 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from South  Carolina for yielding. He is welcome in the beautiful rice country of  Arkansas to hunt ducks this fall at any time. I appreciate his  leadership of the Sportsmen's Caucus, the largest bipartisan caucus we  have here in the House, and all of the good work it does in wildlife  conservation and conservation of our public lands, so I thank my friend  for that.   It is true, I appreciate also his work in the House Energy Action  Team and that of our whip,   Steve Scalise of Louisiana. And that is  because we all are talking tonight about the importance of energy to  our economy, the importance of energy to our families, and how that has  to be balanced in the world of public policy.   Madam Speaker, in 2018, crude oil was the world's number one export  product. Last year, the U.S. accounted for 98 percent of global growth  in oil production. Since the Congress lifted the 40-year ban on oil  exports in 2015, U.S. production continues to set records, and, just  last month set a new all-time high of exporting 3.3 million barrels of  crude per day.   Lifting the ban has filled pipelines and sparked a surge of  investment across this land in new shipping infrastructure around the  U.S.   Total crude imports have also dropped significantly as we rely now  more on domestic production and that production produced by our friends  in Canada. Likewise, exporting clean natural gas is a leading export of  the United States.   South Korea is now the largest buyer of American clean natural gas,  Madam  [[Page H7234]]  Speaker. That is cleaning up their skies, lowering their carbon  emissions, and cutting their trade imbalance with the United States.   Exporting more gas, exporting more oil, and lifting the ban has  allowed us to be an energy leader in the world. We are no longer second  fiddle to the Gulf, to Saudi Arabia, or to Russia. This comes as the  United States is leading the world also, Madam Speaker, in reducing  global climate or carbon emissions. Between 2000 and 2014, the United  States reduced emissions more than 18 percent.   On the contrary, the world's largest carbon emitters, like China and  India, continue to have no policy to reduce their emissions, despite  having the lowest marginal cost to do that. In the EU and the United  States, it is very expensive for us to lower carbon emissions per unit.  But, when you are a major carbon polluter, such as India and China, the  marginal cost to clean up their action is so much cheaper.   Instead, China is building 300 new coal plants, and not a single  country in the EU is on target to meet their carbon reduction goals.  These countries must do more to be competitive with us on the efforts  we are taking here in the U.S.   Like my friends from Georgia and South Carolina, I am a strong  supporter of nuclear energy because it is the cleanest, most green form  of base power generation. In Arkansas, we get about 19 percent of our  electricity generated from nuclear.   And I support the idea of better and more effective ways to store  nuclear waste, which we have talked about and tried to pass in this  House. Any discussion of eliminating carbon emissions must include  nuclear energy.   We also must invest in longer battery life technologies and lowering  barriers towards solar cell innovation. The future of clean energy  rests with harnessing the power of the Sun and being able to store that  power cheaply and portably. No one, Madam Speaker, is doing more  research on that than the United States. We are spending over $550  million a year on advanced energy research to make our country even  more energy competitive.    So, I believe, like many of my colleagues, we need to pursue an all- of-the-above energy strategy that will lead us to a cleaner, less  carbon-dependent world without forcing American families and Arkansas  families to bear the burden of flawed policies like the Green New Deal  or the Paris climate accord.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from South Carolina for this time,  for his leadership, and I look forward to working with him on these  issues in the years to come.    Madam Speaker, today I rise to reflect on the  recent acts of Speaker Pelosi and other Members of the majority last  week on the House floor, it was a clear and egregious violation of the  rules of the House that transpired.   House Members are expected to speak respectfully of their fellow  Members of Congress and of the President of the United States, a  precedent that goes back to the very first Congress about conduct on  the floor of the House.   Citing Jefferson's Manual, the first American book on parliamentary  procedure, ``References to racial or other discrimination on the part  of the President are not in order.''   Last week, Speaker Pelosi clearly violated Chapter 29, Section 65.6  of Jefferson's Manual. The House parliamentarian ruled her speech  violated the rules forbidding personal attacks on the House floor  against the President.   Sadly, the majority then voted to ignore the rules in order to  justify the Speaker's breaking of our rules.   Madam Speaker, how do we expect the American people to follow the  laws we pass in this Chamber when we don't even follow the rules that  we place on ourselves?   I call on the majority to put partisanship and pointless attacks  aside and get back to the real work that will move our great country  forward.                               Crisis in Syria     Madam Speaker, I rise today to, once again,  speak out about the crisis in Syria.   The director general of the Organization for the Prohibition of  Chemical Weapons recently reported that traces of a nerve agent or  poison gas byproduct were discovered late last year at Syria's  Scientific Studies and Research Center.   Even though we were assured by the Obama administration that the  Russians would remove all the chemical weapons in Syria, this report is  not surprising. For some, photos of dead bodies in the streets littered  with children, victims of barrel bombing, or asphyxiated by sarin gas  just weren't enough.   Now we have a United Nations report. The United Nations reports that,  since May, fighting in Idlib Province has forced 300,000 Syrians to  flee their  [[Page H7235]]  homes and thousands more continue to die from Assad's butchering.   Madam Speaker, when will this House finally grow weary of 8 years of  Assad's treachery: more than 570,000 dead, 200,000 imprisoned, and  nearly 12 million dislocated?   The House must act.   Speaker Pelosi well knows, this House, under Republican leadership,  passed the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act three times over the  past three Congresses, only to have it bogged down in the Senate.                                time  2115    Now, Madam Speaker, the tables are turned. Leader McConnell passed S.  1 in February, and we in the House must finally act with expedition and  pass the House version of S. 1, which is H.R. 336, to end this step  back into darkness, stop the torture and murder of thousands, and move  to convict Assad and his henchmen of war crimes.                             Anti-BDS Resolution     Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about H.  Res. 246, a resolution stating Congress' opposition to the ongoing  efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel in the Global Boycott,  Divestment, and Sanctions Movement, or BDS, targeting Israel.   H. Res. 246 passed this House today. Let me get one thing clear,  though. BDS is anti-Semitic at its core, and it seeks to delegitimize  and isolate our ally Israel.   I am a strong supporter and I cosponsored H. Res. 246, but this is  not the piece of anti-BDS legislation that we should have considered on  the floor of this House this week. We should not be letting the  majority off the hook by passing a nonbinding House resolution. H. Res.  246 does not take tangible action to combat the BDS movement, nor does  it have any teeth in it.   Instead, we should be considering and passing H.R. 336, the  Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act, which is the  House version of S. 1. This legislation, Madam Speaker, passed the  Senate in February by an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of 77-23.   H.R. 336 includes the Combating BDS Act, which allows a State or  local government to divest its assets from entities using BDS against  Israel. This bill includes other important provisions for U.S. and  Israel security assistance.   Why won't Speaker Pelosi bring this overwhelmingly bipartisan bill to  the House floor? Well, the reason they are avoiding this bill in favor  of a toothless resolution is because the majority party in this House  is hopelessly divided on what should be a commonsense issue. Imagine  House Democrats hopelessly divided about anti-Semitism--sad.   Resolutions serve an important purpose in this House, but at other  times, we need legislative action. This is the time for legislative  action. We should be changing the Federal law to no longer allow  entities to use BDS to attack the only democracy and our greatest ally  in the Middle East.                    United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, known as USMCA. I congratulate the  Trump administration for successfully updating the 1994 North American  Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and enhancing the benefits to Arkansans  in the form of expanded export sales and growth in jobs.   USMCA modernizes and rebalances the 25-year-old NAFTA, including a  21st century approach to digital trade, intellectual property rights,  and cross-border data flows.   In Arkansas, trade with Mexico and Canada alone supports over 100,000  jobs, and this highlights the need to preserve and strengthen our North  American trading relationship.   USMCA is a big win across the board. We will have stronger growth,  more exports, more jobs, and rising wages. This agreement results in a  more level playing field for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and  businesses.   Madam Speaker, Canada has approved it. Mexico has passed the enabling  legislation for it and has approved this treaty. Now it is time for  Speaker Pelosi to bring the USMCA to the floor and seek approval of  this House.                        Religious Freedom Ministerial     Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank Secretary  of State Mike Pompeo and Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Freedom Sam  Brownback for hosting the 2019 Ministerial to Advance Religious  Freedom.   This second ministerial on religious freedom makes the protection of  religious freedom around the world a priority for this administration.  This global conclave demonstrates that the United States proudly stands  for religious liberty and tolerance so that everyone from all nations  can worship freely and without discrimination.   I agree with former President Ronald Reagan when he addressed the  United Nations General Assembly in 1986 by saying: ``Respect for human  rights is not social work; it is not merely an act of compassion. It is  the first obligation of government and the source of its legitimacy.''   It is through this obligation of service to our fellow man that we  can make our societies better for our children and all future  generations yet to be born.                        American Taekwondo Association     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  American Taekwondo Association and the roughly 20,000 people who  gathered in Little Rock for the 2019 Worlds ATA Martial Arts  competition just last week.   ATA is celebrating its golden anniversary this year with 50 years of  international training. This organization was founded in 1969 and  relocated to Little Rock in 1977, citing similarities between the  State's landscape and that of South Korea.   My friend, Mrs. Sun Cha Lee, is the chairman of the board for ATA  Martial Arts and is committed to changing lives through martial arts  and her philanthropy.   As a fellow member of the Rotary Club of Little Rock, Mrs. Lee  embodies the motto of ``service above self'' and continues to lead  their scholarship foundation that has provided over $1 million to  deserving students.   Mrs. Lee and ATA's cultural addition to Little Rock's story has made  and indelible impact on Arkansas citizens and communities.   I would like to extend gratitude and congratulations to Mrs. Lee on  reaching this memorable milestone. I wish her and all of ATA much  continued success for generations to come.                            Eagle Bank Anniversary     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Eagle Bank and Trust Company on its 100th anniversary. Eagle Bank has  been serving customers since 1919 and has grown into 13 full-service  bank locations.    Eagle Bank was the vision of Harry Hastings, Jr., who applied for a  bank charter for the First State Bank of Sherwood in 1964, eventually  becoming Eagle Bank and Trust Company in 1988.   In 2012, the bank merged with Heber Springs State Bank, which  received its original bank charter in 1919 and was originally known as  Arkansas National Bank of Heber Springs. The bank survived the Great  Depression and the 2008 recession, never closing its doors on its  customers.   Today, Cathy Hastings Owen, daughter of Harry Hastings, operates  Eagle Bank and Trust Company. In 2018, she became the 128th chairman of  the Arkansas Bankers Association and is the first woman to lead that  important organization.   I would like to extend my congratulations to the Hastings family and  Eagle Bank and Trust Company, and I wish the company much continued  success for generations to come.                Flooding--Prevention, Preparation, and Cleanup     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize three  Faulkner County, Arkansas, Scouting units that helped fill sandbags in  preparation for the historic flooding that occurred in Arkansas just in  the past few weeks.   Pack 444, Troop 444, and Troop 644, all of the First United Methodist  Church in Vilonia, volunteered to help our communities in need. This  group who filled sandbags included children in elementary school and up  to high school-aged teens.   Arkansans began filling sandbags on May 22, and more than 65,000  sandbags have been filled by volunteers from across our State.  Sandbagging helps divert water from peoples' homes and  [[Page H7236]]  was an effective way to prevent and reduce the flood damage from these  historic floods.   I thank the Scouting units of First United Methodist Church and all  of those who volunteered their time to help those affected by this  historic flooding.                         Congratulating Ford Overton     Madam Speaker, today I want to rise and  congratulate and thank my very good friend, Ford Overton, for his  selfless service to the State of Arkansas.   Ford served on the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission for 7 years,  including serving as chairman in his final year. His term just expired  on July 1.   As a graduate of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, his love  for the outdoors has always been evident, especially his interest in  fishing and preservation of habitat.   While on the commission, Ford worked with wildlife biologists and  lawmakers to ensure that future generations of Arkansans will be able  to continue to enjoy the healthy wildlife populations with which we are  so abundantly blessed. He successfully inspired many young Arkansans to  enjoy the great hunting and fishing opportunities all across our State.   Ford's service to the State of Arkansas and to wildlife conservation  will not be forgotten, and I join all Arkansans in congratulating Ford  on his infectious passion and leadership throughout the State.              Recognizing the Heroic Acts of Troy Braswell, Sr.     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  heroic acts of Mr. Troy Braswell, Sr., a World War II veteran, for his  remarkable service to our country.   Troy grew up in Louisiana, and after graduating from high school, he  joined the Navy to serve his country. He was only 17 years old, and his  role was that of a powderman.   During his service, Troy served on the USS Mississippi, survived a  kamikaze attack, and, afterwards, contracting tuberculosis. He was told  by a doctor that he had but 6 months to live.   He overcame and survived these challenges, and after his military  service, Troy located to Arkansas in 1945. In 1952, he graduated from  the University of Central Arkansas, then called Arkansas State Teachers  College. Troy turned 93 years old earlier this year and currently  resides in Hot Springs Village.   Troy's sacrifice for Arkansas and for America will not be forgotten,  and I join all Arkansans in thanking him for his bravery and his  dedication to our State and our country.              Recognizing Victory Mission Bible Training Center     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Victory Mission Bible Training Center's grand opening and ribbon  cutting earlier this month in Center Ridge, Arkansas.   Victory Mission Bible Training Center is an 8- to 10-month  residential discipleship training program catering to those who  struggle with problems such as alcoholism and addiction. It is strictly  donation-based and available to people of all ages who need this  important assistance.   I want to congratulate the resident director, Ms. Jennifer Jones,  herself a graduate of the program. She was homeless and struggled with  alcohol and drug addiction before entering this important program.   Since 1960, over 24,000 people have been treated by Mission Teens  centers, and 89 percent of their graduates report that they are doing  well. Several have gone into the ministry or now help at one of the 20  centers across the United States.   Alcoholism and addiction are powerful diseases, and I am grateful to  the Center Ridge community for the opening of the Victory Mission Bible  Training Center and their worthwhile investment in the health of our  citizens and their community.                                time  2130                        Honoring Dr. Edith Irby Jones     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Edith  Irby Jones, a civil rights leader and the first African American  graduate at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Dr. Jones  recently passed away at the age of 91.   Dr. Jones became a distinguished physician on the national stage and  accomplished many firsts for African Americans and women. She was the  first African American woman to intern in the State of Arkansas, the  first to intern at Baylor College of Medicine Affiliated Hospital, and  the first female president of the National Medical Association.   As a child, Dr. Jones experienced the deaths of her father and sister  and suffered from rheumatic fever that left her temporarily unable to  walk or attend school. Despite her hardships, she went on to become the  first African American female resident at Baylor and was one of the  founders of Mercy Hospital in Houston.   When Dr. Jones wasn't practicing medicine, she was in schools and  churches, advocating for racial equality. She later became an advocate  for underprivileged patients and earned an award for volunteerism and  community service by the American College of Physicians.   She also has been inducted into both the University of Arkansas  College of Medicine Hall of Fame and the inaugural group of women  inducted into the Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame.   I honor Dr. Jones for her determination, dedication, and  contributions to civil rights and enriching the lives of countless  Arkansans and Americans. She was a role model and a friend to many  across our State. I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to her  friends, family, and loved ones.                      Congratulating Anne Marie Doramus     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Anne Marie Doramus on her recent appointment to the Arkansas Game and  Fish Commission, becoming the first woman so appointed as a full-term  commissioner.   A graduate of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, her  interest in the outdoors has always been evident, especially duck  hunting and bass fishing in southeast Arkansas. She is a founding  member of the Arkansas Outdoor Society, a group of young adults  passionate about conservation and the outdoors.   Commissioner Doramus, with leadership and passion for conservation,  will be a great asset to the commission over the next 7 years. She  embodies the talent of the next generation of leaders who will be  protecting and promoting our great outdoors.   I join all Arkansas in congratulating Anne Marie and wish her much  success throughout her term as a commissioner.                       Congratulating Camp Rockefeller     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Arkansas' Camp Rockefeller for being recognized, once again, as a  nationally accredited camp by the Boy Scouts of America National Camp  Accreditation Program.   BSA's National Camp Accreditation Program recognizes camps that  provide a fun, high-quality, and safe program consistent with the Boy  Scouts of America brand and what the public expects from scouting.   Camp Rockefeller successfully completed a review of over 200  standards related to the safety and quality of the program, including  campgrounds, properties, and the well-being of every camper, leader,  and visitor. Over the years, Camp Rockefeller has shown continuous  improvement in all areas.   Camp Rockefeller is located within Gus Blass Scout Reservation. Each  year, thousands of scouts from across the country enjoy this beautiful  part of Arkansas and are given the opportunity to participate in  hiking, fishing, climbing, camping, and other outdoor activities.   As a fellow scout, I am proud of these high standards that are being  set at Camp Rockefeller. On behalf of all Arkansans, congratulations,  and we look forward to following your continued success in the years to  come.                  Congratulating Conway for Recycling Award     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Conway Department of Sanitation in the city of Conway, Arkansas, on  being named the 2019 Recycling Education Program of the Year by the  Arkansas Recycling Coalition. This award honors an agency or  association that has made a significant contribution to the advancement  of waste reduction, recycling, and sustainability across our State in  the past year.  [[Page H7237]]    Conway was selected for this award as a result of its outstanding  public education and community outreach effort. This involved talking  with more than 2,700 community members of all ages from schools,  daycares, churches, homeowner associations, universities, and more.   Recycling is a component of making the environment a cleaner place,  conserving materials, saving energy, and reducing the size of our  landfills.   I extend my congratulations to the Conway Department of Sanitation  and the entire city of Conway for its worthwhile commitment to our  environment and our natural resources.      Congratulating Fairfield Bay on Top 100 Planned Communities Honor     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Fairfield Bay, Arkansas, on being named the Best of the Best Top 100  Planned Communities in America by ideal-LIVING Magazine. The Best of  the Best honors those areas and communities that deserve special  recognition for their outstanding qualities, facilities, and programs.   Fairfield Bay began as a planned community 40 years ago and has grown  into an ideal family recreation destination. It was chosen from  hundreds of nominations from North America and Central America.   A huge congratulations to the community, to the residents of  Fairfield Bay, and to Mayor Wellenberger on achieving this recognition.  I look forward to following the Fairfield Bay community as it continues  to grow in the years to come.                       Recognizing Journalism Awardees     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize two  central Arkansas journalists who received the Golden 50 Service Awards  from the Arkansas Press Association for a half-century in journalism.   Larry Miller, from Morrilton, Arkansas, is the editor of the Conway  County Petit Jean Country Headlight newspaper.   Frank Fellone of Little Rock was also recognized and is a former  Arkansas Democrat-Gazette deputy editor and now an independent  journalist.   I also congratulate David Bailey, managing editor of the Arkansas  Democrat-Gazette, on receiving the Arkansas Press Association Freedom  of Information Award.   I congratulate these men who exemplify the spirit and dedication  behind the mission of these awards and our First Amendment, and I wish  them continued success in the years to come.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 35 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, July 24, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
