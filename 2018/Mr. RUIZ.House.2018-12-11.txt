 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the communities  affected by the Cranston fire, one of the largest wildfires my  congressional district and eastern Riverside County has ever seen.   While the Cranston fire was contained in August, many of my  constituents are continuing to piece their lives back together, and  anytime severe rain is forecasted, they once again go into high alert  for mudslides from the burn scar.   The Cranston fire started on July 25, 2018, and within a matter of a  few hours residents of Idyllwild and the mountain communities were  immediately forced to evacuate from their homes. Without hesitation,  first responders from the Idyllwild Fire Department, the Idyllwild  Volunteer Fire Company, CAL FIRE, the California Highway Patrol, the  U.S. Forest Service, and countless others from all over the Nation  sprang into action.   Thanks to their efforts, no lives were lost and the fire was fully  contained by August 10, having burned more than  [[Page H10035]]  13,000 acres. Months later, I am left with the image of police officers  walking through smoldering neighborhoods with megaphones, making sure  no one was left behind.   Today, Idyllwild continues to embody that spirit of community and  togetherness. They are rebuilding homes, clearing debris, and preparing  for the next wildfire that threatens our communities. Friends and  neighbors continue to support one another, and I continue to be  inspired by their compassion and determination.   Throughout this rebuilding, our communities have expressed something  profound: gratitude. Rarely have I seen such an outpouring of support  for our first responders.   I have seen fences papered with handwritten signs thanking the  firefighters and countless tributes to their courage and sacrifice at  local festivals and benefits.   The affected communities could not have made it this far without the  support of religious groups, nonprofits, local businesses, and generous  neighbors. During the fire, volunteers with the American Red Cross and  the FIND Food Bank delivered food to evacuation centers. So did local  restaurants, including Idyllwild Bake Shop & Brew, Cafe Aroma, Coyote  Red's, the Mile High Cafe, and many others.   The Ace Hotel, V Palm Springs Hotel, and Grand Idyllwild Lodge were  just a few of the businesses that generously opened their doors to  displaced residents.   That generosity extended to our four-legged friends, too. I visited  the San Jacinto Valley Animal Campus, where staff provided shelter for  more than 160 local pets.   Their legacy of compassion lives on through community organizations  like Young Idyllwild, who hosted a music festival and benefit to raise  money for neighbors still struggling to piece their lives together.   I was particularly moved by the generosity of local musician Ernesto  Ale and his family, who lost their home in the fire. In the midst of  this hardship, Ernesto found the strength to perform, bringing music to  his community and raising money for neighbors who, like him, lost so  much in the fire.   Ernesto is proof of the kindness and strength exhibited by every  neighbor, firefighter, police officer, and business owner who pitched  in after the Cranston fire.   Government should follow the example of communities it serves,  pulling together in times of crisis and lending a hand to those in  need.                            ____________________
