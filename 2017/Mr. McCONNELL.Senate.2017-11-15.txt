 Mr. President, the need for tax reform has been  obvious for a long time now. Many Republicans have said it. Many  Democrats have said it. We certainly hope Democrats will continue to  stand by their strong statements in support of tax reform today,  because while the occupant of the Oval Office may have changed, the  need for tax reform certainly hasn't.   Indeed, after many long years of an Obama economy that so often  failed the middle class, its effects continue to be felt across the  country for many: for single parents who still struggle to make ends  meet; for moms and dads who still struggle to find a way to send their  kids to college, make a car payment, or save for retirement; and for  small business owners who still find themselves frustrated when they  try to hire more employees, reinvest in their business or pursue their  dreams.   There are many obstacles to tackle--an out-of-control regulatory  state, for one. We have taken significant action to tame that already,  and we will continue to do so.   Another huge factor is our seriously outdated Tax Code. Filled with  complicated schedules, worksheets, deductions, and loopholes, the code  is easy for the wealthy and well-connected to game and almost  impossible for almost anyone else to understand. If you are wealthy,  you hire accountants and lawyers to navigate a complicated process. But  the young, small business owner starting out can't afford a team to do  her taxes and bring on a new employee or raise wages.   Moreover, the Tax Code actively punishes those small businesses and  the middle class with rates that are too high, provisions that are  clearly outdated, and incentives that are just plain ridiculous--like  the fact that it actually encourages the shipping of American jobs and  businesses overseas. Our Tax Code actually encourages that. That is why  this Congress, in conjunction with the White House, is working hard to  pass tax reform.   Today the Senate Finance Committee will continue to examine its tax  reform proposal under Chairman Hatch's leadership. Members are  continuing to discuss the best path forward to deliver relief to the  men and women we represent. This week's hearings are just the latest in  a years-long process to write a tax code that supports the middle  class. In fact, since Chairman Hatch has been the top Republican on the  Finance Committee, it has hosted 70 hearings in the last 6 years. Each  one of those hearings considered how to improve the Tax Code to make it  work better for all Americans.   The committee has made numerous serious efforts to engage across the  aisle to get this done. Members on both sides agree that a pro-growth  tax plan will move our economy forward, help create more jobs, and help  families keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, or at least our  Democratic friends used to, seemingly, until President Trump came  along.   The plan before the committee fulfills important goals that all of us  [[Page S7226]]  should share. It aims to make taxes for families lower, simpler, and  fairer. According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation and  recent news reports, the ``Middle Class [are the] biggest winners in  [the] Senate tax plan.''   It also aims to make it easier for small businesses to grow, invest,  and hire. For Kentucky's small businesses and for those across the  country, this proposal will help to do just that by creating incentives  to bring investment and jobs home and keep them here.   The plan before the Finance Committee fulfills our main goal for tax  reform, which is taking more money out of Washington's pockets and  putting more money into the pockets of the middle class.   Last evening, the committee released a modified chairman's mark that,  among other important elements, will effectively repeal ObamaCare's  individual mandate tax so we can provide even more tax relief to low-  and middle-income families. In short, the goal is to repeal an  unpopular tax from an unworkable law in order to provide more tax  relief to middle-class families.   Now, as the committee continues its legislative markup through an  open process, it will explore further ways to improve this good  legislation. Both Republicans and Democrats have offered hundreds of  amendments. Chairman Hatch is setting aside full days for the committee  to consider them. Once the Finance Committee completes its work and  reports its proposal to the Senate floor, all Members will have the  chance to offer their amendments under the regular order.   Another Senate committee is having an important markup today as well.  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is beginning its  consideration of an important proposal to support good jobs, our energy  future, and our national security.   So, once again, I commend Chairman Murkowski and the members of the  committee for their work on this proposal to further develop Alaska's  oil and natural gas potential in an environmentally responsible way-- more American jobs, more American energy, and more energy security and  independence. I look forward to the Energy Committee reporting its  legislation today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday the Senate continued its  efforts to confirm the President's talented nominees to staff the  Federal Government.   We advanced the nomination of David Zatezalo to serve as the  Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, an important  position to the thousands of miners in States like Kentucky. I look  forward to confirming his nomination early this afternoon, along with  that of Mark Esper, who will be confirmed to another important  position, Secretary of the Army.   Also, we will turn to Joseph Otting, President Trump's nominee to  serve as Comptroller of the Currency. This position is crucial to  protecting our national banking system, and Mr. Otting has the  experience necessary to excel there.   Then, the Senate will continue our efforts to ensure that our  Nation's judiciary fulfills its proper role in our democracy by  confirming two more talented nominees to serve as Federal district  court judges. President Trump has continued to nominate individuals who  will interpret the law as it is actually written, not as they wish it  were.   Donald Coggins has been nominated to serve as district court judge  for the District of South Carolina. He has been in private practice in  South Carolina for over three decades. The Senate Judiciary Committee  reported his nomination by a voice vote. He is a talented nominee, and  I look forward to confirming him soon.   Then the Senate will consider the nomination of Dabney Friedrich to  serve as district court judge for the District of Columbia. Ms.  Friedrich has a wealth of experience, having been in private practice  and having served as assistant U.S. attorney in both the Eastern  District of Virginia and the Southern District of California, and she  has been confirmed twice by the Senate as a Commissioner of the U.S.  Sentencing Commission. The Judiciary Committee also reported her  nomination by a voice vote. These nominees will respect the rule of law  on the Federal bench, and they should be confirmed without delay.   I would like to again thank Chairman Grassley for his commitment to  bringing the President's impressive judicial nominees to the floor.  These are both respected nominees who have the support of Members on  both sides of the aisle, and I hope we can consider their nominations  without any partisan procedural hurdles. We should confirm them soon.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, that at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, November 16,  there be 30 minutes of postcloture time remaining on the Otting  nomination, equally divided between the leaders or their designees, and  that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote  on the confirmation of the Otting nomination; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. I further ask  consent that following disposition of the Otting nomination, the Senate  vote on the pending cloture motions on the Coggins and Friedrich  nominations in the order filed, and that if cloture is invoked, the  postcloture time on the nominations run consecutively.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations:  Executive Calendar Nos. 486 and 487.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate;  that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that  any statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate an  institution in Spencer County marking 150 years of community journalism  in Kentucky, the Spencer Magnet. Since the weekly newspaper began  operations in 1867, it has covered celebrations, tragedies, wars,  elections, and so much more. Today the Spencer Magnet is the oldest  continuously operated business in Spencer County and reaches more than  4,000 homes each week.   Over the years, the paper has operated under different names with  different owners. In 1925, the paper came under the ownership of Katie  Beauchamp, and she changed its name from the Spencer Courier to its  current title. She justified the new name because it matched her  mission for the paper, to serve as a means to draw the people of  Spencer County together.   For 150 years, the paper has done just that. The publication covered  national and international news, but the Spencer Magnet's focus on  community journalism has endeared it to many of my constituents in the  area.   As the Spencer County community looks back on its history, it  recognizes great successes and painful challenges, but the journalism  from this newspaper has been a constant presence in community through  it all. To properly mark its sesquicentennial anniversary, the Spencer  Magnet is rededicating itself to its mission to draw the community  together.   The population of Spencer County continues to grow and change. Now,  many residents work in Louisville and then come home to the rural  Spencer County to escape the city. Whatever the future may bring, the  Spencer Magnet stands ready to deliver the news to its readers.   Kentucky is home to many community newspapers, which have their  finger on the pulse of their readers. Organizations like the Spencer  Magnet are incredibly important for chronicling our past and for  shaping the news of tomorrow. I am proud to help the Spencer Magnet  celebrate this anniversary. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  congratulating the Spencer Magnet on many years of reporting.   Mr. President, earlier this year, the Spencer Magnet published an  article reflecting on its years of community reporting. I ask unanimous  consent that excerpts of the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Spencer Magnet, March 29, 2017]                  Marking 150 Years of the Spencer Magnet                           (By John Shindlebower)         This community has been through a lot over the past 150       years. We picked ourselves up after a devastating Civil War       that was especially brutal on a border state like Kentucky.       We survived economic hardships including a great depression       and a great recession and we saw our young men die in far off  [[Page S7256]]       lands in two world wars and other conflicts across the globe.        Through it all, the Spencer Magnet kept the community       informed.        This community has survived droughts, blizzards, floods and       tornadoes. We've even felt the earth shake a time or two.        We've endured divisive and bitter elections, political       scandals both small and large and we've had families       devastated by violent crime and tragic accidents. The Spencer       Magnet was here to report that news.        There have been grand times as well. New businesses have       started and flourished and the progress that changed so much       of American life did not bypass Spencer County. We've seen       the stage coach give way to the railroad and the railroad       give way to the automobile. Modern day luxuries often taken       for granted, such as running water, electric lights, radio       and television were greeted with fanfare when they made their       initial appearance in our community. The Spencer Magnet was       here to chronicle those changes and the ones that have       followed. Students worked their way through school and       annually marched to receive their diploma.        Local citizens have accomplished monumental achievements       and various churches and organizations have worked tirelessly       to serve the community, their neighbors and their fellow man.       The Spencer Magnet has been here to help the good.        Today, Spencer County continues to grow. Many families from       Louisville, seeking a slower pace of life and a rural       atmosphere, have chosen to make this their home. Many of       these new families simply lay their heads here at night as       they continue to work, shop and socialize in Louisville. But       increasingly, more and more of the newer residents are       becoming active in this community that they now proudly call       home.        The Spencer Magnet understands the role we play in this       pivotal era of Spencer County's history. Perhaps more than       ever before, this newspaper is practicing community       journalism by covering more meetings where decisions that       impact you and this community are made. More and more Spencer       Countians are expressing an interest in being involved       citizens, and it is our role as a newspaper to help those       same people be informed citizens.        Over this latest chapter of our history, the Magnet has       been honored on numerous occasions by the Kentucky Press       Association for our efforts to publish an informative,       quality newspaper that serves our residents. But more       important than awards, is the feedback we get from our       readers. There's nothing we like hearing better than the       words ``We read it in the Magnet.''        The Spencer Magnet is now 150 years old. We're the oldest       continuously operated business in Spencer County. We're proud       of that distinction, but we also do not take it for granted.       That longevity had to be earned by gaining the trust and       respect of readers like you. We don't take that lightly and       we will continue to strive to earn that trust each and every       week as we begin our next 150 years.        The next century and a half will surely be filled with a       mixture of tragedy and triumph. There will be achievements       and there will be failures. We will write stories about great       accomplishments, and we'll most certainly have to report on       heartbreak as well. But that's the nature of the newspaper.       It's what William T. Burton set out to accomplish in 1867,       and it's what we hope those who follow us will continue to do       decades from now.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 258, S. 807.
