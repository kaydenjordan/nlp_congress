 Mr. President, like many of our colleagues during the  Fourth of July break, I spent much of my time crisscrossing the State  of Maryland. On the Fourth of July, I attended many parades. The very  first parade of that day was in a part of Maryland outside of Baltimore  City, called Dundalk, MD, where Donald Trump had done very well in the  past election.   What I found during that parade was a lot of people there who were  still supportive of President Trump but not one person at that parade  who was in favor of TrumpCare or the Senate Republican so-called  healthcare bill--not one.   I was listening to the Senator from Vermont about the most recent  polling. The polling I had seen previously had shown 17 percent of the  American people in favor of this, which was very low. I am not  surprised to hear it is even lower now at 12 percent because my own  personal experience in these places in Maryland that had been  supportive of Donald Trump, and in many ways still are, were that they  were not in favor of this healthcare bill. In many ways, they had felt  betrayed by it.   After all, during the last campaign, Donald Trump said he wasn't  going to cut Medicaid, and yet the bill before us has dramatic cuts to  Medicaid. In fact, the Senate bill has even deeper cuts to Medicaid  over time than the House bill.   We all remember the House bill. President Trump had a great  celebration in the Rose Garden in public, but behind closed doors he  called it mean. Yet the Senate bill, when it comes to Medicaid cuts,  will make them even deeper over a period of time, according to the  report issued by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office, just as we all left town for the Fourth of  July break.   It was an interesting experience to hear people, on the one hand,  saying let's find ways to work together on many of the challenges we  have in this country--and we should find ways to work together--but are  strongly opposed to the healthcare bill that is before the Senate right  now. The reason is, they are paying attention. They are concluding  about this bill the same thing that the AMA, the American Medical  Association, has concluded. In opposing this bill, America's doctors  say it violates the No. 1 principle of medicine, which is: First, do no  harm. That is the Hippocratic Oath. This Senate so-called healthcare  violates that very simple proposition. At the very least, we want a  healthcare system that doesn't do greater harm than what would  otherwise be flawless. Yet we know, from this legislation, in looking  at it, that it does do great harm to our healthcare system in the  United States of America.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has looked at it and  concluded that if you pass this legislation, 22 million fewer Americans  will have access to affordable care than if you don't pass the bill. So  it does harm compared to where we are today.   It is absolutely true that the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. In  fact, the healthcare exchanges specifically can be improved. We need  more choices. We need more competition there. Make no mistake, the  Senate Republican bill and the bill that passed the House don't improve  the Affordable Care Act. They destroy those parts of it that are  working and have been of great benefit to tens of millions of  Americans.   The Congressional Budget Office also tells us that premiums will go  up next year. The Congressional Budget Office also tells us that if you  are a senior between the ages of 50 and 64, you are in for a walloping  increase in your premiums, which of course is what the AARP calls the  age tax and why they are on the warpath against this legislation-- because it will be greatly damaging to those seniors who are in the  individual market who are now going to have to pay huge increases in  premiums. Those have been documented by the nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office.   I would remind my colleagues that the head of the Congressional  Budget Office was someone selected by the Republican chairman of the  Senate Budget Committee and the Republican chairman of the House Budget  Committee, and the CBO is our referee in this place.   If we all could make up our own facts, which in many cases the  debates go in those directions anyway, it would be an even more unruly  place. At least we have the CBO to provide that analysis. It is not  just the CBO. This is masquerading as a healthcare bill.   I ask the question of my colleagues, Why is it that every single  patient advocacy group that has weighed in on this bill has weighed in  against this bill? These are not Democratic organizations or Republican  organizations:  [[Page S3930]]  the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the  American Diabetes Association, the National Association on Mental  Illness, National Breast Cancer Coalition, the National Multiple  Sclerosis Society, the Alzheimer's Association. These are our  constituents.   They don't wake up every morning thinking about a Democratic plan or  Republican plan or Independent plan. These are organizations dedicated  to patient health. They are all against a bill that is parading as a  healthcare bill.   How can that be the case, that every single advocacy group that has  weighed in on this bill that has a healthcare mandate and is  nonpartisan is against it?   I ask my Republican colleagues to go back to the drawing board. This  is not a healthcare bill, not when every single patient advocacy group  weighed in against it, not when nonpartisan analysis tells us that 22  million people will lose out, not when the American Medical Association  says it violates this simple principle of, first, do not harm.   It is not just the doctors. It is the nurses. It is the hospitals. It  is the National Rural Health Association. I spent a good amount of time  in rural Maryland over the Fourth of July break. Rural hospitals are  terrified of the consequences of this legislation, not just because of  the harm that will befall their patients because their patients will be  denied access to affordable care--but when they no longer have patients  who are covered by insurance who come through their doors and there is  an emergency so they provide that care anyway, then the hospital all of  a sudden is not getting paid for the care it provides. They are deathly  afraid they are going to have to scale back their operations and lay  off people in a lot of these rural hospitals.   I really hope and believe this is a moment where the Senate can look  at this situation and decide let's not go down this road because the  American people are asking themselves why are we doing this. It is one  of those cases where I think people sort of lost track of why, other  than the fact that, as many have said today, there had been this call  to get rid of ObamaCare, to get rid of the Affordable Care Act but  never a lot of thought as to what was going to replace it.   Now what we are learning is the proposals that would supposedly  replace it will do harm. They will do a lot more harm than the place we  are at today. Rather than do harm and hurt tens of millions of  Americans, let's find a way to improve the current system. There are  practical ideas for how we can improve the healthcare exchanges, the  marketplaces within the Affordable Care Act. Many of us have put  forward ideas, and I would be more than happy to explore with our  colleagues ways we can improve upon those exchanges without doing harm.   When you look at this legislation and you realize it is not about  healthcare, you have to ask yourself: What is it about other than  simply saying we are going to fulfill this pledge of getting rid of the  Affordable Care Act? At its core, there are two pillars to this bill.  They are rotten pillars, but that is what they are. One is these very  dramatic cuts to Medicaid, very dramatic. As I said, the Senate cuts  even deeper over a longer period of time than the House bill. In the  Senate bill, that cut is around $770 billion, and then there are also  cuts to tax credits that help more Americans afford healthcare. So if  you cut Medicaid, you get rid of tax credits that make healthcare more  affordable. On the other side of the ledger is this whopping tax cut--  whopping tax cut that goes to some very powerful special interests and  some very wealthy individuals. Many of us heard Warren Buffett a couple  of weeks ago on TV saying: I don't need a $670,000-a-year tax cut as  part of a bill that is going to put the health of my fellow Americans  at risk.    I think a lot of people are asking the question: If this is a  healthcare bill, why is the core of it this huge cut to Medicaid and a  huge tax break for the wealthiest Americans? And by the way, if you  make $1 million a year, you get a $57,000-a-year, on average, tax break  in this so-called healthcare bill.   So let's put aside a bill that is rotten to its core. I heard a lot  of talk about trying to fix this. I would just warn my colleagues to  make sure our constituents know that cosmetic changes aren't going to  fix this. You can't put a little deodorant on this and make it come out  smelling great. It is just not going to happen. But if people are  genuinely interested in finding ways to improve the exchanges, I am all  in. We certainly should work together to reduce the cost of  prescription drugs, and there are lots of proposals out there to do it.  The President at one time even talked about making that a priority, but  that seems to have fallen away. We all know there are ways we can  smartly save money in our healthcare system by continuing to move away  from a system that is based simply on the quantity of care and the  volume of care and move toward one that rewards the value and quality  of care. Let's do that.   The final thing I want to point out is that I was in Southern  Maryland over the break, down in a place called St. Mary's County. I  visited one of the substance abuse treatment centers called Beacon of  Hope Recovery Center. These are people of great faith coming together  to help people who are victims of the opioid epidemic, which has had a  devastating impact on Maryland, as it has on so much of the rest of the  country. We talked about some of the former patients who were there,  people who are now actually part of the operation to help save the  lives of other people who are racked with addiction. We met with these  dedicated staff members, former patients, and with local law  enforcement all around a table, recognizing that if we are really going  to conquer the opioid epidemic, we need to provide treatment services.  This recovery center was pleading with all of us--with me, asking me to  plead with all of our colleagues to not cut Medicaid because they are  going to be relying on continuing Medicaid funding in order to provide  those treatment services.   I think people around the country are just beginning to learn that  Medicaid has been helpful and will become even more helpful in the  fight against the opioid epidemic; that it is helping our kids with  disabilities and special education in our schools; that it helps low- income working families who may work for an employer who doesn't  provide health insurance and who still pays so low that they are at an  income level where they qualify for Medicaid. People are also learning  that most of the money spent in Medicaid goes to individuals in nursing  homes and people with long-term disabilities, people who need long-term  care. That is where most of the money goes. And 2 out of 3 dollars  spent on nursing home care in the United States are Medicaid dollars.   So we are all in this together. Those deep cuts to Medicaid are going  to have a devastating impact, as will the other changes that are going  to make health insurance premiums go up for so many people, especially  for seniors. And the provisions are going to harm those with  preexisting conditions in various ways.   I will end with one of many stories that I have gotten, personal  testimonies I received from constituents throughout the State of  Maryland.   This one is from Sarah from Arnold, MD, who says:         Without the Affordable Care Act, my family would not have       affordable, reliable health insurance. When my 3-year-old was       2 months old, he had emergency brain surgery for a benign       cyst. Because of this, and even though he does not have any       lingering effects or medical needs as a result of this       surgery, we were denied coverage for him before the ACA.    That, of course, is because before the ACA, people could be denied  coverage because of a preexisting condition. At the age of 2 months, he  had the cyst. He was forever marked as someone with a preexisting  condition and therefore could not get affordable coverage.   They wrote:         We were denied coverage before the ACA. In 2014, my husband       opened up his own family law practice. Because of this       decision, we were on our own for health insurance.    So they bought into the exchange.         And we are now in our second year of excellent coverage       thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Having a fixed monthly       payment with the options and privileges equal to those who       work for big companies has been immensely helpful. The       Affordable Care Act has worked for me and my family.    Mr. President, my point is not that the Affordable Care Act is  perfect. There are improvements that can be  [[Page S3931]]  made. We should work together to make improvements, but let's not do  something that violates what the doctors call the Hippocratic Oath.  Let's not do something that does more harm in our system. Let's not do  something that will result in 22 million fewer of our fellow Americans  having access. Let's do something good together that actually builds on  what we have, fixes what is broken, because we can make improvements in  the Affordable Care Act, not by doing a U-turn and going backward but  by looking forward.   Mr. President, I really hope that we will do that together.   Thank you.                            ____________________
