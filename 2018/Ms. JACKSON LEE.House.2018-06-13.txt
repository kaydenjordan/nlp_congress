 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, sex toys with children is disgusting, and I believe it  is something that one would want simply to say pass a bill to cease and  desist.   But I would like to discuss H.R. 4655, the Curbing Realistic  Exploitative Electronic Pedophilic Robots Act of 2017, also known as  the CREEPER Act of 2017.   There is no doubt that we oppose what this bill is intending to do.  The bill seeks to prohibit the importation and transportation of child  sex dolls.   There is no doubt that child sexual exploitation is a serious, grave  problem in our country. It is a growing and ever-evolving problem that  requires a multifaceted response, and one might argue that the creation  of these dolls, besides being exploitation of our most precious  resource, is just to make money. That is absolutely both disgraceful  and absurd.   Combating child sexual exploitation requires aggressive action by the  Congress of the United States, and we must remain always vigilant to  stamp out any new methods in technology developed and used by child  predators to harm our children.   Just yesterday, the Department of Justice announced that, in a  coordinated effort spanning all 50 States during March, April, and May,  2,300 suspected child sex offenders were arrested. In my own hometown  of Houston in 2016, 126 people were arrested as online predators as  part of a coordinated effort to tackle the problem of child  exploitation; and last year, 13 were arrested.   We must protect our children everywhere from any and all bad actors  who want to do them harm. I am concerned, however, that the majority  has not given us sufficient time to properly consider this bill, its  basis for making a correlation between the possession of obscene dolls  and possession of child pornography, and its relation to child abuse.  Those are important points, and I know that this bill has great  intentions. We might have made it even greater.   We also did not have the opportunity to assess whether this bill  would implicate a reporting statute for sex offenders or to identify  any other problems and perhaps an opportunity to offer ways to improve  this bill to ensure we are, in fact, protecting all of our children.  Mr. Speaker, I look forward, however, to hearing further in the  discussion of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to close.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for his explanation of the  CREEPER bill. As I stated, it is disgusting, but, more importantly, it  harms our children.   What we want to do in this Congress is to ensure that not only do we  register our concern for the fairness of the criminal justice system,  the criminal code, but that we provide the greatest protection we can  ever provide for our children.   So the idea of sex toys and the utilization of child sex toys is what  I want to be clear, and the importation and transportation is a  dastardly act. I hope as this bill makes its way through the Congress  that we will be assured that it frames itself to go after those who are  the most vile and vicious as it relates to the child sex toys and in  keeping with the confines and the parameters of a just criminal code.   Might I also just say that I just feel compelled, as the gentleman I  know has worked on many issues, to remind this House that we have a  crisis at the border. It is very important as we relate to children and  children being taken away from families--mothers--that we also turn our  attention to protecting those children.   So with that point, I want to indicate my support for effective  measures to protect our children. I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is, again, a topic that is impacting so many  Americans. I recall the CARA Act that the Judiciary Committee passed  out some 2 years ago, a miraculous piece of legislation because we did  not criminalize, we sought to help those who have been badly addicted  to drugs.   I rise in support of H.R. 6029, the REGROUP Act. This bill increases  the funding authorized for the Department of Justice's Comprehensive  Opioid Abuse Grant Program from $103 million per year to $330 million  per year through the fiscal year 2023.   The opioid crisis is a national emergency, and we should certainly  expend the resources to prevent opioid abuse and treat those who have  become addicted. We have found that the overcriminalization of these  persons who are addicted has not served us well. They have generated a  whole population of persons who have been labeled under the topic, but  realistically it is impacting their lives: mass incarceration.   In the United States, drug overdoses are the leading cause of  accidental death, with opioids being involved in nearly two-thirds of  overdose deaths. Overall, the number of drug overdose deaths has nearly  quadrupled over the past 20 years. Although effective for the treatment  of pain, prescription opioids are highly addictive, and nearly half of  all U.S. opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid.  [[Page H5122]]    Many Members understand that this became part of the wave of new  treatment that medical school students and doctors were told and  instructed, that a patient should not have to suffer pain. It had good  intentions. But through that process of medical treatment became a  population of extended addicted persons who began to use a prescription  drug as a drug of use and recreation, and then those who were given it  in the medical sense who were able to get it over and over again on the  basis of pain became addicted.   Overall, the number of drug overdose deaths has nearly quadrupled, as  I said, and this has been thought of as an effective treatment for  pain. Prescription opioids are highly addictive, and nearly half of all  U.S. opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid, as I have  said.   Deaths related to heroin have similarly increased as individuals  often transition from more expensive prescription opioids to cheaper  heroin which has had a rise in its use.   In 2016, Congress adopted this program, as I indicated, the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, as we refer to it.  The Judiciary Committee had a portion of that legislation. CARA was a  well-intentioned initiative to enhance the efforts against opioids  across the range of relevant executive branch agencies, involving the  jurisdiction of several of our committees in the House.   I was pleased that the Judiciary Committee's contribution to this  effort resulted in the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program which  reflects an approach not strictly based on arresting and prosecuting.   At the time, I noted with approval that we were not raising sentences  or expanding mandatory minimums, but instead funding a range of  approaches, including anti-addiction mechanisms such as treatment  alternatives to incarceration, which fell under the Department of  Justice.   Such alternatives incentivized by this program include training for  criminal justice agency personnel on substance abuse disorders, the  implementation of mental health courts, drug courts, and veterans'  treatment courts, assisting parents whose incarceration could result in  children entering the child welfare system, and community-based  substance abuse diversion programs.   It is well-known by Members that if you have one of these courts in  your jurisdiction, they have been powerful. Mental health courts, drug  courts, and veterans' courts have steered a lot of people away from  incarceration. They work well. The judges believe they are  constructive, and we are doing more for people.   In 2015, we learned through a Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security,  and Investigations Subcommittee hearing about the success of a newly  developed Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion, or LEAD, approach that  was spearheaded in cities such as Seattle and Santa Fe.   Through the program we are extending today, hopefully we will make it  easier for other cities to afford to implement diversion programs such  as LEAD.   Other purposes for which these grants may be used include providing  training and resources for first responders in administering opioid  overdose reversal drugs, expanding medication-assisted treatment  programs operated by criminal justice agencies, implementing  prescription drug monitoring programs, preventing opioid abuse by  juveniles, and implementing prescription drug take-back programs, in  addition to investigating the illicit distribution of opioids.   This funding will be an added contribution to these very vital  programs, and I hope that we will be in the business every day of  saving lives and turning around those addicted persons who not only are  hurting themselves, but they are hurting their families.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6029, the REGROUP Act. This  bill increases the funding authorized for the Department of Justice's  Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program from $103 million per year to  $330 million per year through fiscal year 2023.

Deaths related to heroin have similarly increased, as individuals  often transition from more expensive prescription opioids to cheaper  heroin.

More than 80 percent of the defendants sentenced for crack cocaine  offenses were African Americans, despite the fact that more than 66  percent of crack users were either White or Hispanic.   In 2010, we reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder  cocaine from 100 to 1 to 18 to 1, but we did not even make those  changes apply retroactively, and the remaining disparity--and the  remaining mandatory nature of the penalty--remains.   There is more to do, and there is no excuse to allow such injustices  to persist even as Congress attempts to take credit for efforts to  address the opioid crisis.   As former Attorney General Eric Holder said when he instituted his  initiative to address some of the inequities with respect to  prosecuting drug crimes, we need to be ``Smart on Crime.''   We do not need do not need more ``get tough'' rhetoric from President  Trump or Attorney General Sessions about imposing the death penalty for  drug crimes. And we should not be telling prosecutors to ratchet up  criminal charges and penalties for drug offenders. None of that solves  the problem.   Instead of doubling down on failed policies that do nothing more than  proliferate misery, we need real leadership, involving a commitment to  increase resources for alternatives that we know are actually  effective.   And so, while we should support this bill, we should do more to  promote a broader and more just approach for all drugs, and re- instituting policies that reflect the need to be ``Smart on Crime.''   Mr. Speaker, I hope the funding we appropriate in the years to come  will match the increased authorization for funding the Comprehensive  Opioid Abuse Grant Program administered by the Department of Justice.   But we must do more than write checks, we must challenge ourselves to  change our mindset and methodology in the way we address drug abuse  across the range of substances that we have criminalized.   After years of failed policies, we should have learned that we cannot  arrest or incarcerate our way out of any drug crisis, and mass  incarceration--fueled primary by drug-related arrests--has harmed our  communities in many ways.   Therefore, as I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill  today, I also ask that we commit ourselves to extending this  conversation past today so that we can work together to reform our drug  laws, our sentencing  [[Page H5123]]  laws, and broaden our approaches to preventing and addressing drug  abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his leadership and  for his concern for what has been a deadly journey for many Americans.   As I close, I would like to share just a moment of the devastating  impact that this epidemic of drugs has had in many communities.   More than 80 percent of the defendants sentenced for crack cocaine  offenses were African Americans, despite the fact that more than 66  percent of crack cocaine users were either White or Hispanic.   In 2010, we reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder  cocaine from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1. We did not even make those changes  apply retroactively. The remaining disparity and the remaining  mandatory nature of the penalty remains. Therefore, there is much to  do.   This bill will help us a lot, but there is no excuse to continue to  allow people, as is evidenced by the recent pardon by the  administration of an individual who had been incarcerated on a drug  offense, no excuse for us to allow these injustices to persist, even as  we proceed to work on this opioid epidemic.   So I think it is extremely important that, as former Attorney General  Eric Holder said when he instituted his initiative to address some of  the inequities with respect to prosecuting drug crimes, we need to be  smart on crime. Treatment is very important. This legislation raising  the amount of grant money to help with the courts and treatment  elements will be a major aspect to saving lives.   But we do not need to continue to get tough in another arena where we  are speaking about raising penalties, imposing the death penalty for  drug crimes, as the Attorney General has offered. We should not be  telling prosecutors to ratchet up criminal charges and penalties for  drug offenders. None of that solves the problem.   What we are doing today will solve the problem. Instead of doubling  down on failing policies that do not do anything more than proliferate  misery for the incarcerated person who really needs treatment, as well  as the family, we need real leadership involving a commitment to  increase resources for the alternatives we know are actually effective.   I really do believe the veterans courts, for example, are a Godsend  to many of our veterans who come back and truly need help. They are so  grateful for help. They may have gotten addicted while in the service  or because of circumstances after leaving the service, including issues  dealing with their own psychological needs. In any event, we know that  they have served their Nation.   Continuing to support those kinds of alternatives are extremely  important, and we should support this bill so that we can continue  those alternatives, but we need to make sure that we speak against  those approaches that ignore the Smart on Crime. I would ask that we  reinstitute the Smart on Crime, which diminishes the number of people  who get caught up in the system who are just truly addicted from the  terrible plight that they have with drug addiction.   As we work to do more, we must ensure that we look at the crisis as  it relates to mass incarceration. We must also treat all of the  addictions--crack cocaine--as the same, because it spreads throughout  our Nation.   So as we continue this conversation, again, I add my appreciation to  the Congressman from Pennsylvania, the chairman, and Ranking Member  Nadler. As we rise to support this legislation, let us continue to seek  to reform our drug laws, let us reform our sentencing laws, and let us  broaden our approaches to preventing and addressing drug abuse.   I think the experts will tell us that that has been one of the most  effective pathways to get people away from drugs and to get their lives  and the lives of their families restored.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we are on the eve of Father's Day.  Fathers and mothers, their greatest gift, in their minds, are their  children. Their greatest loves are their children. The greatest  willingness to sacrifice their lives are for their children.   Mr. Rodas asked the question: ``Why are you taking him?'' Mr. Rodas,  an immigrant from Honduras, wanted nothing more than a better life for  his wife and three children, and Edison was with him.   In a policy that could be more wicked than evil, this administration,  with no legal grounding, has begun to snatch children away from their  fathers and their mothers.   I know the policy. It was designed some years back for unaccompanied  children. It was not designed for punishment, for taking children from  parents who then do not know where they are and possibly the government  not being able to find them.   Why are we taking him from his father? Why are babies crying in the  night? Because mothers are separated, because they have been snatched  away at the border in my State, the State of Texas.   We should cease and desist, Mr. Speaker. This is Father's Day.   Why are we taking children? The American people need to know, and the  American people need to stand up.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Correa from the great State  of California for taking the time to really allow those of us who are  in pain to express that pain. I know that my colleagues, each one of  them--as we say sometimes in our religious institutions--have come in  their own way.   I come in a series of ways. One, as a years-long member of the  Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee of the House Judiciary  Committee. Being present when we designed a policy for unaccompanied  children to be protected and to get to their rightful guardian and not  go into the hands of sex traffickers. That was, in fact, a stated  policy of the United States for unaccompanied children.   And in many ways it happens. In the last 4 or 5 years I was at the  border when the surge of unaccompanied children came because of the  violence, particularly in Central America. These children came. We knew  they were coming, and we had standup facilities run by nuns and other  religious organizations to take unaccompanied children until a  legitimate legal guardian in the United States could be documented, or  some other legitimate family documented.   When I say, documented, documented that they were able to take the  child and that they were legal to the extent that they were not human  traffickers.   That is what policies we had. There is no policy. There is no  regulation. There is no statute. There is no law. There is no law that  is allowing the personnel at the border, customs--particularly Border  Patrol--to snatch, rip, and tear children away from their family. And  if the distinguished gentleman from California would allow me, I want  this to be a call to action because there is a legal process or  legislative process.   As my previous colleagues have said, many of us are introducing  legislation. This past weekend I stood with Guatemalan citizens, people  of Guatemalan descent, and we know for fact that 1 million people have  been displaced in Guatemala because of the volcano. And I just have to  say, they will be fleeing, many of them.   We also know that people have come because they have suffered  unbelievable, unspeakable gang violence: the decapitating of heads, the  murder of children. One mother saw two sons murdered and she took the  last child, boy child, to try to find refuge.   There are stories like this all over. And so what is happening at the  border is a nonpolicy that is done only for the vileness of punishment.  We will punish these people and they will not come anymore.   As we are on the brink of Father's Day. For those who read the  Scriptures, they know the story of Moses. Sometimes a parent is so  desperate that they will either escape with that child or they will  send that child on. And America has always been a place that has found  a regular order to deal with this crisis. That is not what is  happening, and the American people need to understand.   The courts are overloaded. There are not enough immigration judges.  There are not enough lawyers. They are taking into court 50 and 70  people at a time. There are some people who are not speaking Spanish.  They are speaking an indigenous language, and they do not understand at  all, except they have come with the right that they have--and the legal  term is ``credible fear''--they have come to seek asylum.   And we have for long precedent allowed those who have experienced  domestic violence--the stories are horrific--or those who have been the  victim of gangs to come, and that is not happening now.   So I just want to hold up these pictures that show the anguish of  parents who could be like any one of us. The anguish of the father, Mr.  Rodas, whose 5-year-old was snatched from him; the anguish of parents  who desire to do nothing but to help their child or themselves and  these children are being snatched away. It is not any immigration  policy, but a policy to scare, to punish, to frighten, to undermine,  and to do a vileness.   Not because America is not good. We are. But it is important that we  act upon that goodness and that we don't have these series of pictures  where when this mother turns her back, the child is snatched away.   So the call to action is to the vastness of our religious community,  the  [[Page H5148]]  vast television ministry, TBN, The Impact Network, The Word Network,  Hillsong Church, whatever ones you want to call. In this day of  worship, all of these leaders should stand and speak out in the loudest  voice against the unspeakable, nonkindness, ungodly act of snatching  children away from parents.   I will be going down to visit and to see a number of centers, and all  I ask is my Government to be what it is: a loving and nurturing place  of values and democracy, and a recognition that we are a Nation of  immigrants and a Nation of laws.   These people have come to seek asylum. That is a legal process. Some  may win it and some may not. But I would only say to you that who are  we, if we cannot, as a mass of Americans, cry out against this  administration. No matter how much of a cult we think this  administration has been called, there have to be some good people that  will recognize that our values, our flag rises above any person. And it  is important for us to save the lives of these children.   Mr. Correa, let me thank the gentleman so very much for yielding to  me.   Mr. Speaker, Congressman Correa is a valued member of this body and  one of the outstanding member of the Homeland Security Committee, where  he Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management  Efficienty.   We are here today to call upon the President and the Congress of the  United States to act without delay regarding the ``zero-tolerance''  policy that separates families apprehended on the southern border by  U.S. Border Patrol.   As the member of the House Committees on Homeland Security and former  Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Maritime and  Border Security, I cannot think of a situation more devastating than  having the government forcibly separate a parent from her child to a  place unknown, for a fate uncertain, absent any form of communication.   Every day, hundreds of persons, ranging from infants and toddlers to  adolescents and adults, flee violence, oppression, and economic  desperation from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, seeking safe  harbor in the United States.   They are not criminals or terrorists, they are refugees seeking  asylum.   The American government must harness all available resources to aid  those enduring unimaginable suffering, which is why I have called upon  the President to extend Temporary Protected Status for those affected  by this volcano, including introducing broader legislation that makes  Guatemala eligible for TPS.   While they hope to receive asylum, none of us expected that they  would be treated as criminals or that their children would be forcibly  separated from them.   I cannot think of a situation more devastating than having the  government forcibly separate a parent from their child to a place  unknown, for a fate uncertain, absent any form of communication.   But shamefully that is exactly what is happening under this  administration.   Reports indicate that as many as 700 children have been taken from  adults claiming to be their parents since October 2017, including more  than 100 children under the age of 4.   This startling fact comes after Acting Assistant Secretary Steven  Wagner of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  testified before the Senate in April 2018 that during a review of more  than 7,600 unaccompanied immigrant children who had recently arrived  and been placed with a sponsor, officials at the agency were unable to  determine the precise whereabouts of 1,475 children.   This is unconscionable and unacceptable.   This administration's practice of separating children from their  parents inexplicably turns accompanied children into unaccompanied  children, with all of the attendant risks and dangers, including human  trafficking.   In 2014, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations reported that  ``over a period of 4 months, HHS allegedly placed a number of UACs in  the hands of a ring of human traffickers who forced them to work on egg  farms in and around Marion, Ohio.   The minor victims were forced to work six or seven days a week,  twelve hours per day.   The traffickers repeatedly threatened the victims and their families  with physical harm, and even death, if they did not work or surrender  their entire paychecks.''   What is even more reprehensible is to this day, the Trump  administration maintains that the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)  is not legally responsible for children after they are released from  ORR care. This line of thinking allows such gross negligence to take  place in the first place. As the Founder and Chair of the Congressional  Children's Caucus and as a parent and grandparent, this is  unacceptable.   Studies have documented that when young children are traumatically  removed from their parents, their physical and mental health and well- being suffers.   The effects of these traumatic experiences--especially in children  who have already faced serious adversity--are unlikely to be short- lived, and can likely last a lifetime.   This is exacerbated when the child in custody speaks a language that  is not English or Spanish.   Although the government has a legal obligation to provide reasonable  language services to unaccompanied minors, many children arriving to  the U.S. speak indigenous languages and have little or no translation  assistance provided by the U.S. government.   The Trump administration's ``zero-tolerance'' policy does not make  our nation safer or more secure, nor is it a solution to the problem of  illegal immigration and refugees seeking asylum. It is, however,  monstrously cruel, inhumane, and shameful and makes a mockery of  America's reputation as the most welcoming and generous nation on  earth.   United Nations Office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani recently  condemned the Trump administration's treatment of unaccompanied minors  coming to the United States saying that ``the use of immigration  detention and family separation as a deterrent runs counter to human  rights standards and principles''.   The last time this nation had policies that promoted the forcible  separation of children from newly arrived persons was slavery: a dark  chapter in this nation's history that we should not revisit.   Today, the parents of these thousands of children will not be  deterred from finding ways to reunite with their children, even  reentering the United States under the threat of imprisonment.   It would be unconscionable to prosecute parents under these  circumstances. There must be strong and aggressive congressional  oversight of this administration's immigration enforcement.   The Trump administration's policy should cease and desist  immediately.   National Policy regarding immigration legislation should not create  greater fear for families already traumatized by intolerable conditions  in their home countries.   U.S. immigration policy should not deter refugees from seeking asylum  within our borders.   We should welcome mothers carrying their babies to a safe haven and  assure the safety of their children.   I will soon be introducing legislation prohibiting the separation of  children from their families absent a health or safety risk. The  legislation will also provide that these children the right to be  represented by counsel and that translation services be available at  all legal proceedings at all stages.   As we have seen with the recent volcanic activity and earthquakes in  Guatemala, the United States should be seeking ways to help its  neighbors in the Southern Hemisphere.   The American government must harness all available resources to aid  those enduring unimaginable suffering, which is why I have called upon  the President to extend Temporary Protected Status for those affected  by this volcano.   In the coming days, I will also be introducing broader legislation  that makes Guatemala eligible for TPS, so that those who fled this  horror, and other mainstays of the world--like a murder rate which is  among the highest in the country, and rampant gang violence--may have  hope to realize their American dream.''   The Trump administration is utterly failing in its basic duty to  treat all persons with dignity and compassion.   Rather, it is making a mockery of our national values and reputation  as a champion of human rights.   This crisis is not just an immigration matter, nor is it just a  foreign policy matter.   It is a humanitarian crisis, executed by an administration that  purports to be the champion of `family values' but whose actions do not  actually value families.   We are a great country with a long and noble tradition of providing  sanctuary to the persecuted and oppressed. And it is in that spirit  that we should act. We can do it; after all, we are Americans.
