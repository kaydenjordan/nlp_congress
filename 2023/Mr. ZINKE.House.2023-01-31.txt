 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of our Nation's  wildland firefighters.   In my role as Secretary of the Interior, as Congressman, and as a  Montanan, I have seen the devastation that mismanagement and  overregulation has brought to our forests.   Every year, we bear witness to our forests and homes burning in  catastrophic wildfires, wildfires that will be made worse by frivolous  and potentially deadly litigation that seeks to prevent firefighters  from doing their job.   Last year, I was at a fire camp in Elmo, Montana. While I watched  scoopers from Bridger Aerospace do their work on the ridge, I also  noticed the red stripe where retardant was dropped to protect homes,  ranches, and lives.   In many ways, wildland firefighting is a lot like serving on the  battlefield. The men and women are dropped behind enemy lines,  surrounded on all fronts, and the only resources they have next to them  are those men and women who fight fires and the air support above. If  they call in air support, it is because they need it.   We would never think of denying our troops in battle the lifesaving  air support they need, so why would anyone think that our firefighters  doing their job deserve any less?                            ____________________
