 Mr. Speaker, a few years ago, at a  townhall in my district, a young student asked me: What is Congress  going to do to protect trans people like me? He bravely stood before an  auditorium of neighbors and told me he was terrified by the bigotry and  discrimination against him and his LGBTQ-plus community members.   I have heard these fears expressed by my own nonbinary child. Their  fears are not misplaced. Our LGBTQ neighbors face discrimination in  healthcare, housing, education, and employment. Even here, in the  people's House, Members of Congress are describing transgender people  as something less than, as undeserving, and illegitimate.   Today, our vote for the Equality Act says to every person that you  matter, that you deserve to live your truth with respect and dignity,  that there will be no true freedom for anyone until there is equality  for everyone.
