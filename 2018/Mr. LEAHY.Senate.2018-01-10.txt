 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, just last week we began the second  session of the 115th Congress. We are now safely into 2018, and we  should be talking about what we can accomplish for the American people  in the new year. We simply face a long list of unfinished business from  2017--last year--and, unfortunately, we have a very short window in  which to get it done.   We are 4 months into fiscal year 2018, and we still don't have a  budget deal. I am vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We  should have had this done long before now. Our agencies are operating  under last year's funding levels. They have little flexibility to  handle the problems they face today.   We still haven't reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance  Program, what we call CHIP, so that puts the healthcare of 9 million  children at risk. These are American children.   Nearly 800,000 Dreamers live under uncertainty and fear of  deportation, living in the country they have known most of their lives.  I don't know how anybody, Republican or Democrat, could call this  acceptable.   Now, I know the Republicans control the House, they control the  Senate, and they control the White House. They are in charge. They have  to show responsibility and show leadership on these issues, but instead  of addressing these issues, last year the Republican leadership spent  time rolling back sensible regulations designed to protect the American  consumer, designed to protect our environment, and designed to protect  people from harassment in the workplace. They rolled those all back,  and then they passed a massive tax cut for big corporations and the  wealthiest of Americans.   We Democrats have been calling for bipartisan budget talks since  June--7 months ago. We have passed three continuing resolutions since  September of last year to give us more time to strike a deal on the  budget and Dreamers and CHIP and disaster funding. These are just to  name a few, but they are enormously important to the people who are  experiencing the disasters or who have children who need healthcare or  who are Dreamers. Yet, on the 102nd day of the fiscal year, there are  only 9 days until the next fiscal cliff, and we don't have a budget  deal.   President Trump said months ago that the country could use a good  government shutdown. I don't agree with  [[Page S120]]  him, but I am beginning to think that is exactly what his party is  angling for--a manufactured crisis to distract from the fact that they  are not doing their job.   The Washington Post seemed to confirm this last December, when it  reported the President privately told people that a government shutdown  would be good for him politically. In all of my years in the Senate--I  have been here under Republican and Democratic Presidents alike--I have  never heard such damaging rhetoric come from the President of the  United States.   Nobody wants a government shutdown--nobody. It is devastating to  people not only throughout the government but to people throughout the  whole country. However, that seems to be what they are vying for.   For months, I have been calling for a bipartisan budget deal that is  based on parity--equal increases for defense and nondefense programs-- that would provide relief from sequestration. I agree with the  Republicans and Democrats who say military readiness has suffered under  sequestration but so has our Nation's economy, so has our educational  system, so has our infrastructure, and so has our care for our  veterans.    If we want to combat the problems caused by sequestration, we have to  raise the caps on both sides of the ledger. Fixing one side of the  equation will not address the needs of our Nation and, even worse, will  actually shortchange our military.   If we don't invest in our economy, if we don't invest in the  education of our youth, the military will not have expert, qualified  soldiers, the men and women on whom they rely. If we don't invest in  our diplomacy, our Nation and the world become less safe. If we don't  improve our cyber security defenses and our physical infrastructure, we  become soft targets for those who would do us harm, both in this  country and outside this country. If we don't care for our veterans, we  are not going to have young men and women who are willing to serve.   This week, the majority leader came to the floor making the case for  increased defense spending. He asked us to listen to our nonpartisan  military leaders about what they think is needed to keep this country  safe. I couldn't agree more.   To that end, I have two letters signed by a combined 560 retired  admirals, generals, and other former military members. I ask unanimous  consent to have these letters printed in the Record following my  remarks.   I have no idea what these admirals', generals', and others' political  parties are, but they make the case that we have to increase our  investment in domestic priorities--including education and childcare,  as well as diplomacy--if we are going to keep our country safe and  support our military. Secretary of Defense Mattis said even more  bluntly: If we do not fully fund the State Department, we should be  prepared to buy more ammunition for our military.   The wisdom of our military leaders notwithstanding, Republicans  appear to be dug in. They claim equal increases for both defense and  nondefense programs would add too much to our deficit and burden our  children. It is one over the other. It is hard to have somebody say  that with a straight face in the wake of the President signing a tax  bill to add $1.5 trillion to our Nation's debt and to benefit primarily  large corporations and the wealthiest Americans. You can't make the  argument that we can't afford to take care of our domestic needs. It is  simply not credible.   Budget negotiations are not the only place where Republicans haven't  engaged in a productive way. President Trump's decision to end the DACA  Program has put nearly 800,000 Dreamers in this country in an untenable  position. The decision was as cruel as it was senseless. It may make a  tweet that people look at, but if you are one of those Dreamers and you  are on your way to school and are expecting a scholarship to college  and you don't know if you are going to be in this country tomorrow,  that is not a tweet.   The President should have worked with Congress. He should have found  a permanent legislative solution while keeping DACA protections in  place. I believe he terminated the program under false pretenses,  yielding to xenophobic voices in his administration, and last night a  Federal judge issued an order that said just that: Terminating DACA was  not required under the law--far from it. But a court order that only  temporarily halts the administration from dismantling DACA provides  little comfort to Dreamers. They live each and every day uncertain of  the future and with fear of deportation.   Now, I have heard Members of the Senate trying to decide at what time  we are going to finish voting for the week. Their big fear is this: Are  we going to make our flight home?   Dreamers have to worry if their flight is going to be out of this  country and back to a country they don't even know. They worry if they  will have to leave the country they know and love.   Dreamers are Americans in every way, except on paper. They were  brought here as children, through no fault of their own. They are law- abiding members of our community. They attend school. They serve as  doctors and teachers. They defend our homeland as brave men and women  in uniform.   This is a crisis of the President's own making. Now, Congress needs  to pick up the pieces. I hope, after the meeting yesterday, we will be  allowed to pick up the pieces. We have spent months trying to find a  path forward, but you can't find one if the administration keeps moving  the goalposts.   We need to address the fate of the Dreamers now. You can take a poll  in this country. The American people want us to. Also, look at the  broad bipartisan support on display yesterday at the White House.  Republicans and Democrats want to fix the mess that the President  created. A solution should be within our grasp.   The White House has made unreasonable demands, such as $18 billion of  American tax dollars to build a wall on the southern border, in  exchange for Dreamers. The $18 billion wall is last century's solution.  It does nothing for this century.   If they really believe Mexico is going to pay for it, I have a  solution. Open a bank account and, as Mexico sends us money, then use  it to build a wall. Don't ask the American taxpayers, who are strapped  at home, to pay for something the President says the Mexicans will pay  for. Open an account, find out if they are telling the truth, let the  money come into the account, and then build it.   But, worse, don't use the Dreamers as negotiable commodities. They  are not commodities. They are human beings. They are people who deserve  to have their dreams. Let's pass a bill--we could do it this week-- protecting Dreamers now. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and  the White House. This is their government.   We have a week and a half before the next continuing resolution  expires. We have a lot to do. Let's get serious. Let's get to work. I  am willing to work here every day, every night, right through the  weekend. Let's get it done. We are not doing it for us. We are doing it  for all the American people. Let's do it for all the American people-- not for special interests, not for one party. Let's do it for all the  American people. It could be done, if we want to.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                 Mission: Readiness,                                    Council for a Strong America,                                                       May 30, 2017.        Members of Congress: As retired admirals and generals, we       know from our experience that no matter how much we spend to       build our military and procure the latest and greatest       technology, we will never be a secure nation if we do not       have qualified and skilled men and women to fill the ranks of       our Armed Forces. Therefore, investing in education for our       youngest children, which is the foundation of our future       national security, is essential. Accordingly, we urge       Congress to prioritize investments in early childhood       programs, including funding for Head Start, the Child Care       and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), and Preschool       Development Grants in FY18 Labor, Health and Human Services,       Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill.        Mission: Readiness is the national security organization of       retired top military leaders that recognize the strength of       our military depends on our people. The stunning fact is that       today, 71 percent of young adults ages 17 to 24 cannot       qualify for military service because they are too poorly       educated, medically or physically unfit, or have a       disqualifying record of crime or drug abuse. if these issues       are not addressed, the Nation risks a shortage of qualified       recruits--one that will leave the country vulnerable for       years to come.  [[Page S121]]         Mounting research shows that the early years of life have       an incredible impact on educational attainment, behaviors and       health. High-quality early interventions can help vulnerable       children succeed in school, stay on the right side of the law       and achieve a healthy weight in the long-term. These outcomes       open the doors for many career paths, including military       service.        Long-term studies of early education programs show       impressive differences in children's educational outcomes. A       recent analysis of Head Start outcomes, comparing siblings       who did versus did not attend the program, found participants       showing increased probability of graduating from high school,       attending college, and receiving a postsecondary credential.       High-quality state preschool programs have also demonstrated       lasting effects on students' elementary-school performance.       New Jersey's preschool program, for example, found that       children in the program were three-quarters of a year ahead       in math and two-thirds of a year ahead in literacy in the       fourth and fifth grades.        While Congress faces tough spending choices ahead to secure       and protect our Nation, we know that the backbone of our       military is, and will always be, our women and men in       uniform. As a matter of national security, in order to grow       the pool of eligible recruits, Congress must prioritize       investments in early childhood programs, including funding       for Head Start, the Child Care and Development Block Grant       (CCDBG), and Preschool Development Grants.        Signed by a combined 424 retired admirals, generals, and       other former military members.                                   ____                                                  February 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Majority Leader       McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: As you and your       colleagues address the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018,       we write as retired three and four star flag and general       officers from all branches of the armed services to share our       strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy       and development alongside defense are critical to keeping       America safe.        We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises       our nation faces do not have military solutions alone--from       confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle       East and North Africa to preventing pandemics like Ebola and       stabilizing weak and fragile states that can lead to greater       instability. There are 65 million displaced people today, the       most since World War II, with consequences including refugee       flows that are threatening America's strategic allies in       Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and Europe.        The State Department, USAID, Millennium Challenge       Corporation, Peace Corps and other development agencies are       critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put       our men and women in uniform in harm's way. As Secretary       James Mattis said while Commander of U.S. Central Command,       ``If you don't fully fund the State Department, then I need       to buy more ammunition.'' The military will lead the fight       against terrorism on the battlefield, but it needs strong       civilian partners in the battle against the drivers of       extremism--lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice, and       hopelessness.        We recognize that America's strategic investments in       diplomacy and development--like all of U.S. investments--must       be effective and accountable. Significant reforms have been       undertaken since 9/11, many of which have been embodied in       recent legislation in Congress with strong bipartisan       support--on human trafficking, the rights of women and girls,       trade and energy in Africa, wildlife trafficking, water, food       security, and transparency and accountability.        We urge you to ensure that resources for the International       Affairs Budget keep pace with the growing global threats and       opportunities we face. Now is not the time to retreat.        cc: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.        cc: Secretary of Defense James Mattis.        cc: National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster.        Signed by a combined 121 retired admirals, generals, and       other former military members.     Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, my colleague from Vermont, Senator Bernie  Sanders, wrote what I feel was a terrific op-ed about why we should not  and do not need to close down the government, why we can do our work  and why we should, and that people rely on us, too.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Washington Post, Jan. 8, 2018]                   It's on Republicans To Stop a Shutdown                            (By Bernie Sanders)         I do not know why President Trump and the Republican       Party--which controls the White House, the Senate and the       House--are so willing to shut down the government. Maybe they       think it will be good for them politically. Maybe they       believe the chaos created by a government shutdown would be a       welcome distraction from the ongoing Russia investigation       being conducted by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.       Whatever the motives of the Republican leadership, one thing       is clear: A government shutdown would be disastrous for the       American people.        A shutdown would harm tens of millions of working-class       families who would be unable to access vital services. It       would disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of federal       employees who would not receive the paychecks they expected.       It would endanger members of the U.S. military who are       putting their lives on the line defending our nation.        Congress has a responsibility to the American people to       prevent a shutdown and work in a bipartisan manner to reach a       fair budget agreement that addresses the very serious       problems facing the working people of our country.        Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-      Ky.) ratcheted up threats of a government shutdown last week       by insisting on ending the long-standing, bipartisan       agreement over parity for defense and non-defense spending.       This principle of parity is enormously important for working       families and is something that cannot be terminated. If we do       not act, funding for education, child care, health care,       nutrition assistance, affordable housing and other important       domestic programs will be at a 40-year low as a percentage of       our economy.        As the middle class continues to shrink, cuts to non-      defense spending would cause even worse economic pain to       working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the       most vulnerable. Meanwhile, as Trump and the Republicans       demand an unbelievable $100 billion increase in military       spending over the next two years, the Defense Department has       been inoculated from budget cuts over the past several years       because of the Overseas Contingency Operations loophole--a       special account not subject to spending caps established by       Congress in 2011.        Providing parity in these budget negotiations means, among       other things, fully funding--without offsets--the Children's       Health Insurance Program for 9 million kids and community       health centers for 27 million Americans. It means increased       funding for the Social Security Administration and the       Veterans Administration so they can provide guaranteed       benefits to seniors and veterans who have earned them. It       means keeping our obligations to more than 1.5 million       workers and retirees who are about to lose a large part of       the pensions they were promised. It means addressing the       crisis of student debt, expanding child care, improving our       crumbling infrastructure in rural America and protecting our       national parks. It means providing help in the national       struggle against opioid and heroin addiction.        Furthermore, as part of the budget negotiations, we must       also provide adequate disaster relief to Texas, Florida,       Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as assistance to       the Western states recovering from terrible wildfires.        Finally, Trump added even more fuel to the fire when he       decided to use 800,000 ``dreamers'' as a bargaining chip for       an $18 billion wall that the overwhelming majority of       Americans do not want. These dreamers are young people who       have lived in this country for almost their entire lives.       They go to school. They work. They serve in the U.S.       military. The United States is their home; they know no       other. For Trump and the Republican leadership to allow their       legal status to expire, and to subject them to deportation,       would be one of the cruelest acts in modern American history.       It must not be allowed to happen.        This is not just my viewpoint. It's what the American       people want. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed that       77 percent of the American people, including a large majority       of Republicans, support providing legal protections for the       dreamers. The Republican Congress must act. A clean Dream Act       must be signed into law as part of any budget agreement.        The American people are increasingly disgusted with a       government that protects the interests of the wealthy and the       powerful, while ignoring the needs of the vulnerable. The       U.S. government must do more than provide huge tax breaks to       billionaires, callously deport young people, greatly expand       military spending, end net neutrality, deny the reality of       climate change and threaten to cut Social Security, Medicare,       Medicaid, education and nutrition programs. We must pass a       budget agreement that addresses the needs of Americans and       not just billionaire campaign contributors.  [[Page S122]]         Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, according to Landmine Monitor, which is the  world's best source of data on the production, use, export,  stockpiling, and clearance of landmines, cluster munitions, and other  unexploded ordnance, 2016 was a terrible year for casualties caused by  mines and other UXO.   In 2016, the Monitor recorded 8,605 casualties, of which at least  2,089 people were fatalities. That is the highest number since 1999,  and it includes the most casualties of children ever recorded.  Civilians represented 78 percent of recorded casualties in 2016. There  are still 61 countries that are known to be contaminated with  landmines.   On the positive side, approximately 232,000 landmines were destroyed  in 2016, and 66 square miles of land were cleared of mines and other  UXO. International donors and UXO affected countries increased support  in 2016 for UXO clearance programs by $40 million above the previous  year to $564.5 million. The United States was, like previous years, by  far the largest donor.   It is also encouraging that, since March 1, 1999, when the  international treaty banning antipersonnel landmines came into force,  163 countries have joined. That is an extraordinary achievement for a  treaty that owes its existence to the vision and perseverance of  hundreds of advocacy, human rights, arms control, humanitarian  organizations, and journalists, around the world, and the leadership of  former Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy; yet despite this  progress and substantial declining in the past few years, the number of  innocent people maimed and killed by mines has steadily increased.   There are several explanations for this. Rebel groups like ISIS  routinely use landmines and other improvised explosive devices. The  wars in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen have been largely  responsible. It may never be possible to completely eradicate the use  of landmines by rebel groups, for the weapon is so cheap to manufacture  while causing such harm.   But the major powers that have not joined the treaty--the United  States, Russia, China, Pakistan, and India--also share the blame.  Antipersonnel landmines, which are designed to be triggered  indiscriminately by the victim, whether an unsuspecting farmer or an  enemy or friendly combatant, have no place in the arsenals of modern  militaries. It is hypocrisy to claim on the one hand, as our military  does, that it uses every precaution to avoid harming civilians and  prides itself on its precision weapons, and on the other hand to insist  on the right to use a weapon that is the antithesis of precise and  overwhelmingly harms civilians.   I have spoken more times than I can count about the scourge of  antipersonnel landmines and the need for the United States to join the  Mine Ban Treaty so we are no longer an excuse for other countries not  to join. Our military has not used landmines for more than two decades.  In fact, U.S. policy now strictly limits the use of antipersonnel mines  to the Korean Peninsula, but we do not need them. What we need is the  best protection for our troops to maneuver safely through minefields.  We should have banned these indiscriminate weapons a long time ago, and  we would have if landmines were blowing off the arms and legs of  children in this Nation the way they are in others, but we have learned  that the Pentagon is not in the habit of giving up weapons, even if  they are weapons that deserve to be relegated to the dustbin of  history. That decision will only be made by a President who is willing  to do what is morally right.   Landmines have been aptly described as weapons of mass destruction in  slow  [[Page S136]]  motion. President Trump reacted with anger and disgust, as he should  have, when Syria's President Assad used chlorine gas against his own  people. He should react the same way toward antipersonnel landmines and  set an example for the rest of the world.   I ask unanimous consent that a January 6, 2018, New York Times  editorial on this subject be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Jan. 6, 2018]                   Why Do Land Mines Still Kill So Many?                          (By the Editorial Board)         The world is rolling backward, and at a disturbingly faster       pace, in the struggle to limit carnage from land mines and       other booby-trap explosives. The most recent numbers,       covering 2016, are appalling.        Known casualties that year came to 8,605, including 2,089       deaths, according to a new report by Landmine Monitor, a       research arm of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.       The toll was nearly 25 percent higher than the 6,967 maimed       and dead counted a year earlier, and more than double the       3,993 in 2014. And these numbers are almost assuredly an       undercount. ``In some states and areas, numerous casualties       go unrecorded,'' Landmine Monitor said.        Much of the 2016 mayhem stemmed from conflicts in       Afghanistan, Libya, Ukraine and Yemen, but people in 56       countries and other areas were killed or wounded by       improvised explosive devices and other ordnance placed by       governments or, more commonly, by insurgent groups. The sheer       indecency of it is self-evident. Nearly 80 percent of the       victims were civilians; children accounted for 42 percent of       civilian casualties in situations where the ages were known.        One subset of the menace, cluster munitions, is singularly       vicious. A single cluster bomb can contain dozens, even       hundreds, of baseball-size bomblets that spray in all       directions, ripping apart anything in their path. All too       often, they fail to detonate right away and thus become time       bombs that imperil unwary civilians who pick them up,       including curious children. Cluster munitions alone caused       971 known casualties in 2016, more than twice the toll of the       previous year, according to Cluster Munition Monitor. Most       victims were Syrians, nearly all of them civilians, but Saudi       Arabia has also used American-supplied cluster bombs in       Yemen.        Perhaps the saddest part of all this is that for well over       a decade the world seemed to have gotten a grip on what are       referred to generically as the ``explosive remnants of war.''       Thanks to an international treaty that came into force in       1999--now signed by 163 countries and banning the production,       stockpiling and transfer of land mines--casualties declined       steadily worldwide. They reached a low of 3,450 in 2013,       compared with 9,228 in 1999. (A companion treaty outlawing       cluster munitions, joined by 119 countries, went into effect       in 2010.) As the death and injury toll for 2016 shows, nearly       all that hard-won progress has been erased by the brutal       conflicts of recent vintage.        The picture is not irredeemably bleak. The Landmine Monitor       said that 32 donors, led by the United States, contributed       nearly $480 million in 2016 for mine clearance and victim       aid. That was an increase of 22 percent from the year before.       More than 232,000 antipersonnel mines were reportedly       destroyed in 2016, and about 66 square miles--an area nearly       the size of Brooklyn--were cleared of explosive hazards.        The grim reality, though, is that the land mine and cluster       munitions treaties are undercut by the refusal of some of       modern warfare's most powerful players to sign them. Among       those countries are China, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia       and Saudi Arabia. And the United States. The Pentagon has       long insisted that eliminating cluster bombs could put       soldiers at risk. As for land mines, they are deemed by       Washington to be a useful tool in the demilitarized zone       separating North and South Korea--a first-line defense for       the South against a possible invasion. But given the North's       nuclear buildup, a mined DMZ seems to be a Cold War vestige       of diminished value.        Washington is not immune to international suasion. Land       mines are so stigmatized that American forces have barely       used them since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. The United States       stockpile, estimated at three million mines, is significantly       reduced from pre-treaty years; it's puny compared with the 26       million mines that Russia has on hand, according to the       International Campaign to Ban Landmines. Similarly, American       reliance on cluster munitions, which peaked in the early       stages of the 2003 Iraq war, has all but disappeared.        In 2014 the Obama administration even signaled it might be       willing to join the anti-mine treaty. Regrettably, that step       never came. It might have been a moral statement encouraging       others to follow suit. Now, with President Trump openly       disdainful of international agreements, the likelihood of       Washington's signing the treaty would seem to be about zero.       The Pentagon, under his ultimate control, recently authorized       the military to restock older cluster munitions, whose       immediate failure rate can be high, leaving bomblets that can       explode and kill civilians even years later.        For countries like Afghanistan, Libya, Ukraine and Yemen,       the risks may endure long after the guns go silent. Vietnam       provides an example. Since the war there ended in 1975, at       least 40,000 Vietnamese are believed to have been killed and       another 60,000 wounded by American land mines, artillery       shells, cluster bombs and other ordnance that failed to       detonate back then. They later exploded when handled by       scrap-metal scavengers and unsuspecting children.        The lesson is stark for today's war-torn countries. They       could reap the same whirlwind in coming decades.
