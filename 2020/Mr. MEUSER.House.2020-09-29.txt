 Madam Speaker, it is really my honor to be here today in  support with Congressman Trone, and I thank him for his partnership and  his leadership on this very important issue.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer support for our bill, H.R. 5572,  the Family Support Services for Addiction Act, which provides a family  and community-based approach to addiction treatment that works to  address the deep-seated effects of the addiction crisis on so many  families.   The opioid epidemic is ravaging my district and many States across  America, and all of Pennsylvania is by no means an exception. In 2017,  Pennsylvania experienced 5,456 drug-related overdose deaths. It has  impacted virtually every family throughout the Commonwealth.   Far too many families struggling with substance use disorder feel  like they have nowhere to turn for the resources and very important  information.                                time  1515    This bill would establish a grant program for family community  organizations that provide support for families of individuals  struggling with substance use disorder. These services can include  information and referral sources, support groups, system navigation to  assist the family in finding resources, parent training and education,  specialized crisis support, and, really, much, much more, again, where  they currently don't know where to turn.   As a member of the Freshman Working Group on Addiction, I am very  proud to be the Republican lead on a bill that takes critical steps to  help families feel empowered and equipped to support their loved ones  struggling with substance use disorder.   I again want to very, very sincerely congratulate and thank  Congressman   David Trone for his hard work, his dedication, and his  great care in helping those suffering from drug addiction.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I urge its swift  passage.
