 Mr. President, due to a family related matter in  Michigan, I was unable to attend today's rollcall vote on the  nomination of John K. Bush to be a United States circuit judge for the  Sixth Circuit. Had I been able to attend, I would have opposed his  nomination.   I also was unable to attend today's rollcall vote on the motion to  invoke cloture on the nomination of David Bernhardt to be Deputy  Secretary of the Interior. Had I been able to attend, I would have  voted no on the cloture motion.                            ____________________
