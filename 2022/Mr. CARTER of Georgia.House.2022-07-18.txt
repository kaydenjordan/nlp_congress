 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of a good  friend and a remarkable Georgian, Patrick Jones.   Patrick graduated from the University of Georgia in 1987 with a  bachelor's degree in risk management. A loving father and devoted  husband, he and his wife, Kara, have two children and reside in  Blackshear, Georgia, in my First Congressional District.   Patrick spent over three decades of his career working at Flash Foods  alongside his brother. Under their leadership, it became one of the  largest convenience chains in the Southeast. It was one of the first  convenience chains to establish a loyalty program, a proprietary retail  pricing platform, and a robust item-level inventory management system.   In 2016, Flash Foods was acquired by CST Brands and subsequently,  Circle K. Patrick now serves as the chairman of the board of Primesouth  Bank, president of the Jones Company, and President of Walker Jones  Automotive Group.   An agent of change, Mr. Jones currently serves on the Department of  Transportation's Southern Georgia Citizen's Review Panel, which was  created through the Transportation Investment Act. He has previously  served on the Bona Fide Coin Operated Amusement Machine Operator  Advisory Board.   Mr. Speaker, Patrick Jones has truly made his mark on his community.                            ____________________
