 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  lifelong Ohioan who made a profound impact on not only me but so many  in the Zanesville area, my hometown, Betty Wiechert.   I first came to know Betty when I was just a young boy, when she  became my first Sunday school teacher. All these years later, Betty and  I still attended the same church together each Sunday.   Just a few weeks ago, Betty even surprised me by asking a question on  a telephone townhall. She lived an incredibly full life until the very  end.   Born in Newark and raised in Zanesville, Betty gave her entire life  to her family and this community, teaching not only Sunday school but  also third and fifth grades.   Her passing was preceded by her parents, her husband of nearly 62  years, Rudy, two grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, one great- great-grandchild, a brother-in-law, and her father-in-law and mother- in-law.   She is survived by six children, 16 grandchildren, 46 great- grandchildren, 42 great-great-grandchildren, with three more nephews,  and extended family and friends.   Her faith and her positivity were Betty's trademarks and are all the  things fellow Ohioans remember most about her.   I will miss seeing her each Sunday at church and will always admire  her dedication to bettering the lives of those around her each day. We  will miss her dearly.                            ____________________
