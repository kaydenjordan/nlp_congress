 Mr. President, in 1831, a young Frenchman who sought  to understand the motivating principles behind the world's newest  independent Nation mused:         In America, the principle of the sovereignty . . . is not       either barren or concealed, as it is with some other nations;       it is recognized by the customs and proclaimed by the laws;       it spreads freely, and arrives without impediment at its most       remote consequences.    Alexis de Tocqueville had come to America on a research mission. He  had had no special training in government or political science, but he  had been fueled by a desire to know if the principles that had guided  the early American Republic could help his fellow Frenchmen. Even as an  outsider, de Tocqueville had seen freedom, not a lone figurehead or  compulsory philosophy, as the foundation to build upon. Freedom had  been what he had seen as an enduring foundation.   Today, however, the belief in a moral right to self-governance is  more often than not portrayed as quaint and the kind of fierce  independence that drove our Founders to the battlefield as outdated in  comparison to modern concepts of so-called global governance and polite  codependence.   Yet, when I look at the state of the world and all of its competing  philosophies, I am very grateful for our bold commitment to self- defense. That is why I come to the floor today--to express my thoughts  on our National Defense Authorization Act and to say a thank-you to  Chairman Inhofe for his leadership in pushing the Senate Armed Services  Committee to present ideas, to bring forward amendments, and to work  through this process together. I am looking forward to the couple of  days in front of us in this Chamber with Members from both sides of the  aisle.   It cannot be understated that the importance of maintaining a regular  budget for our military cannot be diminished. The failure to do so will  put our troops at a disadvantage. Look no further than the ongoing  tension right now between the United States and Iran and how this has  magnified the part that deterrence plays--the importance of  deterrence--in our defending our security without our resorting to the  use of military force.   Last week, I spoke at length about two emerging warfighting domains  that challenge the way we think about modern defense. These are cyber  and space. That is why this year's NDAA expands beyond legacy programs  to include the recognition of emerging threats and our responses to  those.   The next great threat to our sovereignty may be more subtle than a  bomb's being dropped on American soil. It could undermine our cyber  security or slowly compromise the supply chain that provides us with  needed microelectronics. It might cause us to question our position in  the world or to rethink our influence in the international community.  It is important to understand that these attacks aren't only meant to  undermine our relationships and our infrastructure; they are  coordinated and intentional attacks on the foundations that de  Tocqueville recognized as being powerful, unique, and underpinning what  we have in the United States.    The implications are clear: Everything we do in this Chamber must be  understood in the context of defending America's sovereignty. It means  believing in the supremacy of the Constitution and giving the defense  community the means to protect us in order to fulfill that first  responsibility of providing for the common defense. It means  recognizing that freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and free  assembly are just as precious as any physical thing we can put under  lock and key.   Those who would threaten our freedom and safety do not look to  America and see our formidable military as the single greatest threat  to their destructive agendas. They are most frightened by our  unwavering and ardent commitment to freedom. Our enemies are frightened  of the young men and  [[Page S4494]]  women who willingly join the military. They volunteer for service.   They are frightened by the strength of conviction that leads men and  women on our streets to protect protests even though they would never  join those protests--not in a million years. They do this because they  recognize that defending someone's right to speak is just as important  as speaking oneself.   Our enemies are frightened by the confidence with which we defend the  Constitution when well-meaning actors ask if we could set the First  Amendment aside to better protect impressionable minds from dangerous  ideas.   Ours is the kind of freedom that is always in danger of extinction,  just as the late President Reagan repeatedly reminded us, but it is  also worth protecting.   This week, I implore my friends on both sides of the aisle to do all  they can to ensure that our best, first line of defense has the ability  to protect and defend freedom and freedom's cause.   I yield the floor.
