 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Protecting  the Right to Organize Act, the PRO Act.   Just last weekend, I invited a number of our Democratic colleagues to  come to my district and stand in solidarity with the Amazon workers in  Bessemer, Alabama, who are voting this month on whether to join the  Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.   Mr. Speaker, it is because of unions that we have a 5-day workweek.  It is because of unions that we have safer working conditions all  across America. Congress must do more to protect the basic right to  join a union.   If we pass the PRO Act, workers in Bessemer and workers across this  country will have stronger collective bargaining rights and more  streamlined union election processes. We would also have meaningful  enforcement for companies that violate workers' rights.   The workers in my Alabama district deserve a fair election that is  free of influence from management.   Mr. Speaker, the Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, are following a  rich tradition of ordinary Alabamians, standing up and fighting for  civil rights and human rights. I am asking my colleagues to stand with  the workers in Bessemer and around this country by passing the PRO Act.                            ____________________
