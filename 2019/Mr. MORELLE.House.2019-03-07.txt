 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Triple  Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Day, which took place earlier this  week on March 3.   My daughter, Lauren, battled triple negative breast cancer for 2  years, with incredible strength, courage, humor,  [[Page H2513]]  and tenacity. She shared her story publicly with tens of thousands of  people on a Facebook page called Lauren vs. Cancer, underscoring the  importance of this serious health issue and encouraging everyone to get  tested.   Sadly, Lauren died at the age of 31 from this horrible disease in  August of 2017. In Lauren's memory, I have dedicated myself to efforts  to eradicate the scourge of breast cancer.   As we recognize Triple Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Day, I want  to extend my support to the thousands of women and men affected by this  devastating and, at times, deadly disease. We must take this  opportunity to highlight the need for continued education, research,  and action to finally find a cure for breast cancer.                            ____________________
