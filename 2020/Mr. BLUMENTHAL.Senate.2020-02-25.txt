 Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to  Jeffrey ``Jeff'' Hammond Long, an outstanding public servant and friend  to many. Sadly, Jeff passed away on July 8, 2018. He was critically  injured by a truck while riding his bike in Washington the previous  day. Today, in honor of what would have been his 38th birthday, I wish  to recognize Jeff's legacy of positivity.   Born in New York City, Jeff enrolled at Brunswick School in  Greenwich, CT. Throughout his many years there, Jeff set an example for  his fellow students. Not only did he mentor younger members of the  community and cocaptain the lacrosse team, but he also served as  president of the student body. Even after graduation, Jeff continued to  serve the school as a result of the foundational experience he had at  Brunswick.   Jeff studied at Hamilton College, where he was vice president of the  student body and an Arthur Levitt Scholar. During his time at Hamilton,  Jeff began his remarkable dedication to public service by interning for  former President Clinton at the Clinton Foundation's New York office,  as well as for Secretary Kerry's Presidential campaign and his U.S.  Senate office.   I had the pleasure of first meeting Jeff in 2010. He worked in my  Senate office for many years, serving as a legislative assistant on the  energy, environment, and transportation portfolio. Jeff routinely  demonstrated his extraordinary commitment to helping the people of  Connecticut and the Nation. A diligent and bright member of my team, he  always put the needs of others before his own, focusing on serving the  people of Connecticut with tireless care and patience.   His incredible wife, Kaylie--another Connecticut native and devoted  public servant--continues to honor his memory by doing acts of kindness  on Jeff's birthday. She and their friends are guided by his motto:  ``It's cool to be nice.''   Jeff's natural inclination to support others and bring smiles to  people's faces touched countless lives from Connecticut to DC, and  everywhere in between. He helped everyone around him find a positive  side to any situation or take a moment to appreciate even the smallest  parts of life.   I am grateful for the considerate and warm outlook Jeff brought  wherever he went, and I know his memory will forever serve as a model  of selflessness and unfailing devotion. My wife Cynthia and I extend  our warmest thoughts to Kaylie, as well as to Jeff's parents, Nancy and  David, and I hope my colleagues will join me in acknowledging Jeff's  incredible impact.
