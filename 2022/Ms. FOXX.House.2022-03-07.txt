 Madam Speaker, the American people are asking one simple  question: Why does the Biden administration hate energy freedom in  America?   They have asked that question every time they have gone to the gas  station and seen prices skyrocketing. Now, they are asking that  question as this administration is falling to its knees and begging  Iran for a nuclear deal. Sacrificing our geopolitical leverage by  appealing to our enemies is appalling, and it is the last thing that  should ever be considered.   Madam Speaker, this administration would rather be awarded a  participation trophy than dig in and fight to put American interests  first.   That mentality is bankrupting our great country, and we have been led  into a political minefield. It is a display of pure weakness and an  absolute disgrace.                            ____________________
