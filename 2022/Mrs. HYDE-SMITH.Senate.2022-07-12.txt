 Mr. President, I also am very pleased to  congratulate the University of Mississippi baseball team on its recent  2022 NCAA World Series championship.   If there is anything an Ole Miss fan is sure of it is that the Rebels  love to keep you on the edge of your seat. Some fans were nervous when  the Rebels hit a midseason slump, but, boy, this talented team hit its  stride right at the perfect time.   The players knew all along they had it in them to take it all the  way. They even issued a warning in early May: Don't let the Rebels get  hot. Well, the Rebels did get hot, and they were able to be there to be  the team that no one saw coming and the team that no one could stop.   Their impressive and exciting run through this year's College World  Series speaks volumes to the Ole Miss baseball program, its leadership,  its players, and, of course, its fan base.   Mississippi's energy has been electric following the win, especially  at Ole Miss's first-ever national baseball championship this year  occurred after Pearl River Community College clinched the NJCAA  Division II baseball championship in June and after Mississippi State  University's win just last year.   Mississippi's sports culture is strong and it is not to be  underestimated. We take great pride in the legacy and inspiring example  of these young athletes and their coaches.   To the entire Rebel baseball family, thank you for your hard work and  dedication to the sport. To Ole Miss and to our great State,  congratulations and Hotty Toddy.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
