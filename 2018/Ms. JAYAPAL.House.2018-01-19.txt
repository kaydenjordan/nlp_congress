 Madam Speaker, this bill is yet another inflammatory and  unnecessary attack on women's rights, namely, a woman's  constitutionally protected right to an abortion.   Of course we support proper care for infants who are born. Those of  us who are mothers know that we want what is best for our children, but  that is not what this bill is about.   This so-called Born-Alive bill seeks to further politicize abortion  and criminalize providers. It is clearly unnecessary because doctors  are already bound by guidelines that require them to provide emergency  care when facing life-threatening circumstances.   Abortion care providers, including Planned Parenthood, are highly  skilled and highly professional. They do not deserve to be  criminalized. This is pure political theater.   Instead of ensuring that women have access to reproductive  healthcare, the Republican majority is attempting to interfere with  patients' relationships with their doctors, a provider's ability to  practice medicine, and our constitutionally protected right to make  choices about our own bodies.   And let us be clear: the impact of this will fall disproportionately  on low-income and rural women and women of color.   And let's also be clear about this: Roe v. Wade gave women the right  to access an abortion, and 7 in 10 Americans support that right across  rural and urban America.                                time  0945    The vast majority on both sides of the aisle see through these  cynical attempts to strip women's access to healthcare from the 20-week  and 6-week abortion bans to these attempts to cut funding to Planned  Parenthood. Our focus, Madam Speaker, should be on ensuring that every  person in America has access to comprehensive healthcare, rather than  harmful bills that strip healthcare or the Republican obsession with  undermining the Affordable Care Act, which the American people have  already said a loud ``no'' to.   We have so much real work to do: passing a real budget, passing a  clean Dream Act, and fighting climate change.   Madam Speaker, I reject this bill. Let's do that real work instead.
