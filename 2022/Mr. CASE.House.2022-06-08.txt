 Madam Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues to recognize  and honor the selfless service of the Japanese Americans who served our  country in World War II with the famed 100th Infantry Battalion of  Hawaii, or the One Puka Puka.   This year, the fabled 100th celebrates its 80th anniversary. The  battalion was composed of 1,400 Americans of Japanese ancestry whose  loyalty was questioned by our government following the attacks on Pearl  Harbor and much worse. Although much of the U.S. public looked upon  them with disdain and skepticism, these soldiers simply persevered.  Their story is one of patriotism, tenacity, and courage.   Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor, and when anti-Japanese  hysteria was at its peak, these young men raised their hands and  demanded the right to defend America.   With the support of U.S. military officers and others in Hawaii and  elsewhere, the Federal Government eventually created an all-nisei, or  second-generation Japanese-American Army unit, the 100th Infantry  Battalion.   Just before their deployment in August of 1943, the men of the One  Puka Puka selected the motto ``Remember Pearl Harbor'' to reflect their  anger at the attack on their country.   Although the cloud of racism and underlying uncertainty hovered over  these brave Americans, their performance was nothing less than  exemplary. In September 1943, the 100th arrived in North Africa, but  soon transferred to central Italy, where it faced heavy combat. It  eventually became known as the Purple Heart Battalion because of its  high casualty rate.   One of its members and casualties was Captain Spark Matsunaga, who  suffered grievous injuries in a mine field. He later became a Member of  this hallowed House and, after that, a United States Senator, inspiring  generations, including me, who was privileged to serve 3 years on his  staff. His own story is just one of countless we can and should  remember.   In August, 1944, and after a year of combat, the battalion integrated  with the Japanese Americans of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. They  then continued to fight through Italy and France. The men of the 100th  spent 20 months in Europe and fought in six campaigns across Italy and  France. They received six Distinguished Service Crosses and earned  three Presidential Unit Citations. Along with the 442nd, the 100th  Infantry Battalion is recognized as the most decorated American unit in  our history for its size and length of service.   The lineage and honors of the 100th and 442nd live on today and are  preserved by the 100th Battalion, 442d Infantry, U.S. Army Reserve.  Today, the unit is staffed with reservists from Hawaii, American Samoa,  Guam, and Saipan. These men and women carry on the legacy of the  soldiers that endured so much before them 80 years ago.   We all owe a debt of gratitude to groups like the Nisei Veterans  Legacy and the Military Intelligence Service Education Society of  Hawaii, and others, for keeping the 100th Battalion's legacy alive.  They have all been critical in recognizing the sacrifices of our  Japanese Americans to defend a country that questioned their loyalty.   On the walls of the National Japanese American Memorial, not far from  our U.S. Capitol, the late Senator Spark Matsunaga's words still ring  true today: ``We believed a threat to this Nation's democracy was a  threat to the American Dream and to all free peoples of the world.''   Today, we renew our debt of gratitude to the Japanese Americans of  the One Puka Puka. May they live forever in our hearts and minds.                            ____________________
