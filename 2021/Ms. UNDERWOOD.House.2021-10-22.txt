 Madam Speaker, every mom returning to the workforce  after childbirth should be provided the time and space that they need  to safely and privately pump breast milk at work.   As a nurse, I understand how critical breastfeeding is to the health  of both mom and baby.   Without sufficient workplace protections, breastfeeding employees are  at risk of serious and painful health consequences and reduced milk  supply. They can also face harassment, docked pay, and even job loss.   Yet each year, millions of workers, including teachers, nurses,  farmworkers, and salaried employees are denied this basic protection  due to an unintended loophole in current law.   I am grateful to Chairwoman Maloney for her leadership, and I am  proud to join her in leading the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act to close  the coverage gap and ensure all breastfeeding moms are protected and  supported as they return to work.   This bill is bipartisan and has a broad coalition of support from  public health, labor, and civil rights groups, as well as from the  business community.   It is also urgently needed, providing commonsense, necessary  protections for working moms, as well as more clarity and  predictability for employers.   Returning to work after childbirth already poses many inherent  challenges for moms and their families, and we must remove barriers for  parents making the best choices for their families and themselves.   I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on this important  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record three letters in support of  the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act from the National Education  Association, the National Partnership for Women and Families, and the  March of Dimes.                                  National Education Association,                                 Washington, DC, September 24, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: The 3 million members of the National       Education Association, who educate and support 50 million       students across the nation, urge you to vote YES on the       Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing       Mothers Act, H.R. 3110. Votes on this issue may be included       in the NEA Report Card for the 117th Congress.        The 2010 Break Time law provided important protections that       ensured employees would have reasonable break time and a       private place to pump breast milk. However, the law excludes       certain categories of employees, including educators; in       fact, nearly one in four women of childbearing age is not       covered by the Break Time law. The PUMP Act would:        Protect the nearly 9 million employees who are not now       covered by the Break Time law;        Require employers to provide reasonable break time and a       private, non-bathroom space for breastfeeding employees to       pump during the workday;        Provide employers with clarity on when pumping time must be       paid and when it may be unpaid, leaving in place existing law       protecting many salaried workers and clarifying that any time       spent pumping while the employee is working must be counted       as hours worked; and        Ensure that nursing mothers have access to remedies that       are available for other violations of the Fair Labor       Standards Act.        Decades of scientific research tell us that breastfeeding       helps put children on the path to life-long health and       wellness. This strong foundation, in turn, can pave the way       for their future success in school. The PUMP Act supports       children's early development, while also recognizing that       breastfeeding mothers are crucial breadwinners for their       families. We urge you to vote YES on the PUMP Act.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,      National Education Association.                                   ____                                                 September 24, 2021.        Dear Members of Congress: The National Partnership for       Women & Families is a non-profit, non-partisan advocacy       organization committed to improving the lives of women and       families by achieving equity for all women. Since our       creation as the Women's Legal Defense Fund in 1971, we have       fought for every significant advance for equal opportunity in       the workplace, including the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of       1978 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). We       write in strong support of H.R. 3110, Providing Urgent       Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act. This       bipartisan legislation will support breastfeeding employees       and their families, improving infant health and the economic       security of women and families.        Once pregnant workers return to the workplace after giving       birth, many will need the ability to pump breastmilk during       the workday. While the Affordable Care Act requires employers       to provide reasonable break time and a private, non-bathroom       space for certain breastfeeding employees to pump, persistent       coverage gaps exist. Roughly one in four women of       childbearing age are not covered by current law. Since       breastfeeding is associated with a host of improved health       outcomes, expanding these protections to the 9 million       workers currently excluded from the Break Time for Nursing       Mothers law is essential to support mothers in the workplace.       In addition to closing the coverage gap, the PUMP Act will       also clarify for employers when pumping time must be paid and       when it may be unpaid, and extend the remedies available for       other violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act to nursing       employees, ensuring that working parents' rights are       protected.        The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act is crucial because it will       fill the gaps in the Break Time for Nursing Mothers law,       allowing breastfeeding employees to remain in the workforce       while keeping their families healthy. It is time to clarify       and strengthen existing federal protections for breastfeeding       employees by passing the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act.            Sincerely,                                                  Debra L. Ness,                                     President, National Partnership      for Women & Families.                                   ____                                                   March of Dimes,                                                 September 24, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Leader Schumer and       Leader McConnell: On behalf of March of Dimes, the nonprofit       organization leading the fight for the health of all moms and       babies, we urge swift passage of the bi-partisan Providing       Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act       (S. 1658/H.R. 3110).        We began that fight more than 80 years ago as an       organization dedicated to eradicating polio in the U.S., a       goal that we achieved. We continue that fight today as we       work to address some of the biggest threats to moms and       babies, such as premature birth and maternal mortality,       through research, education, programs and advocacy.        March of Dimes' ongoing work to improve maternal and infant       health is more important than ever as our nation is in the       midst of a dire maternal and infant health crisis. Rates of       preterm birth are increasing, the U.S. is one of the most       dangerous places to give birth in the developed world, and       there are unacceptable disparities in birth outcomes between       women and infants of color and their White peers. We also       know, the health and well-being of mothers and infants are       inextricably linked. By improving the health of, and       conditions for, women before, during and between pregnancies,       we can improve outcomes for both them and their infants. But       we have many challenges before us.        One of those challenges is ensuring the ability for a       mother to feed her infant after returning to the workplace.       When a new mother returns to work after having a baby,  [[Page H5804]]       she will need continued support in the workplace to ensure       she can continue to breastfeed her child if she chooses.       Exclusive breastfeeding has a significant impact the health       of the baby, as well as benefits for moms. However, returning       to work can make continuing the breastfeeding relationship       between mothers and their infants very difficult, especially       if employers don't provide employees with adequate break time       and an appropriate space to express breastmilk during the       workday.        The Affordable Care Act (ACA) included provisions that       required certain employers to provide break time and a place       for most hourly wage-earning and some salaried employee to       pump at work. The Providing Urgent Maternal Protections       (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act would extend those supports to       the 9 million employees that were excluded from the ACA's       protections and provide for enforcement of this benefit.       These nurses, teachers, retail workers, and managers across a       number of industries deserve the same protections as other       working mothers. March of Dimes proudly endorses the PUMP for       Nursing Mothers Act (S. 1658/H.R. 3110).        Thank you again for the opportunity to express March of       Dimes' strong support for this bipartisan legislation under       consideration, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act (S. 1658/H.R.       3110). We urge the swift advancement of this important bill       and look forward to its passage.            Sincerely,                                                 Stacey Brayboy,                                Senior Vice President, Public Policy                                              & Government Affairs.     Madam Speaker, I thank these groups for their support  of the bill and for their tireless efforts on behalf of working moms.
