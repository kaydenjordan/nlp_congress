 Madam Speaker, this month's job report gives Americans  something to cheer about. Unemployment is down a full 2 percentage  points under Democratic congressional and Presidential leadership since  President Biden took office. The corollary to this impressive  unemployment figure is the record 6 million jobs created, a record for  a new President.   With the signing of the new transportation and infrastructure bill,  more jobs, for example, in my own district, the District of Columbia,  are on the way--$1.1 billion for roads and bridges.   Build Back Better promises even more economic dividends. Analysts say  Build Back Better is the biggest cost-cutting bill for the middle class  in modern American history. With costs down, job growth will be  spurred.   Democrats are creating a new economy featuring record jobs for the  American people.                            ____________________
