 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the students of the Central Pennsylvania Institute of Science and  Technology in Pleasant Gap, Pennsylvania.   Recently, I had the pleasure of joining several students back in  Centre County for a very special project that they are working on. It  is called Heroscaping.   The students are building a memorial at the Centre County Public  Safety Training Center to honor first responders, particularly those  who answered the call to serve when the World Trade Center was attacked  on 9/11.   The project was recently finished, and it was an honor to join them  when I was back in my district to help lay pavers and meet many of the  students involved. One of the students was just 3 months old when the  planes crashed into the Twin Towers. The others had not been born yet.   That is why projects like these are so important--to honor the men  and women who rose to the occasion to protect our Nation and to ensure  that the younger generations never forget their sacrifices.                            ____________________
