 Mr. Speaker, the flow of illegal aliens into the United  States is out of control. President Biden stopped building the wall,  brought back the Obama-era catch-and-release policy, and rolled out an  open borders agenda that is now devastating our country.   More than 1.3 million illegal aliens have been apprehended at our  border since January, and the men and women of the U.S. Customs and  Border Patrol are preparing for another surge of up to 400,000 foreign  nationals sometime this month.   We must invest in border security now. But instead, Washington  Democrats are pushing a radical $5 trillion tax-and-spend package that  will only make our borders and our border crisis worse.   This package includes zero funding for border security and grants  blanket amnesty to 10 million illegal aliens while providing them with  $100 billion in taxpayer-funded benefits.    The border crisis is real. Democrats' far-left, socialist  reconciliation package would only make it worse.
