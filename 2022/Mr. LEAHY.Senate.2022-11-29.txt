 Madam President, on behalf of Vermonters, today I was  proud to vote for the final passage of the Respect for Marriage Act.  Today, we became a slightly more perfect union by recognizing the  sanctity of marriage between two individuals, regardless of gender or  race.   In August of this year, Marcelle and I celebrated our 60th wedding  anniversary. Marrying each other was the most important decision of our  lives--not a decision taken lightly, but a deeply personal commitment.  A decision such as who to spend your life with should not be determined  by a State, local, or Federal government. It is regrettable that  throughout our history, too many Americans have been denied the right  to marry who they love based on their gender or race.   In 2012, I was proud to cosponsor an earlier version of the Respect  for Marriage Act to codify the right for all Americans to marry who  they love. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I also convened the  first ever hearing to examine the harmful consequences the Defense of  Marriage Act had, and still has, on American families.   I am a proud cosponsor of this version of the Respect for Marriage  Act. This bill--as most bills are--is far from perfect, but is a  product of a bipartisan compromise. I want to acknowledge my friend  from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, whose steadfast resolve is the reason  why this bill passed the Senate today. In the face of Supreme Court  Justices determined to turn back the clock on basic rights, a group of  bipartisan Senators remained committed to the principle that all  legally valid marriages between two people who love and care for each  other deserve equal treatment under the law everywhere in our country.   My home State of Vermont is no stranger to making history. Vermont  has been a pioneer in the movement for LGBTQ rights. In 2000, Vermont  became the first State to introduce civil unions and the first to offer  a civil union status encompassing the same legal rights and  responsibilities as marriage. The State again made history in 2009 when  it was the first State to allow same-sex marriage without being  required to do so through a court  [[Page S6849]]  decision. Just last year, I was so proud when former Vermont Supreme  Court Justice Beth Robinson became the first openly gay woman to ascend  to our Federal circuit courts, on the Second Circuit.   Over the years, I have heard from Vermonters, colleagues, my staff,  friends, and family on this issue. They have told me what I already  know from my marriage to Marcelle. The right to marriage--the right to  love someone and build a life with them--should be equally available to  all Americans.   As I have said before, when common ground is fertile, we must plant  the seeds of progress. And I believe that the Senate did that today by  passing the Respect for Marriage Act.                            ____________________
