 Madam Speaker, I was a political newcomer before this;  and just like President Trump, perhaps like me, he was naive to think  that this House, that in the people's House, everybody was true and  just. That is not the case.   Democrats weren't saddened by this sullen day. They weren't waiting  for all of the evidence. This was always about politics because they  loathe the President because he doesn't play by their beltway rules.   I should have known.   But the fact is Kansas is better, the U.S. is better, and the world  is better because of Donald Trump.
