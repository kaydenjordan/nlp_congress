 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of my opening statement at the Senate Health Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            Vaccines Save Lives          The Senate Committee on Health, Education,       Labor and Pensions will please come to order.        Senator Murray and I will each have an opening statement,       and then we will introduce the witnesses. After the       witnesses' testimony, senators will each have 5 minutes of       questions.        It was not that long ago that, as a boy, I remember the       terror in the hearts of parents that their children might       contract polio and my classmates in iron lungs.        The Majority Leader, Senator McConnell, contracted polio       when he was young. His mother took him to Warm Springs,       because that is where President Roosevelt received treatment       for polio. Fortunately, because of her dedication, Leader       McConnell is able to walk today, but thousands of others were       not as lucky.        Following the introduction of a vaccine in 1955, polio was       eliminated in the United States in 1979, and since then, from       every country in the world except for three. Polio is just       one of the diseases we have eradicated in the United States       thanks to vaccines.        Before the vaccine for measles was developed, up to four       million Americans each year contracted the highly contagious,       airborne virus.        In 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       (CDC) declared measles eliminated from the United States. And       in 1980, smallpox was declared eradicated from the world by       the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO).        This is a remarkable demonstration of modern medicine.        Four years ago, this Committee held a hearing on vaccines,       following the 2014 outbreak of measles--the worst outbreak       since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.        And even though 91.1 percent of Americans had been       vaccinated for measles in 2017, according to the CDC, we       continue to see outbreaks of this preventable disease because       there are pockets in the United States that have low       vaccination rates.        Last year, there were 372 cases of measles--the second       highest number since 2000. And so far this year, there have       been 159 cases reported and outbreaks confirmed in Washington       State, New York, Texas, and Illinois.        We know that some Americans are hesitant about vaccines, so       today I want to stress the importance of vaccines: not only       has the Food and Drug Administration found them to be safe,       but vaccines also save lives.        Vaccines have been so successful that, until recently,       Americans have lived without fear of getting measles, polio,       or rubella. We have made significant strides in improving       vaccination rates.        In 2009, about 44 percent of Americans had received       vaccines for seven preventable diseases: Diphtheria],       Tetanus, Pertussis, Polio, Measles, Mumps, and Rubella,       Haemophilus influenza type b, Hepatitis B, Chickenpox, and       Pneumococcal, according to the CDC.        Today, over 70 percent of Americans are vaccinated against       all seven of these diseases.        Vaccines protect not only those who have been vaccinated,       but the larger community. This is called herd immunity.        There are some people who cannot be vaccinated--they are       too young, or have a weak immune system because of a genetic       disorder or are taking medicine that compromises their immune       system, like cancer treatment.        Vaccines protect those who cannot be vaccinated by       preventing the spread of diseases. However, low immunization       rates can destroy a community's herd immunity.        While the overall vaccination rate nationwide is high       enough to create this herd immunity, certain areas--the       pockets of the country where vaccination rates are low--are       vulnerable to outbreaks. There is a lot of misleading and       incorrect information about vaccines that circulates online,       including through social media.        Here is what I want parents in Tennessee, in Washington, in       Texas, everywhere in our country to know: Vaccines are       approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and meet the       FDA's gold standard of safety. The Advisory Committee on       Immunization Practices makes recommendations on the use of       vaccines in the United States and annual child and adult       vaccine schedules. This Advisory Committee is made up of       medical doctors and public health professionals from medical       schools, hospitals, and professional medical organizations       from around the country. They are among the best our country       has to offer and they have dedicated their lives to helping       others. These recommendations are reviewed and approved by       the CDC director, and are available on the CDC's website.        There is nothing secret about any of this science.       Countless studies have been done to show that vaccines are       safe. Charlatans and internet fraudsters who claim that       vaccines aren't safe are preying on the unfounded fears and       daily struggles of parents, and they are creating a public       health hazard that is entirely preventable.        It is important for those who have questions about       vaccines, especially parents, to speak with a reputable       health care provider. As with many topics, just because you       found it on the internet doesn't make it true.        The science is sound: Vaccines save lives--the lives of       those who receive vaccines and the lives of those who are too       young or vulnerable to be immunized.        Before I turn this over to Senator Murray, I want to add       that the National Childhood  [[Page S2510]]       Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 required the Department of Health       and Human Services to submit a report to Congress within 2       years after the legislation was signed into law.        The HELP Committee has two reports from the Department       submitted to Congress dated May 4, 1988, and July 21, 1989.        I would like to ask for unanimous consent that the reports       be submitted into the committee record so that they can be       more accessible to the public.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of my opening statement at the Senate Health Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   Managing Pain During the Opioid Crisis          The Senate Committee on Health, Education,       Labor and Pensions will please come to order. Senator Murray       and I will each have an opening statement, and then we will       introduce the witnesses. After the witnesses' testimony,       senators will each have 5 minutes of questions.        Dan, a constituent of mine who lives in Maryville,       Tennessee, recently wrote me about his wife, who has a rare       disease that causes her chronic pain. Dan is concerned       because it has become more difficult for her to access       painkillers. Dan wrote, ``She is not an abuser, and is doing       everything right. Now it's harder for her to get the medicine       she needs.''        Dan's wife is one out of 100 million Americans who,       according to a 2011 report by what was then the Institute of       Medicine, now the National Academy of Medicine, are living       with some pain--that is about 30 percent of Americans. 25       million of those have moderate or severe pain.        A new report released in 2018, from the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention, says that about 50 million Americans       have chronic pain, and nearly 20 million of those Americans       have high-impact chronic pain.        Here is the reality: we are engaged in a massive effort to       make dramatic reductions in the supply and use of opioids--      the most effective painkiller we have. But on the theory that       every action has an unintended consequence, we want to make       sure that as we deal with the opioid crisis, we keep in mind       those people that are hurting.        We are holding this hearing to better understand the causes       of pain, how we can improve care for patients with pain, and       where we are on developing new medicines and ways to treat       pain.        We know that pain is one of the most frequent reasons       people see a doctor, and, according to the Mayo Clinic, the       number of adults in the United States with pain is higher       than the number of people with diabetes, heart disease, and       cancer combined. These Americans need more effective ways       than opioids or other addictive painkillers to manage pain.       Opioids, which are commonly used to treat pain, can lead to       addiction and overdose. More than 70,000 Americans died from       drug overdoses last year, including prescription opioids,       making it the biggest public health crisis in our country.        Last year, Congress passed comprehensive opioid legislation       to combat this crisis, which President Trump called ``the       single largest bill to combat a drug crisis in the history of       our country.''        Our legislation included more than 70 ideas from 72       Senators, and eight committees in the House and five       Committees in the Senate that included: Reauthorizing       training programs for doctors and nurses who prescribe       treatments for pain; increasing access to behavioral and       mental health providers; and encouraging the use of blister       packs for opioids, such as a 3 or 7-day supply, and safe ways       of disposing unused drugs.        We also took steps to ensure our new law wouldn't make life       harder for patients with pain, but now we need to take the       next step to try to find new ways to help them: first--we       gave the National Institutes of Health more flexibility and       authority to spur research and development of new non-      addictive painkillers. We also asked the Food and Drug       Administration to provide guidance for those developing new       non-addictive painkillers to help get them to patients more       quickly. I'm pleased to see Commissioner Gottlieb's       announcement this morning that the agency is developing new       guidances on how FDA evaluates the risks and the benefits of       new opioid treatments for patients with pain and to help the       development of non-opioid treatments for pain.        Sam Quinones, a witness at one of our hearings, called new       non-addictive painkillers the ``holy grail'' to solving the       opioid crisis. We have backed up those new authorities with       substantial funding--most recently $500 million to help the       National Institutes of Health find a new nonaddictive       painkiller.        Second, we included provisions to encourage new pain       management strategies, such as physical therapy. Third, the       new law requires experts to study chronic pain and report to       the Director of the NIH how patients can better manage their       pain. And fourth, the new law requires the Secretary of       Health and Human Services to report the impact on pain       patients that Federal and State laws and regulations that       limit the length, quantity, or dosage of opioid       prescriptions.        Now that we have started to turn the train around and head       in a different direction on the use of opioids, everyone--      doctors, nurses, insurers, and patients--will need to think       about the different ways we should treat and manage pain.       There are other things the federal government is doing to       better understand what causes pain and how we treat and       manage it.        For example, the National Pain Strategy, developed by the       Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee, which       develops recommendations to prevent, treat, manage, and       research pain. Through the National Institute on Drug Abuse       and the National Institutes of Health's HEAL Initiative,       researchers are working to better understand pain and why       some people experience it differently than others. This will       help us find more ways to more effectively treat pain and       help get people the treatment they need.        For example--physical therapy or exercise may be the best       course of treatment for some kinds of back pain. It may also       help us understand why some people can take opioids to manage       their pain for years without becoming addicted, while others       more easily become addicted.        Today, I hope to hear about how close are we to having a       non-addictive painkiller, and how doctors and nurses can       better treat people with pain.                            ____________________
