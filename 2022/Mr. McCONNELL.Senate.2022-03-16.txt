 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning, Members of Congress  received an update on the situation in Ukraine directly from President  Zelenskyy. His presentation was powerful and heart-wrenching. It  reinforced our sympathy, our outrage, and our resolve.   President Zelenskyy's courage and leadership have earned the  attention and the admiration of the entire free world. He has marshaled  Ukraine's brave and defiant resistance against Russian invasion. He has  steeled the resolve of his people beyond what anybody expected and  offered the entire world a master class in leadership.   This morning, President Zelenskyy didn't mince words about what  Ukraine needs urgently to keep up the fight: more lethal capabilities  and heavier sanctions against Russia and especially the air defense  systems that we should have helped Ukraine get weeks ago. His people  face a long and difficult road ahead, and the entire world knows what  they are up against.   The scale of Russia's aggression wasn't just foreseeable; it was  foreseen. For 30 years, every step toward democracy and sovereignty in  Eastern Europe has tempted the wrath of revanchist autocrats like  Putin. That is why I have asked the Biden administration early and  often to demonstrate America's commitment to our allies and partners  most squarely in Russia's crosshairs.   Last June, 8 months before the Russian invasion, I urged the  President to ``provide serious, lethal support to Ukraine and other  vulnerable states on the front lines of Putin's aggressions''--8 months  ago. In December, I specifically called on President Biden to deploy  extra U.S. forces to reinforce NATO's eastern flank--last December. I  urged his administration to expedite and expand shipments of lethal aid  like anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons. But, as we know, a security  assistance package for Ukraine sat down at the White House for months  before being approved. Once approved, efforts to transfer the weapons  moved at the speed of bureaucracy. And the President waited until  February to order U.S. personnel to the frontlines.   The Biden administration had over a year to get this right. They had  a year to translate rhetorical support for NATO into leading real,  collective defense. But they took 5 months to even nominate an  ambassador to the alliance.   On the campaign trail, President Biden called Putin a ``KGB thug.''  He was right about that. But after 1 week in office, he announced an  agreement with the Kremlin to extend the New START treaty for up to 5  years, reducing our leverage to get a better deal that caps Putin's  nuclear ambitions.   As the threats to Ukraine gathered, whenever an opportunity to act  has presented itself, the Biden administration has hesitated until  political pressure became overwhelming or balked outright.   Since Russia's invasion began, the administration has publicly shot  down efforts from a NATO ally to get working aircraft to Ukrainian  pilots. Last  [[Page S1195]]  Monday, the White House scuttled a bipartisan congressional bill to end  normal trade relations with Russia, only to make a public show on  Friday of calling for exactly the same action.   At every step of the way--every step of the way--the self-deterred  White House has insisted its hesitation and restraint was aimed at  avoiding escalation, but at every step, Putin has escalated.   Now, 3 weeks into Putin's invasion, the reality on the ground is  evolving. It is harder now than it would have been a few months ago to  keep the pipeline of weapons and supplies and intelligence for  Ukraine's brave resistance open. Russia's air offensive in particular  is hitting a deadlier, more aggressive stride. But, as I have been  saying literally for months, it is not too late for the Biden  administration to do the right thing. So here is what President Biden  should be doing right now:   No. 1, he should use the money and authorities we have just provided  him to expand the scope of our lethal aid to Ukraine to include more  effective, longer range air defense capabilities. That means working  with NATO allies with urgency to get Ukrainian pilots more aircraft and  munitions and facilitating the transfer of weapons Ukraine's forces are  most familiar with, like air defense systems from countries with  stockpiles of Soviet legacy systems. President Zelenskyy specifically  pleaded for these air defense systems this morning--this morning.   No. 2, President Biden should deploy more U.S. forces to reinforce  NATO's eastern flank and use the new drawdown and loan guarantee  authorities to help harden the defenses of our frontline allies and  partners. Many of these partners are generously helping Ukraine, and we  should help them backfill their inventories with more modern American  capabilities that will improve NATO's interoperability and bolster  deterrence at the same time.    No. 3, on a trip to Europe next week, President Biden should go  beyond Brussels. He should go to countries like Poland, Romania, or  Lithuania to meet with NATO eastern flank allies. He should look beyond  NATO to deepen our diplomatic security cooperation with important  American partners like Finland and Sweden.   Finally, if President Biden wants the United States to lead our  allies by example and to keep pace with adversaries like Russia and  China, the place to start is with robust investments in our own defense  capabilities. The coming year's appropriations process is an  opportunity to finally--finally--show we are serious.   Vladimir Putin has proven to the world that he is willing to stoop  low in pursuit of power, and he has shown us exactly--exactly--how he  responds to weakness. We cannot afford to stay behind the curve.  America must lead and lead with strength.   A few minutes ago, President Zelenskyy reminded us that the United  States is, indeed, the leader of the free world, so it is time we acted  like it.    Mr. President, in 2018, we reestablished the Senate  NATO Observer Group. I ask for the following Republican Senators to  participate in the group: Tillis (cochair), Barrasso, Ernst, Rounds,  Rubio, and Hagerty.                            ____________________
