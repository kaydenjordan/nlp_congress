 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the 103rd  Airlift Wing of the Connecticut Air National Guard--the ``Flying  Yankees''--as they celebrate 100 years of dedicated service to the  State and our Nation.   The Flying Yankees are the 11th oldest Air National Guard unit in the  United States, including a squadron that has served more than 90 years  in military aviation. Operating from the Bradley Air National Guard  Base in East Granby, CT, the 103rd Airlift Wing provides tactical  airpower and mission support for the State and Nation. The unit carries  out this critical mission through highly qualified and proficient C-130  aircrew.   The 103rd Airlift Wing has a history that dates back to the earliest  years of military aviation, and the Flying Yankees have fought bravely  in numerous conflicts throughout the last century. From their efforts  in France during World War I, to their heroic service in the China- India-Burma theater of operations during World War II, the Flying  Yankees have a long history of valiantly serving our Nation both at  home and abroad. The unit's service continued through the Cold War and  more recent conflicts. The Flying Yankees innovate to meet the changing  needs of the State and the Nation, carrying on their great tradition of  dedicated service to this day.   For a century, the brave members of the 103rd Airlift Wing of the  Connecticut Air National Guard have embodied their motto--``faithful  and alert''--answering the call to service for both Connecticut and the  Nation. I applaud their determination and dedication to the vital  mission of defending our country and hope my colleagues will join me in  congratulating the Flying Yankees on this momentous occasion of their  100th anniversary.                            ____________________
