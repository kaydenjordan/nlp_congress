 Mr. President, the State of Georgia is mourning  legendary broadcast journalist Jovita Moore. Jovita was a trailblazer,  a great journalist, and an Atlanta icon. She began her career in  journalism in Memphis, TN, and Fayetteville, AR, before joining WSB-TV  in Atlanta in 1998. She became a full-time anchor at WSB-TV in 2012,  delivering Atlantans the news each afternoon and holding the powerful  to account.   Born in New York, Jovita earned a bachelor of arts degree from  Bennington College in Bennington, VT, before earning a master of  science degree in broadcast journalism from Columbia University's  Graduate School of Journalism in New York City.   Jovita's career helped blaze the trail for other women and those from  diverse backgrounds in journalism. She was a member of the Atlanta  Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Black  Journalists and won multiple Emmy awards throughout her time at WSB-TV.  Her excellence and example have undoubtedly inspired countless others  to follow in her footsteps. In 2017, Jovita was inducted into The  National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Southeast Chapter's  Silver Circle, one of its most prestigious career awards.   Jovita gave back to the community, taking time out of her busy  schedule to mentor others and help them realize their true potential.  She and her family would help deliver meals during the holidays,  demonstrating commitment to helping those in need.   Jovita's spirit, optimism, and kindness radiated in everything she  did. When she was diagnosed with glioblastoma earlier this year, the  city of Atlanta and the entire Nation rallied around Jovita, just as  she had for them throughout her career. She never gave up hope, using  her diagnosis to spread awareness and encourage others to visit the  doctor, stay vigilant, and get regular screenings. Jovita put her  community first. Jovita Moore was a loving mother, daughter, and  friend. She said her children were her life's most important  accomplishments.   I thank my colleagues in the U.S. Senate for joining me in honoring  the life and legacy of Jovita Moore and sending our deepest condolences  to her children--Lauren, Shelby, and Joshua--to her mother, family, and  friends and the entire WSB-TV family. May her memory be a  blessing.                            ____________________
