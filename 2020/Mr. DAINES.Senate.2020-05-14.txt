 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Darcy Schindler of Granite County for his tremendous  efforts to support his community during the ongoing coronavirus  pandemic.   Darcy has been a committed and passionate science teacher over the  past 27 years. He joined the teaching ranks at Drummond High School 20  years ago, where he continues to mentor and encourage countless  students.   When the coronavirus pandemic began spreading across the country,  Darcy was hearing stories from his friends working in the medical and  dental fields, that they were having a tough time finding protective  masks.   Darcy decided to take action and began volunteering his time and  resources to create protective masks for our healthcare heroes and  first responders on the frontlines of this ongoing coronavirus pandemic  in Montana.   With the school's permission, Darcy used the school's 3D printer to  produce the protective masks. With support from those in the community,  along with his own time and resources, Darcy has shipped well over 100  masks across Montana. He has not taken any payments for his shipments.  He only asks that they instead make a donation to the Drummond Schools  Science Fund to help his students.   It is my honor to recognize Darcy Schindler for his efforts to  support our healthcare heroes and our first responders. His  selflessness and commitment to serve others is an extraordinary example  of how Montanans are stepping up in the face of this pandemic to help  one another. I thank Darcy Schindler for his efforts to help the  Drummond community and communities all across Montana.                            ____________________
