 Mr. President, I join my senior colleague to rise  today in acknowledgement of the ending of an era in Rhode Island with  the retirement of Johnston Police Chief Richard Tamburini next month. I  want to thank Chief Tamburini for his five decades of service and  community leadership. Prior to beginning a career in law enforcement,  Chief Tamburini served honorably in the U.S. Army's 72nd Signal  Battalion. The chief worked his way up the ranks of the Providence  Police Department over nearly three decades, including a stint as part  of a legendary organized crime investigative team along with then- detective and future fellow chief, Vincent Vespia. Tamburini would  eventually become deputy chief of police in Providence prior to his  retirement from the Department.   Chief Tamburini has led the Johnston Police Department for 25 years.  His tenure as chief has been marked by an increase in community  engagement through bicycle patrols, and through the Walk With Cops and  Johnston Police Explorers programs. The chief's leadership and  community-minded efforts have earned him a place in the  [[Page S4630]]  prestigious Rhode Island Criminal Justice Hall of Fame.   As Chief Tamburini told the Johnston Sunrise last year, trust between  a police department and the community it serves is the key to effective  law enforcement. He said at the time:         I really want to focus on that [trust], because as chief of       police it's important to me that no matter what we do with       the community, [we need] a strong relationship and a level of       trust. I think that carries through to the rest the       department, so they can be assured of that.    Today, we pay tribute to a great Rhode Islander, my friend, Chief  Richard Tamburini. I am grateful for his contributions to Rhode Island  and wish him many years of well-deserved rest and relaxation with his  family and friends. Godspeed.                            ____________________
