 Madam Speaker, as we consider the T-HUD appropriations  bill, I stand here to remind this legislative body of the 3 of nearly  3,000 community funding projects that were rejected from this bill in  July, including the LGBTQ Center of Reading in my home community.   The very sad reality can be boiled down to this: These organizations  were rejected by the GOP-led House simply because they had LGBTQ in  their names.   Let's be clear, these services provide lifesaving services like food  and shelter for those who have been rejected from their homes because  of whom they love. They equip our vulnerable populations with the tools  they need for future success--financial literacy, professional resumes,  and life skills, among many other things.   Unfortunately, the Republicans who pulled this funding are likely  hopeful that the American people will not see this bigoted and targeted  approach for what it is, but what we do here today does send a very  clear message to our LGBTQ community. It is a message that says that  too many of my colleagues in Congress don't want to support these vital  community investments simply because of who they serve. We owe it to  the American people to do better and to serve everyone.   Madam Speaker, for my daughter Molly, I ask those who are affected by  this to not accept this bigotry and discrimination any longer.
