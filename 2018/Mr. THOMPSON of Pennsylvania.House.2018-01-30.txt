 Mr. Speaker, I rise today just hours  before our 45th President, Donald Trump, will deliver his first State  of the Union Address.   Members of Congress and guests will fill this Chamber tonight to hear  the President speak about a host of issues impacting America, from  economic growth to trade deals and infrastructure investments, to  immigration reform. I look forward to hearing the President speak about  the administration's successes to date and the plans for the future.   The President and the First Lady, Melania Trump, have invited 15  guests to attend the speech tonight, including veterans, law  enforcement officers, first responders, and families who have lost  loved ones in the fight against the MS-13 street gang. All the guests  in this Chamber tonight, invited by Members of both parties, represent  a wide cross section of America, and I know that all have hope that our  greatest days truly do lie ahead.   Just weeks ago, the House passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for the  American people to get our economy moving again. In February, Americans  will see and are beginning to see, today, more money in their  paychecks. We delivered a fairer, simpler, pro-family Tax Code to give  more money back to taxpayers and spur economic growth.   As the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is implemented, we are hearing story  after story about how this is already making a difference in millions  of people's lives across the country. We have already seen positive  results, and we look forward to hearing more from President Trump  tonight on his vision for a safe, strong, and proud America.   Hundreds of companies across the Nation are sharing the benefit of  the GOP tax reform with their workers. They are raising wages, awarding  bonuses, and increasing 401(k) matching contributions. I want to  highlight just some of the companies in the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania that are investing in their employees:   1st Summit Bank in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, provided a $1,000 bonus  to all full-time employees on top of their 2017 year-end bonuses,  raised its salary ranges, and increased its charitable giving budget by  10 percent.   AccuWeather of State College in my Fifth Congressional District  provided special year-end bonuses to all employees over and above other  compensation benefits and year-end bonuses to which employees may be  entitled. Company leaders said: ``The bonuses are possible due to the  company's robust financial performance in 2017 and strong confidence in  the growing U.S. and global economy now that the tax bill has passed.''   Fulton Financial in Lancaster raised its base wage to $12 per hour,  awarded bonuses for its 3,700 employees, and is increasing charitable  contributions by $2 million.   Kish Bancorp in Belleville awarded $500 bonuses to part-time  employees, $1,000 bonuses to full-time employees, is adding $10 million  to capital expenditures over the next 3 years, and will raise their  base wage.   This is just a fraction of what is happening in the Commonwealth and  in States across the Nation. The benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  are just beginning to be seen, and I have great faith that the benefits  will just continue to grow for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, tonight I know the President will be talking about his  record-setting accomplishments in his first year, how the policies of  his administration are lifting all Americans and setting a foundation  for building a safe, strong, and proud America. From jobs and the  economy to his $1 trillion plan for rebuilding our depleted  infrastructure, to important immigration reforms, I know that he will  cover a lot of ground tonight and will speak from the heart.   I also hope to hear about our national security, from rebuilding our  military to the ongoing efforts to defeat terrorists around the world  who try to harm America and Americans.   I know the President's State of the Union Address will resonate with  our American values and unite us with patriotism and greater  opportunities. I welcome the President tonight to this Chamber, as well  as the First Lady and all the guests, and I look forward to hearing his  important message for the future of our country.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, Sunday marked 32 years  since the space shuttle Challenger disaster.   On January 28, 1986, NASA launched the 10th flight of the space  shuttle Challenger, and it broke apart 73 seconds into its flight,  killing all seven crew members on board. It was devastating for those  watching at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, for those viewing at home,  and for our Nation as a whole.   I rise today to remember the Challenger's dedicated crew:   Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Christa  McAuliffe, Gregory Jarvis, and Judith Resnick.   As President Reagan said in a televised address 32 years ago: ``We  will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as  they prepared for their journey and waved good-bye and `slipped the  surly bonds of Earth' to `touch the face of God.'''   Madam Speaker, these crew members had a passion for exploration. They  inspired children around the world who dreamed of going to space.  Through encouraging STEM study--science, technology, engineering, and  math--we can continue to preserve their legacy and inspire another  generation of explorers.                            ____________________
