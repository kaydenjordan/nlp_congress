 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of Chairman Meeks'  amendment, which would clarify and advance the administration's January  decision to suspend offensive support for the Saudi-led coalition's  operations in Yemen.   The crisis in Yemen continues to devastate innocent civilians who  suffer at the hands of Houthi assaults, coalition airstrikes, and a de  facto blockade that hinders the transit of necessary goods, like food,  fuel, and medicine.   The war in Yemen will not be solved by military operations. The  parties must commit to political negotiations to end this conflict. But  as military operations continue, it is critical that the United States  does not play a role in supporting further civilian bloodshed.   This amendment requires the Department of State and Department of  Defense to ascertain whether any coalition strikes resulted in civilian  casualties and, in turn, suspend U.S. support and maintenance to those  units.   The House voted overwhelmingly to end U.S. support for the Saudi  coalition's offensive, and it is imperative that we follow through on  that promise while ensuring that we protect the vital interests of the  United States.   We cannot allow human suffering in Yemen to continue unabated.  Children are starving. COVID is raging. Enough is enough.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Meeks for his leadership, and I urge  support for this amendment.
