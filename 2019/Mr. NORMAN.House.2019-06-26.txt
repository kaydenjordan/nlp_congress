 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of America's  finest servicemen, Colonel Frank Childress.   Colonel Childress exemplifies the honor and fortitude of the men and  women who make up our armed services. Colonel Childress was placed on  an assignment in the Pentagon in 2001 and was set to arrive in  Washington, D.C. on September 6.   Destiny arrived in a humble disguise when a clerical error delayed  his household goods from being delivered on time. He was offered the  choice of a new delivery date, either September 10 or September 11. He  chose September 11.   The Colonel lived a mile away and heard when the plane crashed into  the Pentagon. He turned on his TV and saw the carnage that took place  in New York and immediately headed for the Pentagon to help in any way  possible. In a time of crisis and panic, Colonel Childress ran toward  danger when many would have fled.   Among the thousands who died that day, Colonel Childress survived.  Twenty-six of his fellow servicemen and -women were killed in the very  office he would have been working in that day.   At first, he was nearly consumed by survivor's guilt, but instead of  surrendering, he joined a Bible study group for Pentagon employees.  Once again, he chose not to run and instead face reality through his  strength and faith in God who led him through those dark and difficult  days that he would face ahead.  [[Page H5174]]    In his immediate response to the 9/11 attacks and his fortitude in  dealing with the aftermath, Colonel Childress is a paragon of bravery.  He exemplifies the words of Winston Churchill before Britain was about  to be under siege by Germany when Prime Minister Churchill said:         There will be a time when doing your best is not good       enough. We must do what is required.    Colonel Childress did what was required in the service to freedom.  His actions set the example that all Americans can share pride in and  follow.                            ____________________
