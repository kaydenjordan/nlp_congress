 Madam Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to  the city of Florence for being awarded the 2023 Great American Main  Street Award by Main Street America, an award that hasn't been given to  another South Carolina city for 20 years.   This is such a well-deserved recognition of the city of Florence's  dedication to preserving its history and culture and maintaining a  thriving community.   Downtown Florence is booming with restaurants and local businesses,  residential growth, and community involvement, and I am thrilled that  the city has received this national recognition of their dedicated work  to create such a great place to live.   I am looking forward to seeing the continued success of the city of  Florence, as it is such a vital part of the Pee Dee region of our  State.                            ____________________
