 Mr. Speaker, on the third day of this reckless  government shutdown, I rise to urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to find common ground and end this gridlock.   Families in Arizona and America are hurting. It is past time for  Congress to come together to boost our military. We must reauthorize  funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, community health  centers, and the Special Diabetes Program for Tribal communities, and  many others.   Mr. Speaker, we can't go back to business as usual and continue to  fund our military a few weeks at a time. Secretary Mattis and our  military leaders have been clear about the dire impacts of continuing  resolutions on our national security time and time again throughout  this year.   We are facing increasing global threats. We cannot undermine our  defense leaders and our troops by refusing to work together. We are  here to solve problems. For our brave servicemembers and families  across our communities, let's get the job done.                            ____________________
