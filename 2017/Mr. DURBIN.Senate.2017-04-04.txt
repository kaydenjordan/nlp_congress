 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, there is a poem that I recall, and it  goes like this:       When I was going up the stair,      I met a man who wasn't there.      He wasn't there again today.      I wish that man would go away.    I thought about that poem when I listened to the majority leader's  speech about how cooperative he has been when it comes to Supreme Court  nominations. The name he forgot to mention was Merrick Garland--Merrick  Garland, who was nominated by President Obama to fill the vacancy of  Justice Antonin Scalia; Merrick Garland, the only Presidential nominee  to the Supreme Court in the history of the U.S. Senate to be denied a  hearing and a vote; Merrick Garland, about whom Senator McConnell said:  I will not only refuse to give him a hearing and a vote, I refuse to  even see him; Merrick Garland, who was found unanimously ``well  qualified'' by the American Bar Association; Merrick Garland, the  person who received bipartisan support for appointment to the DC  Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land.   So when the majority leader comes to the floor to talk about how  cooperative he has been with previous Presidents when it comes to  Supreme Court nominees, he conveniently omits the most obvious reason  for our problems this week: the unilateral decision by the majority  leader to preclude any vote on Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy of  Justice Scalia.   I know Judge Garland. I have met with him several times. He is a  balanced, moderate, experienced jurist who should be on the U.S.  Supreme Court. We should not be entertaining Neil Gorsuch this week; we  ought to be celebrating the first anniversary of Merrick Garland's  service on the U.S. Supreme Court. The reason we are not is that  Senator McConnell and the Senate Republicans refused us that  opportunity. They said: No, you cannot vote on that.   Remember their logic? The logic was: Wait a minute. This is the last  year of President Obama's Presidency. Why should he be able to fill a  vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court when we have an election coming soon?   That is an interesting argument. There are two things I am troubled  with.   I do believe President Obama was elected for 4 years in his second  term, not for 3, which meant he had authority in the fourth year, as he  did in the third year.   Secondly, the Republican argument ignores history. It ignores the  obvious history when we had a situation with President Ronald Reagan,  in his last year in office, with regard to a vacancy on the U.S.  Supreme Court. There were Democrats in charge of the Senate and  Democrats in charge of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and President  Ronald Reagan, a lameduck President in his last year, nominated Anthony  Kennedy to serve on the Court. He sent the name to the Democratic  Senate, and there was a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee  and a vote that sent him to the Court.   You never hear that story from Senator McConnell. It is because it  does not fit into his playbook as to why he would wait for a year and  refuse to give Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote. The reasoning is  obvious: Clearly he was banking on the possibility that the electorate  would choose a Republican President--and that is what happened--so that  a Republican President--in this case, Donald Trump--could fill the  vacancy, not Barack Obama.   So when I hear the speeches on the floor by Senator McConnell about  his bipartisan cooperation, he leaves out an important chapter--the  last chapter, the one that brought us to this moment in the Senate.   I look at the situation before us today, and it is a sad situation  for the Senate--sad in that we have reached the point in which a  Supreme Court nomination has become so political, more so than at any  time in history.   Where did the name ``Neil Gorsuch'' come from for the Supreme Court?  It came from a list that was prepared by two organizations: the  Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. These are both  Republican advocacy groups who represent special interests and are  funded by special interests. They came up with the names and gave them  to Presidential candidate Donald Trump. It was a list of 21 names. He  issued them twice--in March and in September of the last campaign  year--and Neil Gorsuch's name was on the list.   The Federalist Society was created in 1982. Nominally, it is an  organization that is committed to originalism.  [[Page S2181]]  In other words, it looks to the clear meaning of the Constitution, what  the Founding Fathers meant. They say that over and over again: Just  look to the Constitution and read it, and then we will know what we  should do. That was in a speech that was given by Edwin Meese, the  then-Attorney General in 1985, who explained the Federalist Society's  credo.   On its face, it sounds at least arguably defensible that there would  be an organization that is so committed to the Constitution that it  wants Supreme Court nominees who will follow it as literally as  possible. Yet, as Justice William Brennan on the Supreme Court said, if  they think they can find in those musty volumes from back in the 18th  century all of the answers to all of the questions on the issues we  face today--here is what he called it--that is arrogance posing as  humility.   Yet that is what they said the Federalist Society was all about. If  that were all the Federalist Society were about, then I guess one could  argue that they ought to have their day in court, their day in choosing  someone for the Supreme Court, but it is more than that. When you look  at those who finance the Federalist Society--and it is a short list  because they refuse to disclose all their donors--you see the classic  names of Republican support: the Koch brothers, the Mercer family, the  Richard Mellon Scaife family foundation, the ones who pop up over and  over again. Why would these organizations be so determined to pick the  next nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court? It is because  there is so much at stake.   In a Judiciary Committee hearing, my colleague Sheldon Whitehouse  went through the box score when it came to the Supreme Court and how  they ruled when given a choice between special interests and corporate  elites versus average workers and consumers and families. As Senator  Whitehouse pointed out graphically, in detail, overwhelmingly, this  Court has ruled for the special interests. Sixty-nine percent of the  Roberts' Court's rulings are in favor of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's  position on issues, according to one study.   Why would a special interest organization like the Federalist Society  care? It wants to keep a good thing going, from its point of view. That  is why this is a different Supreme Court nominee.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, will the Senator from Oregon yield for a  question without yielding the floor?    As I recall, there was a moment in 1988, in the last year  of President Reagan's Presidency, when there was a vacancy on the  Supreme Court. This Republican President was in his last year--his so- called lameduck year, as many Republicans have now characterized it. At  that time, the Senate was in the control of the Democratic Party. Of  course, the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe, was chaired by Joe  Biden at that time in 1988.   President Reagan sent the name ``Anthony Kennedy'' to the Senate to  fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court and the Democratic Senate held  a hearing and a vote and sent Anthony Kennedy to serve on the U.S.  Supreme Court, where he continues to serve. So those who argue on the  other side that everybody is doing it, that ``you would do the same  thing, if you could'' and that sort of thing, I believe that is belied  by the history--the recent history--when the Democrats were in the  majority in this Chamber.   So the Senator from Oregon is saying that this is not the only time  in history this has occurred, and Senator McConnell ignored this and  decided not to even have a hearing or vote on Merrick Garland-- something that has never been done in the history of the Senate, which  brings us to this moment. Is that the point the Senator is making?    I would ask the Senator from Oregon, as well, through the  Chair, in this situation where Senator McConnell, as the Republican  Senate leader, has exercised his so-called nuclear option to stop  Merrick Garland, President Obama's choice, from filling the vacancy on  the Supreme Court, does the Senator from Oregon believe, as I do, that  this is part of a concerted effort by the Republicans to take control  of the Federal judiciary, the fact that we left the end of the last  year with 30 Federal judicial nominees on the Senate calendar, nominees  who had received a bipartisan vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee?  They were left unresolved, unvoted on, when the Senate went out of  session. Does the Senator from Oregon see as I do, a pattern of conduct  on the Republican part when it comes to filling the courts?     Is the Senator from Oregon aware of the fact that  President Trump, during his campaign, released the list of 21 names of  potential nominees for the Supreme Court, and then thanked the  Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation for preparing that list?  The Federalist Society--a Republican advocacy group here in Washington,  DC--now brags that every member of the Supreme Court appointed by a  Republican President has either been a member of or cleared by the  Federalist Society before they took the bench.    I wonder if the Senator from Oregon will yield for  another question through the Chair.   I ask, when it comes to the Federalist Society--of course, like so  many of these dark money organizations, they refuse to fully disclose  their donors. They say it is to protect their identity from harassment.  It is also protecting the American people from the truth.   Three that we do know have been actively involved would be the Koch  brothers--a well-known group supporting Republican candidates--the  Richard Mellon Scaife family foundation, as well as the Mercer family,  now merging with millions and millions of dollars supporting these  Republican causes.   I ask the Senator: Is it a leap of faith for me to think that they  would not be working so hard to put someone on the Court, unless they  felt that person was going to rule along the lines that they believed?    I ask the Senator from Oregon through the Chair again:  During the course of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator  Sheldon Whitehouse raised this question about dark money with Neil  Gorsuch, the nominee for the Supreme Court, and asked if he was aware  of the fact that millions were currently being spent on ad campaigns  and mail campaigns across the United States to promote his nomination-- and whether Neil Gorsuch felt that the source of this money should be  disclosed. As far as we could bring the judge on this subject, he said:  Well, someone should ask about where the money is coming from. That, I  guess, is a pretty bold statement because many Republicans don't  believe that it is fair to even ask where the money is coming from.   There was a time when even the Senate majority leader used to say: I  am not going to complain about the amount of money. I just want to make  sure it is all disclosed. Well, he is completely vacating that  position. He doesn't want disclosure. He doesn't want the American  people to know where the money is coming from.   I don't know if the Senator from Oregon noticed the television  advertising here in Washington, where there is a lot on an issue like  this before us. But the television screens--at least for those morning  talk shows--were inundated with advertising in favor of Neil Gorsuch  from groups like the 45 Committee, Judicial Justice Committee. They  make up these names right and left.   I ask the Senator: When it comes to decisions like Citizens United,  does  [[Page S2287]]  that give us clear evidence of why the Republicans are fighting so hard  to make sure they put the right person on the Supreme Court?    I ask the Senator from Oregon if he will further yield.   Neil Gorsuch, the judge from the Tenth Circuit who has been nominated  for the Supreme Court, has had some noteworthy opinions. One was the  Hobby Lobby case. It is an interesting parallel between Hobby Lobby and  Citizens United. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court said: We believe  that money is speech. And we believe that the protections of the First  Amendment extend to corporations who should be treated like persons  when it comes to their right of free speech.   In the Hobby Lobby case, Neil Gorsuch, who is headed for the Supreme  Court, reached a parallel decision, giving good credibility to the  argument that the Republicans know why they are pushing for this man to  go to the Court because this was a case where the Hobby Lobby company,  which has stores across the United States owned by the Green family-- the Green family had their own special personal religious beliefs when  it came to family planning and birth control. So they refused to  provide for their 13,000 employees across the United States any health  insurance plan that provided for methods of birth control, which they  found personally offensive. They said that this was a corporate  position they were taking--a company position.   So it was Neil Gorsuch, with others on the Tenth Circuit Court, who  decided to expand the definition of personhood--again to include  closely held corporations like Hobby Lobby. The net result was that the  owners--the Green family--were able to say: We are going to stand up  for our religious beliefs when it comes to family planning. And to say  to 13,000 employees that those employees' personal beliefs--the  religious beliefs of each employee--really made no difference from the  viewpoint of Judge Gorsuch. Once the owners of the company had decided  what was good, principled religious conduct, they could impose that on  their employees.   So there is a parallel here where Citizens United said a corporation  is a person. Judge Gorsuch and Hobby Lobby said that a closely held  corporation is a person. And in the Citizens United case, he said this  person--corporation person--has the right of free speech. In the case  of Hobby Lobby, Judge Gorsuch said this corporation has the right of  freedom of religion to exert their sincerely held religious beliefs.   So I say to the Senator from Oregon: It is clear to me that they  tested Judge Gorsuch in the Tenth Circuit, and he came out ahead when  it came to the basic principle that corporations should somehow be  treated as persons when it comes to rights under the Constitution. That  to me is hard to imagine.   I just can't fathom how they could stretch the meaning of person to  include corporations when it doesn't say so expressly in any of the  statutes that were referenced here. I haven't seen a lot of  corporations pleading guilty and being sent to prison. It doesn't  happen much.   So my question to the Senator from Oregon is, when it comes to the  clearance of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court seat--this open seat on  the Supreme Court--whether they found the Hobby Lobby decision  something that said to them: This man would believe in Citizens United  had he been on the Court at the same time.    If the Senator from Oregon will yield further, when I  started trying to find out the source of the money for these television  ads that support Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, I went to  something--the 45 Committee, I mentioned to you. I had never heard of  it before. I looked it up. There was a committee that sounds just like  this. It is hard to keep track of them. The largest donor by far in  terms of money was Sheldon Adelson, a man out of Las Vegas who has  become rather celebrated, if not notorious, for putting millions of  dollars into those political efforts on behalf of candidates from the  right--some say from the extreme right.   I would also ask the Senator from Oregon if, during the course of his  review of Judge Gorsuch's record, he came across the TransAm Trucking  case, which was really explored at length in the Senate Judiciary  Committee. Many of us felt this was such a clear definition of the  values of Neil Gorsuch, who tends to rule on the side of big business  and corporate elites over and over again.  [[Page S2288]]    The case involved a truck driver who was driving near Chicago on  Interstate 88 in January a few years ago during a bitterly cold period  of time. He had trouble with his trailer. He pulled it off to the side  of the road and realized the brakes on the trailer were frozen. So he  got on his cell phone and he called his dispatcher, and his dispatcher  said: Whatever you do, stay with that truck and trailer. The repairman  is on the way.   So he waited a while. No one showed up. He fell asleep. By the time  he woke up to a phone call from a member of his family, his legs were  numb and he was having trouble breathing. It turned out there was no  heater in the cab of the truck. So there he was, facing hypothermia and  freezing in his truck. Again, the dispatcher told him: Stay there.  Don't leave the truck.   He decided that the idea of dragging this trailer down the interstate  was dangerous and the idea of staying in this truck could threaten his  own life, so he made what I consider to be a reasonable decision: He  unhitched the trailer, took the truck to the gas station, filled it  with gas, warmed up, and came back to the trailer. For that conduct, he  was fired by TransAm Trucking. Because he was fired, he was blackballed  from ever driving another truck.   This man, whom I happened to meet in my office a few weeks ago,  Alphonse Maddin, then did not know which way to turn. He couldn't make  a living. He was a hard-working fellow out of Detroit.   Somebody said: You can go to the Department of Labor, and you can  file a complaint for unfair dismissal.   I see the Senator has a photograph of Mr. Maddin there.   He told me he went to the Department of Labor. They handed him the  form. With a ballpoint pen, he filled it in as to what happened to him,  protesting this dismissal and firing. He said he was shocked a few  months later to get a letter in the mail that said: You win. You are  right. They shouldn't have fired you.   Well, he thought that was a pretty good thing and that he would get  some backpay out of it. But then the appeals started, and it went in  the Federal court system. By the time it got to the Tenth Circuit,  where Judge Neil Gorsuch sat, seven different court judges and  administrative judges had considered the case of Alphonse Maddin as to  whether it was fair to fire him under these circumstances. Only one  judge out of the seven said it was the right thing to do--Neil Gorsuch,  the man who aspires to be on the Supreme Court.   One of my colleagues--and I think it was Senator Franken--said to  Judge Gorsuch: What would you have done if you were sitting in that  truck? What would you have done if you faced freezing to death or  dragging a disabled trailer out on a busy interstate, endangering the  lives of others?   Judge Gorsuch replied: I never really thought about it.   He never really thought about it. To me, that really gets to the  heart of what we are talking about here. He thought about it enough to  rule against that truck driver who faced that terrible choice in his  life, but he did not think for a moment what a reasonable, ordinary man  would do under the circumstances. He reduced the situation to the  absurd and decided to rule for the trucking company, for the  corporation.   When you consider that this Roberts Supreme Court has ruled on the  corporate side, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce side, 69 percent of the  time, it is pretty clear why they have this fond feeling for Neil  Gorsuch as the next Supreme Court Justice.   Does the Senator from Oregon see the linkage here between what the  Republicans are looking for in a Supreme Court nominee and what they  would find in this TransAm Trucking decision?    I thank the Senator from Oregon for yielding for  questions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 850         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20       U.S.C. 1002(a)(2)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking clause (i) and       inserting the following:        ``(i) in the case of a graduate medical school located       outside the United States--         ``(I) at least 60 percent of those enrolled in, and at       least 60 percent of the graduates of, the graduate medical       school outside the United States were not persons described       in section 484(a)(5) in the year preceding the year for which       a student is seeking a loan under part D of title IV; and        ``(II) at least 75 percent of the individuals who were       students or graduates of the graduate medical school outside       the United States or Canada (both nationals of the United       States and others) taking the examinations administered by       the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates       received a passing score in the year preceding the year for       which a student is seeking a loan under part D of title       IV;''; and         (2) in subparagraph (B)(iii), by adding at the end the       following:         ``(V) Expiration of authority.--The authority of a graduate       medical school described in subclause (I) to qualify for       participation in the loan programs under part D of title IV       pursuant to this clause shall expire beginning on the first       July 1 following the date of enactment of the Foreign Medical       School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017.''.       SEC. 5. LOSS OF ELIGIBILITY.         If a graduate medical school loses eligibility to       participate in the loan programs under part D of title IV of       the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.)       due to the enactment of the amendments made by section 4,       then a student enrolled at such graduate medical school on or       before the date of enactment of this Act may, notwithstanding       such loss of eligibility, continue to be eligible to receive       a loan under such part D while attending such graduate       medical school in which the student was enrolled upon the       date of enactment of this Act, subject to the student       continuing to meet all applicable requirements for       satisfactory academic progress, until the earliest of--        (1) withdrawal by the student from the graduate medical       school;        (2) completion of the program of study by the student at       the graduate medical school; or        (3) the fourth June 30 after such loss of eligibility.                                  ______    Mr. President, I ask for a clarification. Is the  remaining 17 or 18 minutes equally divided?    Mr. President, I just wanted to get more specific. I am  not questioning what the Senator asked for.   Do we have 9 minutes each or 8 minutes each?    So will I.   Mr. President, I defer to the chairman of the committee if he would  like to speak first.    Mr. President, for 3 straight days, the Senate Republican  leader has come to the floor and has given us a history of Presidential  nominations to the Supreme Court, but clearly an investigation is  necessary. There must have been a hacking into his computer because he  can't print the name ``Merrick Garland'' to include in his speech. The  Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, has failed to mention  that name because that name is the reason we are in this spot today.   When Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, President Obama exercised  his constitutional responsibility to send a nominee to the Senate to  fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. For the first time in the  history of the Senate--for the first time ever--this Republican-led  Senate refused to give this nominee a hearing and a vote. It had  never--underline the word ``never''--happened before.   Was the reason that he was unqualified? Of course not: he was  unanimously ``well qualified,'' serving on the DC Circuit Court. The  reason was stated clearly by Senator McConnell: We are going to place a  bet that the next President will be a Republican, and we will let them  fill this vacancy.   When the Republicans come to the floor, as they have this morning  talking about the politicization of this process, the reason we are  here, when we should be celebrating the 1-year anniversary of Merrick  Garland on the Supreme Court, is because they kept that position vacant  so it could be filled by a Republican President. That is exactly why we  are here today.   This notion that it is somehow fanciful that the choice of Neil  Gorsuch was made by outside groups is belied by the very words of the  President himself, who thanked the Federalist Society and the Heritage  Foundation--two special interest, Republican organizations--for giving  him a list of nominees for the Supreme Court. It was very open and  public, and there was gratitude--political gratitude--that they came up  with the name Neil Gorsuch. That is a fact.   When we look at the history that has led us to this moment, the  Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, has to accept what is  clear. In the history of the United States of America, until Senator  McConnell's days under President Obama, exactly 68 nominees had been  filibustered. Under Senator McConnell and the Republicans, 79 nominees  of President Obama's were filibustered. It was an abuse of the  filibuster never seen before in the history of our Nation, and it was  that abuse of the filibuster and statements made that they would leave  vacancies on critical courts, like the DC Court of Appeals, there  forever and ever amen, that led to the decision 4 years ago to say that  we would employ a change in the rules so we could finally fill these  court positions--finally break the filibuster death grip--which Senator  McConnell brought to this Chamber in a way never before seen in  history.   So the Senator from Kentucky has made history. He comes to the floor  every day and tells us history. He made history in the number of  filibusters he  [[Page S2387]]  used on this floor. He made history in denying a Presidential nominee  the opportunity for a hearing and a vote, which had never--never-- happened before in the history of the United States. Talk about  partisanship.   When it comes to Judge Gorsuch, I read his cases. I sat through the  hearings. I was in the Senate Judiciary Committee. We took a measure of  the man. He was careful to avoid any question that he could when it  came to his position on cases and issues and values, and that is not  unusual. Supreme Court nominees do that.   So we tried to look at his cases. What do the cases that he decided  reveal about the man? Two or three cases came right to the front. The  first involved the sad story of a frozen truckdriver on Interstate 88  outside of Chicago in January a few years back. It was 14 degrees below  zero, and the brakes on his trailer froze. He pulled to the side of the  road, called his dispatcher who said: Stay with the truck. We are  sending somebody. Hours passed. He was going through hypothermia. He  was freezing. He called the dispatcher and said: I have to do  something. He said: You either drive this disabled truck out on the  interstate and take your best chances or you stick with the truck. He  decided to unhitch the trailer and drive to a gas station, gas up and  warm up, and come back. For that he was fired.   Seven judges looked at that case to decide whether it was fair to  fire Alphonse Maddin. Six of the judges said: No, he did the right  thing. One judge said: I rule for the trucking company that fired him-- Neil Gorsuch, the nominee for the Supreme Court.   In the Hobby Lobby case, the decision was basic, who should decide  the healthcare of thousands of workers. Well, the Green family who owns  Hobby Lobby said: Our religious beliefs should dominate. We should  decide family planning and birth control for our employees and their  health insurance. Judge Gorsuch said: That is right because they own a  corporation, and a corporation is a person, and as a corporation, they  can have sincere religious beliefs. It was a choice between a corporate  ownership of a family and 13,000 employees and their own personal  religious rights, and Judge Gorsuch ruled for the corporation.   Kansas State University. A Kansas State University professor, Grace  Hwang, after working there for many years, was diagnosed with cancer  and had to go through a bone marrow transplant. She took 6 months off.  Then, when she was called back to work, she called the university and  said: I understand there is an influenza outbreak on campus, and I am  afraid, after having just had a bone marrow transplant, to be exposed  to influenza at this point. They said: You either come back and teach  or you are fired. She didn't come back. They fired her. It was Judge  Gorsuch who said their employer was right; Kansas State University was  right.   Those are insights into the values of a man who wants a lifetime  appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, the highest Court in the land.  The questions we have raised about his judgment and his values go to  the heart of who we are and what we want to be. Do we want the Supreme  Court to continue to be a voice for the corporations, the corporate  elite, and employers? Do we want to exclude the opportunities of common  people like that truckdriver, Al Maddin, to have his day in court and  be treated fairly? That is what it comes down to. It is a fundamental  question of fairness and justice.   I am sorry, because I love the Senate and I have spent a good part of  my life here, that we have reached this moment. But it is this effort  to fill the courts of this Nation with Republican appointments, even at  the expense of violating Senate traditions that are over 100 years old,  that has brought us to this moment.   As someone said, the nuclear option was used by Senator McConnell  when he stopped Merrick Garland. What we are facing today is the  fallout.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
