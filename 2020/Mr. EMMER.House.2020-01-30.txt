 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Liberian  community in Minnesota and throughout the United States, as they  celebrate passage of the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act.  This act provides a lifeline to certainty for Liberians around the  country, bringing relief and clarity to so many families and  communities throughout my district and home State.   Adoption of this important legislation is credited to the hard work  of the many advocates who lived in a constant state of limbo and under  the threat of the unknown for many years. Thank you to all our  community members who banded together to advocate for our Liberian  American friends and neighbors.   I am pleased that Congress, the administration, and President Trump  have finally provided our Liberian Americans, our neighbors, and our  friends, the clarity and protection they deserve.                            ____________________
