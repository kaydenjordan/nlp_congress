 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the three most important words of our  Constitution are the first three: ``We the People.'' That is what our  entire vision of our form of government is about.   There was a lot of discussion among the Founders about how we make  sure we don't end up with the equivalent of a King here in the United  States of America because with a King, you get a government by and for  the King and the King's circle, the powerful circle at the top, rather  than the people.   Unfortunately, that vision in America is being challenged--challenged  because we have a fundamental concentration of power through dark money  in campaigns and gerrymandering through voter suppression and  intimidation. The result is a shredding of the vision of our  Constitution.   We have a responsibility in the Senate to fix that, and that is why  we should be considering the For the People Act that takes on  gerrymandering, voter suppression, and dark money. If we want evidence  of just exactly how corrupted the system has become, go no further than  to look at drug companies gouging Americans on drug prices.   Today I am introducing the End Price Gouging for Medications Act to  stop the pharmaceutical companies' greed and give Americans much needed  relief.   The average American spends about $1,000 per year on medication. That  is 11 times what they spent in 1960. More than half of Americans take  at least one prescription medication--about 60 percent of us. One- quarter of them say they or family members have not filled a  prescription or have cut pills in half or have skipped doses because of  the cost, and those costs just keep going right on up.   January through June 2018, there were price increases on 4,412 drugs  and decreases on just 46. That is a ratio that approaches 100 to 1. For  every 100 drugs that go up in price, 1 comes down a little. We are  clearly failing to tackle this problem.   I hear it from my constituents back in Oregon. Bonnie Davis from  Creswell, who is a senior citizen on a fixed income and has been  diabetic for 30 years, was prescribed two new kinds of insulin in  December: BYDUREON, which costs $1,927 for a 3-month supply, and Lantus  SoloSTAR, which costs $1,952. She will pay more than $5,000 out of  pocket by the end of the year. In 1972, insulin cost just $1.49 per  vial. What an incredible difference on a product that has been around  forever.   Her two adult children are living in Germany. They thought about  coming back to the United States of America but decided not to for one  simple reason: the cost of healthcare in the United States of America  and specifically the cost of medications.   I come from Douglas County, a little timber county in Southern  Oregon. Leslie Rogers comes from that county. She comes from Roseburg,  a town where I went to first grade. Leslie shared his daughter Gloria's  story at one of my townhalls. Gloria suffers from a rare genetic  condition called West syndrome. She lives, therefore, in near constant  fear of seizures and cystic fibrosis. It is treatable.   It is treatable with a drug called ACTH. It was invented in the  1950s. Previously, it cost $40 a vial--$40--but in 8 years, the cost  has grown to $45,000. Yes, you heard that right--from $40 to $45,000.  That is more than a thousandfold increase.   The company that makes the drug bought the rights to and blocked a  $200 synthetic ACTH treatment used in Canada to prevent it from coming  to the United States. They are making a lot of money by blocking a  generic synthetic competitor.   Leslie Rogers says: ``Hospitalization and treatment drove my family  to the edge of bankruptcy, and my daughter was left tube fed and  suction dependent due to treatment delays fighting with insurance over  the drug price.''   How would you feel if your daughter or your son were left in a  situation of being tube fed and suction dependent because you couldn't  afford the drug because the drug had increased in price 1,000 times?   The cost of another drug used to treat the disease, Vigabatrin, has  also skyrocketed after makers saw what the first company was able to  get away with. It cost about $1,500 a month 3  [[Page S4570]]  years ago, and $1,500 is a lot. How much does it cost today? It costs  $26,000 per month. That is roughly a twentyfold increase.   Leslie Rogers notes: ``This price gouging has led to thousands of  children since we first spoke to suffer the same fate as my daughter-- severe brain damage, cerebral palsy, reliance on tube feedings, and  many have died.''   Let's be clear. Price gouging in America isn't just about the  pocketbook; it is about health, and it is about life or death for many  people.   This situation doesn't exist in other countries. The whole entire  price regime is different. Let's take, as an example, HUMIRA, a common  drug for rheumatoid arthritis. Here in the United States, it is about  $2,700 per dose. In the United Kingdom, it is $1,362. Why does it cost  twice that in the United States of America for this drug, this common  drug? Then there is CRESTOR, which is used to treat high cholesterol?  It is $216 in the United States, and it is $32 in France. Crudely, that  is a sevenfold increase in the United States over France. Why do we pay  seven times as much as the people in France? There is also HARVONI that  is used to treat hepatitis C. It cost $13,000 in Japan and $30,000 in  United States. That is three times as much. Why do we pay three times  what they pay in Japan for this drug? There is also JANUVIA that is  used to treat type 2 diabetes. It costs $34 in Australia and $331 in  the United States of America--a tenfold increase. Why do we pay 10  times as much as people in Australia?   There is an answer to the question--the question of why we pay so  much for HUMIRA, for CRESTOR, for HARVONI, and for JANUVIA. Very  simply, other governments negotiate the price: If you want to sell it  in our country, we negotiate the price.   We don't. Now, what is the reason why we don't? Why don't we pick up  and do for Americans what the Government of Australia does for  Australians, or the Government of the United Kingdom does for its  citizens, or the Government of France does for their citizens? Why  don't we do it for our citizens--the same good work in negotiating the  price that other governments do? What is wrong with our government?  What is wrong with this Chamber?   It is corruption. It is the absolute corruption of money in  campaigns.   So who are we serving here in this Chamber? Are we serving the people  or are we serving the drug companies? That is the question every Member  of this Chamber should struggle with.   In the United States, drug companies set the price, and we don't  negotiate. In fact, the U.S. Government has set a law saying the U.S.  Government can't negotiate. Why would we do that? Why would we do that  to ourselves? Why would we do that to the people of this country who  cannot afford the drugs because we make them far more expensive than  anywhere else in the world?   Well, we shouldn't. That is why I have introduced the End Price  Gouging for Medications Act. On behalf of the people of America, we  need to end the drug gouging.   Now, I do a lot of townhalls. I do one in every county every year.  There are 36 counties in Oregon. It is open hour for people to ask  questions. They are blue counties, and they are red counties. Twenty- two of my 36 are about as red as the reddest counties you will find in  America.   I ask the people: How many people here at this townhall like getting  gouged on drugs? Nobody does. How many people like paying 2 or 5 or 10  times more than the citizens of other developed countries? No one likes  it.   America is united--rural America, urban America, blue America, red  America, young America, old America. America is united to end this drug  gouging.   So why don't we act?   I challenge my colleagues: Come here and work for the people of the  United States of America rather than the drug companies' profits. It is  time to stand up. Stand up against those companies.   This plan is quite simple. It says you can't sell the drug for more  than the median price of what you sell it for in Australia, Japan,  Canada, and the largest European countries. It is that simple. Median  price in those markets. If you want to raise your prices in America,  you have to raise your prices in those countries. That way we all get a  fair deal. This would stop the drug gouging of Americans overnight.   This is quite simple, but you may ask how is it enforced? How do you  make sure that this happens?   Well, it is this. The difference between the reference price, or the  median price in those countries, and the price the drug company sells  their product at--if they sell it for more than the median price, the  penalty is five times the difference. If they sell it for $1,000 more  per dose over the median price, the penalty is $5,000. That gets  people's attention. Drug companies don't want to be paying massive  penalties.   And where do the fines go? They go to the NIH for drug research and  development. There is all this myth that we are not going to invest in  drug development. The basic science is done by NIH, and this would fund  NIH.   Americans have been ripped off. Americans have been gouged, and it is  this Chamber that is allowing it to happen. Who here wants to come and  say they are for the drug gouging of Americans?   Well, I can tell you that America is not with you if you are  supporting the drug gouging of our citizens. So let's have the courage  to carry the fight for the people, not the powerful.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Feinstein, and          Mrs. Gillibrand):   S. 1995. A bill to establish the Food Safety Administration to  protect the public health by preventing foodborne illness, ensuring the  safety of food, improving research on contaminants leading to foodborne  illness and the chronic health outcomes associated with foodborne  illnesses, improving the surveillance of foodborne pathogens (including  foodborne pathogens identified as antibiotic resistant), and improving  security of food from intentional contamination, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
