 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 758, I call up  the bill (H.R. 5038) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to  provide for  [[Page H10045]]  terms and conditions for nonimmigrant workers performing agricultural  labor or services, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 5038.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5038, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, is  vital legislation that will address an issue of critical national  importance: the growing labor challenges damaging the American  agricultural sector.   Solving this issue is crucial not only from an economic standpoint,  but, also, it is a matter of national security. The less we grow our  own food, the more dependent we become on food imports and the more  vulnerable we become to food contamination, epidemics, fluctuating  market prices, and increased national debt.   Today, food imports account for approximately 32 percent of the fresh  vegetables and 55 percent of the fresh fruit that we consume.                                time  1445    Systemic labor challenges are one of the main reasons for this  increase in agricultural imports.   The United States has seen a continuing decline in the number of  family farmworkers and fewer U.S. workers  [[Page H10067]]  are turning to farm work as their chosen pursuit. As a result, most of  today's hired farm laborers are foreign-born.   Unfortunately, our immigration laws have not been updated to reflect  the needs of our 21st century economy. Due in large part to these  outdated laws, undocumented workers now comprise about half of the farm  workforce, but they are living and working in a state of uncertainty  and fear, which contributes to the destabilization of farms across the  Nation.   H.R. 5038 addresses these challenges head-on. The bill provides  temporary status to current farmworkers with an optional path to a  green card for those who continue to work in agriculture. The bill also  addresses the Nation's future labor needs by modernizing the H-2A  temporary visa program while ensuring fair wages and workplace  conditions for all farmworkers.   We have seen many attempts to solve this issue through legislation  while I have been in Congress. I am pleased that today, we finally have  a bipartisan, balanced solution, one that we should all be able to  support.   This bill is a victory for farmers who have struggled with persistent  labor challenges for decades. It is also a victory for farmworkers, who  have worked tirelessly to grow and harvest food for our Nation without  proper labor protections or any guarantee that they can remain in this  country. No acceptable solution can fail to deal with this reality.   That is why H.R. 5038 is the right solution. I hope my colleagues  will find the courage to vote today in favor of providing a seat at  America's table for those who are responsible for providing the food  that we serve on all our tables.   I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), my friend and  colleague, and the chair of the Immigration Subcommittee, for her  leadership and steadfast commitment to the bipartisan process that led  to today's vote on the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, and I urge all  of my colleagues to do what is right and to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                   Washington, DC, December 9, 2019.      Hon.
