 Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Filipino  American History Month. Throughout the month of October, people across  the United States come together to pay tribute to the rich culture,  history, and heritage of Filipino Americans.   Since the first permanent Filipino settlement in the United States  was established more than 250 years ago, Filipino Americans have played  a notable role in the development of our country. As the third largest  Asian American and Pacific Islander group in the United States,  Filipino Americans add to the fabric of our society through  contributions in healthcare, the arts,  [[Page S7465]]  business, journalism, and in government and military service.   Filipinos and Filipino Americans have a longstanding history of  serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. In 1915, Fireman Second Class  Telesforo Trinidad was awarded the Medal of Honor for his extraordinary  heroism in rescuing two shipmates after a boiler explosion on board the  USS San Diego. He survived and continued serving during WWI and WWII  until his retirement in 1945. Today, Telesforo Trinidad holds the  distinction of being the first Filipino American and the first and only  Asian American in the U.S. Navy to receive a Medal of Honor.   Filipino Americans have also contributed as leaders in important  workers' rights and civil rights movements. In 1965, Larry Itliong,  Peter Velasco, and Philip Vera Cruz led Filipino American farm workers  to strike, demanding better pay, benefits, and working conditions. The  Delano Grape Strike was one of the most pivotal civil rights and labor  movements in American history.   Earlier this month, Maria Ressa, a Filipino-American journalist and  author, became the first person born in the Philippines to win a Nobel  Peace Prize. Maria, a ``fearless defender of freedom of expression,''  was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for working to expose the abuses of  power and growing authoritarianism in her native country. She also  founded Rappler, a digital media company for investigative journalism  that has documented how social media is spreading fake news and  manipulating public views.   While Filipino American History Month is a time of celebration and  commemoration, we must also recognize the disparate impact that the  COVID-19 pandemic has had on communities of color, including the  Filipino-American community. Approximately one in four Filipino- American adults serve as frontline healthcare workers. High  representation in essential work and other socioeconomic factors like  living in multigenerational homes, poverty, limited English  proficiency, preexisting health conditions, and a lack of health  insurance, put these communities at higher risk for COVID-19  transmission. As a result, Filipino-Americans comprise an estimated 32  percent of COVID-19 deaths among nurses despite representing only 4  percent of registered nurses nationwide. In spite of the emotional and  physical toll of the pandemic on these frontline workers and their  families, the Filipino-American community has continued to show its  strength and resilience.   During Filipino American History Month, we reflect on the great  sacrifices and contributions of generations of Filipino Americans who  have helped to shape our Nation. This resolution reminds us that as the  United States forges ahead, it is crucial to ensure that future  generations can learn from and appreciate the legacies of Filipino  Americans, as well as other immigrants and people of color.                            ____________________
