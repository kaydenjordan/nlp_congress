 Mr. Speaker, November 9 marks the 79th anniversary  of Kristallnacht. Referred to as the ``Night of Broken Glass,'' the  German high command issued orders to target Jews because of their  faith.   Disguised as normal citizens, members of the SS and the Gestapo  destroyed hundreds of synagogues, looted and vandalized thousands of  businesses, arrested tens of thousands of innocent civilians, and  killed nearly 100. This atrocity was a harbinger of one of history's  darkest periods, the Holocaust.   The anniversary of this grave tragedy serves as a constant reminder  of what happens when hatred and bigotry flood the minds of our world.  When evil is met with silence and indifference, all of mankind suffers.   Unfortunately, the world has not learned a lesson from the past.  Anti-Semitism has seen a troubling rise across the globe, and we must  continue our fight toward ending this brutal chapter of intolerance.   Mr. Speaker, November 9 serves as a reminder of this tragedy, but  also as an opportunity to fight this hatred and all forms of hatred,  and vow to never let such an atrocity to ever occur again.                            ____________________
