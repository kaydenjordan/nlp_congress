 Madam President, later today, Senate Democrats want to  take their next big step toward playing Russian roulette with our  country. They want to begin pushing through a reckless taxing-and- spending spree that was authored by our self-described socialist  colleague, Chairman Sanders. Today, the American people will learn  exactly where each of their Senators stand.   The American people elected a 50-50 Senate, an incredibly close House  of Representatives, and a President who pledged to govern down the  middle and unify the country. But as soon as President Biden, Speaker  Pelosi, and Leader Schumer got the keys, they handed them right over to  the far left.   Remember, Democrats inherited three safe and effective vaccines that  were already rolling out nationwide and an economy that was primed to  come roaring back, but our colleagues pressed ahead with a massive  springtime spending package that even liberal experts said would drive  inflation, and, of course, it did.   Overall inflation has risen at the fastest rate in nearly 13 years.  Core inflation hit its highest level in almost 30 years. Families are  getting hit by higher prices everywhere, from the grocery store to the  gas station, to their housing costs. Small businesses have had trouble  reopening because would-be workers are getting a government bonus to  actually stay home.   So the country is still working through the side effects of the  borrowing and spending the Democrats forced through back in the spring,  but Democrats don't want to just refill their socialist prescription;  they want to double the dose--double the dose. According to what they  just released, Democrats want to unite behind Chairman Sanders'  resolution to spend a staggering $4.2 trillion more. Of course, outside  experts estimate the real cost will be even higher still.   If it is even close to fully offset, as they claim it is, this seems  almost certain to be the largest peacetime tax hike on record. So let  that sink in--the largest peacetime tax hike on record.   Even though their rough sketch of these tax hikes would shatter  President Biden's promise not to raise taxes on the middle class,  families earning well under the President's stated threshold would get  hit and hit hard. This new reckless taxing-and-spending spree will fall  like a hammer blow on workers and middle-class families: fewer jobs,  lower wages, more inflation pushing costs higher and higher.   What our colleagues are proposing and planning is absolutely jaw- dropping. People want to pretend this is just business as usual, just  liberals doing liberal things using Senate procedure. Make no mistake,  this reckless taxing-and-spending spree is nothing like we have seen-- nothing.   The basic math of their taxing and spending is toxic enough, but the  radicalism that we will be debating on the floor goes well beyond  dollars and cents. The policies they want to put behind this budget  resolution read like somebody walked across the Rotunda to the House  and handed the Squad a pen and piece of paper: sweeping--sweeping-- amnesty for illegal immigrants in the middle of a border crisis,  regulations that are so radical that our colleague Senator Markey said:         The green new deal is in the DNA of this . . . budget       resolution. All of the things that are in [this], we talked       about in the green new deal.    Senator Markey.   They want to induce 49 other States to make their electric grids more  like California's; make it more expensive to mine critical minerals we  need to compete with China; they want to take  [[Page S6195]]  working families' child tax credit and turn it into a permanent welfare  program--listen to this--with no work requirement; they want to tamper  with the prescription drug industry in ways that would leave Americans  with fewer new treatments and fewer new cures; they want to put  government's thumb on the scale of families' childcare choices and  selectively subsidize parents whose households work the way Washington  wants; and they want to tax more money out of Americans' pockets while  reviving a special tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits wealthy people  in blue States.   So let's face it. The brute facts of the Senate's rules mean that, if  50 Democrats plus the Vice President stick together, Republicans will  probably not be able to save our colleagues from themselves. If all 50  Democrats want to help Chairman Sanders hurt middle-class families,  even if our colleagues who claim they are moderates want to follow the  far left off this cliff, well, that is their prerogative, but we are  going to argue it out right here on the floor at some length. Every  single Senator will be going on record over and over and over.   Senate Republicans will be bringing forward commonsense amendments  that represent what Americans actually want and actually need. Our  colleagues can look forward to votes on national security and funding  our Armed Forces; votes to remove backdoor tax cuts for wealthy  liberals; votes to protect family-owned small businesses and family  farms from crushing tax hikes; votes to encourage schools to finally  reopen in person; to stop the catch and release of COVID-positive  illegal immigrants coming into our country; to protect taxpayers from  being forced to fund the horrors of abortion. And that is just a  sampling. Because our Democratic colleagues missed some deadlines, it  has been an all-out sprint to prepare amendments.   So I want to thank our nonpartisan Senate clerks and  Parliamentarians. They have worked multiple weekends, straight through.  They were kept up late last night processing hundreds of amendments,  and they are going to be up late with all of us yet again.   If President Biden and 50 Senate Democrats want to outsource domestic  policy to Chairman Sanders, if this historically reckless taxing-and- spending spree is how the modern Democratic Party wants to define  itself, if they want inflation and tax hikes to be their legacy, then  Republicans do not currently have the votes to spare the American  families this nightmare, but we will debate and we will vote and we  will stand up and we will be counted--and the people of this country  will know exactly which Senators fought for them.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, well, here we go again, colleagues.  We have seen this once before, and I think it is fitting that after  passing this budget resolution full of reckless taxing and spending, we  end the evening with an effort to Federalize--take over all elections  all across America by the Federal Government.   Now, we are hearing it is going to be a substitute, but what is  technically before us is as follows: After ramming through this  reckless taxing-and-spending spree here in the dead of night, they also  want to start tearing up the ground rules of our democracy and writing  new ones, of course, on a purely partisan basis.   I suppose the timing actually makes sense, given the terrible votes  that every Democratic Senator has just cast here tonight. I can  understand why their thoughts have turned so quickly to their next  elections and why they might be feeling especially anxious to tilt the  playing field in their direction.   This ridiculous, go-nowhere bill that is stuck in the Rules Committee  would let Washington Democrats take over 50 State election laws,  completely Federalize how we handle elections in this country.   It would attack popular safeguards, like voter ID. It would turn the  Federal Election Commission into a partisan body. It would even spend  public funds on our political companies. Four-plus trillion dollars in  new spending actually wasn't enough tonight. It wasn't enough.   The preference of at least 49 out of 50 of them is to spend public  money on our own elections; have public money finance the attack ads of  people you disagree with.   So, look, my view is that maybe this is just concluding the night  with a little comic relief. S. 1 is an absurd and clumsy effort by one  political party to literally rewrite the ground rules of our democracy  to try to advantage them and disadvantage the other side.   It is always a temptation when the majority wants to write the rules  to make it more likely you can get the outcome you want.   This isn't going to work. It isn't going to work tonight, and it  isn't going to work when we get back.                                Vote on Motion
