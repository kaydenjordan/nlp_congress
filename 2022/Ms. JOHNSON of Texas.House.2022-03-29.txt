 Madam Speaker, today is a solemn day.   Today, in the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol, we paid  tribute to the Dean of the House of Representatives, the late  Congressman Don Young. And how fitting is it for Congressman Young to  lie in state in National Statuary Hall. Much like this hall, Don Young  is an icon--a pillar--in the history of the House of Representatives.   Longevity as an elected official isn't a given--it has to be earned.  And for 49 straight years, Don Young earned the honor of representing  Alaska in Congress, which he considered the privilege of a lifetime.  Congressman Young loved Alaska, and Alaska loved him. By the end of his  tenure, not only was he the longest-serving politician in Alaska's  history, but also the longest-serving Republican Member of the House of  Representatives in U.S. history.   Now, you may not think that a nurse from Texas and a frontiersman  from Alaska would have a lot in common. And for the most part, you'd be  right. But that never stopped us from working together when it meant  the betterment of our constituents. We partnered on legislation that  provided Pell Grants to Gold Star Families. We led an annual letter  advocating for increased funding for the Innovative Approaches to  Literacy (IAL) program. We spent long days and late nights together in  the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee hearings. The list goes  on and on.   We also had the opportunity to travel the world together on CODELs.  He sponsored valuable and worthwhile trips that I never hesitated to  sign up for. And the farther away we got from Washington, the closer we  became.   My thoughts and prayers are with his beloved wife, Anne, with whom I  had the pleasure of getting to know over the years, as well as his  children, grandchildren, and all those who loved him. He will be dearly  missed.
