 Mr. Speaker, people often wonder: Does government  understand what is happening in my life and the family's life?   Despite the arguments of our Republican colleagues that the pandemic  has passed, that the economy is fine, and that no relief is warranted,  the truth is that more than half a million people have died, 4 million  small businesses have closed, millions of people are out of work, and  relief is needed.   The American Rescue Plan will speed up the delivery of vaccines,  bolster testing and tracing, and expand access to affordable  healthcare. It puts money--up to $1,400 a person--right into the  pockets of working people. It extends unemployment benefits and gets  help to small businesses.   Today, with President Biden in the White House and Democrats in  control of the Congress, we can tell the American people that help is  on the way.   To listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you wonder,  where do they live, because, according to them, all of this has been  resolved, the pandemic is gone, people are back to work, and the  economy has recovered. That is not reality.    This bill will provide desperately needed relief to those we serve.  Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support the American Rescue Plan.    Mr. Speaker, in 2015, a white supremacist with a  criminal record was allowed to purchase a gun which he used to kill  nine parishioners at Mother Emanuel AME Church in South Carolina.   That shooter, who was prohibited under Federal law from owning a gun,  was able to purchase one because of a loophole that allows the sale of  a gun to proceed if Federal investigators do not complete a background  check within 3 days.   Through November of last year there were more than 5,800 incidents  where people who are legally prohibited--criminals--legally prohibited  from purchasing a firearm still obtained one because of this dangerous  provision, which has come to be known as the ``Charleston loophole.''   H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act, closes the Charleston  loophole. It strengthens background check procedures to ensure that  Federal investigators have enough time to complete background checks  before a gun is transferred to the buyer. Common sense.  [[Page H1307]]    But closing the Charleston loophole is not enough. Current Federal  law only requires a background check for the sale of guns from licensed  gun dealers.   Background checks work. Since the law was enacted, 3\1/2\ million gun  sales were denied, which means 3\1/2\ million people who were  prohibited under Federal law because of a criminal record or some other  disqualifying information were denied the right to buy a gun. They  work. The problem is more than 20 percent of gun sales or gun transfers  happen without a background check.   And that is why H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act requires  background checks on all gun sales, including guns sold by unlicensed  dealers online or at trade shows.   Every day in this country more than 100 people in the United States  are killed with guns. Gun violence is an epidemic that threatens the  public safety in communities all across America. We must not wait for  another tragedy to strike.                                time  1630    Requiring background checks on all gun sales is a commonsense gun  violence prevention measure that serves as a first line of defense to  keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.   I think we can all agree that dangerous criminals should not be able  to get guns. There has been a lot of discussion today about Second  Amendment gun rights, and we all respect that. But what about my  constituents' right to live a life free from gun violence, to take a  walk in the park, to go to a movie theater, to go to church and pray,  and to be able to do so without the fear of being gunned down and  killed? There is a competing interest here of public safety and  protecting the security of people to live a life free from gun  violence.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1446 and  H.R. 8. Join us in supporting legislation supported by over 90 percent  of the American people who have good common sense. Vote ``yes.'' Help  end the scourge of gun violence in this country.
