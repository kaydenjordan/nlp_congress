 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that kind introduction. It  was a remarkable time sitting at the airport right there on the  Delaware River and understanding how much we depend on safe, secure  travel in those airports around the country.   But to both Marc and Brendan, thank you for the Blue Collar Caucus  and bringing to light many of the issues that at times we as a nation  might have forgotten, quite frankly, those who work with their hands,  those who are getting up each and every morning and going to work,  having a job, taking care of their family, and I think focusing on that  is so important.   I am myself involved with the Building Trades Caucus, and we are  talking about something that is near and dear to everybody's heart, and  it is called infrastructure.   In this day and age when people are wondering about what is going on  in the country, I want to talk about the ``t'' word. No, it is not  Donald Trump; it is a trillion dollars, and that is the number that  people have been talking about that we need for infrastructure.   Infrastructure means many things to many different people. If you are  in Flint, Michigan, it is about having clean water. The pipes need to  be replaced. We have a growing infrastructure that is many years old.   When we think back about one of the major components of  infrastructure in this country, during the Eisenhower administration,  it was building the interstate system, from north to south, from east  to west, connecting coasts, connecting cities, connecting States. And  that is something that has been so important to us. But apparently not  important enough to keep and maintain.   I am very familiar with the systems that we have. I went to the other  4-year school; it was called an apprenticeship program, an electrical  apprenticeship that I spent 4 years in. After graduating, I worked up  and down the Delaware River at refineries, on bridges, and on our  infrastructure. We know how important it is.   But in Congress, because of the Blue Collar Caucus and many others,  we need to remember that the dignity of a job is so important. We have  211 attorneys here in Congress, but there is only one electrician.  There is only one carpenter. There is only one ironworker, and there is  only one painter. Diversity comes in many shapes and sizes, and our  Founding Fathers understood how important that was. They were farmers,  printers, attorneys, doctors, all coming together and bringing those  experiences into this very House, this very floor, to remember why we  are here.   Anybody who drove on a road to get here today understands what  infrastructure means.                                time  2015    But somehow we haven't paid attention. We had the American Society of  Civil Engineers brief us a few weeks ago to the Building Trades Caucus  on the report card that they give each and every year: aviation, a D;  bridges, a C-plus; ports, a C-plus; energy, a D; transit, a D. The  overall report card was a D.   If I had come home with a D on my report card, I know what my parents  would have done to us. But somehow having the D on the report card for  the very infrastructure here in the United States has been acceptable.   Well, it is not. We are deferring this problem to the next generation  when we owe them a responsibility of turning over our world to them in  a little bit better shape, not worse shape.   So when we look at that investment in roads, rails, ports, airports,  it does something more than just to fix the very problems that we look  at each and every day. It is about a job. What better way to put  America back to work than fixing our own infrastructure. Nobody does it  better than the building trades who have the training programs second  to none and does not use one dime of public investment. All funded  privately. Fifteen different trades coming together to fix our  infrastructure.   In addition to that, they do something that is really special. We all  know the figure when it comes to those who put the uniform on to help  protect our country is less than 1 percent. We have so many of those  men and women who are coming home today, and there is a program that  the Building Trades Caucus have put together called Helmets to  Hardhats. Taking those who want to come home and start a career, took  their helmet off and go right into an apprenticeship program, put the  hardhat on. What better way to say to those veterans they are welcome  home than to give them a job? But not just a job, a career.   So as we continue to have the discussions day-to-day, the ``t'' word  is about trillion dollars. It is about putting back into our country  the investment that it is due.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank my colleagues for coming here  today to make sure that we remember those men and women who don't  necessarily put on a suit and tie but have the dignity of going to work  each day as blue-collar workers, and we are damn proud of it.
