 Mr. President, first, I want to thank my friend and  colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, not only for his wonderful  remarks here today but for his passion on this issue. He was one of the  first to blow the whistle on these colleges.   When you hear about this, it just boils your blood--boils your blood.  These kids did nothing wrong. It is one of the reasons we believe  student debt should be forgiven. The Federal Government gave them the  loans--that was required by law--but they were taken advantage of  through no fault of their own.   I wonder if this Mr. Modany has been prosecuted for any of these  things. He does not deserve to have, probably, the millions he has on  the backs of all of these students.   But I thank the Senator from the bottom of my heart. This boils our  blood, what they did to these kids. That is one of the reasons we  believe that the White House ought to forgive up to $50,000 of student  debt.   OK. Let's go to another subject.    Mr. President, in a few moments, I will lock in our  agreement on both PNTR as well as cloture on the SCOTUS nomination.   First, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the following  nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 810, 852, and 862; that the Senate  vote on the nominations, en bloc, without intervening action or debate;  that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table; that any statements related to the nominations be printed in the  Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; and that the Senate resume legislative session.    Now, Mr. President, in a few moments, I will lock in an  agreement on a number of important votes tomorrow.   First and foremost, we have reached an agreement for the Senate to  conclude the confirmation process of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson  tomorrow. We will hold a cloture vote tomorrow morning at approximately  11 a.m., and the final vote for her confirmation is on track to take  place at around 1:45 tomorrow afternoon, depending on how many Members  wish to speak.   It will be a joyous day--joyous for the Senate, joyous for the  Supreme Court, joyous for America--but we still have a long way to go.  America, tomorrow, will take a giant step to becoming a more perfect  nation.   I will have more to say on this historic occasion tomorrow, but, for  now, I wish to thank my Senate colleagues for working together to  advance and finalize this historic nomination to the Supreme Court.   Second, I will also lock in an agreement to hold a series of votes on  PNTR and the oil ban tomorrow.   After many rounds of negotiations with Republicans, we have reached  an important and crucial breakthrough. This agreement clears the path  to finally approve legislation that will strip Russia of permanent  normal trade relations with the United States. It will also allow the  Senate to take separate action on an oil ban proposal as we originally  sought. These proposals both have the support of the White House, and  it is a big, big deal that we are finally getting them done. I wish  this could have happened sooner, but after weeks of talks with the  other side, it is important that we have found a path forward to  getting PNTR done on a bipartisan basis.   I want to sincerely thank Senator Crapo, who worked in good faith  with us, together, and we wouldn't have reached an outcome--this  outcome--without his diligence and good faith.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Putin absolutely must be held accountable  for the detestable, detestable, despicable war crimes he is committing  against Ukraine. The images we have seen coming out of that country,  especially out of the town of Bucha, are just pure evil--it reminds us  of the worst moments in human history--caused by the evil man, Putin:  hundreds of civilians murdered in cold blood--men, women, children, the  elderly, the defenseless; people with hands tied behind their backs and  left dead on the streets; civilians shot in the back of the head--all  for one reason: They are Ukrainians. It is one despicable reason.   This is genocide when you murder, wantonly, innocent civilians  because of who they are. Whether it be their religion, their race, or  their nationality, that is genocide, and Mr. Putin is guilty of it.   Formally revoking normal trade relations with Russia is precisely the  right thing for the Senate to do because it will land another huge blow  to Putin's economy. It is a key part of  [[Page S2052]]  any strategy for holding Putin accountable for his savage attacks on  innocent civilians.   Again, I thank all of my colleagues for their good work and look  forward to passing PNTR in the Senate tomorrow morning.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 10 a.m. tomorrow, April 7, the Senate  resume legislative session and proceed to the en bloc consideration of  H.R. 6968, the Russian oil ban, and H.R. 7108, the Russia PNTR, both of  which are at the desk; that amendment No. 5021 to H.R. 6968 be  considered and agreed to; that amendment No. 5020 to H.R. 7108 be  considered and agreed to; and that those be the only amendments in  order to either bill; that the bills, as amended, be considered read a  third time en bloc; that the Senate vote on the passage of H.R. 7108,  as amended, and H.R. 6968, as amended; and that with respect to both  bills, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table without further intervening action or debate; further, that upon  the disposition of H.R. 6968, the Senate resume executive session and  vote on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 860, the  nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson. Finally, I ask unanimous consent  that the mandatory quorum call for the cloture motion with respect to  the Jackson nomination be waived; that if any nominations are confirmed  during Thursday's session of the Senate, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    I thank my friend, the Senator from Idaho.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as we move on, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Foreign Relations be discharged from further  consideration of S. 3522 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.
