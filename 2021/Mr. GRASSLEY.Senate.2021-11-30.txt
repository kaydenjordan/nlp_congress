 Mr. President, on November 3 of this year, Special  Counsel Durham indicted Christopher Steele's primary subsource, Igor  Danchenko. He indicted him on five counts of lying to the FBI. He lied  about his contacts and the identity of his sources.   One of the more serious lies was about Sergei Millian. The indictment  shows that Danchenko alleged a phone call occurred between him and  Millian about a Trump-Russia conspiracy. That call was part of the  basis that the FBI used to get a FISA warrant on Carter Page.   Now, according to Durham, Steele's source lied about the call because  that call never happened. This is yet another stunning, fatal defect  against the Obama-Biden administration's fake predicate to investigate  Trump--specifically, yet another illustration of Justice Department and  FBI failure.   Now, as a result of these failures, this country has been dragged  through the mud for years. That statement is well understood at this  point, but I have more to explain about it.   The indictment also shows that one of Steele's sources was a  ``longtime participant in Democratic Party politics'' and that he  ``fabricated'' at least some of the information that he gave to  Danchenko.   This source, identified as Charles Dolan, ``actively campaigned and  participated in calls and events as a volunteer on behalf of Hillary  Clinton'' during the 2016 election.   Another one of Danchenko's sources was also a Hillary Clinton  supporter. Charles Dolan gifted to this particular Russian subsource an  autobiography of Hillary Clinton signed with these words: ``To my good  friend, a great Democrat.''   Now--get this--while the Democrats were smearing Trump with false  Russia allegations, they were the ones rubbing elbows with Russians and  spreading false information in the media, and, of  [[Page S8825]]  course, the media, as we know, gladly ran with that information. For  example, President Biden's current National Security Advisor, Jake  Sullivan, promoted the false story about the Russian bank called Alfa  Bank communicating with the Trump organization, when he worked for the  Clinton campaign.   Notably, during congressional testimony, several years ago, Sullivan  said that he wasn't sure who Marc Elias represented when he presented  Trump opposition research to the campaign. Now, for crying out loud,  Elias was the Clinton campaign's general counsel.   My oversight work dating back to December 2016 has focused on the  Democratic Party's and Clinton campaign's links to the Steele dossier.  Last Congress, Senator Johnson and I obtained many records relating to  Crossfire Hurricane. We were able to get many of them declassified for  the public.   I point you to our April 15, 2020; December 3, 2020; and December 18,  2020, press releases on this information. Some of the declassified  records show that the FBI had reports in its hand that showed the  Steele dossier was most likely tainted with Russian disinformation.   One document indicates that the FBI received a U.S. intelligence  report on January 12, 2017, warning of an inaccuracy in the dossier in  relation to Michael Cohen. The report assessed that the material was  ``part of a Russian disinformation campaign to denigrate U.S. foreign  relations.''   That same day, the FISA warrant against Page was renewed for the  first time by Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. This is when the  Obama-Biden administration and the Justice Department were still in  charge.   A similar U.S. intelligence report arrived on February 27, 2017,  undercutting a key allegation against then-President Trump. The report  noted claims about Trump's travel to Moscow in 2013 ``were false, and  they were the product of Russian intelligence services infiltrat[ing] a  source into the network'' of sources that contributed to the dossier.  Just over a month later, the FISA warrant against Page was then renewed  for a second time.   I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the FBI also opened a  counterintelligence case on Danchenko and failed to tell the FISA Court  about it. If this fact pattern was a movie script, nobody would believe  it.   With Durham's recent indictments, we now have even more proof that  the Trump-Russia collusion investigation had the wrong name. It should  have been the Clinton-DNC-Russia collusion investigation.   The media and many members of the Democratic Party ought to be  ashamed of the falsehoods that they were spreading throughout these  years. Our political discourse has been damaged for decades to come  because of that scheme.   Recently, the Washington Post had to correct over a dozen articles  relating to its previous Russia reporting in light of the extensive  errors made by that newspaper--years of errors, I might add. I think it  is somewhat unprecedented, and I am sure the Washington Post hated to  retract and correct the record.   As Durham proceeds, I would say this: Don't take your eyes off of  government misconduct. The Justice Department and the FBI hid critical  information from the FISA Court that would have cut against their case.  They failed to correct the record when they should have corrected the  record. Simply put, the Justice Department and the FBI misrepresented  information to the court. That conduct can't be allowed to pass.                            Remembering Tom Riter    Mr. President, on another matter, just a short point I want to make  about a very important voice in agriculture journalism that has gone  silent.   Every Tuesday morning--probably for 52 weeks out of the year--I hold  a conference call with agriculture reporters and farm broadcasters to  discuss news and issues impacting the 2 percent of the Americans who  feed and fuel the world. I am talking about our family farmers.   For the past several decades, the first question each week came from  a very familiar voice in the agriculture community: Tom Riter of WNAX  out of Yankton, SD.   Sadly, Tom passed away on November 21, just a few days before  Thanksgiving.   Tom rarely--and I mean very rarely--ever missed my weekly call. In  fact, he always kicked off the discussion that was carried on by  probably another dozen people--kicked off the discussion with a smart  question about farm policy. Undoubtedly, his reports kept his listeners  informed on issues that make a big difference to their lives, their  farms, their ranches, and businesses in the American heartland.   He happened to be a native of Rock Rapids, IA, not far from Yankton.  He was a fellow University of Northern Iowa Panther. Tom joined WNAX in  1999, so he was around that station for 22 years, I think it adds up  to. Ever since, I have looked forward to our weekly discussions.   I am grateful for Tom's dedication to his craft, specifically his  work to expand the public's understanding and appreciation of the ag  community's contribution to our society--most importantly, that 2  percent of the people in this country who produce the food for the  other 98 percent.   My wife Barbara and I extend our sympathies to Tom's family and  friends, the WNAX family, and his colleagues in the ag press community.  We lost a very big voice for American agriculture. He will be greatly  missed.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
