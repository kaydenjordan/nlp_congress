 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Laura  Shipp.   Laura attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1.   Laura was a single mother to her son, Corey, who is a Marine Corps  reservist.   Laura and her son had a strong relationship, and she had even moved  from California to Las Vegas so she could be closer to him.   Laura loved the Los Angeles Dodgers and country music. She was  protective of those that she loved and had a big heart.   Laura is remembered as being a smart woman who would always make sure  to buy her son and nephew a toy or a snack, even when she didn't have a  lot of money.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Laura Shipp's  family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State  of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
