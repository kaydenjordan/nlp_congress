 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, understand the       concern. And I can tell you that one of the reasons that the       Department wanted to use a preexisting list, the one that I       believe you are referring to, the HUD approved counseling       agency list, is because that list is preexisting. The       Department did not want to be in the business of picking and       choosing which organization may or may not receive any       funding under the agreement.        Chairman GOODLATTE. No, but it is the Congress'       responsibility to appropriate funds, and the Congress'       responsibility to be picking and choosing who gets       appropriations for expenditures. And we want to know what       connection there is between the fact that cuts were made and       . . .                                  exhibit b       From: Taylor, Elizabeth G.

Based on our       current understanding of the potential scale, we identified       three options that would best align with organizational       capacity and litigation goals, and achieve the ASG's goal of       a distribution mechanism that reaches a broad coalition of       legal aid organizations.        The options listed below could be pursued either separately       or in some combination. As set out below, we recommend a       combination of options l and 2:        1) distribute the majority of funds set aside for legal aid       to IOLTA foundations; and        2) reserve sufficient funds for a national organization to       establish Consumer Protection Fellowships in specific states       pursuant to the settlement, to focus on foreclosure       prevention solutions that help people keep their homes and       prevent future mortgage abuses.        IOLTA foundations are especially appropriate intermediaries       in cases involving banks because a) they have capacity to       effectively distribute large sums of money; and b) the       historically low bank Interest rates from the beginning of       2008 to the present, have meant the loss of hundreds of       millions of dollars to legal aid programs nationally, while       the need for free legal services has grown.        Legal aid offices respond to the wide range of legal       problems faced by low-income communities in distress, with       lawyers working on cases involving housing and consumer       protection as well as family law matters and access to public       benefits. Often clients have multiple, interrelated legal       problems, such as a loss of housing that may exacerbate or       lead to other debt problems or an acute need to access other       public benefits. Some larger organizations also have       expertise in broader community development work, like working       on behalf of citizen groups to negotiate community benefits       agreements (such as requiring development to include       affordable housing or prioritize local labor). Typically, as       non-profit organizations subject to oversight by boards of       directors, legal aid offices have a formal process for       setting local priorities with oversight and input from their       boards. It could be logistically difficult for large scale       funding through IOLTA to have subject matter restrictions on       it (such as only for housing cases). Like most IOLTA funding,       and like federal funds from the Legal Services Corporation,       it is best to have as few strings as possible--both to       respect established local priorities and avoid overly       burdensome accounting. However, for the smaller portion of       funding in option 2, it makes sense to be targeted both as to       geography and subject matter.        Finally, while we recommend as few restrictions as possible       on funding going to legal aid organizations, we note that       some organizations already live with funding restrictions--      such as not being allowed to pursue class actions. If, to       build support for these ideas generally, there is a need to       fashion reasonable restrictions, then ATJ can help with       further development of such options.

I thought our       conversation was helpful, and I appreciate your willingness       to hear my suggestions regarding a ``pilot project on       community reinvestment'' in Prince William County, Virginia,       as an element of the anticipated JPMorgan Chase settlement.       For the record, it is important that I offer the following       disclaimer: this proposal is made on our own initiative, and       without the encouragement, approval, or suggestion by either       you or the Department of Justice.        By way of background, The Leadership Conference on Civil       and Human Rights is the nation's leading civil and human       coalition. We have been actively involved for many years in       housing and lending policies both before and in the wake of       nation's financial crisis. As I mentioned when we spoke, we       are working with several community-based organizations in       Prince William County that seek to promote the public       interest through leveraged investments in neighborhoods that       have been hard hit by home foreclosures.        For example, VOICE, a broad-based citizens organization       with 50 religious and community institution members in       Northern Virginia, has asked The Leadership Conference to       assist them in their fight to get JPMorgan to reinvest a       portion of the more than $300 million in equity it stripped       from Prince William County, VA communities and families       through predatory loans, toxic Mortgage-backed Securities       (MBSs), and foreclosures (see attached one-page summary of JP       Morgan's Prince William track record).        We are asking DOJ officials negotiating with JPMorgan Chase       to consider including in any settlement significant equity       capital or grant funds to promote and capitalize a Prince       William County Restoration Fund (see attached concept paper)       which will revitalize blighted neighborhoods, rebuild       homeownership, and address                              exhibit I Part II                                 Metro IAF                             VOICE for justice                     National Community Restoration Fund            JP Morgan Chase & Federal Government MBS Settlement         Goal: Require JPMorgan Chase to reinvest some of the equity       its predatory mortgages stripped from communities as part of       the US Department of Justice's proposed $13 Billion       Settlement with JPMorgan over regulatory issues and mortgage-      backed securities (MBSs).        Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a network of 22 broad-      based citizens organizations in the East, Midwest, and South,       proposes that this occur in one of two ways;        Ideal Proposal: The Federal Government should require       JPMorgan Chase to pay $2 billion in cash to capitalize a       National Community Restoration Fund that would help restore       communities and be available on a competitive basis. The       National Restoration Fund could capitalize 50 local community       restoration equity funds to rebuild communities across the       country that were destroyed by JPMorgan's predatory loans and       toxic MBSs.        Alternative Proposal: The Federal Government should include       in its consent agreement, as part of the consumer relief       portion, a requirement that JPMorgan Chase capitalize local       community restoration equity funds through significant grants       (at least $10 million+ each) or Equity Equivalent (EQ2)       investments over 20+ years on a non-recourse basis at very       low interest rates (0%-1%) to rebuild communities devastated       by foreclosure. JPMorgan Chase could be given enhanced credit       towards its settlement requirements for this type of grant or       investment.        Background: JPMorgan Chase's predatory loans--packaged into       toxic MBSs--did not just hurt investors and individual       homeowners; they destroyed entire communities for which       JPMorgan should be held accountable to reinvest. MBSs allowed       predatory lenders to originate trillions of dollars of sub-      prime loans that were structured to fail, targeted at low-      wealth and minority borrowers, and concentrated In low-income       neighborhoods in cities and aging suburbs throughout the US.       The cumulative effect of these failed mortgages was to:        Leave large-numbers of blighted and vacant homes that       depress property values,  [[Page H8111]]       preventing remaining homeowners from securing a loan       modification because they are underwater. These properties       also attract crime and other public safety issues;        Devastate homeownership rates, replacing owners with       renters vulnerable to negligent absentee investors and       destabilizing neighborhoods;        Create pressures on available affordable rental housing as       demand rises from families recently foreclosed, raising rents       and making rental housing unaffordable;        Deny large swaths of former homeowners, who are stuck in       high-priced rental housing,                                  Exhibit J         Best,        Peter J.

Thank you for agreeing to speak with US Deputy Attorney       General Tony West about meeting with VOICE--Virginians       Organized for Interfaith Community Engagement Leaders--to       discuss VOICE & Metro Industrial Areas Foundation's (Metro       IAF) proposal to create a $5 Billion National Community       Equity Restoration Fund to rebuild communities devastated by       predatory loans and toxic Mortgage Backed Securities issued       by financial institutions.        The VOICE-Metro IAF National Community Equity Restoration       Fund concept paper is attached. As you know, VOICE worked       with Senator Mark Warner, Federal officials, and other allies       to get ``grants to capitalize community equity restoration       funds'' included as one way JP Morgan Chase can fulfill its       consumer relief obligations under the Department of Justice-      JP Morgan Chase $13 billion toxic Mortgage Backed Securities       settlement. This precedent potentially creates a vital       resource to rebuild communities hard hit by predatory loans       and foreclosures. We will brief Deputy Attorney General West       on how community equity restoration funds established by       VOICE/Metro IAF sister groups are transforming blighted       communities on a large scale in Baltimore, New York,       Milwaukee as well as the VOICE restoration plan for Prince       William County, VA. VOICE & Metro IAF will make the case that       the Department of Justice should make ``grants to capitalize       community equity restoration funds'' mandatory in all future       settlements.        Below is background information on VOICE and its organizing       to hold financial institutions accountable for the predatory       loan and foreclosure crisis in Prince William County, VA as       well as Metro IAF. Watch this short video for the story about       VOICE's organizing: VOICE Foreclosure Organizing Video. The       concept paper has details on the effectiveness of community       equity restoration funds in rebuilding blighted communities.        Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to       talking with you again soon.
