 Madam Speaker, this Friday is the 383rd  birthday of the U.S. National Guard. Established in 1636, the National  Guard is the oldest military organization in America. Its members  served during times of war and emergency to keep American families safe  and secure.   This anniversary allows us to come together to honor those who have  risked their lives to protect our freedom. These sacrifices show that  freedom is not free.   South Carolina is fortunate for the service of Adjutant General Van  McCarty appointed by Governor Henry McMaster in the tradition of  retiring Adjutant General Bob Livingston.   As a veteran of the Army National Guard and the father of three Army  National Guardsmen who have served in Iraq, Egypt, and Afghanistan, I  appreciate servicemembers, veterans, and military families. I am  grateful for the resolve our servicemembers have to protect American  families. I am thankful to celebrate this birthday of the militia  filled with brave, self-sacrificing men and women.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
