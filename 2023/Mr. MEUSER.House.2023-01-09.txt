 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Nebraska for  yielding.   The idea, Mr. Speaker, of hiring 87,000 new IRS agents to close the  tax gap is misguided. I served as revenue secretary for the great  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We did, in fact, close a tax gap through  what proved to be very effective measures. These measures included  improving IT systems and processes, which truly determined tax evasion  from tax avoidance.   Largely taking the easy approach of hiring 87,000 new agents,  doubling the size of the IRS--I don't know who thinks that is a good  idea--does not improve the quality of information used to accomplish  the goal of collecting all tax revenues that are due. It will only  increase the number of audits, most often on innocent small businesses  and individuals.   As well, the CBO projection of $186 billion of increased revenue was  established before the administration said that only those above  $400,000 in income would be audited. Currently, nearly 90 percent of  the audits are conducted on small businesses and those making less than  $400,000.   How can you make a projection when your targeted audience is reduced  by 90 percent?   This is an absolutely flawed plan that will do nothing but increase  the size of government, increase audits on law-abiding businesses, and  fail to achieve its intended results. It is Big Government at its  worse.   According to the CBO, the hiring of these new IRS agents will also  cause audit rates to rise on all taxpayers. A bipartisan analysis found  that this increase in funding would result in 1.2 million more audits;  700,000 of them will target taxpayers making $75,000 or less. These new  IRS agents will not be targeting wealthy tax cheats as they claim. They  will be targeting everyday Americans.
