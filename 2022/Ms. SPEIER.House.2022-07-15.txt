 Madam Speaker, it gets more painful every single day.  When you think about it, you have an AG in Indiana who has smeared a  healthcare professional in that State who did exactly what she was  supposed to do in providing an abortion to a 10-year-old. But he was  going to bring charges against her.   We have a colleague on the other side of the aisle who is now putting  down $20 bills as if we are going to race over there to get that $20  bill to answer his question.   I mean, what are we doing here? Have we lost it?   This bill simply codifies what is interpreted in the Constitution in  the Fifth Amendment.   Now, we have a Justice, Kavanaugh, who was asked the question: May a  State bar a resident of the State from traveling to another State? The  answer is no. But, interestingly enough, the right to travel, those  words, are not in the Fifth Amendment.   So, if we have an originalist Court, we do have to pass this bill,  which has been introduced by Congresswomen Fletcher and Strickland and  other Members, because women should be able to travel. Right now, we  cannot even guarantee that to a woman who wants to get an abortion.   I have had an abortion. I have had miscarriages. I have had to live  with a dead fetus in my body. I know what that experience is like. Not  everyone over there does. I would say most Members over there don't.   But it is my personal right. It is every woman's personal right.
