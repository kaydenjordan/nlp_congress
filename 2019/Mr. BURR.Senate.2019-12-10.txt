 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in opposition.    Madam President, I reluctantly rise in opposition to this  legislation, and I have worked with Senator Isakson over the years on  FDA legislation.   I want to be perfectly clear that I agree with all of the reforms  that are in this piece of legislation within the over-the-counter  division at FDA. I simply disagree with the way in which this  legislation provides the resources to achieve these reforms because I  don't believe it will result in what the expectations are of the  authors.   When the drug industry first agreed to user fees in 1993, the fee to  file a new drug application was $100,000. Today that fee is $2.1  million. To that end, the FDA has struggled to uphold its end of the  bargain, falling behind in its commitment to hire the number of  employees the agency needs to actually review the applications that  cost millions of dollars to file.   The FDA continues to increase the amount of user fee dollars it  requires to review applications, eroding the balance of congressional  oversight provided by the appropriation of taxpayer dollars.   I encourage my colleagues that what Johnny is trying to do is the  right thing to do, but it is the wrong way to pay for it.   I yield the floor.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read  the third time.    Madam President, I want to take a few moments to explain  why I am opposed to the OTC reform legislation offered by Senator  Isakson. Senator Isakson and I worked together on many pieces of FDA  legislation, and I have no doubt that he worked tirelessly to draft  this bill in the best interest of patients. I will miss working closely  with my colleague from Georgia to improve the lives of the millions of  Americans touched by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's work each  day.   I want to be clear that I agree reforms are needed within the over- the-counter drug division at the FDA. I simply disagree on the way in  which this legislation provides the resources to achieve these reforms  because I do not believe it will result in my colleague's desired  outcome. Here is why.   I reformed the FDA in 1997 with the passage of the FDA Modernization  Act, which I like to call FDAMA. One of the foundational principles of  that legislation was to bring more certainty, predictability, and  accountability to an agency that had lost its way, failing to bring new  drugs and medical devices to market in the United States in a timely  manner. Twenty-two years later, I am starting to see the implementation  of major provisions of this law. Two decades after its passage, the FDA  is finally putting key policies into practice that Congress demanded.  Two decades is an unacceptable amount of time for Americans to wait.   One of the components of FDAMA was the reauthorization of certain  user fee programs. Over these past two decades, we have seen FDA's user  fee agreements increase with each 5-year cycle, bringing more resources  into the agency to review drug, biologic and device applications.   When the drug industry first agreed to user fees in 1993, the fee to  file a new drug application with the FDA was $100,000. Today, that fee  is $2.1 million. To that end, FDA has struggled to uphold its end of  the deal, falling behind in its commitment to hire the number of  individuals the agency needs to actually review the applications that  cost millions of dollars to file. The FDA continues to increase the  amount of user fee dollars it requires to review applications, eroding  the balance of congressional oversight provided by the appropriation of  taxpayer dollars to the agency.   I would caution my colleagues that we are currently experiencing the  effects of a center at the FDA that receives 100 percent of its funds  from user fees, the Center for Tobacco Products. The CTP has had 10  years and received over $5 billion in user fee resources. It has yet to  finalize a single governing regulation for the products Congress tasked  the CTP with regulating. Meanwhile, youth rates of vapor product use  continue to increase and 2,000 Americans have fallen ill from the use  of unregulated products. I have spoken many times on my concerns with  the growth and development of FDA user fee programs because they have  not resulted in the development of an FDA that keeps its promises. I  promise my colleagues that the user fee program included in this bill  will not be any different.   While the Senate has wrestled with solutions to high drug costs for  the last 18 months, we are voting to approve a bill that increases the  development costs for one of Americans' cheapest options for care. The  over-the-counter user fee bill provides millions of dollars in new  industry funds to reform the OTC system at FDA, and the agency is  asking for tens of millions of dollars to deal with a backlog of OTC  monographs or recipes to create over the counter medications.   User fee dollars are intended to go toward the review of  applications, but I can assure my colleagues this is not the full story  at the Agency today. Last year alone, $133 million in drug user fees  went toward administrative expenses at the FDA, funds that may  otherwise help to invest in new treatments or cures for Americans. This  is very simple math, the more user fee programs we provide to the FDA,  the less the FDA is accountable and responsive to Congress.   Through FDAMA and more recently in the 21st Century Cures Act and the  2017 FDA user fee bill, I worked to rebalance the focus of the FDA, to  reaffirm its authorities to regulate the cutting edge science facing  the agency, and to better leverage and strategically invest its  existing resources. So I cannot support legislation that degrades the  progress we have made at the FDA.                            ____________________
