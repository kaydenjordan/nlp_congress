 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as a Member of  Congress who has proudly worked to fight and defeat terrorism as a CIA  officer. I worked with my colleagues to protect the lives of the  American people, our servicemembers, and our interests around the  world.   I fully agree that we need to revisit our Authorizations for Use of  Military Force. I have worked with Members of Congress, including the  esteemed gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), to raise this issue. I am  proud to see that we are actually seeing progress toward the repeal of  the 1991 and 2002 AUMFs. That is encouraging.   However, that does not mean that we should abandon ongoing operations  that keep the United States safe that are authorized under the 2001  AUMF. Should we discuss it? Should we debate it? Should we look toward  reforming it? Perhaps. Should we order the men and women in uniform to  come home over the next few months? Absolutely not.   We should not encourage a resurgence of ISIS. We should not abandon  our work with the Kurdish fighters on the front lines. We should  understand the implications for the long-term stability of the Middle  East and the actions we take here today.    Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I oppose the  resolution to withdraw quickly from Syria, and I look forward to  earnest, bipartisan, forward-looking conversations about how we can  reassert our constitutional role and protect our ongoing work to defeat  terrorism and keep the homeland safe.
