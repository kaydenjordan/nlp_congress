 Mr. President, today, during National Police Week, I wish  to honor the thousands of uniformed Montanans who put their lives on  the line to guarantee the safety and well-being of our families and the  communities they call home.   Day in and day out, they keep out drugs, provide justice for families  shattered by crime, and ensure parents are secure tucking in their kids  at night.   These law enforcement officers are well-trained, committed, and they  deserve our deepest gratitude.   When others run from danger, they courageously face it head on. They  bravely stand up to threats, and in the most tragic of circumstances,  some make the ultimate sacrifice.   Last year, Montanans lost Deputy Mason Moore of the Broadwater County  Sheriff's Office.   Deputy Moore was a beloved son, husband, father, and brother. He had  a strong faith and a deep commitment to Montana and this Nation. His  legacy lives on in his family, his fellow law enforcement officers, his  community, and our State. Montana will never forget his dedication to  service and his promise to keep all Montanans safe.   Tragic moments like this make us all stop and remember how thankful  we are for the men and women who serve and protect our communities.   This National Police Week we add Deputy Moore's name to National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC, to respectfully  document his sacrifice and to preserve his legacy.   In addition to honoring the life and service of Deputy Moore, we  recognize six outstanding Montana law enforcement officers who also  responded on May 16, 2017.   Deputy Austin Micu of Powell County Sheriff's Department, Troopers  Thomas Gill and Timothy R. Wyckoff of Montana Highway Patrol, and  Sergeant Tim Berger, Lieutenant John O'Brien, and Officer Rich O'Brien  of Butte-Silver Bow Law Enforcement Department all went above and  beyond the call of duty, and we honor them today as ``Top Cops.''   During this week and every week, we thank you for putting your lives  on the line to make Montana a safer place.   God bless you, and God bless your families, and God bless America.                            ____________________
