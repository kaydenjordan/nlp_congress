 Mr. Speaker, in 1961, in the face of a challenge from the  Soviets, President Kennedy visited the University of Washington and  said we are neither ``warmongers nor appeasers. Neither hard nor soft.  We are Americans, determined to defend the frontiers of freedom.''   He pointed out the university's motto is: ``Let there be light,'' and  asked: ``What more can be said today, regarding all the dark and  tangled problems we face, than: Let there be light.''   It is the unanimous view of the United States intelligence community  that Russia used social media to influence our elections in 2016. After  yesterday, Americans from all viewpoints called on Congress to stand up  for our interests to protect our elections from Russian influence.   I offered the Honest Ads Act as an amendment to the bill we are  voting on today. This bipartisan bill simply establishes the same  disclosure requirements for online ads that currently apply to  political ads on television and radio.   So today, Congress had the chance to stand up to Russia and pass the  Honest Ads Act, but like the President a day ago, this body failed to  act.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has a duty to defend the frontiers of freedom.  So, let there be light. Let's pass the Honest Ads Act and shine a light  on the darkest corners of our election systems so that Russia can never  again use our news feeds to influence our elections.                            ____________________
