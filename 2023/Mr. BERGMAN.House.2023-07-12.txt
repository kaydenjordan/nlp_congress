 Mr. Chairman, to quickly amplify on Mr. Gallagher's  comments, sometimes you don't know what you don't know until it is too  late, and the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee focuses  on knowing things early to prevent disaster.   Today, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2670, the National Defense  Authorization Act for fiscal year 2024.   I sincerely thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Smith for their  leadership in bringing this truly bipartisan legislation to the floor  for the 63rd consecutive year. This bill is critical for the national  security of our Nation as well as providing congressional oversight of  the Department of Defense.   This bill provides resources and capabilities to counter our Nation's  number one threat--China. The Intelligence and Special Operations  Subcommittee portions of the bill accomplishes this by ensuring the  Defense Intelligence Enterprise, the Defense Security Cooperation  Agency, and the Special Operations Forces have the proper authorities,  force structure, flexibility, and technically and tactically competent  people to support the Department's efforts in strategic competition and  counter China.   There is more work to be done. This bill is far from perfect and  requires compromises from both sides, but it is an overwhelmingly  bipartisan bill that supports our servicemembers with a 5.2 percent pay  raise, the largest in 20 years. More importantly, it provides our  servicemembers with the resources to accomplish the task our Nation  asks of them.   This is a critically important bill, and I urge all of my colleagues,  regardless of differences, to support it.
