 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule  and the underlying bill. I originally had some things written down on  paper, but based on the last comments, I just want to echo the  sentiments of my colleague and also share that I served as Secretary of  Labor in the State of Delaware. I served as head of State personnel.   Jobs are important to us. I had the opportunity to work on WIA, WIOA,  all of those great pieces of legislation for workforce development. And  I want to talk about some myths.   There is a myth that the majority of people on SNAP aren't working or  won't work in a year. That is a myth. Two-thirds of SNAP recipients are  children, seniors, and people with disabilities. People don't realize  that. And there are 6 million unfilled jobs. So, for me, the problem  with this bill, the biggest problem is that it was a missed  opportunity.   If we are truly serious about employing people who are returning from  prison, people who maybe have a disability--    Mr. Speaker, if we are truly serious, then we  will come to the table. But when the table is set in stone, then we  don't get an opportunity to really work on those things that will  support the American people.   The other piece that was disappointing to me is, I came to this as a  person who wanted to be on this committee because of its bipartisan  nature and that the American people are waiting and watching to see us  come together for them. This is a loss of confidence, and it is also a  missed opportunity.   I am excited and hopeful that we will come together because the  people are watching.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that I wrote to  Secretary Perdue, because there were a lot of questions and assumptions  that were never answered even in our markup.                                     Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, May 11, 2018.      Hon. Sonny Perdue,      Secretary of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture,           Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Perdue: I am writing to request that the       U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) respond to my inquiries       regarding H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018,       which is also known as the Farm Bill. As a member of the       House Committee on Agriculture, I am one of 46 Members       sitting on the committee of jurisdiction for this       legislation. Given the breadth of the proposed changes in the       Farm Bill, I want to take this opportunity to reach out to       the agency that will be responsible for implementing the       provisions in the bill.        During the markup of the Farm Bill on April 18, 2018, my       colleagues on both sides of the aisle were only able to       direct questions to Chairman Conaway. However, I believe it       is essential that we hear from the experts involved in       running these programs to ensure we are advocating for       policies that are evidence-based. As a result, I respectfully       ask that you address the following questions and provide a       timely response.                              Workforce Programs         My understanding is that we would need anywhere between       three to five million more slots in workforce training       programs across the country if all eligible SNAP participants       would like to enroll in SNAP Employment and Training (E&T)       programs. The bill would provide a new federal E&T grant of       $1 billion per year to finance the newly mandated work       program, which comes out to less than $30 per person per       month. Upon what evidence and or best practices has this       number been arrived at? Does the USDA believe this is       sufficient? If not, what does the USDA think is sufficient to       implement a meaningful workforce development program and move       people into work?        The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis says it       would take a decade to set up a program for everyone to get a       work slot. If state E&T costs are greater than their annual       federal grant, will states bear the additional costs       associated with operating the work programs? What breakdown       does USDA expect in administration expenses between job       training, IT, administrative costs, and other programs? What       are the ramifications for states of not fully implementing       their work programs?        What additional capacity would USDA require to oversee this       new work program? Would states experience increased       administrative costs under this proposal?        When specifically will we hear the results from the 2014       Farm Bill SNAP E&T Pilot Projects? Under current law, what       are your expectations for sharing these findings and building       them into USDA oversight of state E&T? If H.R. 2 were to be       enacted as proposed, when will you be able to incorporate the       findings from the pilot projects into the SNAP program, based       on how this bill is written?        I appreciate your timely consideration and the work you do       for farmers, families, and communities across the country.            Sincerely,                                           Lisa Blunt Rochester,                                                   Committee Member,                                    House Committee on Agriculture.     Mr. Chairman, it is with deep disappointment  that I stand in opposition to the partisan farm bill. I joined the  House Committee on Agriculture because of its reputation of being  bipartisan. I represent an entire State--urban, rural, and suburban.  The farm bill is vital. That is why I was so disappointed to see this  breakdown.   The goal of creating a thriving economy and moving people out of  poverty is a goal we all share, and throughout my career I have worked  to connect people with jobs. As Delaware's former secretary of labor  and deputy secretary of health and social services, I have overseen  both workforce development and economic safety net programs.    I believe in work. We believe in work. However, the majority's  proposal would essentially force individuals off SNAP to pay for an  unproven, untested, severely underfunded program.   What happens if your child gets sick or your car breaks down? Should  that mean you and your child go hungry for up to a year if you are  sanctioned?   What makes this even more troubling is that the 10 pilot programs  designed to give us best practices in providing employment and training  services to SNAP recipients, one of which is in my home State of  Delaware, have not been completed or evaluated and won't be until at  least 2019.   Why are we putting the cart before the horse? If the majority is  really concerned with getting the policy right, why not wait until we  have the evidence and the data to make good use of taxpayer dollars?   To understand the impact on Delaware, I traveled across my State and  met with farmers, emergency food providers, supermarket owners, and  State agencies. But the conversation that surprised me the most was one  I had recently with a father. He shared how, years ago, SNAP and public  housing allowed him and his wife to raise three healthy daughters.  Because of support, he was the first in his family to graduate from  high school and college and, ultimately, to move out of poverty.   He paid that debt back in multiple ways through service. He went on  to become a social worker, a school administrator, and, subsequently,  was elected city council president.   The value of service was then passed down. One daughter went to work  in the White House and is now a professor of social work at Rutgers  University. The second daughter became an engineer and worked for the  U.S. Army, protecting our troops. And his oldest daughter grew up to be  a Congresswoman. That dad is my dad.   Colleagues, we still have a chance to go back to the drawing board.  The hopes, the dreams, the aspirations of 42 million people are in our  hands. Let's not let them down.                                time  1800
