 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Langworthy) for  yielding the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, here we are, 6 weeks into a new Congress, and the  Republican majority has yet to bring substantive, serious legislation  to the floor that does anything to address the serious issues  confronting our great Nation.   Instead, we have seen Republican leadership buckle under time and  again to the demands of a rightwing minority that seems more interested  in stoking controversy and conspiracy theories than crafting actual  legislation or governing.   Instead of delivering for the American people, we have seen precious  time and taxpayer dollars wasted in power struggles and political  stunts, rather than doing the people's business.   True to that pattern, today's rule provides for the consideration of  three deeply problematic measures, measures that further the objectives  of that extremist minority, measures that stoke division, that  undermine government institutions, and that threaten fundamental  American freedoms when they don't align with the radical right's  ideology.   By caving to these fringe forces, Republican leadership is  squandering precious time and taxpayer dollars that would be better  spent working together on the issues most Americans want us to address  lowering prices; housing, healthcare, and education needs; making our  communities safer; and protecting our planet.   The first two resolutions under consideration today would nullify  legislation recently passed by the democratically elected D.C. Council  and, in the process, would undermine the fundamental right of citizens  of Washington, D.C., to political self-determination.                                time  1245    H.J. Res. 24 would overrule the Local Resident Voting Rights Act,  which was recently passed by the D.C. Council.   With this measure, the citizens of D.C. decided to join other  municipalities around the country in allowing noncitizen residents to  vote in local D.C. elections.   H.J. Res. 26 would nullify the Revised Criminal Code Act, the RCCA,  which reformed D.C.'s criminal code. That code has not been  comprehensively revised since it was first enacted in 1901.  [[Page H722]]    The American people expect their Members of Congress to prioritize  their most pressing kitchen table issues, but instead of focusing on  lowering costs or creating better-paying jobs, we are here today to  interfere with legislation duly enacted by the citizens of D.C. and  their government.   Not only is that not what our constituents sent us to do, it is  distinctly antidemocratic to substitute our policy judgment for the  local policy judgment of D.C.'s elected officials.   The nearly 700,000 residents of the District of Columbia, a majority  of whom are Black and Brown, are worthy and capable of self-government.   Instead of seeking to undo the work of that democratically elected  body, we should be holding hearings and considering whether it is  finally time to address the issue of D.C. statehood.   As my colleague, Mr. Raskin, said in the Rules Committee yesterday,  if my Republican colleagues insist on acting as a colonial overseer of  the District of Columbia, the least they can do is hear from the people  of D.C.   Those promoting these resolutions should have called a hearing or at  least attempted to engage the D.C. Council and community leaders in  some way.   If my colleagues think they have the best interests of the people of  D.C. at heart, let's hear from the D.C. residents.   I believe they have made it quite clear they don't appreciate being  made a pawn in national political battles.   We owe it to the people of D.C. to enact statehood, not this radical  attempt to interfere with the district's Democratic process.   The subject of these disapproval resolutions, the Revised Criminal  Code Act and Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act, should be  irrelevant.   But just so we are clear, let's look at the legislative history of  those two acts that our colleagues across the aisle want to overturn.   Under the D.C. Home Rule Act, which is a Federal statute, the  democratically elected 13-member D.C. Council is required to enact a  new law twice, with at least 13 days intervening between each vote, in  order to pass legislation.   Legislation passed by the council and affirmed by the Mayor or with a  veto override is then transmitted to Congress for a review period.   The legislation takes effect at the expiration of the review period  unless Congress intervenes by passing a resolution of disapproval.   Congress has only overturned duly elected D.C. laws three times  before the misguided efforts that we are forced to consider today.   Now, the D.C. Council passed the Revised Criminal Code Act by votes  of 12-0 and 13-0. While the Mayor vetoed it, the council voted to  override that veto by a vote of 12-1.   The Revised Criminal Code Act is the culmination of a 5-year process  to revise and update D.C.'s criminal code, which, as mentioned  previously, has not happened since it was first created over a century  ago.   Everyone in the D.C. legal system, from prosecutors to judges to  defense attorneys to scholars, agrees that this revision is long  overdue.   Our colleagues across the aisle object to the revised criminal code  that has been crafted with so much care to meet local conditions  because they don't like some sentencing provisions that seek to match  up the law with current standards.   They posit that harsher penalties would be a greater deterrent to the  criminal conduct that they want to target when, in fact, the data shows  that harsher penalties in some of the States that they represent does  not, in fact, deter that conduct.   So think about this: Republican politicians from Georgia and Kentucky  and Texas, who haven't bothered to take the time to hold a hearing or  study this issue, have decided to parachute in and dictate to the  700,000 residents of D.C. that they know better than those residents  and their elected Representatives how to run their city.   Can you imagine how those politicians would react if the D.C. Council  tried to tell them how to run the jails in Athens, Georgia; Lexington,  Kentucky; or Buffalo, New York?   What is particularly infuriating is that our Republican colleagues  claim that they want to block the D.C. law because they want to be  tougher on crime. But, once again, this is empty rhetoric. Overturning  the D.C. criminal code will do nothing to increase public safety in  D.C. or anywhere else.   As I mentioned at the outset, we are 6 weeks into the new Congress,  and the Republican majority has not brought forward any legislation to  address crime in America.   They won't consider legislation to block the flood of unregulated  guns into American communities, they won't ban the weapons of war that  take innocent lives in horrifying and predictably regular mass  shootings, and they haven't taken any action to address the societal  issues that produce violence.   The second resolution under consideration would vacate the Local  Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act, which the D.C. Council passed by  votes of 12-1 and 12-0 after holding hearings and soliciting public  comment.   This act would allow otherwise qualified D.C. residents who are not  U.S. citizens to vote in local D.C. elections.   Qualified noncitizen residents could vote in races for Mayor,  council, attorney general, neighborhood commissioners, school district,  and local referenda.   Of course, this does not apply to Federal elections. Our colleagues  are trying to paint this legislation as some radical new idea, but  there is nothing in the U.S. Constitution--which I understand was read  here on the floor today, so we could check--that prohibits noncitizens  from voting in local, State, or Federal elections.   In fact, there is a long history in the U.S. of noncitizens being  allowed to vote in those elections, and they have done so since at  least 1704 in what would later become the U.S. At various points, 40  States have permitted noncitizens to vote. Congress only first  prohibited noncitizens from voting in Federal elections in 1996.   Currently, there are at least 15 municipalities that permit  noncitizens to vote in local elections. They do so in recognition of  the fact that noncitizens, who are allowed to vote under such local  laws, pay a variety of State, local, and Federal taxes, and they have  an inherent interest in helping to shape policies in the communities  where they live.   I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to oppose these profoundly  undemocratic and paternalistic resolutions.   Now, today's rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 185, which  would terminate the CDC requirement for proof of COVID-19 vaccination  for foreign travelers to enter the U.S.   The CDC order was put in place to open the world back up and allow  vaccinated foreign travelers to visit the U.S. while keeping our  community safe.   Revising or revoking the COVID-19 public health guidance should be at  the behest of public health experts with understanding and knowledge of  global case trends, up-to-date data, and real-time safety information  about emerging infections and COVID-19 epidemiology, not partisan  politicians looking to settle political scores or curry favor with the  disgraced former President and his base.   This bill would upend our current COVID-19 travel protocol, and  worse, tie the hands of our public health experts by prohibiting any  future order to require COVID-19 vaccinations as a condition of  entering the United States.   As I said last week when the majority brought several bills to the  floor attacking COVID-19 emergency declarations and vaccines, we  shouldn't jeopardize our progress in fighting COVID with political  stunts.   This is just the latest bill inspired by anti-vax conspiracy theories  that has been rushed to the floor, uninformed by any hearings or any  scientific evidence.   It is dangerous to repeatedly mislead the public about the efficacy  of these vaccines that are proven to save lives.   This bill increases the risk of spreading new variants, just as  hospitals and public health infrastructure are trying to rebuild.   Once again, an extremist fringe is putting politics over science and  undermining public health experts at the expense of the American  people, and Republican leadership is letting them get away with it.   We need Republican leaders to embrace science and promote the public  [[Page H723]]  good, instead of undermining them to score political points.   I am disappointed that my colleagues continue to waste this body's  time and taxpayer dollars on frivolous bills and resolutions.   Mr. Speaker, the resolutions and bill we are considering today do not  address the issues we were elected to address for the American people.   We have now been in this Congress for over a month and have yet to  take up any serious legislation. I hope my colleagues can work in a  bipartisan manner to address the problems our constituents sent us here  to solve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from The Sentencing  Project advocacy group, which is signed by over a dozen civil rights  organizations opposing the Republican efforts to obstruct the enactment  of the District of Columbia's Revised Criminal Code Act.   It states: ``Washingtonians know best how to address criminal justice  policies in their community and deserve the right to determine their  own laws. Local leaders are better positioned and retain more expertise  to address safety and justice issues in the District than Congress.''                                          The Sentencing Project,                                                   February 6, 2023.      Re Oppose efforts to obstruct the District of Columbia's           Revised Criminal Code Act.       Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Chairman Jim Jordan,      Judiciary Committee, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Jerry Nadler,      Judiciary Committee, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Speaker McCarthy and Minority Leader Jeffries: On       behalf of the undersigned organizations, we write to express       our opposition to efforts to obstruct the District of       Columbia's Revised Criminal Code Act, including any       resolution of disapproval or budget rider. The Revised       Criminal Code Act of 2022 (RCCA) is the product of 16 years       of research, an expert commission, 51 public meetings,       extensive public feedback, and robust negotiation. As such,       the D.C. Council voted unanimously to pass the RCCA and the       RCCA is supported by 83% of District voters. Opponents of the       RCCA, however, are spreading misinformation about the RCCA's       impact in a blatant attempt to erode home rule and trample on       the rights of District residents. We urge you to oppose these       attacks on the RCCA and vote against any resolution of       disapproval.        Washingtonians know best how to address criminal justice       policies in their community and deserve the right to       determine their own laws. Local leaders are better positioned       and retain more expertise to address safety and justice       issues in the District than Congress. Federal overstepping to       interfere with RCCA's implementation, which does not go into       effect until 2025, would be inappropriate and misguided. The       D.C. Council can continue to amend the RCCA, if desired, to       address stakeholder concerns.        The RCCA is a long-overdue modernization of the D.C.       Criminal Code. Since the 1960s, dozens of states have       embarked on criminal code reforms, removing obsolete       provisions, ensuring sentences are proportionate and       equitable, and simplifying overlapping charges. The RCCA       follows that trend--the District last comprehensively revised       the criminal code in 1901. A revision to reflect best       practices in sentencing and criminological evidence is       necessary to ensure justice, fairness, and safety in the       District. By ensuring the statutes are clear and       constitutional, the RCCA makes the law easier for police       officers, attorneys, and judges to understand and administer.        To arrive at that revision, the District engaged in a       thorough, transparent, and evidence-based process. The D.C.       Council created a Criminal Code Reform Commission (CCRC)       which prepared recommendations based on a review of recent       code reforms in other jurisdictions, current sentencing       practices in D.C. Superior Court, court data, recommendations       by the American Law Institute, social science, and the       current sentencing guidelines. The CCRC Advisory Group, whose       five voting members included representatives from the Office       of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, the Office       of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia, the       Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia, and two       professors from Georgetown University Law Center and George       Washington University Law School, unanimously voted to       approve the recommendations. The D.C. Council also made       numerous changes to the introduced version of the bill,       reflecting negotiations with the Metropolitan Police       Department, the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Office of the       Attorney General, the Public Defender Service, D.C. Superior       Court judges, and members of the community. As Mayor Bowser       acknowledged in her January 4, 2023 letter to D.C. Council       Chairman Phil Mendelson, there is ``consensus agreement'' on       ``95% of the bill.''        The RCCA is a balanced bill--bringing the District in line       with national sentencing norms by lengthening some sentences,       reducing some maximums, and other reforms. The RCCA includes       many modernizations, such as aligning D.C. with the majority       of the country by creating the right to a jury trial for       misdemeanors. The RCCA also lengthened sentences for several       offenses and permits enhancements and stacking that can make       the sentences much longer. The RCCA increases penalties for       possession of assault rifles, ghost guns, and restricted       explosive  [[Page H724]]       devices, to 4 years from 1 year under current law. It also       creates a new offense, endangerment with a firearm, which       criminalizes discharging a firearm in a public place, or in a       manner that creates a substantial risk of death.       Additionally, the RCCA reduced the statutory maximum for       certain offenses, in order to improve proportionality and       reflect current sentencing practices, which are typically       well below the maximum. As such, the sentence maximum changes       in the RCCA are not expected to lower sentences for serious       crimes. For example, the RCCA's 20-year maximum penalty for       robbery is seven times higher than the median sentence       imposed for robbery, and 11 years higher than the 97.5th       percentile sentence imposed for robbery. For robberies and       carjackings, over 97.5% of sentences currently imposed by       judges are lower than the maximum allowable penalty outlined       in the RCCA.        The people and leaders of the District support the RCCA.       The RCCA is also backed by an abundance of research, data,       and stakeholder feedback. Attempts by Congress to intervene       are rooted in efforts to end home rule and falsehoods. We       urge you to respect the will of Washingtonians and oppose all       efforts, whether a resolution of disapproval or budget rider,       to obstruct the RCCA.            Sincerely,        American Civil Liberties Union, American Civil Liberties       Union of the District of Columbia, Center for Disability       Rights, DC Justice Lab, Drug Policy Alliance, Due Process       Institute, FAMM, FWD.us, Justice Policy Institute, National       Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, National Council for       Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls,       NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, The Festival       Center, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights,       The Sentencing Project.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), our esteemed colleague.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am afraid we have to dig into the weeds a little bit with Rules  Committee process right now.   Earlier, the gentleman from New York said that with this rule, the  new majority has tied the number of times that more minority amendments  were made in order than majority amendments.   While I am certainly supportive of minority amendments, that sounded  wrong, so we asked our staff to check. They haven't had much time while  we have been speaking, but they have already found at least two times  that the Democratic majority did this in the last Congress, H.R. 302  and H.R. 963. Perhaps our colleagues need to check their facts.   What I do know is that this rule contains the 18th and 19th closed  rules of this new Congress. That is already over 30 percent of what we  did during the first year of the Democratic majority. So it is more  like a return to Republican habits, just like they ran the most-closed  Congress in history last time they had control.   I am also astonished to learn that it was the possibility of family  separation that inspired our colleagues to introduce H.R. 185, when the  issue of family separation due to our outmoded, broken immigration  system has not served to inspire any urgency to reform that system.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will  offer an amendment to the rule to ensure that H.R. 185 does not take  effect unless it is certified that it won't decrease Social Security  benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, Social Security is the bedrock of our  Nation's social safety net. Since its inception, it has lifted millions  of our seniors out of poverty. Protecting the benefits that Social  Security provides should be a priority for this Congress, for everyone  in this Congress, as my Republican colleagues demand reckless cuts in  exchange for paying our Nation's bills.   Democrats are going to continue to push to ensure that these vital  benefits are protected and will continue to give Republicans every  opportunity to ease the American people's anxiety by demonstrating with  their votes, including on this measure, that they do not intend to cut  Social Security.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Speaker, these measures today do nothing to address the important  issues facing American families. These resolutions are misguided and  unserious at best and deeply undemocratic at their core. House  Republicans continue to waste precious time and taxpayer dollars on  power struggles and political stunts.   Republican leadership's acquiescence to the fringe forces in their  party is a disservice to the American public. With all of the  challenges this Congress should contend with, an extremist overreach to  nullify democratically passed legislation and rolling back lifesaving  COVID protections is a waste of precious time and resources.   My Democratic colleagues and I are here to work on behalf of the  American people and are ready to do the serious work of delivering for  them, fighting for better jobs and safer communities. We will oppose  extremist attempts to stoke division, to undermine government  institutions, and to threaten fundamental American freedoms.   I invite my colleagues to work across the aisle, to work together on  the issues that matter to all of our constituents: lowering prices;  addressing housing, healthcare, and education needs; making our  communities safer; and protecting our environment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and  the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
