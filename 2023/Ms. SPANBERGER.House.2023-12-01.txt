 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  incredible service of John Shinholser.   Since 2004, John has served as the president and cofounder of The  McShin Foundation, a substance use disorder recovery organization that  provides lifesaving resources to Virginians who are struggling with  substance use disorder. These services range from medical detox to  sober living and from providing peer-to-peer mentorship to advocating  for more support for reentry services in jails and prisons.   John is a leader in this space, and from the day I first started in  politics, he wanted to make sure that helping those with substance use  disorder was a priority of mine.   Last year, John marked 40 years in recovery himself. He achieved  sobriety while he was serving in the United States Marine Corps in  1982, and he never looked back. For decades, he has used his own story  to empower others, to help them and their families to sustain their  recoveries.   He has treated substance use disorder as the illness that it is. With  his philosophy that substance use disorder is an illness, not a  character flaw, he and his wife, Carol McDaid, have reached tens of  thousands of Virginians. They have saved lives and saved families.   He might be retiring from leading The McShin Foundation, but I know  that he is far from retired when it comes to making a difference in our  community.   On behalf of a grateful Commonwealth and on behalf of every person  whose life he has impacted, including mine, I stand before the United  States House of Representatives in thanking John Shinholser for his  lifelong mission of helping others and our Nation.                            ____________________
