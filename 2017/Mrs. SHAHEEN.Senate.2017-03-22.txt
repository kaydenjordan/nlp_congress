 Mr. President, as ranking member of the U.S. Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is a privilege to  join Chairman Risch as we celebrate the first ever Small Business  Development Center Day, which will unite the more than 1,000 small  business development centers, SBDCs, across the country with the  hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs they have assisted in their 37- year history.   Small businesses are the engine of our economy, creating two out of  every three new jobs in the United States. As Chairman Risch stated,  since 1980, America's SBDCs have provided these small businesses with  high-quality, low- or no-cost consulting, and a variety of educational  programs across the country. Together with SBA's other resource  partners--women's business centers, veterans business outreach centers,  and SCORE chapters--SBDCs have enhanced the ability of America's small  businesses to grow and create jobs.   To provide some context for what this means to our economy, the  association representing SBDCs estimates that SBDC clients start a new  business every 30 minutes, create a new job every 5 minutes, generate  $100,000 in  [[Page S1931]]  new sales every 7.5 minutes, and raise $100,000 in capital every 11  minutes. Job growth for SBDC clients is nearly 10 times greater than  job growth for the average business.   Under the leadership of Dr. Richard Grogan, the New Hampshire SBDC  State director, New Hampshire SBDCs have helped thousands of small  business owners and entrepreneurs realize their dreams, start new  businesses, and create jobs. Last year alone, New Hampshire SBDC  counseled and trained more than 2,500 businesses and assisted in the  formation of more than $39 million in capital for New Hampshire's small  businesses.   For example, NH SBDC has been instrumental for Julie Lapham, the  founder and chief sales officer of a startup in Dover, NH, called  Popzup. Popzup is a family-owned business that provides a new popcorn  product for health-conscious consumers. As Julie explained it, her  local SBDC helped to prepare her for a Shark Tank-style pitch  competition in which she took home a first-prize award of $10,000. They  have helped her understand her financing options and continue to stay  involved and support her company's growth.   I hope my colleagues will join me and Chairman Risch in celebrating  SBDC Day and acknowledging their local SBDCs for their accomplishments  and the role that they play in helping small businesses create jobs.                            ____________________
