 Madam Speaker, today is a major day. Not as major as the  day we had about 10 days ago when the House passed, with bipartisan  support, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, but we are going to have a  bill signing in the White House in just a few minutes by President  Biden.   This is a big deal. We passed a bill that President Trump couldn't  pass with a Republican Congress and without a Republican Congress.  President Biden and this Congress passed it. It is going to mean road  repairs, bridge repairs, airport additions, bridge observations and  repairs. Ports in our country will be improved. Broadband will be  extended. The electric grid will be improved; people will get access.  This is what used to be bipartisan--people working together to get the  infrastructure of our country that moves goods to ports, goods to  people, makes our country tick, helps business, puts jobs together.   This is an important bill. The Democratic Congress with 13  Republicans passed it. It is a great day to celebrate. America is on  the move again.                            ____________________
