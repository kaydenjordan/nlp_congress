 Mr. President, yesterday the entire Senate had the  opportunity to meet in classified session for a briefing on election  security. We heard from the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI  Director, Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and  other key administration officials about our recent progress and  ongoing work to protect our democratic process from interference.   The takeaway was perfectly clear. After 2016, this new administration  kicked into high gear. Alongside our efforts in Congress, all levels of  government worked proactively to make sure that 2018 was not a repeat  of 2016.   Far from letting up, the executive branch is continuing to work hard  in advance of next year's Presidential election. We know our  adversaries will not be letting up, so we aren't letting up either.   I want to underscore my appreciation for the tremendous work that so  many officials across our government have been doing to protect our  democracy and impose costs on adversaries who dare to interfere.  Threats remain, but yesterday's briefing was an instructive  counterpoint to the doom and gloom hyperbole we often see in the media.   Good news doesn't sell newspapers. Although I doubt it would get much  coverage, I am proud of the work of our government and what they have  done to shore up our defenses of American democracy and deter foreign  influence and interference.   I believe our colleagues feel the same way. At one point during  yesterday's briefing, applause broke out in the room for the work of  one of our agencies--bipartisan applause in the briefing yesterday  about what was done in 2018, after which it was largely incident free.   Many of the details of yesterday's briefing were classified and  should remain so, but much of what was discussed were the specific  details and the full impact of steps that are already public knowledge.   Here in Congress, we have taken legislative action to enhance  interagency coordination on cybersecurity, expedite security clearances  for election officials, and allocate hundreds of millions of dollars in  direct aid to State election officials--direct aid to State election  officials.   With the new resources that we provided, the Department of Homeland  Security dramatically strengthened its information sharing and security  partnerships with the State and local authorities that operate  elections in the United States. Participation came from all 50 States  and 1,400 localities, and the direct aid to States helped the  authorities who were on the frontlines conducting elections update  their systems, strengthen their defenses, and maintain vigilance.   These and other actions have been part of a coordinated, government- wide, Federal, State, and local campaign to shore up our defenses. I  would anticipate that every Member who attended the classified briefing  likely  [[Page S4780]]  came away feeling confident that big steps forward have taken place in  the last 2\1/2\ years.   Thanks in large part to these measures, the 2018 elections went more  smoothly than 2016, and as we look to 2020, it is encouraging to learn  how seriously the administration is taking the threat and proactively  working to counter it because we know the threat is not going anywhere.  Foreign adversaries are going to keep at it, so I am glad the  administration is so focused on staying strong and remaining vigilant.   Of course, as I said yesterday, the roots of the issue run deeper  than our elections themselves. A foreign adversary like Russia didn't  just wake up one day in 2016 and decide to interfere in the American  democracy. The meddling was an outgrowth of a long pattern of weakness  and naivete that permeated all 8 years of the Obama administration.   Punching back against this misbehavior, and deterring future episodes  like it, has also meant taking broad steps to strengthen America's  posture abroad and to get more realistic about our relationship with  the Russians. Obviously, nearly 30 Russians and Russian corporations  have been indicted by the Special Counsel for election meddling.   More broadly, we have a new national security strategy--an improved  roadmap for our global presence that takes seriously the need to check  great power competitors like Russia and China.   We are recommitting to the alliances that preserve American values  around the world, reforming NATO to meet 21st century threats, and  equipping our allies and partners who are on the frontlines of Russia's  geopolitical prospecting. Congress and the administration have worked  together to restore our Armed Forces and unwind harmful funding  restrictions that cut readiness and limited our commanders. So not just  our efforts on election security but, really, our entire foreign policy  have made strides under the leadership of this administration.   To conclude, yesterday's briefing made it clear that our work has led  to huge progress--huge progress--but the work certainly isn't over.  Leaders across government are continuing to explore and repair  potential vulnerabilities and increase cooperation ahead of the 2020  Presidential election. Congress will certainly continue to monitor this  closely while resisting any efforts to use the failures of the past to  justify sweeping federalizations of election law, as some on the other  side have consistently sought to do.   Let me say that again. Congress will certainly continue to monitor  this closely while resisting any efforts to use the failures of the  past to justify sweeping federalizations of election law, as some on  the other side have consistently sought to do.   Make no mistake, many of the proposals labeled by Democrats to be  ``election security'' are measures, in fact, for election reform that  are part of the wish list of the left called the Democrat politician  protection act.   What they do is ignore the great work this administration has done  and sweep under the rug the necessary measures this Chamber has passed.   But speaking broadly, I think all Americans should remember this:  What Russia really set out to do was to sow division, spark doubt, and  trigger a crisis of confidence in our country that would extend far  beyond the actual actions that they undertook.   So as I have said before, as we continue taking action and shoring up  our defenses, it is also vital that we not fall into precisely-- precisely--the trap that Putin and company have laid. It is vital that  Americans not take the bait on fear and division and ultimately do  Russia's work for them.   Our country is strong. American democracy is strong. Our elections  are already safer and more secure, and the important work continues.  Our adversaries will not let up, so we are not letting up either.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, all week the Senate  has continued our productivity in overcoming partisan opposition and  confirming the President's well-qualified nominees for important  offices.   We have confirmed the newest judge on the Ninth Circuit. Yesterday we  confirmed three district judges by overwhelming bipartisan margins--78  to 15, 80 to 14, and 85 to 10. Those are the margins on three district  judges. Clearly, we are not exactly talking about radioactive,  controversial nominees here, not when 78 votes for confirmation is the  low end.   Nevertheless, as has become typical over the past 2\1/2\ years, our  Democratic colleagues insisted on cloture votes to cut off debate  before we could confirm any of them. In fact, we have yet to voice-vote  a single judicial nominee this entire Congress. We haven't voice-voted  a single judicial nominee this entire Congress.   It is really a shame. It is not the precedent the Senate ought to be  setting for these lower tier nominations. Of course, we have confirmed  them nonetheless.   Before the end of this week, the Senate will have done the same for  three other lower level nominees to the executive branch.   Weeks like this were impossible before my Republican colleagues and I  did the right thing for the institution a few months back and moved the  Senate back toward our historic norms for nominations of this sort. We  argued that Senate Democrats were mindlessly obstructing even the least  controversial nominees just for obstruction's sake.   Our colleagues across the aisle insisted, no, the majority would be  ramming through these extreme individuals and cutting off intense  debate that these extreme nominees deserve. Well, who is right? Well,  one more time for good measure: 78 to 15, 80 to 14, and 85 to 10.  Enough said.   It is particularly ironic that some of my friends across the aisle  elect to complain that the Senate is spending too much time on  nominations--the Presiding Officer has heard that--spending too much  time on nominations. I am not making this up. We actually hear  protestations from the Democratic side that confirming these men and  women is taking too long, as though it weren't totally obvious to  everyone that their own unprecedented delaying tactics are the only  reason these nominees have not been quickly confirmed in big batches on  a voice vote.   It is quite the two-step: Democrats systemically drag their heels for  2\1/2\ years and counting and then complain we are not moving fast  enough. Well, if it weren't clear by now, the tactics are not going to  work. The Senate is going to press on. We are going to do our job.   Today, we will press on despite 492 days of obstruction--492 days of  obstruction--and confirm Peter Wright, the President's nominee to serve  as--listen to this--an Assistant Administrator at EPA. He has been  waiting for 492 days.   As it happens, we will also vote on two Kentuckians--Robert King and  John Pallasch. Mr. King has been nominated to serve as Assistant  Secretary for Postsecondary Education. He comes with an impressive  record of experience in higher education administration and advocacy at  home in the Bluegrass State and beyond. Mr. Pallasch has been tapped  for Assistant Secretary of Labor. His resume includes service as  director of the Kentucky Office of Employment and Training as well as  previous service with the Department as Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Mine Safety and Health.   I will be proud to support each of these well-qualified nominees as  their senior Senator from Kentucky but moreover as someone who believes  that the American President deserves to have his team in place and that  citizens ought to be governed by the government they actually voted  for.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
