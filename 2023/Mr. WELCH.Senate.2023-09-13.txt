 Madam President, I am delighted to be here with my  colleagues, the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Kansas.   I am going to start by answering a question that the Senator from  Kansas asked rhetorically: Why is it that American citizens and  consumers and merchants pay seven times what is paid by merchants and  individuals in Europe? It is because our government doesn't protect our  consumers. Our government is not protecting our merchants and our small  businesses.   Where there is a monopoly or, in this case, a duopoly and there is  this massive pricing power that Visa and Mastercard have, they are  doing what monopolies and duopolies do. They abuse that pricing power,  and they just stick it to our merchants. It was $33 billion in charges  in 2013, and it is $93 billion in charges now. And it is not as though  the expenses for Visa and Mastercard have really gone up anything close  to that.  [[Page S4430]]    Inflation is their ally, as the Senator said. COVID was their ally,  as we had to rely more on those cards. And they justify what they are  doing because it is a convenience for the shopper. You know what, it is  a convenience for the shopper. It is a convenience for the merchant.  But how does that justify a rip-off just because you are doing  something that we need?   And it is folks in Kansas who voted for my Republican colleague, it  is folks in Illinois who voted for my Democratic colleague, and it is  all of the people we represent, not only these small businesses that  are absolutely essential to our local economy and to the vitality of  our small communities.   We were at that press conference, and Senator Marshall's grocery  store folks were here. They were salt of the Earth. They were like--the  highest compliment I can give: They are almost like Vermonters, all  right. They were terrific people. And we had a father, and we had the  son who was going into the family business, and the family business is  about serving people in that community.   And we have got a store in Vermont, Dan & Whit's, which has been  there for generations, and its motto is, ``If we don't have it, you  don't need it.'' And you can basically get anything you want. But, do  you know, during COVID, when they had these incredible challenges with  workforce, they actually put an ad on the signboard, and retired folks  from Norwich would come help do the work, stack the shelves, and do the  checkout.   And when a lot of my neighbors found out that every time a customer  used a credit card it was costing Dan & Whit's 2 to 3 to 4 percent just  so they would pay the bill, they were shocked and appalled. And this  store, like the Senator's store in Kansas, all of them--retail is hard.  That is such hard work. You have got to watch your costs. You have got  to save your money. You have got to provide really good service.   And Senator Durbin mentioned the second highest expense for many of  these small merchants is the cost of the credit card, paying the bill.  And it is invisible to most of us when we use our card, because I  always thought, if I use my card and I pay my bill, I am not going to  have to pay those 25 percent interest rates. But when I found out about  what was going on, how much the merchants were getting ripped off, it  actually was the last time we had over $4 gas and I was filling up at  my local small convenience store, and I went in and talked to the  owner. I got my coffee and got a doughnut. But he got out his bill, and  he showed me that when I filled up the tank of gas, with the swipe fee  and then the percentage that was taken out--and a very, very small  margin on the sale of a gallon of gas for these stores--he was losing  money. Visa and Mastercard were doing fine, but my local merchant was  losing money.   And the thing that I so enjoy about being with my colleagues here and  Senator Vance on this bill is, at the heart of this, we understand  that, in rural America and smalltown America and in neighborhoods even  in big cities like Chicago, these local stores, these merchants, they  give us so much service and so much emotional satisfaction. It is where  you stop in, you talk to folks you see every day, you share the stories  about who won, what happened to the Bears, what happened to the  Patriots. But we need those places. Our communities, democratic life  need those places.   And this is not a Democratic-Republican deal. All of the people we  represent and all of America want to have a sense of community, and who  more than our local merchants, who oftentimes live above the store,  right? I mean, a pretty tough job.   They come down, sweep it up in the beginning and at the end. They  give kids their first jobs. So many high school kids work in these  stores, and they learn how to be good employees, how to do good  customer service. The ability to hire these kids gets compromised  because of this extra expense.   And, really, what are they doing? We are paying a bill, all right.  They have got incredible intellectual property. They have got security  systems and all of that. It is good. It is a service.   So no dispute there. But just because you are providing a service  doesn't entitle you to rip off everyday merchants because you can.   And the question that I think we have to ask as the U.S. Senate is,  What is our job and whom do we work for? Our job is not to pad the  already obscene profits of Visa and Mastercard. Our job is to protect  our merchants who are doing the work day in and day out and our  consumers who are doing their best to stay afloat, pay their bills, get  from one end of the month to the other, and hope their checks clear and  they can pay their credit card bill.   Our obligation is to the people who have no power but who do have a  right to expect that their elected Representatives and Senators, when  they see a rip-off, will call it a rip-off and stand up and say: You  are going to get treated fairly.   And that is essential for restoring our trust and faith in one  another. It is essential for our obligation to help communities that  are working so hard to create a sense of place that people want, a  sense of connection that we want, to make certain that those businesses  that are doing so much in all of our communities--that are doing so  much in all of our communities--can keep doing that work that is  strengthening communities, providing good jobs to our kids.   And do you know what? Let's act. Let's pass Senator Durbin's and  Senator Marshall's bill, and let's protect our merchants against these  rip-off credit card fees from Visa and Mastercard.   I yield back.    Madam President, I rise today to recognize Dan Fraser,  manager of Dan & Whit's General Store, who will be stepping down from  his role. Dan & Whit's is a family-owned general store and the  unofficial community center of my town, Norwich,  [[Page S4438]]  VT. Dan & Whit's is a local institution, carrying products from coffee  to nails, breakfast sandwiches to rubber gloves. As one employee  stated, ``Dan & Whit's is the heartbeat of this community''--and I  could not agree more.   For decades, Dan Fraser has been an integral member of the Norwich  community. Since he was in fourth grade, Dan has been working at the  general store, named for his grandfather Dan Fraser, and has been a  full-time employee since 1990. Dan's philanthropy and dedication to his  community, whether it be on the Harford Town Selectboard or in special  education, exemplifies what it means to be a community leader.   Small businesses are the heart and soul of small towns and rural  communities. Small businesses account for 99 percent of all businesses  in Vermont, and our State serves as a model for the Nation,  highlighting that local communities are at their best when small  businesses are given the resources they need to thrive. Supporting our  neighbors and supporting local businesses is the Vermont way. The town  of Norwich is a better place because of Dan & Whit's.   The COVID-19 pandemic made clear what Vermonters already knew: Small  businesses and general stores are essential to our communities. The  sacrifices that Dan & Whit's made during the pandemic, including a  grocery delivery fund for folks who lost their jobs as a result of the  pandemic, illustrate the store's commitment to serving the community.  Even when staffing shortages nearly forced the store to close, they  made sure to meet the community where they were and did all they could  to ensure the community could thrive in trying times.   Margaret and I will miss the warm welcome from Dan when we visit the  store. His ability to always point us to what we need underscores the  store's slogan: ``If we don't have it, you don't need it.'' While the  store may no longer have Dan, the Norwich community will always need  him. His enthusiasm and passion for his community will be especially  missed, along with his colorful and lively shirts and shoes.   Dan has served his community well, and Margaret and I are wishing him  well in his next chapter of life.                            ____________________
