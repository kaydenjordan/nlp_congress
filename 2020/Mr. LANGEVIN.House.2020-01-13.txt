 Madam Speaker, every young person needs a mentor,  someone to provide real-life guidance as they navigate the challenging,  formative years of youth. Mentoring is closely linked with positive  behaviors, including school attendance, regular volunteering, and  college enrollment. Unfortunately, one in three young people in America  is growing up without a mentor.   During National Mentoring Month this January, I rise to honor the  organizations, mentors, and others who are working every day to close  this gap--organizations like MENTOR Rhode Island and Big Brothers Big  Sisters of Rhode Island. I am proud to represent them as a member of  the Congressional Youth Mentoring Caucus and to push for strong funding  for youth mentoring each and every year.   Madam Speaker, our young people are our most precious resource, and  it is our duty to support them and the mentors who help them thrive.                            ____________________
