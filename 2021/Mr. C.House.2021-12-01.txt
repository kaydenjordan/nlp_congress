 Scott  Franklin).    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I appreciate you  recognizing me for a couple of moments here, a fellow friend from just  up I-75 in central Florida.    Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of every American taxpayer who  is infuriated by the wasteful spending of our government. For many  months now, Republicans like me have been taking to the floor to sound  the alarm on the Biden administration's ridiculous and wasteful  spending.   As hardworking Americans are struggling with the highest inflation in  over 30 years, President Biden wants to continue doling out taxpayer  money by the billions--to things like tree equity and studies to  determine the effect of climate change on lactating individuals.   We have all been taught there is no such thing as a free lunch. When  your government is spending money it doesn't have, like it is going out  of style, you better hold on to your wallet.   The Washington Times recently reported more than 40 percent of the  $700 billion in COVID unemployment benefits went to fraudsters,  including many connected to state sponsors in China and Russia.   For context, the relief money lost to fraud could have provided  $160,000 to every American family living under the poverty line or paid  for an Ivy league education for every 18-year-old in the country.  Instead, this money now sits in the coffers of our enemies who will  surely use it against us.   It is bad enough that irresponsible Democrat policies have created  inflation that is hurting American families, but the lack of oversight  of hundreds of billions of dollars means that we are funding our  enemies.   This kind of fraud, waste, and abuse should be thoroughly  investigated by Congress. Unfortunately, Republicans are in the  minority, for now, we don't have the authority to determine which  investigations will be held.   I hope my Democrat colleagues share my concern and outrage. What they  do with this information will tell us all we know about how they feel  about squandering hard-earned taxpayer dollars.   The American people deserve answers and a solution that ensures fraud  like this can never happen again.    Scott Franklin of Florida, Mr. Issa, Mr.       Meuser, and Mr. Gimenez.
