 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3706. Under longtime  Federal law, counties located within the National Forest System have  received a share of revenues generated through the sale of timber  harvested from those Federal lands.   This revenue has been critical for forested counties to support  schools, roads, law enforcement, search-and-rescue operations, and  other local activities that benefit both our forests and rural  communities.   However, with the sharp decline in timber harvesting across the  National Forest System since the early 1990s, rural counties have seen  revenues for schools and other important local services plummet as a  result.   To offset this lost revenue, Congress created the Secure Rural  Schools program in 2000 to provide additional funding to participating  counties based on their average historical timber payments.   In my own district in north Florida, Putnam County and Marion County  have received a combined total of more than $624,000 through the Secure  Rural Schools program, thanks to the sale of timber harvested out of  the Ocala National Forest.                                time  1515    In rural counties like Putnam, this funding provides support for the  county's schools, roads, and other critical services. It is no  different in Marion County.   The recent infrastructure bill, signed into law this past November,  reauthorized the Secure Rural Schools for the next 3 years. However,  due to a drafting error, this reauthorization did not lock in the  payment allocations that participating counties last elected in 2013.   Consequently, payments for this spring will revert to their default  levels in permanent law. This means that county allocations will revert  to 80 percent for Title I, 20 percent for Title II, and zero percent  for Title III.   To correct this problem, S. 3706 will lock in the 2013 elections for  the coming year. In doing so, the bill will provide certainty and  consistency for county payments that will be made in the coming months.   Fundamental errors like this demonstrate how flawed and rushed the  process was to pass the infrastructure bill this last year. It also  demonstrates the need for committee consideration and why committees  should not be bypassed before bringing a bill to the floor.   However, given the great importance of county payments to both  forested counties and rural school districts around the Nation, I  support this commonsense technical fix and urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.''   As we continue to consider how to best steward our national forests  and support forested communities, I would like to add that increasing  timber harvesting across the National Forest System will better support  these counties and reduce the need for this program in the long run.   Regardless of what the critics say, timber harvesting will encourage  forest health and will help prevent the devastating wildfires that have  torn through America's forests in recent years. Our forests are an  important pillar for our rural economies and provide much-needed  revenue to our local counties and schools, like those in my own  district.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
