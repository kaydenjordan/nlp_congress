 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for the  opportunity to come and talk about this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition. It has been noted this  morning, the legislation that we are considering today doesn't just  reverse the Supreme Court's recent ruling of Roe v. Wade, it goes much  further.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have assembled this  bundle of policies in an effort to undermine the enforcement of pro- life State laws.   As the Republican whip just pointed out a little earlier, in  combination with what is called the so-called Women's Health Protection  Act, it seeks to undermine the will of the people, and places the U.S.  on a short list with North Korea and China as countries with the most  extreme abortion policies in the world. We don't want to be on a list  with those two countries.   Instead of undermining State law, we should be enabling States that  have chosen to extend the responsibility of protecting its citizens to  also include the unborn.   The Alabama legislature enacted the Human Life Protection Act in  2019, reflecting the will of the citizens of the State. I cannot allow  those voices to be silenced by radical Federal abortion bills.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure that we  are voting on this morning, and all of the extreme measures yet to come  attacking the most vulnerable among us.
