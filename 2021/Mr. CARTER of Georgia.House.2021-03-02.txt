 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  the underlying bill. This legislation masquerades as a fix to the  country's election concerns. However, that couldn't be further from the  truth.   This bill relaxes ethics requirements with a change in  administration. It forces taxpayers to subsidize elections and election  outreach. It compromises  [[Page H995]]  States' rights and leaves Washington as the arbiter of managing  elections, which runs against the Constitution. It would limit free  speech and weaken the First Amendment protections that everyone here  holds in such high regard.   This legislation compromises State voter ID integrity laws and moves  to roll back the important work that has been done in this space. It  alters the Federal Election Commission's makeup and effectively limits  any bipartisan consensus or work that can be done.   This isn't a bipartisan bill intended to unite the country and mend  concerns about elections. No, this is another partisan package that was  rushed to the floor and, subsequently, could have serious consequences  for our constituents and our Nation.   This bill will weaken what many States are doing to improve election  security and establishes a dangerous precedent for the involvement of  Federal agencies in election issues.   For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the  underlying bill.
