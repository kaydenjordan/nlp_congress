 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the life and legacy of  Charles Page, a true public servant who considered himself so blessed  that he went by the nickname of Mr. Lucky.   But it goes without saying that all of us benefited from Charlie's  generosity and willingness to give back to the place that we call home.   He came to the Monterey Peninsula as a young airman assigned to the  Defense Language Institute. He stayed there, built his life there, and  continued to serve there as a two-term city councilman, as the  president of the Association of Monterey Bay Area Government, and as  the founder of the Monterey County Legal Aid Society, as well as the  founder of the Monterey Peninsula College Foundation.   Charlie understood the value of junior colleges, not just for  students, but for the entire community.   He inspired people to get involved, including myself. I will never  forget when I received a phone call out of the blue asking me when I  was going to get involved, when I was going to serve.   I believe that that call sparked the beginning of my career in  service.   Mr. Speaker, for that and all of his contributions to our community  and country, I recognize Charlie Page, for we are all blessed and lucky  to know him.                            ____________________
