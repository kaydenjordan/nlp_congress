 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Mr. Albert Shelander, a courageous veteran and dedicated  community developer.   At just 18, he served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, spending  2 years on the USS Janssen destroyer escort in the Philippines. Upon  coming home, he attended Emory University, where he served as the  captain of the college's golf team.   After graduating, Albert dedicated his life to making good things  happen in Glynn County. For 25 years, he served as director of the  American National Bank of Brunswick and helped develop hundreds of  acres of real estate throughout Brunswick and St. Simons Island.   As a member of the Salvation Army, he rang the bell regularly at  Christmas and also served as senior warden at his local church for 6  years.   Albert founded a 150-unit retirement home in Brunswick and directed  its growth for 40 years.   He was also an active leader in the Museum of Coastal History, Glynn  County Chamber of Commerce, Brunswick Rotary Club, and Brunswick  Country Club.   There is no doubt that Albert's involvement in our community helped  shape thousands of lives for the better, and I mourn his passing  greatly.        Congratulating Savannah Christian High School Girls' Golf Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Savannah Christian High School girls' golf team on their 2023 AAA State  championship win.   As a team, the girls had a combined final score of 488, winning the  tournament by a very impressive 52-stroke margin. Not only was this a  very decisive victory, but it also marked their second State title in a  row.   This impressive athletic achievement was a team effort led by golfers  such as Mary Miller, who had a score of 64 in one round followed by a  score of 73, and sophomore Ava Cottis, who scored an also impressive 81  and 74.   I also recognize Coach Annie Keller, who was recently named the  Savannah Morning News Girls Golf Coach of the Year. I know her coaching  was essential for this victory.   I am so proud of these young women, and I know they will continue to  represent their school well on and off the golf course.                                time  1030                         Congratulating Terry Tolbert     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr.  Terry Tolbert on his 50th anniversary working at The Economic  Opportunity Authority of Savannah-Chatham County.   Mr. Tolbert has truly been promoting positive change his entire life.  He grew up in Savannah near Crawford Square, where he began his career  with EOA as a teenager, eventually becoming the youngest member on  their board of directors.   He also served on the Region IV Youth Council, covering eight  southern states.   With each year that passed, Mr. Tolbert's impact grew as he  implemented programs to help the disenfranchised, such as the homeless,  veterans, foster grandparents, and low-income families.   He has an infectious can-do attitude and always emphasizes the  importance of never giving up.   Mr. Tolbert now serves as the executive director of the EOA, and  after 50 years, he is still working tirelessly to help people climb out  of poverty.   His expertise speaks for itself, and I thank him for touching the  lives of so many in the Savannah area.  [[Page H2771]]                                ____________________
