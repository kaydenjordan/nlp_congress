 Mr. Speaker, at this crucial moment, the United States  must support our democratic ally Ukraine. Stopping the Russian invasion  is critically important, because right now democracy worldwide is under  attack.   Helping Ukraine defeat Putin will make clear that the United States,  our allies, and democracies everywhere will not tolerate the invasion  of sovereign nations by bad actors.   We must also recognize the common thread between what is happening in  Ukraine and what is happening in Israel. Iran is supporting dictators  and terrorists who seek the destruction of democracy around the globe.   Iran funds and trains Hamas terrorists and sends weapons to Russian  [[Page H6966]]  forces as they inflict horrors upon civilians.   Let's be clear: If we allow Russia to win this war, the attacks on  democratic nations will not stop there. The United States will  undoubtedly be pulled into future global conflicts.   Now, more than ever, we must support our democratic allies in their  fight against evil. Congress must recognize the urgency of this issue  and send aid to our democratic allies immediately.                            ____________________
