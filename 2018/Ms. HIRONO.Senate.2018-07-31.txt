 Mr. President, I would like to start by thanking Senator  Wyden for his leadership in the fight to protect Medicare and Medicaid  and for organizing this time for us to speak on this important subject.   I grew up in a three-generation household. My 93-year-old great- grandmother lived with us for over 20 years, and my grandmother lived  with us until she was 98. So I, of all people, of course know the  importance of Medicare to our seniors.   On May 7, 2015--a full 3 months before he descended a golden  escalator to launch his campaign--Donald Trump bragged on Twitter about  how he was ``the first and only'' Republican candidate to run for  President to state that ``there will be no cuts to Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid.''   He made, and repeated, that promise for a reason.   All across the country, we know Americans across party lines care  deeply about healthcare and expect their Members of Congress to protect  their healthcare.   Millions of Americans receive their healthcare through Medicaid and  Medicare. These two programs have helped tens of millions of Americans  since their creation 53 years ago. Medicare provides quality health  insurance for millions of seniors, and Medicaid helps them afford  nursing home care and other services when they need it.   Medicaid has served working families and the poor who otherwise  couldn't afford healthcare coverage, helping to bring our uninsured  rate to a historic low, and Medicaid is currently helping tens of  thousands of Americans receive drug treatment amidst the ongoing opioid  epidemic.   Again, it isn't surprising that Donald Trump pledged to protect these  programs while campaigning for President. They are wildly popular  programs for a reason, but it also isn't surprising that almost  immediately after his election, Donald Trump reneged on his promise to  protect Medicare and Medicaid. It began when he appointed Tom Price-- the architect of plans to dismantle Medicare and Medicaid--to serve as  his Secretary of Health and Human Services.   It continued when the President and congressional Republicans sought  to eliminate the Medicaid expansion and cut hundreds of billions of  dollars in Medicaid funding during the push to repeal the Affordable  Care Act--the ACA.   It continued when the administration issued new rules that allowed  States to implement arbitrary work requirements for Medicaid. Four  States have already taken advantage of this new authority. If the rest  of the country follows their lead, between 1 million and 4 million  Americans will lose their healthcare coverage.   It continued when the President proposed turning Medicare into a  voucher program, converting Medicaid to a block grant, and cutting  nearly $2 trillion from both programs as part of his fiscal year 2019  budget.   These changes and cuts would have a devastating impact on the  hundreds of thousands of Hawaii residents who depend on these programs  for their healthcare and their long-term care needs.   Medicaid, for example, serves around 350,000 Hawaii residents,  including 38 percent of all the children in Hawaii and 15 percent of  seniors, as well as people with disabilities across our State. These  cuts would be particularly devastating to Hawaii residents who access  healthcare through our Federally Qualified Community Health Centers,  many of which depend on reimbursements through Medicaid to provide  high-quality care to those in need.   During the height of the debate to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I  spoke with Sheila Beckham, the CEO of Waikiki Health on Oahu. Waikiki  Health operates a network of health centers and shelters in Honolulu  that cater to high-risk populations, including a significant number of  patients living with HIV and AIDS. If the President and congressional  Republicans had succeeded in cutting Medicaid, Sheila would have had to  lay off between 80 to 100 workers and close all but two of the clinics  she operates.   Medicaid cuts would have also had a significant impact on women's  health outcomes throughout Hawaii. Last year, I shared a story about a  young woman named Anne, who walked into the Kokua Kalihi Valley Clinic  3 years ago. She had no health insurance, and she was pregnant at the  age of 15. The doctors at the clinic helped Anne apply for Medicaid,  which helped her afford prenatal care and gave her support to stay  healthy and in school. Medicaid helped Anne and her husband Dan, age  17, welcome a healthy baby boy named Joseph. Today, Anne is a graduate  of Farrington High School, she works part-time and has plans to become  a pediatric nurse practitioner. Her family now has health insurance  through Dan's employer.   Medicaid also plays a crucial role in providing long-term nursing  care for seniors who otherwise would not be able to afford it. I know  how important this is for our seniors in Hawaii because we have in  Hawaii the fastest growing aging population in the entire country.  Across our State, Medicaid provides coverage for three in five nursing  home residents. At Hale Makua on Maui, that number is closer to 80  percent, and without Medicaid, many of the residents would not be able  to afford to stay there.   One story that has stuck with me came from Keith Moniz. After working  as a custodian for more than 40 years at St. Anthony's School, Keith's  brother Lester lost his job and his health insurance. Only a few short  months later, Keith's brother Lester had a debilitating stroke that  left him permanently disabled. Fortunately, Lester  [[Page S5490]]  was able to obtain Medicaid coverage and is now a long-term resident at  Hale Makua.   Keith was very clear about what would have happened to his brother if  the President had succeeded in making large cuts to Medicaid. Keith  said:         It would be devastating. We had a difficult time taking       care of him when he was at home, and he's gotten the care       that he needs at Hale Makua. It would be a big loss. . . . I       don't know what we could do, where we would be able to move       him to.    Our seniors--in Hawaii we call them kupuna--would also be  significantly harmed by the President's plan to voucherize and make  huge cuts to Medicare. More than 230,000 kupuna--our seniors in  Hawaii--or 17 percent of our State's population are covered by  Medicare. Through its payments to providers and purchases of medical  equipment, Medicare generates $2.5 billion for Hawaii's economy.   Our kupuna are already struggling with the rising cost of living and  nearly 9 percent of them live in poverty. Many more are living on fixed  incomes and would be especially vulnerable to rising costs under the  President's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program.   Last year, I shared the story of Lanny and Anne Bruner from Kauai.  Lanny is 80 years old, but he is still working three jobs to make ends  meet after losing the family home during the 2008 mortgage crisis. His  wife Anne has glaucoma and pays what she calls a ``ridiculous amount''  for eye drops. Lanny had a heart attack and two knee replacements. Like  many of our kupuna living on a fixed income, they simply could not  afford to pay the extra money they would be forced to pay if  Republicans succeed in their effort to privatize Medicare.   These stories underscore the importance of and the need for Congress  to pass specific legislation to protect Medicare and Medicaid from  partisan attacks from Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. This  week, I will be introducing new legislation that would prohibit  Congress from making devastating cuts to Medicare and Medicaid through  the budget reconciliation process. It accomplishes this objective by  requiring any legislation that seeks to make certain changes to  Medicare or Medicaid to receive 60 votes in the Senate before such  changes can be implemented. Of course, these changes include increasing  the Medicare eligibility age, privatizing or turning Medicare into a  voucher program, block granting or imposing per capita caps on  Medicaid, and rolling back the ACA's Medicaid expansion.   My legislation builds on the success of an amendment I introduced  with my colleague from Indiana, Senator Donnelly, during last January's  budget debate to protect these programs. Although our amendment did not  pass--it came pretty close--two Republicans joined us in supporting it.  It is nice to know some of my Republican colleagues are concerned about  seniors, children, and working families who rely on Medicare and  Medicaid every single day.   I think it is just astonishing that as we are talking about cutting  Medicare and Medicaid for millions of seniors throughout our country,  and hundreds of thousands in Hawaii, these kinds of changes are being  proposed by the very President and the people in Congress who gave the  richest 1 percent of the people in our country and corporations a  huge--a huge--tax break. By the way, the President is talking about  giving the rich people in our country even more of a tax cut. It is  just astounding to me that while all of that is happening on the one  hand, on the other hand, they propose changes to two huge programs that  millions of people in our country rely on. Where are our priorities?  They are definitely misplaced if we go along with these schemes.   I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this  fight to protect these critical social safety net programs.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the life and public  service of Laura Efurd who passed away on July 2, 2018.   Losing someone as hard-working, level-headed, and good humored as  Laura is not easy. I was proud that Laura was willing to return to  public service as my State administrative manager. She provided a  steady, experienced hand, and balanced it with her kindness and genial  nature. Her regular, day-to-day presence helped me and my staff a great  deal. We miss her.   Laura had a life well-lived. She was born in Kona, HI and raised in  Mililani.   Laura left Hawaii for college at Ouachita Baptist University in  Arkadelphia, and earned a master's degree from American University in  Washington, DC. She established herself professionally on Capitol Hill  working first for Congressman Robinson from Arkansas, then as  legislative director for almost 9 years to my friend, Congresswoman  Patsy T. Mink of Hawaii.   Patsy was well known for standing up for underserved communities,  including women and minorities, and a tireless fighter for social  justice and expanding access to quality health care and education.  While Patsy was a force of nature, we all know what an important role  that staff plays in a congressional office to support and execute the  work of their Members. As legislative director, Laura was instrumental  in working with Patsy. She helped spearhead the establishment of the  Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, CAPAC, founded by  Representative Mink and Norm Mineta, D-CA, in 1994. Laura served as the  caucus's primary staffer during Representative Mink's term as chair.  CAPAC's creation helped to initiate and provide a much needed voice for  the AAPI community in Congress. At its start, CAPAC was made up of two  Senators and five AAPI House Members representing Hawaii, California,  American Samoa, and Guam. Since then, the caucus has grown to 22  members, with 3 Senators and 19 House Members representing 10 States  and territories.   Laura was also a founding member of the Congressional Asian Pacific  American Staff Association, CAPASA, and helped to support the  internships that CAPASA sponsors through the Asian Pacific American  Institute for Congressional Studies.   Through her commitment to public service--particularly in the Asian  American and Pacific Islanders, AAPI, community--a greater number of  individuals have had the opportunity to realize their dream of service  to our Nation.   After nearly a decade serving on the Hill, Laura moved to the  executive branch, where she served in the U.S. Department of Labor  before working in the Clinton White House. There, as Deputy Director of  the Office of Public Liaison, she worked to build bridges for the AAPI  community across the country into the highest levels of our Nation's  government. She helped to identify and confirm key AAPI appointments  and was instrumental in the creation of the White House Initiative on  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, another institution to expand  opportunity to the AAPI community that is still in existence today.   After her service in the White House, Laura headed to San Francisco  and worked for ZeroDivide, a nonprofit focused on helping underserved  communities understand and unlock technology as a means of expanding  economic opportunity, civic engagement, and healthy outcomes.   In recognition of her work building enduring institutions that expand  opportunity within the AAPI community, Laura was awarded this year's  Jose M. Montano, Jr. Award from the Congressional Asian Pacific  American Staff Association. This award recognizes a Capitol Hill alum  who has gone above and beyond to sustain a pipeline of AAPI staffers  and leaders on the Hill.   Over the years, she has found other ways to serve and promote  opportunity. She served as a member of the Federal Communications  Commission Consumer Advisory Committee, with the Center for Women's  Policy Studies, and as, chair of the Governor of California's Task  Force on Broadband, Community Development, and Public/Private  Partnerships. In these roles, Laura's work was always about giving a  voice to people who had all too often been overlooked or forgotten.   All along, Laura touched many people with her care and compassion,  generosity of spirit, and gracious tenacity. She poured all of her  energy into whatever she was working on. In one instance, I recall that  for our staff retreat, she worked at great length to create games that  brought staff with diverse backgrounds together for a common purpose,  to share the uniqueness of Hawaii, and to reinforce the reason why  those of us in public service do what we do.   It is difficult when we lose someone who was so full of life and  still had much potential. We remember Laura as a giving individual who  shared so much with so many. Laura made a positive impact during her  life, one that extends from coast to coast, and took her from Hawaii to  the highest levels of our government. As her brother Steve wrote on the  day she passed:         Her impact on people was never more evident than during the       outpouring of support she had during the past year and       especially during the past few weeks. The impact she had will       be felt way beyond the end of her time on earth. Her time       here with us is pau. But Laura will live on in our hearts,       our memories, our actions, our stories, as well as in       programs she helped guide, in legislation she helped to       craft, and in her crafts, and in  [[Page S5514]]       the example she set. Our celebration of her life here with us       is going to be a special one.                            ____________________
