 Mr. President, today I rise to discuss the historic  rehabilitation tax credit. The historic rehabilitation tax credit is a  vital component of pro-growth tax reform and a shot in the arm for  communities across the country. For instance, in my State of Louisiana,  the credit has encouraged 782 restoration projects since 2002. This  amounts to more than $2.2 billion in investment into cities and towns  across the State. Many of these private investment dollars are flowing  into small and rural communities with populations less than 25,000  people.   I am pleased that the Finance Committee restored the historic  rehabilitation tax credit to the 20-percent level and ensured a smooth  transition for approved and underway projects by grandfathering them in  under the prior law and regulations.   For purposes of the historic rehabilitation tax credit's transition  rule, ``taxpayer'' refers to the person who undertakes the  rehabilitation of a building. In the case where a person makes an  election under section 48(d), the term ``taxpayer'' means the lessor,  since the lessor is the person who undertook the rehabilitation. It is  intended that the historic rehabilitation tax credits be available  during the transition period only to the extent such credits would have  been available under the prior law and regulations.
