 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, Wednesday, tomorrow, marks 200 days of this  Congress and 200 days of House Democrats delivering for the people.   Together, with President Biden we have created millions of jobs since  he took office at a faster pace than any President in U.S. history.  Economic growth projections are up. Wages are up. And unemployment is  down.   With the passage of the American Rescue Plan, we have brought needed  relief to families across the country.   More than 160 million Americans are now fully vaccinated against  COVID-19. And nearly 70 percent of adults in the United States have  received at least one shot.   We invested in helping schools reopen safely and to make up for lost  learning time. We sent money to States and to local communities to help  keep childcare providers on the job and to lower costs for working  families. And we got more than 163 million economic impact payments  into the hands of hardworking Americans in 2021.   And last week, child tax credit monthly payments began hitting the  bank accounts of roughly 39 million households, covering almost 90  percent of children nationwide. That is historic tax relief for nearly  every working family across the United States.   And behind each of those numbers is a family member, a neighbor, a  colleague faced with untenable circumstances, getting the support that  they need.   Last week I had a chance to sit down, Mr. Speaker, with families in  my district. I represent northern Colorado. It is a wonderful place.  Many of these families shared with me exactly what these child tax  credit payments will mean for them and for their families.   Annie in Boulder, a woman that I met last Wednesday, is 8 months  pregnant, and her child tax credit payment is helping her pay for  healthcare while she is on maternity leave until she is able to return  to work full time.   Johanna from Fort Collins, already received her credit on July 15,  and she will use that credit to pay for a summer camp for her son.   Others shared how these payments will help pay for their childcare,  for food, or rent payments. Child tax credit payments for many Colorado  families, for many California families, for many Texas families, for  many Montana families, for many American families is a lifeline because  the payments mean money in the pockets of hardworking parents that will  ultimately help strengthen our economy and build better lives for their  families.   The bottom line is that with the child tax credit and with the  American Rescue Plan, help is here for so many.   I recently had an opportunity to take a road trip across my district  to see what the American Rescue Plan has meant for families in northern  Colorado from Boulder County to Larimer County up to the Wyoming border  from Vail to Grand Lake to Bailey, Evergreen, and many places in  between, visiting with families and small business owners, childcare  workers, and communities.   And we heard story after story about how these funds are helping our  communities, providing support to local food banks who have seen  skyrocketing demands, providing a needed lifeline to small business  owners and renters, and supporting, as I said, our cities and counties  amidst the unprecedented moment that we are all experiencing.                                time  1900    We have always said that at this time of unprecedented challenge, we  could not leave our families or our communities to weather this moment  alone. Well, we have not. President Biden has not. House Democrats have  not. Senate Democrats have not. And we will not.   Mr. Speaker, 200 days--200 days of shots in arms, money in pockets,  children in schools, people in jobs. And our work is just getting  started, because  [[Page H3742]]  we will continue to deliver for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Lieu), my  good friend, the co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications  Committee, someone who has been delivering for the people in his  district in California and for the people of our country for many  years.    Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to entertain the  gentleman's question.    It is funny that you ask that question, Mr. Lieu, because  not a single Republican, not one, voted for the child tax credit; no  laughing matter, as it were.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  California.   If the distinguished gentleman from California might be willing to  engage in a brief colloquy with me, I would be interested in yielding  to him.   I was fully aware that the House Republicans didn't vote in favor of  the child tax credit, but you mentioned a litany of other programs that  have come to pass over the course of the last 200 days that have had a  dramatic impact on the American people.   Is it your understanding that no Republicans voted for, for example,  the Restaurant Revitalization Fund as part of the American Rescue Plan?    Well, Mr. Lieu, I couldn't agree with you more. And you  make a very interesting and salient point, because as we reflect on the  200 days with House Democrats leading the charge here in the Congress,  pushing to get money in pockets and restaurant revitalization funds and  funds for small businesses and the child tax credit payments, and funds  for our schools and funds for firefighting departments and local  communities, we know that House Democrats have been working for the  people.   And while it is unfortunate that the House Republican Caucus has been  unwilling to partner with us in this effort, we certainly hope that  they will come around.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, one of the privileges of serving in this  august body is meeting giants. The Speaker, of course, is familiar with  the refrain that we stand on the shoulders of giants, and that is  certainly the case in the instance of the colleague of whom I have the  honor of recognizing, someone who has been a voice for the voiceless,  who has been a champion for working families in our country, for doing  everything that she can possibly do to eradicate poverty, not just in  the State of California, but across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), my  distinguished colleague and friend.    Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank the gentlewoman from  California, and I certainly could not have said it any better, because  we were proud to take the steps that were necessary to help  constituents across the country.   The problems, the challenges that we face as a country don't  discriminate on political lines or jurisdictional lines. We don't focus  on helping Republican communities or Democratic communities. American  communities, that is who we are here to help; American families, the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, Social Security was created over 80 years ago. And I was  at an event earlier today. As we talked about the child tax credit, I  was joined by my colleague, Mr. Lieu. And Senator Booker was so  eloquent as he described the child tax credit program, in particular,  as a new Social Security for kids, for children.                                time  1915    So that every child in the United States has the opportunity to  succeed and live the American Dream, that is what it is all about. The  stories that you heard from my colleagues today, that is who we are  helping. The single mother in Broomfield, Colorado, who is trying to  make ends meet. The working family in Texas, California, Iowa,  Nebraska, Seattle, or Florida trying to find the resources to pay for  childcare, to put food on the table, to pay their mortgage, that is  what the child tax credit is all about.   Mr. Speaker, 200 days, 200 days of progress. I am proud of the work.  My colleague, Mr. Lieu, is proud of the work that House Democrats have  done in partnership with President Biden; the work that Representative  Axne has done to fight for farmers in Iowa; the work that  Representative Harder has done to increase appropriations for  firefighting in the Western United States, as we are besieged by  wildfires; the work that Representative Delgado did to secure local  community support for the smallest cities, towns, and municipalities in  rural America.   Money in pockets, shots in arms, children in schools, and people in  jobs. Mr. Speaker, 200 days, and we are just getting started.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
