 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H. Res. 630, a resolution I helped introduce that would require sexual  harassment training and antidiscrimination training for Members of  Congress, staff, and interns.   The requirements in this resolution are long overdue, Mr. Speaker.  This is an issue which the Federal Government must be a leader on.  Under this legislation, training must be completed within a certain  timeframe, and employees must provide proof they have completed the  training to the Committee on House Administration.   It is very important that we take serious steps to address harassment  in Congress. I applaud Congresswoman Comstock on her leadership. I have  been proud to work with Congresswoman Speier, along with the bipartisan  group of my colleagues, to make sure we have a productive, safe, and  professional work environment here in Congress.   This resolution is part of that solution, and I will continue working  and pressing for additional reforms. I urge all of my colleagues to  support this resolution.
