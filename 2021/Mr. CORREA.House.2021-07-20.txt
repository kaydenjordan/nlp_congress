 Madam Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Santa  Ana Police Officer Ramses Aguinaga, who was tragically taken from his  family by cancer. Ramses was a leader in the community where he grew  up. He was a smart and caring person who always made an effort to  understand each and every individual in his community.   In high school, he played football for Mater Dei High School where he  was a key player in making sure that Mater Dei won the Southern Section  Division championship.   In college, Ramses became interested in criminal justice and spent 16  years as a police officer. But his greatest accomplishment was the  birth of his son, Mateus Aguinaga, and Ramses loved this child, loved  him to death.   Ramses passed away in peace. His family mourns him and will never  forget how he brightened the lives of so many of his friends and  neighbors where he grew up. He was a loving father, a thoughtful son, a  caring brother, and a role model for our community.                            ____________________
