 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Virginia and my  colleagues for their work on this bill.   Mr. Chair, Ben Franklin signed the Declaration of Independence at age  70. Grandma Moses started painting at age 76. We should never, ever put  an age limit on our dreams or the ability to make a living.   But here is the thing, Mr. Chair: You can be a dedicated employee,  having spent decades building a career that you are proud of, taking  care of your family, putting your kids through college, saving for your  future. You need and want to work and, one day, when you are ready,  retire with dignity. But then, out of nowhere, your life is shattered.  Your bosses say: ``You are fired.''   They list their reasons. However, you know the truth. You have been  let go to make way for a younger employee. Now you are without a  salary, without your health insurance. You know your odds of getting a  new job are slim when you are competing with 20-year-olds and 30-year- olds who are willing to work for lower wages and fewer benefits.   For too many seniors, Mr. Chair, this is a reality.   Nearly three in five workers have experienced age-based  discrimination, not only unfairly depriving the worker of a paycheck  but taking valuable workers out of the workforce.   Now, a Supreme Court decision has made it even harder to prove age  discrimination.   Mr. Chair, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act  would give senior workers the protection they deserve and society the  workers that we need.   The poet Robert Browning said: ``Grow old with me, the best is yet to  be.''   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this very, very good bill.
