 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and let me thank Mr.  McCaul and Ms. Kelly, both members of the Foreign Affairs Committee,  for authoring this important legislation and Chairman Royce for  bringing it to the floor.   One of the most important things that we deal with on our committee  is protecting the lives of the brave American citizens working at our  embassies and consulates abroad. This legislation will help us improve  the way we provide embassy security.   This bill would also authorize the embassy security, construction,  and maintenance account for the next year at $2.3 billion, the same  level appropriated for the account this year.   Now, what has me concerned is the Trump administration has asked  Congress to slash embassy security by $700 million. That just isn't  right.   Mr. Speaker, the clearest indication of an administration's  priorities is its annual budget. Frankly, it is astounding to me that  the Trump administration has proposed such massive cuts to embassy  security funding for 2 years in a row.   On the campaign trail, President Trump spent a lot of time blaming  Secretary Clinton for the tragic attacks on our consulate in Benghazi.  He did so with little regard for the facts. Secretary Pompeo, as a  Member of this body, especially during the time of the absurd Benghazi  Select Committee, expressed a great deal of outrage over the handling  of diplomatic security. Now they have tried to cut funding for embassy  security at every opportunity.   My message for them is simple: There is no cost too high to protect  the lives of our diplomats and their families. I wish the President and  the Secretary understood that.   Fortunately, Congress has the last word on these issues. We have come  together in a bipartisan way for the past 2 years and rejected  President Trump's draconian cuts to embassy security funding. This bill  represents another rejection of the Trump administration's dangerous  proposal.   Additionally, I would like to highlight two provisions in the bill.  The first requires that all U.S. Government employees traveling abroad  on official business receive a written or oral security briefing from  the State Department on potential threats. This is a commonsense  measure, and it is, honestly, bizarre that it isn't already required.   Second, I also want to thank Mr. McCaul and Ms. Kelly for including  language that requires the State Department to provide our committee  with a strategy for establishing a physical diplomatic presence in  countries in which we currently have no physical diplomatic presence.   Lastly, I strongly support a universal approach to U.S.  representation abroad, and I continue to be disappointed that we have  no embassies in several countries in the Eastern Caribbean where  Venezuela, Cuba, and others are present and active. Being absent  significantly weakens U.S. leadership in the Caribbean and elsewhere  around the globe.   Finally, let me say, while I am pleased that we are advancing this  legislation, I am disappointed that it is moving as a standalone bill  and not as it was originally intended, as the title of our committee's  State Department authorization bill. Given the chairman's hard work on  the State Department authorization bill, I am sure that the gentleman  shares my concern. I hope that we can breathe new life into the  legislative effort by the end of this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I will close by again thanking Chairman Royce for bringing this  legislation to the floor.   We have no greater duty on our committee than to protect Americans  serving abroad. I am very pleased that we are making several essential  fixes in our approach to embassy security in this legislation and  authorizing the embassy security, construction, and maintenance at a  robust level.   We live in a dangerous time, and the Trump administration's budget  would put our diplomats at even greater risk than what they have  already faced on a daily basis, so I am glad that the House is stepping  in to do what is needed.   Finally, let me say again, while I am pleased this bill is moving  forward, I don't believe the window has closed on getting a  comprehensive State Department authorization bill to the President's  desk, and I continue to stand ready to work with the chairman to do  just that.   Mr. Speaker, I support the chairman's motion; I urge all Members to  do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend from Arizona (Mr.  O'Halleran) for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of our amendment to H.R. 1635.  Our amendment is simple. It would ensure that student borrowers are  provided information about the full range of income-based repayment  options. This will help students get a full picture of what college is  going to look like and give an estimate of what they might owe on a  monthly basis over their anticipated career. This additional  transparency will make sure students are not caught off guard about  their student debt after graduation.   As the co-chair of the California Public Higher Education Caucus, one  of my priorities here in Congress has been working to improve the  affordability, accessibility, and quality of higher education.   Think about it. I paid $393 a quarter to go to medical school. That  meant I could go to 4 years of undergraduate school, 4 years of medical  school, get some help from my folks, work part time, a few  scholarships, and graduate with less than $10,000 of debt. That is  amazing.                                time  1515    Now, I am not that old. We might not be able to get to that place,  but the truth is that education has allowed me to do what I have done  throughout my life, and that is an investment that pays off.   Let's make sure we make higher education affordable and accessible to  our students in that next generation. Let's make sure we keep making  those investments, and, again, let's make sure that those students have  that transparency and the information that they need to make reasonable  decisions.
