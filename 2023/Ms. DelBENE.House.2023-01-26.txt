 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 7.    Mr. Chair, I am offering this amendment with my  colleagues, Representatives Gluesenkamp Perez, Kilmer, Hoyle, and  Salinas.   Protecting the environment is foundational to the heritage, culture,  and quality of life in the Pacific Northwest. Our region is a  trailblazer in renewable energy sources, like hydroelectric, wind, and  solar.   Congress should follow our lead and focus on accelerating our  transition toward a green energy economy.   Instead, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to  push for more giveaways to the fossil fuel industry and heighten the  risk of another oil spill like Deepwater Horizon.   Our amendment would prevent Republicans from allowing drilling for  oil and gas along the Washington and Oregon coasts.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Perez), my  colleague, the newest Member of the Washington delegation.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Kilmer), my colleague from the Olympic Peninsula.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Hoyle), one of our new Members.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Salinas).    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the Pacific  Northwest and support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
