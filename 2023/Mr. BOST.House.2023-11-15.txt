 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Cris Edwards of Olney,  Illinois, for her being named a National Distinguished Principal by the  National Association of Elementary School Principals.   Cris is the principal of Richland County Elementary School, which  serves nearly 1,000 rural students. The school's mission is to develop  respectful and responsible learners and leaders. Under Cris Edwards'  watch, that mission is being fulfilled.   Her devotion is recognized by students, parents, and teachers alike.   The school was given the high honor of a legacy school by the Leader  in Me program. They host High Five Fridays to build connections in the  community, and they launched a mobile library in an old school bus to  deliver books in the summer.   Cris has earned her status as a National Distinguished Principal just  as she has earned her position as the incoming president of the  Illinois Principals Association.   Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing Cris Edwards for all she  has done to provide a positive learning environment for Richland County  schoolchildren.                            ____________________
