 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Alyssa Naeher, the  Connecticut-born U.S. Women's National Soccer Team goalkeeper.   The United States team once again proved that they are the best in  the world. And throughout the World Cup, Alyssa--who grew up in  Stratford, Connecticut, in my district, and played at Christian  Heritage School in Trumbull--provided crucial play after crucial play.  None was more important or heart-stopping than her save against  England.   By stopping a penalty kick with time winding down, she single- handedly saved the United States' championship hopes.   And Alyssa is more than just a champion. She is a role model as the  team champions the issue of equal pay for them and for millions of  women and families nationwide.   Clearly, the time is now for the United States Senate to pass H.R. 7,  the Paycheck Fairness Act, which has said men and women in the same job  deserve the same pay.   What better tribute, my friends, to the talent, to the determination,  and to the commitment of these outstanding young women.   Mr. Speaker, again, I congratulate Alyssa. Connecticut could not be  more proud.                            ____________________
