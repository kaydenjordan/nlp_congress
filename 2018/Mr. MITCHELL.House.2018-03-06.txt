 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, this is the second week of the tax truth  squad effort to share the facts, the real facts about the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act, and the impact it has already had on the American economy and  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here with my fellow colleagues  representing Michigan and Illinois. These two States include diverse  industries and diverse people, from farmers, to bankers, to  manufacturers.   I am humbled to represent the hardworking people of the 10th  Congressional District and the Midwest. This is exactly what the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act has done: helped our constituents work every day  supporting their family and helped their local economy.   My colleague before me proceeded to speak about we should pay  attention to the needs of those close to and living in poverty. Well, I  wish he had stayed. I grew up in poverty.   Like many in Michigan, I grew up in a large family. I have six  brothers and sisters. My dad had a good job building trucks in a line  at General Motors. My mom often had a full-time job to help make ends  meet. That is why I committed to supporting policies that create real  economic growth and economic opportunity for families like the one in  which I grew up.   I was but a young pup in 1986, the last time our Tax Code was  modernized. Since then, the Tax Code grew to 74,000 pages of rules and  regulations that have only confused people. You would need to be a  wizard to understand what is in the Tax Code as it stood at the end of  the year. That is why I promised my constituents, when I came to  office, when I ran for office, I would work hard to achieve meaningful  tax cuts and reforms for the American people.   I believe Americans can, and should, make independent decisions about  the use of their own money, the money they work for, not the  government. The government shouldn't come first. The Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act allowed hardworking individuals and business owners to do just  that.   Across the Nation and back home, we have already seen the direct  impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. More than 400 companies have  already announced pay raises, bonuses, and increased 401(k)  contributions and benefits, or, in the case of utility companies,  lowered rates.   Direct bonus announcements have already reached over $3 billion  across this Nation. Let me repeat that: $3 billion. Companies in  Michigan have already committed more than $180 million in bonuses to  employees.   A couple of examples: Fiat Chrysler, one of the State's largest  employers, is reinvesting its tax savings to its employees in our  community, in addition to giving a $2,000 bonus to 60,000 employees.  And that is in addition to profit sharing as part of their contract.   Fiat Chrysler announced it will move heavy-duty Ram truck production  from Mexico to Macomb County: a $1 billion investment that will create  2,500 jobs.   In my district, Michigan's 10th, Lakestone Bank & Trust, a small  community bank, operating in Lake Lapeer, St. Clair, and Macomb  Counties, gave hourly employees $1 an hour raise. I know some consider  that to be crumbs. Where I grew up, $1 an hour more is real money. They  gave all of their salaried employees a $1,000 bonus saying: ``We are  very appreciative of all Lakestone Bank & Trust employees and certainly  what they have accomplished over the years. . . . This is a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity, and we know we want to reinvest much of the  savings''--in the tax bill--``back into our bank, and the first place  we are going to put it is into the hands of our employees. Employees  are our most important asset.''   Stories like this are not unique. From CVS to Chipotle, and AT&T to  Wells Fargo, they are reinvesting tax reform savings in our hardworking  employees in our communities throughout the country.   This is the second week of the tax reform truth squad--we are calling  it--an initiative where Members from States across the Nation are  invited to tell their stories about the benefits of tax reform. There  are countless stories they are anxious to express.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Walberg), one of those Members, my colleague, serving on the  Energy and Commerce Committee, a defender of a strong rural economy and  a good friend, representing the Seventh Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Walberg for his comments. I  failed to recognize that I serve with Mr. Walberg on the Committee on  Education and the Workforce, on which he is a subcommittee chair. So I  thank him for joining us.  [[Page H1426]]    I made a notation that I want to share with everyone tonight as we  move forward. With the changing of the standard deduction, with the  nearly doubling of the standard deduction, about 90 percent of  taxpayers will be able to file their taxes on a form about this size.  They will be able to file their taxes like this, rather than the pile  of paperwork they have dealt with for years. Here it is on a larger  scale.   Most are going to be able to simply file their wage and compensation  income and use the standard deduction. They will be done except for a  few other tax credits we will talk about, the tax credit they can get,  for example, on investment tax credit or family child credit. We will  talk about that. But most Americans can file like this. That is one of  the things we wanted to achieve, one of the great achievements of the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Mr. Speaker, next I yield to Congressman Fred Upton, who represents  Michigan's Sixth Congressional District, the former chairman of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce, another colleague of mine from  Michigan, the senior member of our delegation, experientially only, not  age, with decades of experience in Congress focusing on job creation  and economic opportunity for our State and for our Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Upton for joining us. I  appreciate him taking time out of his busy schedule to talk about how  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has impacted his district and the State of  Michigan.   Let me state, as we get our next speaker to come forward, that in my  district alone, the average savings for the average filer in my  district is $2,700 a year.   Now, I know that some of the colleagues on the other side of the  aisle refer to that as crumbs, as meaningless, but that is real money  that allows people to make a difference in their lives, to move  forward, make decisions about fixing their houses, go on vacation, put  a downpayment on a new car, all things that wouldn't be possible.   More importantly, that is money they worked for. That is not money  somebody gave them. That is their money to begin with, and they get to  keep it. That is what is so important about it.   Mr. Speaker, our next speaker who wants to come forward and talk  about his district is Representative Shimkus, who, as Mr. Upton said,  was a conferee on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Congressman  John Shimkus, who represents the  15th Congressional District, a member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce, a conferee on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and who has been an  advocate for smaller government for years.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Shimkus for the enthusiasm,  the detail on the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Mr. Speaker, we are going to continue on this conversation and talk a  little bit about the trade States, because it has had a great impact  not only on Illinois, but also on Michigan.   Joining us at this point is Congressman  Mike Bishop, a neighbor of  the 10th Congressional District, a member of the Committee on Ways and  Means that had a direct impact on this bill. He has been a leading  advocate for a fair and simple Tax Code. He represents the Eighth  Congressional District.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Congressman  Mike Bishop.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his feedback on  the impact of the Tax Cuts bill, and I thank him for taking time out of  his schedule.   Next, I have the privilege of recognizing a key player in the effort  to reform our Tax Code and cut taxes, the chairman of the Ways and  Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy. I thank the gentleman for his  leadership on this and, hopefully, continued success on our tax laws.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Sixth District of  Illinois (Mr. Roskam).    Mr. Speaker, I will ask the gentleman to stay for just  a moment for a real quick question.   First, I would say that the Bears is his example--and my example is  Steve Yzerman was a rookie in the NHL and captain of the Detroit Red  Wings. If you ask a young hockey fan now who Steve Yzerman is, they  would look at you blankly. That is how long ago tax was tackled.   I have a question for the gentleman. Ninety percent of our taxpayers,  we believe, are going to file a standard deduction, but we kept--we  talked about it a great deal. We kept some key tax cuts in the Tax Code  to actually help families.   Can the gentleman briefly talk about, maybe, the family and child tax  credit and what we did with that and why we think that is important.    I want to be clear with folks. There is a child and  family tax cut, the earned income credit, and the higher education  credit, and those are all credits against your tax liability. This is  not simply a deduction. After taxes are determined, those are credits  back, not a tax deduction.    People don't understand the difference some days.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for clarifying that,  and I certainly hope people listen to the difference because some  people don't understand that. I appreciate the gentleman taking time to  join us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman representing the 12th District  of Illinois (Mr. Bost), a small family business owner himself.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for joining us this  evening.   Next is Congressman Adam Kinzinger, who serves on the Energy and  Commerce Committee as well as on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Like  many Members around here, he is a very busy man.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman representing the 16th District  of Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger) to talk about tax cuts in his district.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Kinzinger for joining us this  evening. I appreciate the detail in his district.   We are going to continue with Illinois for a bit here. I guess it is  Illinois' night for awhile.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the Representative from the 14th District  of Illinois, Congressman Randy Hultgren, who has consistently been a  voice of business owners across America through his work on the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hultgren for joining us. I  appreciate him taking the time to explain the importance of this in his  district.  [[Page H1430]]    My next speaker has extensive experience on economic development and  creating a better business climate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Congressman Darin LaHood, representing the  18th District of Illinois, a member to both the Joint Economic  Committee and Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, could the Congressman stay one moment for  a quick question?    Mr. Speaker, he was talking a little bit about the  depreciation allowance and what that depreciation means for small  business--especially small business.   One of the important things we did was to change how the taxes are  structured for a path we call pass-through to small businesses. Maybe  he could explain that briefly, what was done to help small business be  viable and grow in this country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. LaHood for detailing that, and  I appreciate him taking time this evening.   We now will rotate back to Michigan, a fellow freshman, good friend  of mine, also a proud Yooper. I am proud to introduce my fellow  colleague in the freshman class from the northern regions of Michigan,  who, throughout this process, served on the Budget Committee and had  input into what this bill is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to Congressman Jack Bergman from the First  District of Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Bergman, and we are  wishing for spring in northern Michigan sooner than mid-May.   Mr. Speaker, I want to wrap up this evening by talking a little bit  about what all my colleagues spoke about: our principles.   Our principles were that people who worked hard should keep more of  their money, that their families and their pocketbooks should come  first and not government come first. We have achieved that with the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act.   How did we achieve that?   We almost doubled the standard deduction. For a married couple, the  standard deduction is $24,000 this tax year--$24,000, and you pay no  taxes.   We lowered the individual tax rates for all tax brackets.   We simplified the Tax Code so that taxpayers can file their taxes, 90  percent of them, on a form about this size. No, you don't have to mail  a postcard. You put it in an envelope. But the good news is you don't  need multiple pages. You don't have to hope that you have got a wizard  to help you. Ninety percent of Americans can fill out a few items on  here, include the W-2, and send it on in.   We expanded, as was discussed earlier, the child tax credit from  $1,000 to $2,000 for single filers and married couples to help parents  with the cost of raising their children. We made that fully refundable  up to $1,400. That is, even if your taxes are zero, you get a refund  from the government for $1,400 to help you with childcare and taking  care of your dependents.   For taxpayers that the standard deduction did not work as well, we  kept a number of important deductions, the three most popular ones:  Charitable deduction, kept that; the home interest deduction, we kept  that; and State and local taxes.   What that means is, for 95, 98 percent of my tax filers in the 10th  Congressional District, even if they fill out their deductions rather  than do the standard deduction, they are much better off.   Since the tax reform bill passed, as I stated earlier, 400 companies,  in about 70 days, have given a pay raise or a bonus or both, increased  benefits, 401(k) contributions.   In the case of utilities, you heard in Michigan, almost $400 million  a year in rate cuts, something we hadn't thought about, hadn't  anticipated--real money saved by our consumers.   Four million people have received a special tax bonus, resulting in  about $3 billion injected into the economy. In Michigan, it is $180  million already.   That is real money. It is not economic Armageddon. I am proud to have  been part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We will continue with the Tax  Truth Squad every week through the summer to send a message to the  American people that we are looking out for their paychecks and the  well-being of their family.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
