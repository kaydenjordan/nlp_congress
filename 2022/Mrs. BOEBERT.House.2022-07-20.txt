 Mr. Speaker, fake handcuffs won't close the southern  border. Fake handcuffs won't lower gas prices, curb inflation, harden  the supply chain, put baby formula on our shelves, deter Russia, or fix  our broken and weak reputation across the globe.   Mr. Speaker, fake handcuffs won't fix our education system, protect  our students from CRT and grooming, or create opportunities to lift  communities out of poverty.   Fake handcuffs won't increase domestic energy, increase recruitment  for our military--go woke, go broke--or solve a single problem that the  American people actually care about.   Mr. Speaker, fake handcuffs make for a good photo op, but they don't  benefit the American people. Fake handcuffs only benefit those who  pretend to wear them.   Mr. Speaker, this body should be delivering solutions for the  American people not with fake handcuffs but without restraint.                            ____________________
