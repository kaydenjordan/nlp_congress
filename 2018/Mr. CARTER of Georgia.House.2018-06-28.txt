 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Captain  Raymond Sweatte and Mr. Michael Sullivan, the crew of the University of  Georgia Skidaway Institute of Oceanography's ship, the Savannah.   While Captain Sweatte and Mr. Sullivan were on the Savannah  conducting a research-based fish survey just off the coast of Georgia,  they were contacted by the Coast Guard about a nearby ship in distress.   After searching multiple locations in the nighttime darkness, the  Savannah located and saved two Florida fishermen struggling to cling to  their lives.   The fishermen had been taking on water for about 5 hours in high seas  and winds and could not keep up with the water flowing into the ship.   If the Savannah had not located and rescued these struggling  fishermen, it is possible they would not have survived.   I sincerely thank the University of Georgia's Captain Sweatte and Mr.  Sullivan for their bravery and heroic actions in this emergency  situation to save the lives of two fellow Americans.                            ____________________
