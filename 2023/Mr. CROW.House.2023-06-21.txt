 Mr. Speaker, here are some facts.   Fact number one, Donald Trump remains one of the greatest dangers to  our democracy that we have ever seen, and he is a demagogue.   Fact number two, demagogues don't like people who call them out, who  speak the truth, and who pose a threat to their grand designs to  destroy our democracy.   Fact number three, I have spent my life serving this country in  uniform, out of uniform, and I would be hard-pressed to find somebody  who is more committed to democracy, who has more integrity, and who is  more committed to the rule of law than Adam Schiff.   I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this  absurd proposal, to set yourself free from your servitude of Donald  Trump so we can move forward as a country.   Set yourself free. You know the truth, and the truth shall set you  free.
