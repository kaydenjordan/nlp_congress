 Madam Speaker, here we are again, late at  night, debating last-minute legislation to fix problems the current  majority created.   When considered alongside the ongoing COVID pandemic, widespread  workforce concerns, and the cloud of uncertainty created by unnecessary  vaccine mandates, it is clear the combined effects of upcoming Medicare  reimbursement cuts represent a critical threat to our healthcare  system.   While I commend the efforts that have been made over the last few  days to draft solutions which address the concerns of our healthcare  providers, instead of coming together to pass a bipartisan compromise,  we again find the majority attaching controversial, unrelated material  to this bill.   Tonight, the majority has chosen to jeopardize urgent relief for  healthcare providers with political gimmicks relating to the debt  ceiling and paygo issues we saw coming from miles away.   I am disappointed to see yet another erosion of the rules and  precedents of Congress. I urge all members to oppose this bill.
