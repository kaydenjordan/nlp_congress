 Mr. President, today I rise to thank Belle Lunders, one  of my constituents, for sharing the significance of Trisomy 13  awareness.   I ask unanimous consent that her statement regarding Trisomy 13 be  submitted to the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Trisomy 13 is a chromosomal disorder where the 13th pair of       chromosomes have an extra copy creating three chromosomes.       Trisomy 13 is the least common and most severe of the       feasible autosomal trisomies. Median survival is fewer than       three days. It affects one in every 8,000 to 12,000 live       births.        Babies born with Trisomy 13 can have many health problems       and more than 80 percent don't survive more than a few weeks.       Between 86 percent and 91 percent of live births do not live       past their first year. Survival beyond the first year is       associated with mosaicism. There is no cure for Trisomy 13       but different treatments depend on the symptoms. In most       cases surgery and therapy are the best options. Prenatal       testing and ultrasound can confirm a Trisomy 13 diagnosis       through amniocentesis.                            ____________________
