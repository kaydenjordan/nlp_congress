 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill  proposed by Speaker Ryan, a day after the big lie was finally admitted  to by President Trump, the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland  Security, and the resident White House sociopath, Stephen Miller, that  ripping children from their mothers and fathers and jailing them was  solely an administrative decision, not a law, not a loophole, not the  fault of Democrats, but, instead, the singular, cynical, and cruel  policy of the Trump administration.   Yet H.R. 6136 does nothing to remedy the damage of that policy for  children, for their parents, and does nothing to soothe the conscience  of our Nation.   H.R. 6136 has no oversight or public review of for-profit and  nonprofit detention centers, nothing to reunite 2,300 children with  their families, and eliminates the standards of care for children in  detention centers.   Today was supposed to be about DACA recipients. This bill does  nothing for them either. Their fate is tied to spending 23 billion  taxpayer dollars on a political gift to Trump for a wall, a wall that  circumvents environmental law, puts our lands, water, and wildlife and  border land communities at risk, and a point system that could  disqualify over 80 percent of current and previously eligible Dreamers.   We had an opportunity to address Dreamers, by the way, another Trump- created crisis, with a vote on the Aguilar-Hurd legislation, a  bipartisan compromise that includes some content I opposed, but I would  vote for it because it is necessary and a step forward. But this effort  was sabotaged by Trump and the Republican leadership of this House.   We are now asked to vote on Speaker Ryan's H.R. 6136, the anti-family  values bill. It is wasteful, repressive, and meaningless.   Regardless of how you paint it, how you sell it or lie about it, this  particular pig will never be a silk purse. I urge a ``no'' vote on the  legislation.
