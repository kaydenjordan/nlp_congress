 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, this is a simple amendment. The  Clinton era Roadless Rule applies a one-size-fits-all approach to areas  where those policies rarely work, especially the federally locked lands  in Alaska.   At 16.8 million acres, the Tongass National Forest is the largest of  the National Forest System. Coupled with the Chugach National Forest,  Alaska contains 12 percent of the total acres of national forest lands  in the total United States.   The Roadless Rule is nothing more than another effort to end the  multiple-use mandate of Federal forest  [[Page H4169]]  lands, something that is required by law but often ignored by nameless,  faceless, unelected bureaucrats.   Although the Tongass is over 100 years old, only 400,000 acres have  been harvested. Of the remaining acreage, much of the forest is not  topographically suitable for timber harvest, and 6.6 million acres are  congressionally designated as wilderness areas, national monuments, and  roadless areas.   Not only does the Roadless Rule violate the authorities granted under  the Alaska National Lands Act, it was adopted without proper  consultation or consideration of the countless communities that rely on  responsible resource development.   Nearly 96 percent of the Tongass National Forest and 99 percent of  the Chugach National Forest are protected by ANILCA and forest  management plans.   Exempting Alaska from the Roadless Rule would help make certain that  what is left of the timber industry in the southeast can survive.   Many individuals adamantly oppose logging old growth in roadless  areas. However, old growth will continue to be predominant in the  Tongass, and given the remote nature of Alaska, the vast majority of  the forest is in a roadless state.   Over 90 percent of the Tongass is unaccessible by road. The lack of  access to timber not only costs good-paying jobs, but results in trees  dying of disease and infestations. Dead trees serve no purpose other  than to become kindling, creating fires. So by having a robust timber  industry, we can help prevent the spread of serious wildfires like have  been seen in the lower 48.   To be clear, we are not talking about clearcutting the entire  national forest. We just want to help it stay healthy and fulfill its  multi-use mandate of the Tongass.   By significantly limiting the areas that are eligible for harvesting,  the implementation of the Roadless Rule actually makes conservation  more difficult since locations with less conservation value often can't  be selected.   If any reasonable form of timber industry is to exist in the near  future, it is imperative we restore Alaska's exemption from the  Roadless Rule as quickly as possible. It has placed an undue burden on  my State and the people of my State.   Mr. Chairman, we worry about immigration. We worry about  homelessness. We worry about employment. We worry about education. I am  saying this Roadless Rule takes away the opportunity for people to  supply for their family so they can have a sustainable sylviculture  industry taking care of our forests in southeast Alaska. The Roadless  Rule should have never applied to Alaska to begin with.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), the chairman of the  full committee.    Mr. Chairman, the comments from the other side  of the aisle were talking about Alaskans opposing this amendment.   With all due respect, I am an elected representative, and if they  don't like what I do, they don't vote for me. I just believe in jobs.   When I first got elected to this job, when I first started this  Tongass battle, we had 15,000 jobs in Alaska in the timber industry in  the Tongass. And through the National Land Act itself, we were told  that no other jobs would be lost in the timber industry, and they  slowly crept around and eliminated what remaining jobs occurred. And  the sad part about it, from my point of view, they have killed the  timber industry. That was not the intent. We were supposed to have a  timber industry.   Then along comes the Clinton era Roadless Rule that means you can't  build a road anywhere that has no road. How do you have a hydropower  site? We had to fight for 4 years to get a hydropower site.   This action here by an administration--this and past  administrations--have to understand, this is about employment. This is  about managing--managing--timber. And those who don't want to manage  anything, you destroy it.   Mr. Chairman, I am urging this body, this Congress, to do what is  right for the State of Alaska and right for the timber, and the right  for the people that live there and that depend upon a source of income  other than living off, very frankly, somebody giving them something.  They want to work for it.   Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It is to  make sure Alaska Natives and American Indian populations are able to  access traditional foods in nutrition programs.   Many American Indians and Alaska Natives incorporate traditional  foods: fish, game, seafood, wild berries, and plants into their daily  diets. These foods are locally sourced and culturally significant.   The cultural significance of traditional foods is especially  important in long-term care and hospital settings, where individuals  are likely to be away from their homes for extended periods and are  unable to easily carry on their traditions. It is likewise important  for Native youth to have access to traditional foods for proper  nutrition and cultural heritage.   May I say, Mr. Chairman, when you are in a hospital you can recover  faster if you have a traditional food. This amendment builds on a  previous provision of mine in the 2014 farm bill that authorized  donation and serving of traditional foods which meet the safety  standards and in facilities that serve these indigenous populations.   It applies to programs encompassing residential childcare, child  nutrition programs, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and others.  There have been no documented safety issues and the food handling and  storage safety standards incorporated in my previous amendment are  stringent. The standards were, in part, based on successful standards  from Alaska which has long led the way for safety procedures for  traditional foods.   For years, this provision has led the way to safely offer traditional  foods to the vulnerable populations that need it the most. My amendment  maintains these standards.   This amendment tonight, like the previous one, has no budgetary  effects. That is for those who do not want to spend any more money. It  simply works to ensure that Native American and Alaska Native youth and  elders can participate in nutrition programs and access traditional  foods, regardless of the facility in which the program is implemented.   This is important, given that child nutrition and senior meal  programs that serve a significant number of natives are sometimes  housed in facilities that are not specifically designated as Tribal,  and the legislation is truly focused on the importance of nutrition.   This amendment should be heavily and heartily accepted and passed. I  strongly urge adoption of this amendment. It is about nutrition, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson), the ranking member of the Agriculture  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman. Again, I  understand why the chairman is against this, but we have no cases where  there has been any food hazards, food abuses, or anything like that.  And I have to describe one thing to my colleagues.   I am 85 years old. I am an Alaska Native. I have lived in one of the  villages up north. My diet has consisted of seal meat, seal oil, whale  meat, whale oil, and berries. I am an older man. I am in a hospital in  Anchorage, Alaska, or I am in a long-term care facility to take care of  me, and they serve me, of all things, a chicken, or they will serve me  some salty Spam.                                time  1715    That is not too bad by the way.         But things that will not make me well. And in my mind I       desire and my body craves what I have eaten during the       history of my life. And that keeps me weller. In fact, I       might be able to go home and be able to harvest those things       that I love.    This is all I am trying to do in facilities. This is a good  amendment. I know there has been opposition from some of the Federal  agencies: Oh, this is a safety issue. Keep in mind, this is an issue  that takes care of that person who is receiving that food.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation. It  should happen for those people, my Alaskan Natives. It is important.   Mr. Chairman, I don't have any other speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
