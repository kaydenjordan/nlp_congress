 Madam Speaker, my amendment makes a simple change that  would help improve the development of workplace violence prevention  plans required under H.R. 1195, the Workplace Violence Prevention for  Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.   As you know, our Nation's nurses, social workers, and other  caregivers suffer from workplace violence injuries at far higher rates  than any other profession. In fact, these workers are nearly five times  as likely to suffer a serious workplace violence injury than workers in  other sectors, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   The underlying legislation would require employers within these  sectors to develop and implement a workplace violence prevention plan  to reduce the incidence of injuries and create safer working conditions  for their workers.   In order to ensure that covered employers in the healthcare and  social service industries develop thoughtful and comprehensive  workplace violence prevention plans, my amendment clarifies that  employers are able to outreach to experts and specialists who lead in  the issue of workplace violence.   Healthcare and social service workers have unique needs and face many  difficult challenges in the workplace.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support  for H.R. 1195 from the CEO of AIHA, Mr. Sloan.                                                            AIHA.   Support for H.R. 1195, Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care                       and Social Service Workers Act       Rep. Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chair, Education and Labor Committee,      House of Representatives.      Rep. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Education and Labor Committee, House of           Representatives.        Dear Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Foxx, and Members of       the Committee: On behalf of AIHA, which represents scientists       and professionals committed to preserving and ensuring       occupational and environmental health and safety in the       workplace and community, I urge you to quickly approve H.R.       1195, the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and       Social Service Workers Act.        AIHA supports this bipartisan bill, which has 120       cosponsors and would address workplace violence in health       care and social service settings. Violence in these       industries remains a leading cause of traumatic workplace       injury and death in the US. The bill would help solve this       problem by requiring covered employers to develop and       implement comprehensive workplace violence prevention plans       that are tailored to meet their individual needs.        AIHA looks forward to our continued work together on       workplace violence and other occupational and environmental       health and safety issues.            Sincerely,                                              Lawrence D. Sloan,                                            Chief Executive Officer,                                                              AIHA.
