 Madam Speaker, I rise to call on the President and  Senate Republicans to reopen the government.   We are now on day 27 of the Trump shutdown, and more and more  families are being harmed. 800,000 Federal workers have been furloughed  or are working without pay--workers from the Forest Service, Coast  Guard, Customs and Border Patrol, and TSA. These workers clock in every  day to make sure the rest of us are safe, and they can't count on a  paycheck.   Federal employees aren't the only ones impacted. I recently met with  a small business in my district that works on Federal contracts  supporting space exploration and research, a growing industry. Because  of the shutdown, they haven't been paid for work they have already  done, forcing this small business to lay off 20 percent of its  workforce last week. It never had to happen.   Every day, this shutdown the President is so proud of hurts more  families and businesses. It must end.                            ____________________
