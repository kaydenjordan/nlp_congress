 Mr. Speaker, this farm bill is outrageous. What it is  doing is breaking what has been traditionally a bipartisan commitment  to including a nutrition title that helps people in all of our  districts who need the food. This bill has had no process. It is a  continuation of an effort to ratchet down any help that Americans need.   That healthcare bill was going to help on healthcare by taking it  away from 24 million people. This nutrition bill, supposedly, is going  to help people by taking $23 billion worth of benefits away from  children, veterans, the elderly, and the disabled who need that food.   Why?   Well, there is a reason. We passed a tax cut. By the way, it wasn't  paid for. $2.3 trillion added to the deficit for a tax bill where 87  percent of the benefits go to wealthy multinational corporations and  individuals earning over $890,000 a year.   Well, the bill has come due, and we have a proposal here to come up  with $23 billion to pay for it, and that is taking meals off the table  of disabled people.   And, by the way, the work requirement, what is it really? Because  that sounds good.   By the way, who doesn't want to work? Everybody wants to work. You  need a job.   We are going to pay for this so-called work requirement by taking  money away from nutrition, paying bureaucrats, and giving them the  impossible job of putting people who are not able to work into jobs  that don't exist. Talk about cynical; that is what this bill is.   I am from Vermont where we have lots of folks who need help, and we  have lots of Vermonters who, with very little money, with enormous  volunteer effort, are doing things that put meals, good meals, on the  tables of those families.   Don't pass this farm bill that takes that nutrition away from our  Vermonters and our American citizens.
