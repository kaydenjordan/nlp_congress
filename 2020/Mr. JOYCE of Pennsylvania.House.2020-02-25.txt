 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Andrea Devorris Cohen, a dedicated community leader whose work has  benefited the people of Blair County.   As the president of Lakemont Park, Andrea has led the recent  transformation of this amusement park into a renewed recreational  epicenter for our community. From new playgrounds and walking trails to  batting cages and basketball courts, Lakemont Park has been restored to  a beautiful facility where families and friends can gather together.   A homegrown Altoona leader and the daughter of Nancy and Don  Devorris, Andrea has spent her career working for our community and  improving the quality of life in Blair County. This week, she will be  honored by the Central Blair Recreation and Park Commission for her  many contributions and achievements.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 13th Congressional District of  Pennsylvania, we thank Andrea Devorris Cohen for her leadership in the  revitalization of this historic recreational center, as well as her  continued service to our community.                            ____________________
