 Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle in Congress to express my deep sorrow after yesterday's  shooting.   At the end of the day, we are not Republicans or Democrats; we are  Americans. We may disagree with one another, but we cannot allow those  disagreements to change how we treat each other as fellow human beings.   I believe we need to change our tone and bring more civility to our  political discourse. Young people across the country look to us to set  an example, and we all must rise to the occasion.   This horrible violence will not divide us and it will not stop us  from getting back to business on behalf of the American people.   Let us come together as Americans above all else, and, of course,  keep our good friend, Steve Scalise, and all of those affected by the  shootings in our prayers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the VETERAN  Act, H.R. 2372.   Our Nation's veterans must have access to affordable, quality  healthcare options. I know that is one thing, of course, everybody can  agree on, particularly when it comes to our veterans.   The VETERAN Act codifies an important protection for those who  served. Veterans who are not already enrolled in health insurance  through  [[Page H4928]]  the VA will continue to have the option to purchase coverage on the  individual insurance market.   Under the American Health Care Act, those veterans seeking coverage  on the individual market will be eligible for tax credits to purchase  the plan that is right for them. It is only right. This bill ensures  our veterans have more options and more control over their healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, again, this is something we can all agree on. I am proud  to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, and I urge passage.
