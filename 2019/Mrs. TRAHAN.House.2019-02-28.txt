 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Madam Speaker, I rise today with a great sense of  urgency.   Every day it seems as if there is another news story about a shooting  in a school, a movie theater, a synagogue, or on a city block. We have  lost far too many lives due to gun violence.   From my own community, I celebrate the life of Olivia Marchand from  Westford, whose mother, Jody, endured years of domestic abuse. In 2010,  she survived her husband's brutal attack but lost her beautiful Olivia  when her husband shot and killed her and then killed himself.   This tragedy devastated our whole community. As a mother, this loss  still fills me with grief and anger.   Today, Jody keeps her daughter's memory alive, educates women on  domestic violence, and fights for tougher gun laws. We must answer  America's call for action on gun violence, not the gun lobby's call to  maintain the status quo.   Yesterday, we passed universal background check legislation, a  necessary first step to tackle gun violence in America. I urge my  colleagues to continue voting for these critical reforms.                            ____________________
