 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 7) to make a technical amendment to the Violence Against Women  Act of 1994, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                    S. 7         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VAWA Technical Amendment Act       of 2022''.       SEC. 2. GRANTS TO COMBAT VIOLENT CRIMES.         (a) Amendment.--Section 2001(d) of title I of the Omnibus       Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C.       10441(d)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)--        (A) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``or Native       Hawaiian'' after ``Indian'';        (B) in subparagarph (B), by inserting ``or Native       Hawaiian'' after ``Indian'';        (C) in subparagraph (C)--        (i) by inserting ``or Native Hawaiian communities'' after       ``tribal communities''; and        (ii) by inserting ``or Native Hawaiian'' after ``Indian'';       and        (D) in subparagraph (D)--        (i) by inserting ``or Native Hawaiian communities'' after       ``Indian tribes''; and        (ii) by inserting ``or Native Hawaiian'' after ``against       Indian'';        (2) in paragraph (2)--        (A) in subparagraph (A)(iii), by inserting ``or Native       Hawaiian communities'' after ``Indian tribes''; and        (B) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``or Native Hawaiian       communities'' after ``Indian tribes''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(6) Native hawaiian defined.--In this subsection, the       term `Native Hawaiian' has the meaning given that term in       section 801 of the Native American Housing Assistance and  [[Page H9822]]       Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4221).''.        (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--Section       40002(a)(42) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (34       U.S.C. 12291(a)(42)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (A)--        (A) by inserting ``, Native Hawaiian organizations, or the       Native Hawaiian community'' after ``Indian service       providers'';        (B) by inserting ``, organizations, or communities'' after       ``member providers''; and        (C) by inserting ``or Native Hawaiian'' after ``designed to       assist Indian''; and        (2) in subparagraph (B)--        (A) in clause (i), by inserting ``, organizations, or       communities'' after ``member service providers''; and        (B) in clause (ii), by inserting ``or Native Hawaiian       communities'' after ``tribal communities''.       SEC. 3.         This Act shall become effective one day after enactment.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on S. 7.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 7, which would amend the  Violence Against Women Act to ensure that Native Hawaiian women can  access the benefits and support included in the critical Violence  Against Women Act.   According to the National Institute of Justice, more than 1.5 million  American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in  their lifetime, while women in these communities experience  significantly higher levels of sexual violence and stalking.   Since its introduction in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has  provided billions of dollars of grant funding to address the needs of  those who have survived domestic violence, sexual assault, sex  trafficking, dating violence, and other crimes against women.   One of VAWA's major grant programs, the Services, Training, Officers,  and Prosecutors grants, commonly known as STOP grants, provides funding  for eligible Native organizations to help combat sexual violence and  support victims and survivors. However, due to an error in drafting  language, which was first made known to Congress and the Department of  Justice in 2016, Native Hawaiian organizations have been unable to  access this funding to serve Native Hawaiian victims and survivors.   Specifically, Native Hawaiian organizations are able to apply for  STOP grant funding, but they cannot use those funds to actually serve  the Native Hawaiian community. As a result of this drafting oversight,  Native Hawaiian women are denied access to these critical resources,  which are meant to encourage the development and improvement of  effective victim advocacy and services in cases involving violent  crimes against women and to strengthen services to victims.   S. 7 would amend the act to include specific references to Native  Hawaiians and Native Hawaiian communities and organizations. This  simple fix would make certain that all victims and survivors of  domestic and sexual violence, including Native Hawaiian women, are able  to access the services and support they need to rebuild their lives.   I thank Senator Mazie Hirono for introducing this modest but  important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, for nearly three decades, the Violence  Against Women Act has provided critical funding to organizations that  support victims and survivors of gender-based violence. However, Native  Hawaiian women, who experience disproportionately high levels of sexual  violence, have been excluded from accessing these much-needed  resources.   S. 7 would allow Native Hawaiian victims and survivors to receive the  support they need and would allow Native Hawaiian organizations to  increase their efforts to combat sexual violence.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2991) to establish a Department of Homeland Security Center  for Countering Human Trafficking, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2991         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Countering Human Trafficking       Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the victim-centered approach must become universally       understood, adopted, and practiced;        (2) criminal justice efforts must increase the focus on,       and adeptness at, investigating and prosecuting forced labor       cases;        (3) corporations must eradicate forced labor from their       supply chains;        (4) the Department of Homeland Security must lead by       example--        (A) by ensuring that its government supply chain of       contracts and procurement are not tainted by forced labor;       and        (B) by leveraging all of its authorities against the       importation of goods produced with forced labor; and        (5) human trafficking training, awareness, identification,       and screening efforts--        (A) are a necessary first step for prevention, protection,       and enforcement; and        (B) should be evidence-based to be most effective.       SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CENTER FOR COUNTERING                     HUMAN TRAFFICKING.         (a) Establishment.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall       operate, within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's       Homeland Security Investigations, the Center for Countering       Human Trafficking (referred to in this Act as ``CCHT'').

(b) Operations Unit.--The CCHT Director shall operate,       within CCHT, an Operations Unit, which shall, at a minimum--        (1) support criminal investigations of human trafficking       (including sex trafficking and forced labor)--        (A) by developing, tracking, and coordinating leads; and        (B) by providing subject matter expertise;        (2) augment the enforcement of the prohibition on the       importation of goods produced with forced labor through civil       and criminal authorities;        (3) coordinate a Department-wide effort to conduct       procurement audits and enforcement actions, including       suspension and debarment, in order to mitigate the risk of       human trafficking throughout Department acquisitions and       contracts; and        (4) support all CCHT enforcement efforts with intelligence       by conducting lead development, lead validation, case       support, strategic analysis, and data analytics.        (c) Protection and Awareness Programs Unit.--The CCHT       Director shall operate, within CCHT, a Protection and       Awareness Programs Unit, which shall--        (1) incorporate a victim-centered approach throughout       Department of Homeland Security policies, training, and       practices;        (2) operate a comprehensive Continued Presence program;        (3) conduct, review, and assist with Department of Homeland       Security human trafficking training, screening, and       identification tools and efforts;        (4) operate the Blue Campaign's nationwide public awareness       effort and any other awareness efforts needed to encourage       victim identification and reporting to law enforcement and to       prevent human trafficking; and        (5) coordinate external engagement, including training and       events, regarding human trafficking with critical partners,       including survivors, nongovernmental organizations,       corporations, multilateral entities, law enforcement       agencies, and other interested parties.       SEC. 4. SPECIALIZED INITIATIVES.         (a) Human Trafficking Information Modernization       Initiative.--The CCHT Director, in conjunction with the       Science and Technology Directorate Office of Science and       Engineering, shall develop a strategy and proposal to modify       systems and processes throughout the Department of Homeland       Security that are related to CCHT's mission in order to--        (1) decrease the response time to access victim       protections;        (2) accelerate lead development;        (3) advance the identification of human trafficking       characteristics and trends;        (4) fortify the security and protection of sensitive       information;        (5) apply analytics to automate manual processes; and        (6) provide artificial intelligence and machine learning to       increase system capabilities and enhance data availability,       reliability, comparability, and verifiability.

SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         In addition to amounts otherwise authorized to be       appropriated, there is authorized to be appropriated to the       Secretary of Homeland Security to carry out this Act       $14,000,000, which shall remain available until expended.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on S. 2991.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2991, which would codify the  Center for Countering Human Trafficking within the Immigration and  Customs Enforcement agency of the Department of Homeland Security;  require the center to develop a strategy to improve the effectiveness  of its programs; and transfer the Department's national trafficking  awareness Blue Campaign to the center.   Human trafficking is a multibillion-dollar criminal industry that  exists in cities, suburbs, and rural towns and denies freedom to nearly  25 million people around the world.   Although some populations are more vulnerable than others,  trafficking is a constant threat to the health and safety of victims of  all ages, genders, nationalities, and backgrounds, while posing a grave  danger to public health and safety, as well as national and global  security.   In 2020, the National Human Trafficking Hotline identified more than  16,000 victims of human trafficking, who likely represent only a  fraction of the total number of victims.   In that same year, the Department of Homeland Security launched the  Center for Countering Human Trafficking, or the CCHT, a centralized  location for subject matter experts to coordinate and expand efforts to  combat human trafficking. The CCHT integrates the efforts of 16 DHS  offices and agencies that combat human sex trafficking and forced  labor, which encompasses criminal investigations, victim assistance,  identifying and reporting human trafficking, and external outreach,  intelligence, and training.   Since its establishment, the CCHT has made great strides, providing  critical support and analysis to criminal investigators in the field;  delivering comprehensive training to domestic and international  audiences; and focusing on promoting an integrated, victim-centered  approach to the investigation of human trafficking.   However, because the center is not formally codified, it lacks  permanence and long-term funding necessary to further strengthen its  efforts.   S. 2991 would make the CCHT permanent within ICE, ensuring that the  progress made in recent years can be maintained and improved upon,  while also increasing coordination among other components within DHS to  fight human trafficking and prevent the importation of products made  using forced labor.   This legislation would allow the CCHT to fortify its permanent  staffing with at least 45 employees that are special agents, criminal  analysts, victim-support specialists, and other subject-matter experts  dedicated to disrupting and dismantling human trafficking organizations  and providing support and protection to their victims.   To promote modernization of the CCHT's information systems and  operations, which support global investigations of human trafficking  and forced labor in supply chains, S. 2991 would require the  development of a strategy and proposal to modify systems and processes  related to its mission.   Lastly, this bill would transfer to the CCHT the Blue Campaign, the  national public awareness campaign designed to educate the public, law  enforcement, and industry partners to recognize and respond to human  trafficking, and authorize DHS to transfer any additional functions to  the CCHT that combat human trafficking and the production of goods  using forced labor.   Because we know that traffickers are constantly looking for new ways  to exploit new victims, we must do more to fight this grave crime. That  includes being responsive to change and making necessary improvements  to the agencies, offices, and components put in place to investigate,  disrupt, and dismantle trafficking organizations and to give aid and  support to victims.   This bipartisan legislation would allow the Center for Countering  Human Trafficking to continue guiding counter-human trafficking  operations, protecting victims, and enhancing prevention efforts to  combat human trafficking around the world.   I thank Senator Gary Peters for introducing this important  legislation, as well as Representative   John Katko, and the bipartisan  coalition of colleagues who have worked on the House companion.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                   Washington, DC, December 9, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning S.       2991, the ``Countering Human Trafficking Act of 2021.'' There       are certain provisions in the legislation that fall within       the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland       Security.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's formal consideration       of the provisions that fall within its jurisdiction. I do so       with the understanding that, by waiving consideration of the       bill, the Committee on Homeland Security does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters       contained in the bill which fall within its rule X       jurisdiction.        Please place this letter in the Congressional Record during       consideration of S. 2991  [[Page H9825]]       on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in       which you have worked regarding this matter and others       between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, December 9, 2022.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: I am writing to you concerning S.       2991, the ``Countering Human Trafficking Act of 2021.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Homeland Security. I acknowledge that your Committee will not       formally consider S. 2991 and agree that the inaction of your       Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in S. 2991       which fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                      Jerry Nadler,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, S. 2991 would not only provide permanency,  increased coordination, and modernization to the Center for Countering  Human Trafficking and the Department of Homeland Security, this bill  would also promote growth within the center and bolster victim-centered  counter human trafficking efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2899) to require the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to  address deficiencies and make necessary upgrades to the security camera  and radio systems of the Bureau of Prisons to ensure the health and  safety of employees and inmates.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2899         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Prison Camera Reform Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Bureau of Prisons has 122 institutions located       throughout the United States. The Bureau of Prisons employs       nearly 38,000 employees and is responsible for more than       150,000 Federal inmates.        (2) Video footage from security camera systems and reliable       communication over radio systems within Bureau of Prisons       institutions are essential to protecting the health and       safety of Bureau of Prisons employees and Federal inmates.        (3) Based on the experience of Bureau of Prisons       correctional staff, the noticeable presence of functioning       security cameras serves as an effective deterrent to criminal       behavior and misconduct.        (4) Well-documented deficiencies of camera systems at       Bureau of Prisons' facilities have hindered investigators'       ability to substantiate allegations of serious misconduct by       staff and inmates, including sexual and physical assaults,       medical neglect, and introduction of contraband.        (5) In a 2016 report, the Office of the Inspector General       for the Department of Justice determined that ``deficiencies       within the BOP's security camera system have affected the       OIG's ability to secure prosecutions of staff and inmates in       BOP contraband introduction cases, and these same problems       adversely impact the availability of critical evidence to       support administrative or disciplinary action against staff       and inmates''.        (6) Shortcomings in the land-mobile radio systems at Bureau       of Prison facilities institutions impede the communication       abilities of staff, slowing or preventing the response of       correctional officers during an emergency or threat of       attack, and jeopardizing the safety of both staff and Federal       inmates.       SEC. 3. REQUIRED PLAN FOR REFORM OF BOP SECURITY CAMERA AND                     RADIO COVERAGE AND CAPABILITIES.         (a) Plan.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons       shall--        (1) evaluate the security camera, land-mobile radio       (referred to in this Act as ``LMR''), and public address       (referred to in this Act as ``PA'') systems in use by the       Bureau of Prisons as of the date of enactment of this Act;       and        (2) submit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate       and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of       Representatives a plan for ensuring that all Bureau of       Prisons correctional facilities have the security camera,       LMR, and PA system coverage and capabilities necessary to--        (A) ensure the health and safety of staff and Federal       inmates; and        (B) ensure the documentation and accessibility of video       evidence that may pertain to misconduct by staff or inmates,       negligent or abusive treatment of inmates, or criminal       activity within correctional facilities.        (b) Contents.--The plan required under subsection (a)       shall--  [[Page H9827]]         (1) identify and include plans to address any deficiencies       in the security camera system in use at Bureau of Prisons       correctional facilities, including those related to--        (A) an insufficient number of cameras;        (B) inoperable or malfunctioning cameras;        (C) blind spots;        (D) poor quality video; and        (E) any other deficits in the security camera system;        (2) identify and include plans to adopt and maintain any       security camera system upgrades needed to achieve the       purposes described in subsection (a), including--        (A) conversion of all analog cameras to digital       surveillance systems, with corresponding infrastructure and       equipment upgrade requirements;        (B) upgrades to ensure the secure storage, logging,       preservation, and accessibility of recordings such that the       recordings are available to investigators or Courts at such       time as may be reasonably required; and        (C) additional enterprise-wide camera system capabilities       needed to enhance the safety and security of inmates and       staff;        (3) identify and include plans to address any deficiencies       in the LMR and PA systems in use at Bureau of Prisons       correctional facilities, including those related to--        (A) an inadequate number of radios;        (B) inoperable, outdated, or malfunctioning LMR or PA       systems;        (C) areas of Bureau of Prisons correctional facilities that       lack adequate reception for radio operation;        (D) radios that lack an emergency notification feature       (also known as a ``man down'' function), which automatically       sends an alert and transmits the location of that radio in       the event the wearer is in a prone position; and        (E) any other deficits in the LMR or PA systems;        (4) include an assessment of operational and logistical       considerations in implementing the plan required under       subsection (a), including--        (A) a prioritization of facilities for needed upgrades,       beginning with high security institutions;        (B) the personnel and training necessary to implement the       changes; and        (C) ongoing repair and maintenance requirements; and        (5) include a 3-year strategic plan and cost projection for       implementing the changes and upgrades to the security camera,       LMR, and PA systems identified under paragraphs (1) through       (4).

(d) Annual Progress Reports.--Beginning 1 year after the       date on which the plan is submitted under subsection (a)(2),       and each year thereafter until the end of the 3-year period       described in subsection (c), the Director of the Bureau of       Prisons shall submit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the       Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of       Representatives a report on the progress of the       implementation of the submitted plan.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 2899.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 2899, the Prison Camera Reform Act of 2021, is  bipartisan legislation that would require the Bureau of Prisons to  evaluate the security camera, land-mobile radio, and public address  systems in use at the BOP institutions, submit to Congress a report on  any deficiencies, and implement a plan for needed improvements.   In 2016, the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General issued  a report on deficiencies within BOP camera systems. The report found  that camera deficiencies affected the ability to secure prosecutions of  staff and incarcerated individuals in cases involving introduction of  contraband in BOP facilities and adversely affected the availability of  critical evidence to support administrative or disciplinary action  against staff and incarcerated individuals.   Following that report, BOP took some action to improve the camera  systems. However, their efforts have proved insufficient. A follow-up  OIG memo in 2021 found that of the over 24,000 cameras across all BOP  institutions, 86 percent, more than 20,000, are still analog or utilize  old technology. Analog cameras produce poor-quality video, have limited  coverage, and contribute to dangerous or unsafe areas within BOP  institutions.   A fully digital camera system would produce improved video quality  and coverage, enhanced search capabilities, and expand video storage  periods of between 60 and 120 days. These capabilities would improve  the BOP's threat assessments, monitoring, and contraband interdictions.   Improving BOP camera systems will create safer institutions for both  correctional staff and incarcerated individuals.   Tragic cases of officer assaults against individuals while  incarcerated often rely on camera footage as evidence, but outdated  technology makes holding these officers accountable even more  difficult.   This bill would require the BOP to investigate and address  deficiencies in the camera and radio systems across all institutions.  The BOP would also be required to implement all needed improvements  within 3 years and to submit annual progress reports. The significant  oversight mechanisms within this legislation will enable Congress to  hold the BOP accountable and ensure that all deficiencies are addressed  within the specified time period.   Security camera systems within prisons are critical for protecting  the safety, well-being, and civil rights of both incarcerated people  and prison employees.   This bipartisan measure would require the BOP to investigate and  address these critical safety concerns and ensure that the improvements  will, in fact, be made by including significant congressional  oversight.   I thank Representatives Keller, McBath, and Trone, as well as Senator  Ossoff, for introducing this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the lack of adequate camera systems puts the  safety of both incarcerated individuals and correctional officers and  staff at risk.   The Prison Camera Reform Act of 2021 is bipartisan legislation that  takes an important step toward making much-needed improvements.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 5230) to increase accessibility to the National Missing and  Unidentified Persons System, to facilitate data sharing between such  system and the National Crime Information Center database of the  Federal Bureau of Investigation, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 5230         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on S. 5230.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Every year in this country over 600,000 Americans go missing. While  many of the missing are fortunate to be found alive and well, tens of  thousands of individuals remain missing for more than 1 year, what many  agencies consider to be cold cases.   It is also estimated that 4,400 unidentified bodies are recovered  each year, with approximately 1,000 of those remaining unidentified,  also becoming cold cases.   The families of those who go missing are forced to endure crushing  uncertainty, not knowing what happened to their loved ones or if they  will ever return. But they also face systemic challenges in helping law  enforcement locate the missing or match them to unidentified remains so  that they can at least have some semblance of closure.   The Help Find the Missing Act, or Billy's Law, is bipartisan  legislation that will help address this crisis by closing loopholes in  our Nation's missing person databases by streamlining the reporting  process and ensuring that law enforcement databases are more  comprehensive and accessible.   The bill is named after Billy Smolinski of Waterbury, Connecticut,  who went missing in 2004 at the age of 31, and whose family ran into  countless obstacles as they attempted to help law enforcement in the  search, including that Federal law does not mandate the reporting of  missing adults or unidentified bodies.   This problem is compounded by the fact that local law enforcement  agencies, medical examiners, and coroners often lack the resources and  training to report these cases to the appropriate national authorities.  When cases of missing persons or unidentified remains are reported, the  number of separate and uncoordinated Federal,  [[Page H9830]]  State, and local databases makes it extremely difficult to find the  missing or match them with recovered remains.   Billy's Law will address these challenges by authorizing and ensuring  funding for the Department of Justice to continue to maintain the  National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs, which is  the national clearinghouse and resource center for missing,  unidentified, and unclaimed persons. It provides an online database  that is accessible to law enforcement and the public, and to which the  public can contribute.   NamUs also provides free forensic services to aid in the  identification of missing persons and unidentified remains;  investigative support to law enforcement agencies; technical assistance  to families of missing persons; and its subject matter experts train  State and local service providers to support individuals and families  impacted by the disappearance of a loved one.   Critically, Billy's Law would require data sharing between NamUs and  the FBI's National Crime Information Center, or NCIC, in order to  create more comprehensive databases of missing persons and unidentified  remains and streamline the reporting process for State, local, and  Tribal law enforcement. It would also amend current law to require that  missing children be reported to NamUs as well as to NCIC, and it would  require the reporting of information on every unidentified deceased  person, regardless of age.   In addition, the bill would require the Attorney General to issue  guidelines and best practices to law enforcement, medical examiners,  and coroners on handling cases involving missing persons or  unidentified remains.   We must do everything possible to ensure that we have a comprehensive  and coordinated missing persons reporting and investigation system that  works so that we can provide resolution to the families of those whose  loved ones disappear.   I thank Senator Chris Murphy for his yearslong effort to pass Billy's  Law, and I thank Representative Jahana Hayes for introducing the House  companion bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), a sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, the families and loved ones of those who  have gone missing spend every day desperately searching for answers and  for help. Billy's Law provides critical tools to help them find  answers, coordinating our Nation's multiple missing persons databases,  increasing reporting requirements, and providing training and resources  to the myriad agencies that investigate these cases, while supporting  the victims' families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of  this crucial bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1518, I call  up the bill (S. 4003) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe  Streets Act of 1968 to provide for training on alternatives to use of  force, de-escalation, and mental and behavioral health and suicidal  crises, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on S. 4003.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, S. 4003, the Law Enforcement De-Escalation Training  Act of 2022, is bipartisan legislation that would improve training for  law enforcement officers, including training on using alternatives to  force and de-escalation tactics.   This bill was previously brought to the floor under suspension of the  rules, but it failed to garner the necessary two-thirds majority  support. I was disappointed to see some of my Republican colleagues  continue to lead efforts to withhold desperately needed training  resources from law enforcement officers.   I am hopeful that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may  have had more time to consider the significance and importance of  passing this critical legislation to not only improve policing  practices through increased training, but also to make our communities  safer by ensuring individuals in crisis receive the help they need.   Law enforcement officers are often the first responders to  individuals in crisis. While we have worked to develop and implement  non-law enforcement crisis response services, there continues to be a  need to train and equip law enforcement officers to de-escalate  interactions and divert individuals to appropriate mental and  behavioral health services.   Additionally, there is a need to provide officers and crisis response  teams the tools they need to understand and respond to individuals with  disabilities. One study found that disabled individuals make up one- third to one-half of all people killed by law enforcement officers.   Reforms to law enforcement, including de-escalation training, both  improve public safety and reduce crime. A study of the Louisville,  Kentucky, police department found that de-escalation training reduced  use-of-force incidents by 28 percent and community member injuries by  26 percent. Officer injuries were reduced by an even larger margin of  36 percent.   S. 4003 would require the Department of Justice's Office of Community  Oriented Policing Services to consult with a broad range of  stakeholders in developing the training curriculum, including law  enforcement and behavioral health groups, as well as civil rights and  civil liberties groups and associations that represent individuals with  disabilities.   This bill also requires the National Institute of Justice and the  Government Accountability Office to evaluate the implementation of the  program and the effect of the training to ensure that the curricula  have a tangible impact on law enforcement encounters with people in  crisis and to identify possible changes that would further improve  outcomes.   This bipartisan bill has broad support from law enforcement, mental  health, and community advocacy groups, and would improve public safety  by developing and implementing evidence-based de-escalation training  for law enforcement officers.   I thank Senator Cornyn for introducing this bill and former  Congresswoman Karen Bass for leading the House version of this  important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa), a distinguished member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support  of this legislation from the Louisiana Sheriffs' Association, the Major  Cities Chiefs Association, the National Fraternal Order of Police, the  American Conservative Union, the American Academy of Social Work and  Social Welfare, the American Association for Psychoanalysis and  Clinical Social Work, the American Association of Psychiatric  Pharmacists, the American Association of Health and Disability, the  American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the American Group  Psychotherapy Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the  American Psychological Association, the Anxiety and Depression  Association of America, the Association for Ambulatory Behavioral  Healthcare, the Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder, Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, the  Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, the Meadows Mental Health  Policy Institute, NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals,  the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the National Alliance to  Advance Adolescent Health, the National Association for Children's  Behavioral Health, the National Board for Certified Counselors, the  National Council for Mental Wellbeing, the National Eating Disorders  Association, the National Federation of Families, and National Network  of Depression Centers, Catholic Charities USA, Catholic Prison Ministry  Coalition, the Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development,  United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Center for Public  Justice, the Jesuit Conference Office of Justice and Ecology, the  National Association of Evangelicals, the National Latino Evangelical  Coalition, National Hispanic Christian Leadership Coalition, and the  Prison Fellowship.                                Louisiana Sheriffs' Association,                           Baton Rouge, Louisiana, October 19, 2022.      Hon. Steve Scalise,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Honorable Steve Scalise: On behalf of Louisiana's 64       sheriffs and the over 14,000 deputies they serve, I am       writing you today to express our strong support for the bi-      partisan Law Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act which       passed the Senate by Unanimous Consent on August 1, 2022.       This legislation seeks to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and       Safe Streets Act of 1968 to provide for training on       alternatives to use of force, including de-escalation and       mental and behavioral health and suicidal crises training.        As you know, Louisiana currently has a population of       approximately 4.52 million people. According to the most       recent Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services       Administration Behavioral Health Barometer, close to 5.6       percent of adults (253,120) in our state live with serious       mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar       disorder, and major depression. During 2017-2019, the annual       average prevalence of past-year serious thoughts of suicide       was 4.4 percent. Yet, only 39.5 percent of adults with mental       illness in Louisiana receive any form of treatment from       either the public system or private providers. The remaining       60.5 percent receive no mental health treatment. Furthermore,       according to Mental Health America, Louisiana is ranked 35th       out of the 50 states and Washington D.C. for providing access       to mental health services.        Despite our sheriffs best efforts to train our deputies in       incident response that includes deescalation, problem       solving, and mental health awareness, we are asking       Louisiana's law enforcement community to compensate for an       overworked mental and behavioral health system. If we are       going to ensure more citizens who are in need of mental       healthcare receive such care when they encounter a deputy, we       need to ensure our deputies have the tools and training to       help facilitate this transition to care. This is why the Law       Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act is so important.        For the first time, the Law Enforcement De-Escalation       Training Act would provide federal support for Louisiana's       sheriff offices to adopt de-escalation training to respond       more effectively to people suffering with a mental or       behavioral crises. It would require the Attorney General to       develop de-escalation training curricula, authorize annual       grant funding for training, evaluate implementation to       improve trainings and outcomes and foster greater       collaboration with community mental and behavioral support       centers. The legislation also enjoys the support ofthe       National Sheriffs' Association, the Major Country Sheriff's       Association, the National Criminal Justice Association along       with the National Association for Rural Mental Health, The       Anxiety and Depression Association of America, and the       Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute.        Senator John Cornyn, one of the lead sponsors of the Law       Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act put it best when he       stated ``We ask law enforcement in our communities to wear       too many hats, including that of mental health provider, and       they often do not have enough resources or training to       provide the level of care individuals in crisis need.'' With       your support, the House of Representatives has an opportunity       to fix this, and we hope it can do so before the end of the       year.        Thank you for your continued efforts in support of       Louisiana's law enforcement community. We look forward to       working with you to ensure this critical legislation's       enactment.            Sincerely,                                                   Michael Ranatza,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                  Major Cities Chiefs Association,                                                     April 05, 2022.      Hon. John Cornyn,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cornyn and Senator Whitehouse: I am writing on       behalf of the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) to       register our support for S. 4003, the Law Enforcement De-      Escalation Training Act of 2022. The MCCA is a professional       organization of law enforcement executives representing the       largest cities in the United States and Canada.        The MCCA is a leader in national policy debates on policing       reform and, in January 2021, released a comprehensive report       that addressed a number of topics, including training. This       report recommended that all law enforcement officers undergo       training on de-escalation tactics.        De-escalation training is already a part of many MCCA       members' standard training curriculums. Law enforcement       training is quite expensive, however, and the Law Enforcement       De-Escalation Training Act will provide critical grant       funding to help offset the costs associated with de-      escalation training. Furthermore, MCCA members will also be       able to use these resources for continuing education. which       will help further enhance existing de-escalation training       programs.        Thank you for your leadership on this issue and your       continued support of law enforcement. Please do not hesitate       to contact me if the MCCA can be of additional assistance.            Sincerely.                                                     Jeri Williams,                                  Chief, Phoenix Police Department,      President, Major Cities Chiefs Association.                                   ____                               National Fraternal Order of Police,                                      Washington, DC, April 8, 2022.      Hon. John Cornyn III,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Cornyn and Whitehouse: I am writing on behalf       of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you       of our support for S. 4003, the ``Law Enforcement De-      escalation Training Act.''        Law enforcement officers face numerous challenges when       responding to threats against public safety, and not all of       these threats are necessarily criminal in nature. Police are       on the front lines and are often called to deal with       individuals experiencing mental illness, substance abuse       issues, or similar psychological impairments who may become       dangerous to themselves or to the public. Recent studies       found that as many as ten percent of all law enforcement       encounters involve individuals experiencing these issues. The       Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration       (SAMHSA) has estimated that over 2 million individuals       arrested each year are struggling with a serious mental       illness.        Your legislation would address this issue by providing $70       million in annual grant funding from the Edward Byrne       Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne-JAG) to State and       local law enforcement agencies to train officers in de-      escalation tactics and alternatives to the use of force. The       U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Community Oriented       Policing Services (COPS), through  [[Page H9836]]       consultation with State and local law enforcement agencies,       would be required to develop a curriculum of relevant       training topics, including de-escalation tactics, use of       force alternatives, establishing and maintaining crisis       intervention teams, as well as how to safely respond to       mental and behavioral health crises using public benefits       programs, housing assistance programs, and other relevant       services. The funding from this bill will be used to cover       the cost of training, attendance, overtime fees, and the       procurement of certifications. Additionally, the National       Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the Government Accountability       Office (GAO) would study and evaluate the impacts of the       training. This would ensure that the training has a       meaningful, tangible impact on law enforcement encounters       with individuals in crisis.        The implementation of de-escalation techniques would have a       tremendous positive impact on public safety and the       relationship between the public and law enforcement officers.       Numerous studies have shown that civilians base their       perceptions of law enforcement on their last encounter.       Providing officers with the skills and training to avoid       needless escalation of calls for service enable officers to       protect the public more effectively. This improved       communication will create a better police force and safer       communities.        On behalf of the more than 364,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, we thank you both for your leadership on       this important issue. If I can provide any additional       information about this bill, please do not hesitate to       contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco in our Washington,       DC office.            Sincerely,                                                      Patrick Yoes,      National President.                                   ____                                      American Conservative Union,                           Alexandria, Virginia, September 29, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee Rayburn HOB      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan: The       American Conservative Union (''ACU'') is the nation's oldest       grassroots advocacy organization. Founded in 1964 by William       F. Buckley. we have a 50-plus-year track record of advancing       policies that reduce the size and scope of government,       advance liberty, and reduce burdens on families. Criminal       justice reform, if done properly, fits squarely within this       rubric.        ACU also strongly supports law enforcement. We have asked       our police officers to do more and more in recent years.       Today, our men and women in blue are not only cops putting       their lives on the line every day; they also serve as family,       marriage and addiction counselors, mental health responders,       and social workers, too. As a result, officers have day-to-      day interactions with people in crisis, and this often       escalates to the point that a use of force is necessary.       Deescalation is an important skillset for officer safety as       well as for those in crisis when they encounter law       enforcement.        Accordingly, we support the efforts of Senators John Cornyn       (R-TX) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) to ensure that funding       for de-escalation training is expanded. S. 4003 establishes       funding through the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (``JAG'')       program totaling $90 million for two years to help state and       local law enforcement obtain de-escalation crisis       intervention training. This funding will be targeted to       smaller law enforcement departments that would otherwise lack       resources for this type of training.        It is notable that the curriculum will leverage the ``train       the trainer'' model to allow a significant increase in       training opportunities by having officers train their       colleagues. Not only is this an efficient use of resources,       it helps inculcate the lessons and values of de-escalation in       the culture of the departments funded by this program.        Finally, S. 4003 includes strong reporting and evaluation       requirements on grants for the Department of Justice, the       National Institute of Justice, and the Government       Accountability Agency. ACU believes the justice system must       be accountable for a wise use of tax dollars, and these       requirements will ensure that state and local law enforcement       are effectively using their grants to serve their communities       well.        We believe S. 4003 would be a prudent use of taxpayer       resources and as such, urge you to take this important       legislation up as soon as possible. Should S. 4003 come to       the floor, we will recommend to our colleagues at our sister       organization, the ACU Foundation's Center for Legislative       Accountability, to score this bill positively.            Respectfully,                                                 David H. Safavian,      General Counsel.                                   ____                                                     August 3, 2022.      Office of Senator John Cornyn,      Hart Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.      Office of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse,      Hart Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Cornyn and Whitehouse: Our faith-based       organizations write to urge for broad co-sponsorship among       your colleagues and the swift passage of the Law Enforcement       De-escalation Training Act of 2022 (S.4003) as it would help       police officers better serve vulnerable populations and keep       our communities safe. Furthermore, this bill would promote a       more restorative justice system that respects the God-given       dignity of each person and promote safe communities for both       law enforcement officers and residents. The bill would also       provide law enforcement officers with the skills and tools       needed to respond appropriately to the needs of the       communities they protect and serve.        Police officers respond every day to calls for service for       men and women grappling with grave mental and behavioral       health challenges. However, they are not consistently trained       to address these situations effectively. Inadequate training       can undermine law enforcement officers' wellbeing and job       satisfaction, and increase incidents of excessive use of       force that erodes public trust. Policymakers must better       equip law enforcement officers with evidence-based training       for interactions with people in crisis that fosters community       partnership, promotes understanding of mental illness, and       prioritizes the lowest level of force necessary to keep       communities safe.        Several key provisions position the Law Enforcement De-      escalation Training Act (S.4003) to be a catalyst for       modernizing American policing. The legislation would create a       new federal funding stream to provide training for law       enforcement agencies on de-escalation techniques, on       participation in crisis intervention teams, on making       referrals to community-based service providers, on safely       responding to individuals in a behavioral or mental health       crisis, and on alternatives to use of force. Furthermore, the       bill would advance transparency and accountability to best       practices through strong reporting and evaluation       requirements from the Department of Justice, National       Institute of Justice, and Government Accountability Office.       To foster public trust, the Department of Justice will       develop training curriculum in collaboration with mental       health providers, law enforcement agencies, civil rights       organizations, and other stakeholders. The legislation would       provide funding for continuing education for law enforcement       officers to further refine their knowledge and tactical       skills beyond initial training requirements.        We support the passage of the Law Enforcement De-escalation       Training Act of 2022 as it would provide law enforcement       officers the training needed to carefully respond to the       needs of the community in a way that would promote human       dignity and strengthen public trust.            Sincerely,        Catholic Charities USA,        Catholic Prison Ministry Coalition,        Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development, United       States Conference of Catholic Bishops,        Center for Public Justice,        Jesuit Conference Office of Justice and Ecology,        National Association of Evangelicals,        National Latino Evangelical Coalition,        National Hispanic Christian Leadership Coalition,        Prison Fellowship.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Trone), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, S. 4003 is bipartisan legislation that would improve  training for law enforcement officers, including training using  alternatives to force and de-escalation tactics. This training will  reduce use-of-force incidents and improve officer and community safety.   It passed the Senate unanimously. The most conservative Republican  Senators all voted for it. I read a long list of organizations  supporting it. The American Conservative Union is not a group noted for  profligate Federal spending.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to have some perspective on this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
