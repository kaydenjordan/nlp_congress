 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  the blue State bailout budget. The Democrats know they don't have the  votes to pass these radical policies in the Senate, so they are  doubling down on reconciliation to destroy our economy with a $2  trillion taxpayer-funded spending spree.   Democrats are using reconciliation for the exact opposite purpose for  which it was created. With this budget, Democrats are bailing out  failing Democrat-run States like Illinois and New York, expanding the  welfare state, exploding the deficit, groveling to teachers' unions and  teachers who refuse to go to work, and hiking taxes on businessowners  who don't comply with the higher minimum wage standard. This is just  the beginning.   They want to pay people more money to stay home rather than allowing  them to go back to work and earn a paycheck. They are fine letting  schoolchildren and parents suffer while teachers' unions ignore them  and still collect taxpayer-funded paychecks.   American politicians sent millions of children and young adults home,  closed their schools, and banned them from going to their jobs. They  forced them to stay in isolation from their peers. They canceled prom,  canceled sports, and canceled graduation.                                time  1415    They claim this was for their safety, but the results have been  horrific. Suicide and depression have been on the rise. Do you think  any family will feel like a consolation prize of $1,400 will make them  feel good about their teen that committed suicide because of the  shutdowns? I don't think so.   Democrats are trying to raise the minimum wage for jobs that they  won't even let people go to work in. Democrats closed their States  while Georgia stayed open. Why are we supposed to bail them out? Why  are my hardworking constituents being punished for wanting to go to  work and support their families?   Democrat Governors have run their States like tyrants of third-world  countries, not like free Americans. They are oppressing the American  people and reaping the benefits.
