 Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of  Ms. Shalanda Baker to be the Director of the Office of Minority  Economic Impact at the Department of Energy.   Congress established the Office of Minority Economic Impact within  the Department of Energy in 1978. Congress recognized that the energy  shortages and rising energy prices we faced at the time would have an  overwhelming impact on the quality of life for our socially or  economically disadvantaged citizens.   The Office of Minority Economic Impact was created to provide a  mechanism to ensure that the energy needs of minorities were fairly  considered and addressed. Its goals were, first, to understand the  impacts of our energy policies and programs on the quality of life in  minority communities and, second, to ensure that minority business  enterprises are afforded an equal opportunity to participate fully in  the energy programs of the Department.   The position of Director was created not only to head this office,  but also to advise the Secretary of Energy on the effect of the energy  policies, regulations, and actions of the Department on minorities and  on how to increase minority participation in the Department's programs.  The position does not carry with it the policy making or regulatory or  adjudicatory powers of many other senior offices in the Department of  Energy, but it plays an important role in ensuring that the needs of  minority and disadvantaged communities are justly and fairly addressed  and that they are treated fairly.   The Director also helps ensure that the Department complies with our  civil rights and equal employment laws and that it maintains a diverse  workforce and inclusive work environment.   The Department of Energy's commitment to fairness, equality, and  diversity has always been important. But it is especially important  today, as we face record high fuel prices, come to grips with the  global climate crisis, and transform how we fuel our economy. We must  ensure that our energy policies do not leave anyone behind or impose an  unfair or disproportionate burden on minority or disadvantaged  communities.   I believe Ms. Baker is very well qualified for this position. She has  spent the past decade studying the impact of the transition from fossil  fuels to cleaner energy resources on disadvantaged communities. And she  has spent the past 17 months serving as the Deputy Director for Energy  Justice and as Secretary Granholm's Advisor on Equity.   I strongly support her nomination, and I urge a favorable vote on her  nomination.

Hunt upon her retirement after more than 20 remarkable years of service  to the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation.   I have often said there is no greater accomplishment than to find  yourself in a position to give back to the community you love. As a  Clarksburg native, Mary Hunt has served the people of her community and  beyond with professionalism, compassion, and respect throughout her  entire career.   Mary has never taken any position she has held lightly--and has  always seen herself primarily as a servant of the people of West  Virginia. She worked tirelessly for the Charleston mayor's office of  economic and community development throughout the late `80s and early  `90s. Mary found herself in the capital city at a pivotal time, when  major development projects were coming to fruition. It is hard to  imagine a Charleston today without such iconic spaces as Haddad  Riverfront Park and Capitol Market, but Mary was there when the ideas  were conceived and helped bring them to reality.   Mary made her mark in State government, too. In the early 1990s,  during Gaston Caperton's administration, she worked as executive  assistant to the cabinet secretary for the West Virginia Department of  Commerce for 2 years and then as the chief of administration for the  West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection for 5 years,  through 1997. Truly, her legacy of civic service is one we should all  instill in ourselves.   Throughout her time as program director at the Benedum Foundation,  Mary served as an irreplaceable leader by advancing the foundation's  existing programs and starting new initiatives to ensure the  organization's continued viability and positive social impact. Time and  time again, Mary has made her devotion to helping others abundantly  clear--not only through her philanthropy projects, but by building new  partnerships and inviting others into the fold--ultimately bolstering  her capacity for good.   Over the last two decades, Mary has helped numerous communities, both  internally and externally, to help them make their projects possible.  During her tenure, she has helped distribute grants in almost all 55 of  West Virginia's counties, supporting nearly 650 grant projects and  touching roughly 200 organizations.   With an unrivaled, strong spirit of optimism and innovation, her  commitment to strengthening our communities is something to admire. Her  work has undoubtedly advanced the foundation, but more importantly, our  entire State. I know she has inspired many young leaders throughout her  illustrious career, and I am confident that they will carry the torch  to ensure a brighter tomorrow.  [[Page S2813]]    I will always be grateful to Mary for her passion for serving the  people of West Virginia. While she is retiring and everyone is sure to  miss her strong leadership, Mary Hunt's unwavering dedication will  leave a lasting legacy on the countless lives she has touched. Again, I  congratulate Mary for her remarkable years of service, and I am honored  to wish good health and much happiness to Mary and her family in the  days and years ahead.                            ____________________
