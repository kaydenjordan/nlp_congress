 Madam Speaker, June is Alzheimer's and  Brain Awareness Month. Worldwide, there are an estimated 47 million  people living with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Without a change,  these numbers are expected to grow to 76 million by the year 2030.   Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States  and is the only leading cause of death that cannot be prevented, cured,  or even slowed. Sadly, one in three seniors will die with the disease.   This disease took my mother's life.   Alzheimer's has a devastating impact on those who are diagnosed with  the disease and their caregivers and loved ones. More than 16 million  Americans provide unpaid care to family and friends living with  Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.   Compared with caregivers for people without dementia, twice as many  caregivers for people with dementia indicate substantial emotional,  financial, and physical stress.
