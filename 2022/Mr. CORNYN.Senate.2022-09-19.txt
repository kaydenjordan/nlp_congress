 Madam President, when Attorney General Garland went  through the confirmation process for his current job as Attorney  General of the United States, he made a solemn pledge to keep politics  out of the Justice Department. I, for one, was encouraged by his  statement, having seen the disastrous politicization of the Justice  Department under former Attorneys General Eric Holder and Loretta  Lynch.   Attorney General Garland said this. He said:         I will never make a decision in the Department based on       politics or partisanship.    I took him at his word. I hoped we wouldn't see a return to the days  when people saw double standards play out in the Justice Department  based on who happened to be in office, who happened to be investigated.  But, clearly, under Attorney General Garland's leadership, the  Department of Justice has pointed its arrows toward concerned parents,  for example, who are exercising their First Amendment rights to  [[Page S4814]]  speak up about their children's education. Attorney General Garland has  sued the State of Georgia and the State of Texas, for example, claiming  that ballot integrity measures that are within the prerogative of the  States to pass were somehow suppressing the public's right to vote.   We are going to start voting in about 50 days from now. That is the  main election date. In Texas, we will start voting a full 2 weeks  before that date, where, without any reason whatsoever, you can show up  and vote in person, 2 full weeks before the general election. Yet  Attorney General Garland spins the false narrative that somehow the  State of Texas is suppressing people's right to vote.   And then Attorney General Garland I think shocked everybody by  authorizing an unprecedented search warrant on a former President and a  current political rival when less intrusive means and methods would  have produced the same documents that they claimed to be after.   Time and time again, the Department of Justice under Merrick Garland  has taken aggressive actions that are viewed by the Biden  administration as politically advantageous. For everybody else, though,  it is a different story, that double standard. When Supreme Court  Justices are receiving death threats, including the interdiction of a  deranged man who was out to kill Justice Kavanaugh here in the Nation's  Capital, the Attorney General did not respond by taking appropriate  steps to prevent that violence. In fact, he fanned the flames. Instead  of protecting the Justices, he chose to criticize them and encouraged  what amounts to irresponsible conduct on the part of people on the  left.   And now I am concerned about the Department's double standard in the  handling of the Hunter Biden investigation. The public reports are that  the President's son has been under investigation by the U.S. Attorney's  Office for the District of Delaware for a long time now. There is a  lot, of course, we don't know, but reported leaks and evidence seem to  show that Hunter Biden may have committed various felonies, including  tax fraud, money laundering, and foreign lobbying violations. Despite  the severity of these concerns, recent news reports have painted an  alarming picture of the Department of Justice's handling of this  investigation: silencing whistleblowers, downplaying or discrediting  inculpatory information, prohibiting the Department of Justice and FBI  employees from communicating with Members of Congress. This does not  look, sound, or smell like an impartial investigation guided only by  the facts and the rule of law.   Just across the street from here sits the Supreme Court of the United  States. On the front of that Court is the inscription ``Equal Justice  Under Law.'' There is no footnote. There is no asterisk. There is no  exception for relatives of the President of the United States. Every  American is entitled to fair and equal treatment and equal justice  under the laws. The Attorney General must guarantee that Hunter Biden  receives the same treatment as any other American who is under criminal  investigation--not better, not worse, but the same.   Today, 32 of my colleagues and I have sent a letter to Attorney  General Garland urging him to provide special counsel authorities and  protections to U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who is leading the  investigation into Hunter Biden. This is a critical step that the  Attorney General can and should take to restore faith in this  investigation and avoid even the appearance of impropriety. So I hope  he will honor our request, do what he pledged to do when he was  confirmed, and keep politics out of this investigation and, in the  process, restore public confidence in our Nation's most revered  institutions.
