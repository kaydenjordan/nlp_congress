 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of our  friend and colleague, Congressman John Lewis.   With every march, every sit-in, every time we reject unjust rules and  institutions designed to oppress any group, we honor the legacy of John  Robert Lewis.   A record number of Americans have stood up, spoken up, and laced up  their marching shoes in recent weeks. Millions of them are too young to  know about the man in whose footsteps they are following as they make  what he so rightly called good trouble.                                time  2100    May we all model his grace, courage, kindness, and commitment to  nonviolence as a way of life and continue the good trouble he started  even when--especially when--it is unpopular.   I feel so much gratitude to have learned from this giant of history,  this singular American genius, and to have served, however briefly,  alongside him. His loss is devastating. His memory everlasting.   Rest in power, my beloved brother.
