 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of one of my constituents,  Donald Gillen, who is in Washington, D.C., today to receive the  Congressional Gold Medal for his service to our Nation during World War  II.   Donald joined the Army on July 26, 1945. He was stationed at Camp  O'Donnell in the Philippines from November 1946 through June 1947. As  part of the 12th Philippine Scout Division, he became a company  commander in the 57th Infantry Regiment.   Donald moved to Belleville, Illinois, with his college sweetheart,  Marilyn, to be close to his family, including four grandchildren. Now  he is a guest staffer for the Belleville News-Democrat and supports his  wife's singing in their church choir.   I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming Donald to our Nation's  Capitol and thanking him for his service. We are forever grateful.                            ____________________
