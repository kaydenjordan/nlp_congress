 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to rise in strong support of  this rule and the underlying legislation, which is the product of a lot  of effort on the part of a lot of people on a very bipartisan basis.   I would first like to thank and congratulate our distinguished chair  and ranking members for their work on the 2017 Consolidated  Appropriations Act and for their leadership in bringing this  legislation forward today to address a number of timely issues facing  our Nation.   I certainly want to thank the gentleman, Mr. Cole, to my immediate  left for his strong work on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education and Related Agencies bill, which I will mention at  some point here as well, but his leadership has been extraordinary on  this issue.   I would like to draw special attention to some of this legislation's  provisions that will further support our veterans and enhance our  military's readiness.   Division L of the underlying bill provides supplemental funding to  augment the appropriations that were provided to MILCON and the VA  accounts, military construction and the VA accounts, last September.   Specifically, this bill will allow us to further address the opioid  epidemic that has escalated within so many communities across the  country and affected individuals and families from a broad range of  backgrounds and professions.   The 2017 bill will provide $50 million in additional current-year  funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve opioid and  substance abuse prevention and treatment for veterans. Those funds will  allow the VA to achieve full implementation of their responsibilities  under title IX of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016.   I just raised this issue less than an hour ago with VA Secretary  David Shulkin in this morning's hearing. He stressed the importance of  these funds to stay ahead of this challenge and provide comprehensive  treatments to our veterans. It is my hope that the lessons learned from  this public health crisis will be remembered so that we can prevent  similar episodes from occurring in the future.   In addition, the FY17 Consolidated Appropriations Act will support  readiness and infrastructure improvements and facilitate future force  structure growth by providing all our military services with the full  amount requested for military construction efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with so many of my colleagues from both sides of  the aisle that we need to make investments in our military readiness. I  would like to stress that the investments in the infrastructure and  military construction programs that support our troops at home and  abroad are critical aspects of our overall readiness posture. This bill  will move us in the right direction by addressing needs for both our  Active-Duty and our National Guard and Reserve forces.                                time  1330    I would also like to talk about some other aspects of this  legislation, too, in the underlying bill. Many pressing needs are  addressed here.  [[Page H3086]]    Specifically, we are talking about a very significant pay increase, a  2.1 percent pay increase for our troops. It is the largest pay increase  in 6 years.   This legislation makes a substantial downpayment on our efforts, and  the Trump administration's efforts, to enhance and increase military  spending to address the various threats that we are seeing throughout  the world.   I just returned from South Korea and Okinawa, Japan, and we have many  challenges in Northeast Asia, that I won't go into here today. But we  all know that we have some real obligations, particularly for our  United States Navy.   I also wanted to mention, too, my good friend, Chairman Cole. He led  the effort, along with Senator Roy Blunt, to increase funding for  medical research, critical lifesaving medical research to the National  Institutes of Health by $2 billion in this legislation, taking the  funding level from $32 billion to $34 billion. And that is on top of  what we heard in fiscal year 2016, which took us up $2 billion, as  well, from $30 billion to $32 billion.   So the commitment of this side of the aisle to medical research, I  think, is strong, and we are backing it up with our dollars. We had to  set some priorities, and Chairman Cole did that in the labor health  bill. He set those priorities, and we said: This is one of them. I am  proud that we as Republicans are stepping up on medical research. I am  also pleased, too, that many of our Democratic friends are supporting  this in this effort as well.    Mr. Speaker, I would also like to point out that this  legislation, in addition to this robust increase for medical research,  the chairman also provided substantial support for early childhood, a  priority to him and to many of us.   And there are other areas, too. Pell grants made some great changes,  too--year-round Pell grants for so many students who are struggling  with college affordability.   I also want to point out, too, on border security, a downpayment has  been made here as well. This legislation provides $1.5 billion  additionally for border security. This will help us move closer to  establishing greater operational control of our border, which is  something I think we all agree needs to be done.   These are just a few of the provisions of this legislation beyond  what I am responsible for--military construction and VA--that are  worthy.   I would urge support of this bill. I would also like to point out  that we did pass the Military Construction and VA Appropriations bill  back in September on time. It is the first appropriations bill passed  on time since 2009. I want to take a little credit for that.   But these other 11 bills that have been discussed here today need our  support. We need to keep this government running. We have done it in a  very thoughtful, bipartisan, measured way, and we have been very  responsible. This bill needs to get to the President's desk  immediately.   Again, I urge support for this legislation, and I support the rule as  well.
