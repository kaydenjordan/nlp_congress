 Mr. President, every week I have been coming down to  the Senate floor to honor an individual who is serving in my great  State of Alaska, who is helping to make our State, his or her local  community, or even our country a better place. We call these  individuals our Alaskan of the Week.   Alaska carries a mystique. We all know that. I am a little biased,  but it does, rightfully so. It is a beautiful State. We all think it is  the most beautiful State in the world. I encourage everybody who is  watching from the Gallery or on TV to make sure they take at least one  trip to Alaska sometime in their life. You will love it. It will be the  trip of a lifetime.   But Alaska is much more than just a beautiful State. It is actually a  State that is critically important to America--critically important to  our country. We have abundant natural resources: fish, metals,  minerals, and oil and gas. They are resources that help feed our  country, help build our country, and help power our country.   Further, given today's threats, we are also the most strategically  located State in the country. In fact, General Billy Mitchell, father  of the Air Force, said in testimony to the Congress in the 1930s that  Alaska was ``the most important strategic place in the world,'' which  could control Asia, North America, and Europe. He said that whoever  controls Alaska controls the world.   In Alaska, we are the hub of combat airpower for the Asia-Pacific and  the rest of the world. We are also a vital expeditionary platform, with  some of the Army's best trained troops, who can deploy anywhere in the  world on a moment's notice. Importantly, we are the cornerstone of our  country's missile defense system.   What makes this military triad truly exceptional is the Arctic-tough  women and men in uniform supporting each of these pillars of America's  military might in Alaska, who work day and night to ensure that our  country is safe.   Following Armed Forces Day a few days ago, where we honor all of  those who currently serve in the military--and we are all going to be  celebrating in a few days Memorial Day to honor those who gave their  lives serving our country--I recognize a group of proud Alaskans who  help protect our country. These individuals were recently awarded the  2017 Alaska Missile Defender of the Year award from the Missile Defense  Advocacy Alliance. Today, they are our Alaskans of the Week.   These are National Guard servicemembers from the Alaska Army and Air  National Guard who have demonstrated leadership, excellence, and  selfless commitment in their operation of the U.S. Ground-based  Midcourse Defense system, at Fort Greely, and the Early Warning Radar  system at Clear Air Force Station in Alaska, over the past year.  Essentially, these are the men and women who keep our country safe with  America's most sophisticated missile defense system. So I would like to  read their names on the Senate floor.   Base defenders of the year from the 213th Space Warning Squadron at  Clear Air Force Station: SSgt Jonathan Rivera-Calderon and SSgt  Stanislav Barilov.   Missile defenders of the year from the 213th Space Warning Squadron  at Clear Air Force Station: Capt. Erik Haugen and TSgt Mark Lockwood.   Base defenders of the year from Fort Greely: SGT Nathan Williams and  SGT Travis Hall.   Best crew winners from the 49th Missile Defense Battalion, Delta  Crew: MAJ Michael Long, CPT Anthony Montoya, 1LT Rachel Simmons, SSG  Caroline Domenech, and SGT Jose Aponte.   These Alaskan missile defenders continue to stand ready and excel as  they protect our country and our citizens from an increasingly diverse  set of national security threats. They are just a few of the 300 men  and women missile defenders in interior Alaska who, every day, protect  the entire United States. They like to call themselves the ``300  protecting the 300 million.'' I think of them as modern-day Spartans,  the 300 Spartans who fought alongside King Leonidas to protect Greece  in 480 BC. That is who they are, modern-day Spartans.   The mission of these men and women is to protect the entire country  from a rogue missile threat--whether from North Korea, Iran, or another  country--that could hit any city in America. This is what they do 365  days a year, 24/7. They are on call on Christmas, New Year's, and Super  Bowl Sunday. They are tough, well-trained, and they are committed  patriots of America.   We face a dizzying array of threats across the globe. But the one  that keeps not only me but many Members of the Senate and our military  up at night right now is the threat from North Korea. There is no doubt  that North Korea and the leader of that country are intent on obtaining  and nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile that can range  our entire country. Recent unclassified briefings on this issue have  said it is no longer a matter of if but when North Korea is going to  have this capability.   To protect us from this impending threat, this advancing threat, a  number of us introduced a bill this past week to enhance our missile  defense system across the country. While Alaska's missile defenders  currently keep us safe, like many in our military they need more  training and better technology so these brave men and women  [[Page S3195]]  can do their job and continue to keep America safe in the future.   Leading up to Memorial Day, I want to make sure to thank all who have  served and continue to serve our Nation in uniform. I especially honor  those who made the ultimate sacrifice, and, of course, their families.  I also want to make sure I recognize Alaska's missile defenders. While  millions of Americans will be outside this weekend, having a barbecue  and celebrating Memorial Day, every American in this country can rest  assured that these brave missile defenders in Alaska, men and women  like the Spartans of old, stand watch to defend our freedoms. They are  doing it today and they will do it on Memorial Day, just like they do  every day of the year.   That is why all of them, in my view, merit the award of Alaskans of  the Week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to recognize another Alaskan, one  who happens to be right here in the Senate Chamber, Senate Page Wade  Quigley. I think we should call him the Junior Alaskan of the Week.   Wade is from Girdwood, AK. He is actually right here, getting a  little red in the face. I think he is slightly embarrassed. Girdwood  was originally called Glacier City, for the ice-capped mountains  surrounding the town. About a 45-minute drive from Anchorage, it is a  very, very special place. My wife Julie and I and our three daughters  love Girdwood. We spend a lot of time there skiing and enjoying the  outdoors.   Wade is now 16 years old. When I was told that this morning, I was a  little surprised. He is much more mature than 16. He will be entering  his senior year at South Anchorage High School, the school that my  daughter Laurel attends, next fall.   Like a true Alaskan, Wade takes full advantage of our State's  abundant natural resources, teaching skiing in the winter and  commercial fishing for pink salmon during the summers in Kodiak, AK.   In DC, Wade has been doing a great job serving in the U.S. Senate as  a page. According to those who supervise him, as well as his fellow  pages, Wade is eager to take any opportunity to talk or learn about his  State. The esteemed Laura Dove herself has referred to Wade as  ``Alaska's best ambassador.'' I thought that is what Senator Murkowski  and I were supposed to be. It is a grand compliment. Others say he has  a heart for public service, humor, and kindness. He is extremely well- liked throughout this building.   In just 2 weeks, Wade and all the pages will complete their service  as Senate pages. By the way, it is very, very hard work. They are up at  5 o'clock a.m., studying at 6 o'clock a.m., classes until 9 o'clock,  and then working in the Senate until the wee hours. I thank Wade and  all the Senate pages for their service to the Senate, to their States,  to their country.   Wade's energy and upbeat outlook will be missed in this body. Even  though he is leaving us in the Senate, Wade hopes to continue his  service to his country by attending the U.S. Air Force Academy.   Whatever his final path is, I am sure he will bring to it the same  work ethic and the same love for his country and for Alaska and, I  believe now, after 6 months, for the U.S. Senate.   Wade, to you and all the pages who have done such a great job, thank  you, and, yes, thank you for being the Junior Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, as we approach Memorial Day, we remember  the men and women who sacrificed their lives in devotion to the causes  of liberty, freedom, and democracy. As such, I would like to take the  opportunity to speak about one event in our Nation's history that had a  profound impact on my great State of Alaska. June 3 marks the 75th  anniversary of the Aleutian Islands Campaign of the Second World War.   This ``Forgotten Battle'' began with the bombing of Dutch Harbor and  subsequent invasions of Adak, Kiska, and Attu, AK by the navy of  Imperial Japan. For the Allied forces, this campaign resulted in 1,481  casualties, 640 missing, and 3,416 wounded, but perhaps what is even  less known, is the impact this conflict had on the Aleut--Unangan/ Unangas--peoples of Alaska.   In the months of June and July of 1942, Aleut communities were  damaged, homes and personal possessions rummaged through or destroyed  by Allied forces, and more than 881 Aleut civilian residents of the  Pribilof Islands and the Aleutian Islands west of Unimak Island were  relocated to temporary camps in Southeast Alaska. Forty-two residents  of Attu were taken to Japan in September 1943, where they spent the  rest of the war as prisoners, and nearly half of them died, mainly of  hunger and malnutrition.   The campaign ultimately ended in an Allied victory with the Japanese  withdrawal from the Aleutians in 1943, but the effects are still felt  by those communities and peoples who were impacted.   Today, before the Senate, I would like to take a moment to honor the  sacrifices of our servicemembers, including the 25 Aleut who joined the  Armed Forces and the three who participated in the U.S. invasion to  recapture Attu and later received Bronze Stars for their valor. I want  to also honor the civilians, the Aleut evacuees, and Attuan prisoners  of war whose communities, culture, languages, and lives were forever  affected.   From June 2 to 4, 2017, a memorial ceremony will take place in Alaska  to honor and acknowledge the evacuees, their descendants, and veterans  of this ``Forgotten Battle,'' both living and deceased.                            ____________________
