 Mr. President, I first rise today to thank my  colleague for his comments. I am very pleased that this process may now  move forward--the one that was stymied because of a bill that, as my  friend from Colorado just pointed out, would kick millions of people  off of healthcare, jack up their premiums, and really was an effort to  pass the buck to the States without the bucks. I think that is one of  the reasons we saw our Republican Governors in Nevada and in Ohio  opposing this effort. I thank him for his leadership on the relevant  committees and his passion for this issue.   I would agree with him that people in my State, the State of  Minnesota, just like the State of Colorado--we have a lot of  independent sorts in both our States, and they want to see us get  things done. We now have the opportunity to do that.    Is there a question?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.    Thank you.   As we wait for those bipartisan negotiations--and we hope we will get  something soon, because I have seen reinsurance be a positive force in  my State for bringing some of the rates down in the exchange. The  average for the preliminary rates was 20 percent when our Republican  legislature joined with our Democratic Governor to get this passed--20  percent reduction. We would like to see that rolled out on a national  basis.   (The remarks of Ms. Klobuchar pertaining to the submission of S. Res.  268 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.                              Climate Disruption     Mr. President, I rise to discuss my resolution, S.  Res. 268, calling on the Senate to formally recognize September 26 as  National Voter Registration Day.   National Voter Registration Day is a celebration of our democracy and  our Nation's most fundamental right--the right to vote.   Today, thousands of volunteers and organizations in all 50 States are  hitting the streets to register voters. Their goal is to create  awareness about the registration process and register people who may  not register on their own or don't have the time or don't know how to  do it. It is really to reach out to people way ahead of an election.  Last year, their hard work paid off, and more than 750,000 Americans  registered to vote on National Voter Registration Day.   These volunteers understand that voting is a fundamental right, but  not everyone agrees. There are still people who seem to see it as a  privilege that not all eligible voters should enjoy. That is not the  way we should see this.   The right to vote is clearly under attack in the United States. We  have seen discriminatory voting laws spring up across the country, and  those who want to prevent people from voting are making it harder and  harder for people to get to the polls.   I do not see this as a partisan issue. My State last year had the  highest voting rate in the country. And we have seen a number of States  that do things like have same-day registration, mail-in ballots, things  like that, and they tend to have higher voting rates. They are not just  Democratic States or Republican States; they are Independent States.  And when you look at the list, it doesn't necessarily mean that a  certain party is going to win. We had Independent Governor Jesse  Ventura win in our State; Governor Tim Pawlenty. But what our States  share is a higher voter turnout. What does that mean? Well, it means  that people have some trust in their government when they participate.  Even when their candidate doesn't win and the other candidate wins, at  least they know they had a say and that it mattered and that they went  to the voting booth.   That is what I am talking about today because in some States, we have  seen discriminatory voting laws spring up, and they have literally made  it harder for people to vote. We have heard reports of problems with  equipment. We had 3-hour lines in Arizona. We had 100 miles to the  nearest polling station in Nevada and Utah, photo ID requirements in  Wisconsin, where we now know it can really be hard to get an ID in the  first place. In North Carolina, a Federal court found that the State's  laws to prevent voter access--and this is a more conservative court,  the Fifth Circuit--they said the voter laws had been crafted with  ``surgical precision'' to discriminate against minorities.   Now we have an administration that is abandoning efforts to uphold  voting rights. In many States, this is a truly bipartisan effort. The  Commission on ``Election Integrity'' looks to be making it harder,  rather than easier, to vote. States are reporting that some Americans  are actually unregistering to vote because of the Commission's request  for personal data from across the country. We have had Democratic and  Republican secretaries of state band together to say this is something  they don't want to do.   Taken together, these efforts to suppress the vote represent a  concerted strategy to ensure that fewer people make it to the polls.  This is not about one party or the other party; this is about our  democracy. Our very freedoms are built upon the freedom to vote.   So what else do we see? Well, we see attacks from without on our  election. I remember the Presiding Officer had an excellent quote on  this matter when he said: One election, it will be one candidate in one  party; and the next election, it could be the other candidate from the  other party. That is why, when we look at interference from foreign  governments, we must also protect the sacred right to vote, and that  means everything from the amendment I have with Senator Lindsey Graham,  which is now a bill, to make sure our cyber security is strengthened as  we head into the 2018 election and make sure that our States have the  ability to protect their own voting equipment. The reports now--I just  found out that in my own State, an attempt had been made to hack it. In  21 States, we have seen attempts at hacking.   All our bill does is say: Let's help the States to shore up their  equipment, to make sure they have backup paper ballots and other  commonsense measures.   This bill in the House--the amendment to the National Defense  Authorization Act--was carried by Mark Meadows, the head of the Freedom  Caucus. That is right. It is a bipartisan amendment across both the  House and the Senate to protect our State election equipment. Our  country is stronger when everyone participates, and that is why we must  protect the election equipment.   We must make it easier to vote. I have one idea: Why don't we just  automatically register eligible voters when they turn 18, maybe when  they get their driver's license or Social Security number. Our States  have that data. They also have a way to crosscheck with criminal  records and other things to make sure these are eligible voters.  Wouldn't that be easier than going out and trying to get everyone to  vote? It doesn't mean you have to vote, but you automatically get  registered to vote, just like you get your Social Security number.   There is momentum for this idea at the State level. Last month,  Illinois  [[Page S6139]]  became the 10th State to pass automatic voter registration. Experts  project that it will result in 1 million people being added to the  registration list. Estimates show that as many as 50 million eligible  voters would be registered if we moved to automatic registration.   Another thing we can do to increase turnout is to allow same-day  voting. In February, I introduced the Same Day Voter Registration Act,  a bill that will allow people to register to vote on election day. This  reduces the burden of voting and ensures that anyone who forgets to  register can go up there to prove who they are and they can get  registered. Fifteen States have this--not just blue States, but red  States and blue States. And they always tend to be up at the top in the  number of people who vote.   We need to restore Americans' confidence in our election process and  our democracy, and we do that by welcoming people to vote.   A few years ago, I was fortunate enough to go with Congressman Lewis  on his yearly pilgrimage--his trip where he takes people to the site of  the march to Montgomery. The weekend I got to go was actually the  moment 48 years to the weekend later. The White police chief of  Montgomery handed his badge to Congressman Lewis and gave him that  badge and apologized. He apologized because their police department at  that time, 48 years before, had not protected the African-American  marchers and those other citizens who were there marching with them.   It took 48 years, but it happened. It was an emotional trip, and it  made you think about those marchers and everything they had done just  to get the right to vote. You see it in other countries where people  will wait in line for a day just to be able to have their say in their  own government. That is really what this is about. It is about a  freedom--the freedoms that are guaranteed in our Constitution. One of  those is that we can all participate. As long as we make the rules, as  long as we are eligible, we can all participate.   Today on National Voter Registration Day, I hope that people will  join me in celebrating the work of those who are out there encouraging  people to vote and, of course, get out there and register yourself so  your own voice can be heard.                            ____________________
