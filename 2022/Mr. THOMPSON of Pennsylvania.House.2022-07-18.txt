 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the Ruth M. Smith Center in Sheffield, Pennsylvania, for 100  years of service to their community.   The Ruth M. Smith Center has been supporting the community of  Sheffield since 1922 when the Smith family gave their home to the  Women's Society of Christian Service. Since then, the home has served  as an orphanage, a daycare preschool, and as a personal care home for  adults with intellectual and physical impairments as well as older  adults.   The center is a staple of the Sheffield community as it continues to  provide support and assistance to those who need care beyond the basic  necessities of food and shelter.   As a nonprofit association, the Ruth M. Smith Center is able to  support those who cannot afford the costs of care through donations by  individuals, churches, and State grants.   Madam Speaker, the Ruth M. Smith Center is a testament to the power  of community groups to uplift those most in need of support. It is a  privilege to congratulate them on their continued service to Sheffield,  Pennsylvania.                            ____________________
