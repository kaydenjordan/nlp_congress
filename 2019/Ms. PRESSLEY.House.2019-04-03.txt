 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Violence  Against Women Act, VAWA.   I rise today to bring our stories out of the shadows. Let us reject  the myth that strong women, bold women, independent women do not find  themselves in the throes of violence at the hands of someone who claims  to love them.   My mother, my shero, found herself in such an abusive relationship,  one that threatened her physical safety and her sanity, and chipped  away at her dignity and her joy.   As a child, to witness the abuse and degradation of the person who is  your world, your everything, it is an image, a feeling, that never  leaves.   To the millions of women who find themselves in the shoes of my  mother and to the countless daughters who find themselves looking on: I  see you. I am fighting for you and all the Sandys out there.   My mom, Sandy, depending on the day, was beaten for being too pretty,  too ugly, too smart, too dumb. This man beat my mother's limbs and  tried to beat down her spirit. His abuse was the deepest of betrayals.   For the stories that we share here today, if they make people  uncomfortable, good. Let that discomfort lead to transformation,  transformation in our discourse, transformation in our lawmaking, and a  renewed commitment to our shared humanity.   No more.   Mommy, this one is for you.                            ____________________
