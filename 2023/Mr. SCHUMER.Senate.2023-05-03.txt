 Mr. President, I hope you had a good birthday yesterday.    Mr. President, decades ago, President Reagan warned that  debt ceiling brinksmanship ``threatens the holders of government bonds  and those who rely on social security and veterans benefit . . . [and]  the United States,'' he said, ``has a special responsibility to itself  and to the world to meet its obligations.   If President Reagan were around today, he might well be exiled by a  modern Republican Party that in many ways seems dead set--dead set--on  abandoning that special responsibility never to default.   We have less than a month to go until we hit June 1. Every day wasted  is another day closer to catastrophe. At stake is the well-being of  families, retirees, veterans, kids, and the very stability of our  economy.   But by ramming the ``Default on America Act'' through the House-- totally partisan, knowing full well this bill can never become law-- Speaker McCarthy and the hard right have made the odds of default go  up. By handing his gavel over to the hard right, the Speaker is giving  the American people two terrible options: either default  on the debt  or default  [[Page S1472]]  on the country, with steep cuts to law enforcement, first responders,  veterans, seniors, and even cancer research. Just think how radical  such an ultimatum truly is. It is a dramatic break from how both  parties have approached default in the past.   On one hand, a Republican default would crash the economy, increase  costs, and kill American jobs. Unemployment would rise to at least 8  percent. Mortgage and car payments would all go up by a lot, while the  value of pensions and 401(k)s would come crashing down. That is the  future that Speaker McCarthy and the House Freedom Caucus have made  more likely by passing the ``Default on America Act.''   But the alternative is also a nightmare scenario. If the Republicans'  ``Default on America Act'' became law, 1 million seniors--1 million  seniors--would lose access to Meals on Wheels. These are seniors who  literally can't get food on their own much of the time and rely on  others bringing it to them. They would be on the chopping block if the  GOP has its way. Deprive seniors who can't leave their homes of food-- what is that all about?--so that some very wealthy, wealthy  multibillionaires don't have to pay any taxes? It is outrageous.   Here is another one. The Republican ``Default on America Act'' would  eliminate 30,000 law enforcement jobs across the country. Do you know  what that means? Gun violence will get even worse. Our neighborhoods  will become less safe. Border security would be deprived of billions in  crucial resources. The war on opioids would decline, and more  addictions, crimes, and others from opioid use would go up. What is  that all about?   Once again, the hard right--totally enthralled by the very wealthy,  wealthy few who are so greedy, they don't want to pay any taxes--say  cut things like this. Cut law enforcement. Cut Meals on Wheels.   The ``Default on America Act'' would shamefully attack our Nation's  veterans, purging 80,000 VA jobs, leaving our Nation's heroes without  the care they have earned throughout a lifetime of service.   These are just three of many. Eliminate Meals on Wheels; greatly hurt  our efforts at law enforcement and safety by dramatically cutting,  defunding police; greatly--greatly--tying the hands of the VA so that  veterans would get worse healthcare and they would have to wait even  longer--this is what the Republicans' ``Default on America'' bill does.  That is why it is dead on arrival--not for some political ideological  reason, but it would do such harm.   When you wonder about the motivation of the Republicans, it  ultimately is this, these rightwing Republicans. Listen to the greedy  few, the powerful greedy few who don't want to pay any taxes and want  to have taxes reduced. Some of them even called for even eliminating  the income tax.   Finally, the ``Default on America Act'' is chock-full of totally  irrelevant, hard-right goodies that would deregulate fossil fuel,  reward corporate greed, shower the ultrarich with tax giveaways, and  impose cruel and unpopular work requirements on vulnerable families.   Whether it is kicking seniors to the curb, cutting law enforcement  jobs, or abandoning our veterans, everything about the ``Default on  America Act'' wreaks of MAGA extremism. So it is no wonder the  Republicans did it in secret. It is no wonder that they didn't want to  do what they promised to do: have hearings, have witnesses, have  bipartisan discussions and amendments.   But if Republicans won't level with the American people about their  terrible bill, Senate Democrats are going to do it for them. Tomorrow,  the Senate Budget Committee will hold a hearing on how the ``Default on  America Act'' would weaken the economy and slash hundreds of thousands  of jobs. I want to thank Chairman Whitehouse and all the members of the  committee for doing the important work of bringing this bill to the  public eye because the American people deserve better.   Incredibly--incredibly--tomorrow's hearing will be the very first  hearing in either House that actually looks at what the ``Default on  America Act'' does. Amazing. This huge bill that affects almost every  aspect of American life--they haven't had one hearing on the issues  they are doing. But we are going to start doing it, and that hearing  will be the first, but there will be many others.   As Democrats shine a light on how unserious and extreme the  Republican ``Default on American Act'' is, our view about the path  forward remains the same: can't choose the ``Default on America Act'';  must avoid the horrors of default; pass a clean bipartisan bill to  avert default.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  and the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein) are necessarily  absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business,  [[Page S1501]]  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, May 4; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that following the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Hunt nomination postcloture and that all time be  considered expired at 11:30 a.m.; further, that following the cloture  vote on the Shogan nomination, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate  resume consideration of the Gupta nomination, with the time until 1:45  p.m. equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, and at  1:45 p.m. the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the  nomination; further, that if any nominations are confirmed, the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    For the information of the Senate, there will be two  rollcall votes at 11:30 a.m. and one at 1:45 p.m.                            ____________________     Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order, following the very, very learned remarks of Senator Sullivan.    Would the gentleman yield?    I just want to reserve the right to read the remarks  before closing debate.    I thank the Senator.   I yield the floor and am looking forward to the Senator's remarks.
