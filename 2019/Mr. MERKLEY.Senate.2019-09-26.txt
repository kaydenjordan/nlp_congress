 Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart today that I  honor the incredible life of Mary Gautreaux, an Oregonian who never  stopped fighting to make our State and our world a better place for  all. Throughout her decades-long career working with my colleague  Senator Wyden as a fellow, a field representative, and as deputy State  director, she was deeply committed to not only preserving Oregon's  natural treasures but making sure Oregonians in every comer of our  State had the opportunity to experience them.   Her love for helping others was only paralleled by her passion for  Oregon's incredible public lands, which was a cornerstone of her life  even long before she joined Senator Wyden's team. Previously, she  fought wildfires and maintained our forests--strenuous, courageous work  that is critical to keeping our communities safe. When she transitioned  to Senator Wyden's office, her hard work continued and culminated in  countless accomplishments that will shape the lives of Oregonians for  generations to come.   On behalf of all Oregonians, I thank her for her generous spirit and  her unwavering dedication to serving the people of Oregon. Her  contributions will be felt for generations to come, and she will be  dearly missed and never forgotten.                            ____________________
