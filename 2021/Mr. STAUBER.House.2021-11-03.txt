 Madam Speaker, this time last year, America was energy  independent. Now our Nation is facing a full-blown energy crisis,  leaving the American people to ask, ``What changed?''   Well, the answer is simple.   Unlike the Trump administration, the Biden administration is  determined to make it more difficult for American energy producers to  develop affordable and reliable energy here at home.   On his first day in office, Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline.  Soon after, he banned all new oil and gas leases on Federal lands. As a  result, Americans are paying exponentially more at the pump with gas  prices reaching a 7-year high. And this winter, the cost to heat our  homes is expected to jump 54 percent.   As the top Republican on the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral  Resources, I have been disappointed to see Joe Biden and Democrats in  Congress double down on their failed agenda by pushing a $5.5 trillion  tax-and-spend package that will only increase our energy prices.   Instead of canceling commonsense energy projects, let's empower  American energy workers to do what they do best. Instead of targeting  American energy companies, let's make it easier for them to increase  domestic oil and gas production.   If we do this, the next century can be an American century.                            ____________________
