 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the  body to talk about Social Security.   I am pleased to be joined by so many of my colleagues from across the  country who understand what Martin Luther King called the fierce  urgency of now, and why the United States Congress has to act.   It has been more than 51 years since the United States Congress has  enhanced the benefits of Social Security. Richard Nixon was President,  and a gallon of milk cost 72 cents.   Much has changed in 51 years, and now, I am proud to announce today  that the Ways and Means Committee will be marking up Social Security  2100: A Sacred Trust, next Wednesday and, in doing so, for the first  time in 51 years Congress will be moving forward to enhance benefits  for those who need it the most.   Why do I say that?   Everybody in America knows that this pandemic, this global pandemic  that we are in, has caused unbelievable harm across the globe and here  in this country.   But who has it affected the most?   Of the close to 1 million people who have perished in the United  States, over 756,000 of them are over the age of 65.   And who is the group that has been hurt the most by the ensuing  inflation that comes from a global pandemic and a war in Ukraine?   It is people on a fixed income. It is the more than 65 million  Americans that are on Social Security.   I commend President Biden for taking the leadership in this area; who  campaigned across the country, assuring Americans that Social Security  was a sacred trust; which, indeed, it is because it has never missed a  payment.   We used to have to go back to 1935 and talk about the Great  Depression. We only have to go back as far as 2008 and 2009 because  people understand during the Great Recession, when they saw their  401(k) become a 101(k), that Social Security never missed a payment,  not a pension payment, not a spousal payment, not a dependent payment,  not a disability payment.   It is America's number one insurance program. And all Americans know  this, and it is easily verified, weekly or monthly, when they look at  their paycheck and it says FICA, Federal Insurance Contribution.   Whose?   Theirs. It is an earned benefit that they have paid into throughout  their lives.   And yet, Congress has not acted in 51 years, until now. Under the  leadership of President Biden, Speaker Pelosi, and Chairman Richard  Neal, we are moving forward with legislation that will provide much- needed relief to people struggling in this pandemic and dealing with  inflation.   I am pleased that I am joined today by so many of my colleagues who  have told their stories over and over again about the citizens that  they are interacting with, and what an enormous burden this pandemic  and inflation has caused for them, and now, finally, for Congress to  act.   And how so?   Improving benefits across the board by more than 2 percent for  everyone; making sure that nobody who worked all their lives and paid  into a system can retire into poverty; making sure that we have a COLA  that actually reflects the cost that people incur; making sure that we  repeal WEP and GPO, so that teachers and firefighters--something that  Mr. Pascrell has championed his whole time here in Congress--understand  that relief is on its way because Democrats care deeply about this.    We are faced, as well, with an alternative from the other side. And  here is the simple difference. Republicans have proposed to end Social  Security. Republicans have proposed to cut Social Security across the  board by more than 21 percent in 20 different separate proposals in  their Republican Study Plan.   They have also called, in committee, in the eight hearings that we  have had on Social Security, to still privatize Social Security.   Democrats stand, not just to protect Social Security, but to expand  Social Security for those that need it the most. And those assembled  here today understand how vitally important it is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the  ``deaness'' of the House of Representatives, and someone who  understands intuitively, women need this benefit the most. And in this  country more than 3 million Americans receive below poverty-level  checks from Social Security, and the vast majority of them are women.    I thank Ms. Kaptur and greatly appreciate  the gentlewoman from Ohio's comments.   I yield to the gentleman Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), who also  understands and has worked tirelessly as an original cosponsor of this  bill to make sure that several of the benefits, more than 14  enhancements to this bill, are now going to be enjoyed by the people of  Pennsylvania and all across this Nation.    I thank the gentleman, but it actually is  authored by 206 Members of the United States Congress, and I appreciate  all the work that has been done.   The gentleman was correct. This is the number one antipoverty program  for the elderly. It is also the number one antipoverty program for  children. It is also the program that more veterans use for disability  than any, even the VA. It is the most efficient and effective  government program in terms of cost.   They operate in insurance language at what is called a 99 percent  loss ratio which means this: It costs less than 1 percent  administrative costs to distribute the greatest insurance program. The  greatest antipoverty program for the elderly, for children, and for  veterans is all done by Social Security. That is why we need to expand  it.   On the Committee on Ways and Means, Chairman Neal had a Racial Equity  Committee that our colleagues all participated in, and one of the  shining stars of that was none other than Stacey Plaskett from the  Virgin Islands, who understands that if we want to focus on what John  Lewis called the next great challenge for civil rights, it was to  recognize how Social Security has treated women and specifically women  of color and Black males.   I recognize Stacey Plaskett from the Virgin Islands.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  her comments, and especially as it relates to staff, also for her  comments about this is the cornerstone, a key ground-laying cornerstone  of the human infrastructure.  [[Page H6906]]    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time we have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), the distinguished vice chair of the  Subcommittee on Social Security, the leader in Congress on making sure  that firefighters and police officers and teachers are taken care of  across the board, but specifically as it relates to Social Security and  WEP and GPO, to be followed by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois  Frankel).    I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  his unwavering support and dedication not only to the firefighters,  police, and teachers across this country who will benefit from this  legislation, but all Americans, and especially those in Paterson, New  Jersey, who he has dedicated his life to serving.   Mr. Speaker, I yield now to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois  Frankel), a woman who understands the significance of Social Security,  hailing from the State of Florida, which is probably the senior center  capital of the world in terms of the population there of senior  citizens.   Before yielding to the gentlewoman, I recognize the number of  committees that have come out in support of this legislation, including  the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Social  Security Works, the NAACP, the National Organization of Women, the  Latinos for a Secure Retirement, the National Education Association,  the AFT, and more than 350 organizations have come and endorsed the  work of Lois Frankel, who understands what seniors need not only in  Florida but across this Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Florida for her comments.   Every now and again, we find leaders in the country who may come from  the House but all of a sudden take on national prominence. Why is that?  Because they speak straightforwardly to the people, in the case of Tim  Ryan, in Ohio, but they are really speaking to the entire Nation.   What are they talking about? The more than 10,000 baby boomers a day  who become eligible for Social Security and the individuals who have  worked all of their lives and paid into a program and receive below- poverty-level checks from their government, and also a pay-for in this  program that has the wealthiest people paying their fair share simply  by lifting the cap on people making over $400,000. That is four-tenths  of 1 percent of the American public. Even with that, they will be  paying proportionately less than a person earning $35,000 to $50,000 a  year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), the next  Senator from the State of Ohio, the person who speaks to that working  class, and it resonates not only in Ohio but across this great Nation  of ours.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Ohio for his remarks. I am so proud he is going to be going to the  United States Senate because, in the United States Senate, Mr. Scott  from Florida has proposed ending Social Security in 5 years. Ohio needs  to make sure that it is sending someone to the United States Senate who  is not going to end Social Security in 5 years but is going to expand  Social Security now, when we need it, when we are in the worst pandemic  in the history of the country, when we are suffering through inflation.  The time to act is now.   As Martin Luther King would say, it is the fierce urgency of now. It  has been 51 years since Congress has done anything.   That is something that Ted Lieu of California understands and has  been working tirelessly, as an original cosponsor of this bill, to  reach out not only to the citizens of California but all across this  country to make sure that they are going to have the benefits that can  sustain them. Our goal is to expand benefits, not cut them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Lieu).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California for his comments.   I will point out that this is a bipartisan plan, probably more  correctly called nonpartisan. Why? Because Independents, Democrats, and  Republicans of all ages, of all backgrounds and ethnic groups, support  Social Security because it is, as President Biden indicated, a sacred  trust.   As Congressman Ryan pointed out, whether you are in a rural area or  an urban area, whether you are on the coast or in the Great Plains of  this country, you are impacted by Social Security. This is about your  mother and father. It is about your brothers and sisters.                                time  1530    It is what I call the great mirror test. If you can look your  constituents in the eye--and we have provided every Member of Congress  with a card that says: How many of your constituents receive Social  Security?   It is Congress' responsibility. This is not something that can happen  through executive order. This is not something that the Supreme Court  is going to rule on. This is only something that Congress can do.   We are blessed in the House that we have a great leader in Nancy  Pelosi. It was Nancy Pelosi, back in 2005 that led the charge that was  ``Horatius at the bridge,'' so to speak, to prevent the privatization  of Social Security, and we were successful.   Thank God we were, for had that plan succeeded, 2008 and 2009 would  have been far more disastrous. Yet, as we all know, Social Security, in  the midst of that recession, never missed a payment, not a spousal or a  dependent payment, not a disability payment, and not a pension payment.   And now it is Nancy Pelosi as well. Along with President Biden and  Democrats--and frankly, a number of Republicans--who know in their  hearts and know because when they give that mirror test and go home and  look at their family members, in the midst of this pandemic, in the  midst of this inflation, the most successful and the most efficiently  run governmental program that we have should be embraced by everyone to  give the access and relief that our seniors need, that our disabled  veterans need, that our children continue to need.   President Eisenhower and President Nixon, the last President under  whom we expanded Social Security benefits, that was in 1971, and a  gallon of milk cost 72 cents--what seniors have endured. And like most,  like my mother, would turn to their children and say: Don't worry about  me. I don't want to be a burden.   My mother--all mothers--were never a burden. They were an inspiration  to us all. And we all owe it to them to make sure that they live out  their lives in the simple dignity of knowing they can't retire into  poverty. That is the promise of Social Security. It hasn't kept pace.  How could it if it hasn't been expanded in 51 years.   Now its solvency is in question and this bill expands its solvency.  And, most importantly, it expands the benefits that are so vitally  needed--especially, as Mr. Pascrell pointed out--to teachers,  firefighters, police officers, and municipal employees, who, through no  fault of their own, have found themselves on the short end of Congress'  inaction. It is the fierce urgency of now.   When you go home and when you travel to a senior center, ask your  constituents--and face them eyeball to eyeball and say: How can I help  you?   They will respond: By fixing Social Security. By giving us a COLA  that actually reflects the costs that we incur, that don't tax us while  we still work because we have to make ends meet, to make sure that we  are expanding benefits across the board for everyone--because it is  everyone's program--and make sure that the wealthy pay their fair  share.   That is what President Biden has called for. That is why it is a  sacred trust. That is why we are proud to put this before us and say we  are here to expand Social Security, not end this. Please, I beg of my  colleagues on the other side, join us in expanding benefits that you  know need to be expanded on behalf of the citizens you represent.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
