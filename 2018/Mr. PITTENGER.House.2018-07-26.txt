 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his exemplary  leadership on behalf of our military and in defense of our country. We  are deeply grateful for him.   Mr. Speaker, I say today how pleased and grateful I am that our  Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act is being included in  the NDAA bill. To that end, I thank Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member  Waters, Heath Tarbert with the Treasury Department, Clark Fonda, my  chief, so many people,  Andy Barr, who contributed to this process to  make sure that we are in a position of strength.   For over 2 years, I have led these efforts to prevent Chinese and  other adversarial nation-states from acquiring our sophisticated  technology in our military. This bill, this Foreign Investment Risk  Review Modernization Act, was the result of countless meetings  throughout our assembly, as well as throughout this district, of  talking to multiple people in the industry, as well as our intelligence  community and defense, to make sure that we had done the job to allow  adequate oversight for these investments.   FIRRMA will broaden the jurisdiction of CFIUS in several key areas,  including minority noncontrolling investments and certain real estate  transactions close to national security sites. FIRRMA strengthens our  export control laws and creates an interagency review to cover overseas  joint ventures. Overall, this bill closes several key loopholes in the  CFIUS process.   Today, I do believe that the passage of the NDAA and FIRRMA  legislation will help improve national security and combat aggressive  Chinese efforts to secure our technology.   I thank all who participated in this process, and I commend this bill  to our Congress to pass.
