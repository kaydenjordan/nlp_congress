 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my colleagues that  we are in the midst of a maternal and infant health crisis.   The United States remains one of the most dangerous places to give  birth among high-income countries, and we are trending in the wrong  direction.   According to the recently released ``2023 March of Dimes Report Card:  The State of Maternal and Infant Health for American Families,'' the  United States maintained a D-plus grade for preterm birth for the  second year in a row.   We saw only a modest 0.1 percent improvement in the preterm birthrate  over the previous year, with the data showing persistent and  compounding gaps in health equity that put moms and babies at risk.   Virginia is not far behind with a C grade. The preterm birthrate for  2022 was 9.7 percent, just 0.2 percent lower than the year before.   We must take decisive, comprehensive action to address these dual  crises and improve public health outcomes for mothers and babies across  the Nation. That is why, earlier this month, I introduced a bipartisan  resolution with my colleagues to designate November as Prematurity  Awareness Month. Our resolution aims to raise awareness about the risks  and challenges associated with preterm babies and encourage communities  to promote preterm prevention programs.   As is too often the case, minority populations, particularly Black  women, experience disproportionately higher rates of preterm birth and  other associated health challenges. The preterm birthrate among babies  born to Black women is still 1\1/2\ times higher than the national  average.   I am a Black mother to two young children, and I know this reality  all too well. I was the first member of the Virginia House of Delegates  to be pregnant and give birth while in office, and I almost died giving  birth to my second child, Samantha.   Nine weeks prior to her due date, my placenta ruptured, and I was  rushed to the emergency room for an emergency cesarean section. The  last thing I remember is hearing my doctor say, ``I am here, and I will  take care of this.'' Samantha was born 9 weeks early and spent the  first 6 weeks of her life in the NICU at Henrico Doctors' Hospital. I  will never forget the fear and anxiety that I felt.   This experience inspired me to take matters into my own hands as a  State  [[Page H5941]]  legislator to do everything in my power to improve healthcare resources  for Virginians and tackle the maternal and infant health crisis.   Now, I am one of the few--less than 7 percent--mothers to young  children in Congress. I am one of the even fewer 3 percent of Members  of Congress who is a Black mother. I am proud to continue my efforts  here in Congress on a bipartisan basis.   We can improve health outcomes and close longstanding health  disparities by promoting awareness of this nationwide epidemic and  encouraging parents and communities to take an active role in  supporting preterm birth intervention programs.   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution, and I am  grateful for the bipartisan group of legislators who are supporting  this effort. Together, we can make real progress on these issues, but  only if we keep it a priority. We must because our children's lives  depend on it.                            ____________________
