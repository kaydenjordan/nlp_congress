 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor to discuss the State of  Nevada's fierce opposition to using Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste  dump.   While I appreciate having the opportunity to speak to you today, I am  extremely frustrated with the recent actions Congress has taken to  revive this project.   Mr. Chairman, Yucca Mountain lies in my congressional district. In  the 30 years since Congress passed the ``Screw Nevada'' bill, Congress  has wasted $3.7 billion of taxpayers' money on a project that Nevada  has repeatedly said will not happen.  [[Page H4938]]    And now, this Congress wants to continue to egregiously spend money  on this failed project in fiscal year 2019 appropriations.   So once again, I am here to fight to prevent nuclear waste from ever  coming to my home State of Nevada. That is why I have introduced an  amendment to H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water Development and Related  Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019.   My amendment, Mr. Chairman, would strike $190 million for the  licensing of the nuclear waste depository at Yucca Mountain.   I routinely hear from my Republican colleagues on the need to reduce  our deficit and debt. I fully agree with the sentiment. Congress should  not waste another $190 million of taxpayer money on a project that will  not come to fruition.   But you should support my amendment not just on the fiscal basis. Mr.  Chairman, my home State of Nevada, which has no nuclear energy- producing facilities, should not be the dumping ground for the rest of  the country's nuclear waste.   And this is not just an issue facing Nevadans. It is an issue that  impacts constituents from 329 congressional districts in 44 States and  Washington, D.C.   Putting a nuclear repository in Nevada's backyard means that this  high level nuclear waste must travel through your backyards first as  well.   Your constituents will see high level nuclear waste transported  through their communities on rail and by truck. A simple car crash or  train derailment will leave your constituents at risk and cost our  taxpayers more money to clean up the mess.   It is clear that reopening Yucca Mountain is fiscally unsound,  presents threats to people across the country, and is unwanted by the  people of Nevada. That is why I encourage you to support my amendment  to prevent nuclear waste from ever coming to Nevada.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms.  Rosen), my colleague.                                time  1815     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment to H.R. 5895, the  Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of  2019.   This amendment, Mr. Chairman, is very simple. It would strike  language that would prohibit the closure of Yucca Mountain.   This site sits in my congressional district, less than 100 miles away  from Las Vegas, a city that sees 42 million visitors each year, with  many of these visitors coming from your districts. Nevada depends on  these visitors. Nevada's economy depends on these visitors.   Putting a nuclear repository this close to millions of Americans is  simply irresponsible. And I have grave concerns with the transportation  of nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain should this project move forward  against the will of Nevadans.   Mr. Chairman, Nevada has no nuclear-energy-producing facilities, and  it should not be the dumping ground for the rest of the country's  nuclear waste. The bottom line is this: If your State generates nuclear  waste, then you should keep it in your backyard.   Or if any of my colleagues are okay with sending nuclear waste to my  State, then maybe they should consider keeping it in their own State. I  will be more than happy to work with them on an amendment.   So, again, Mr. Chairman, the people in Nevada do not want this  nuclear waste stored in their backyard. Yucca Mountain needs to close,  and that is why I encourage my colleagues to vote in support of this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Nevada (Ms. Titus), my colleague from the First Congressional  District.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
