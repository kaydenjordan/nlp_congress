Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1447, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of the Coastal and Ocean Acidification  Stressors and Threats, or COAST, Research Act, my bipartisan bill to  help coastal communities adapt to the climate crisis by expanding  scientific research, monitoring, and adaptation of ocean and coastal  acidification.   I want to thank all of the staff on both sides of the aisle, from the  committee and my personal staff, especially Maxine Sugarman, for all  their work on this bill.   Every person on this planet benefits from a healthy ocean. The ocean  covers more than 70 percent of the planet's surface. It supplies much  of the oxygen that we breathe and regulates our climate. It is linked  to the water we drink, and it is home to more than half of all life on  the planet. The power of its waves generates clean energy. The ocean  drives our economy, feeds, employs, and transports us. But despite our  intrinsic connection, for too long the ocean has taken the heat for us.   According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, atmospheric  carbon dioxide concentrations are now higher than at any time in the  last 3 million years. Approximately one-third of the carbon dioxide in  the atmosphere dissolves into our ocean and estuaries, causing them to  become more acidic.   Ocean and coastal acidification make it difficult for shellfish,  coral, and other marine organisms to build their shells and skeletal  structures. Some finfish, including endangered salmon in the Pacific  Northwest, lose their sense of smell necessary for identifying prey,  reproducing, and navigating their habitats. Our understanding of the  long-term consequences of ocean acidification is still limited, but we  do know that the changes in ocean chemistry are already affecting the  fishers and shellfish farmers who depend on the ocean's resources to  support themselves and their families and the Tribes that have treaty  rights and deep cultural and historical connections to diminishing  species.   The most effective strategy for mitigating ocean acidification is  reducing anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide pollution worldwide. I  have joined with colleagues on the Select Committee on the Climate  Crisis in releasing a bold, comprehensive, and science-based Climate  Action Plan to reach net-zero emissions no later than mid-century and  net-negative thereafter. But there are also actions that we can take  immediately to improve conditions, lessen exposure to ocean  acidification, and manage local pollution and conditions that can  exacerbate acidification.   This bill, which I introduced with my fellow co-chair of the House  Oceans Caucus, Representative Young from Alaska, and with  Representatives Pingree and Posey, would improve scientific research on  ocean and coastal acidification in the context of other environmental  stressors and direct Federal agencies to assess adaptation and  mitigation strategies. Funding has lagged behind the needs of the  scientific community for years, and this bill would provide a modest,  but important, increase for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration and the National Science Foundation to scale up research  efforts. Importantly, the bill also expands the definition of ocean  acidification to include estuaries and recognize mechanisms that cause  changes in coastal chemistry.   NOAA is already leading interdisciplinary efforts to expand our  understanding of changing ocean conditions in its role as chair of the  Interagency Working Group on Ocean Acidification. In fact, this year  marks the 10th anniversary of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program, and  I hope my colleagues will join me in applauding their work to truly  advance regionally coordinated scientific research.   A September 2015 Government Accountability Office report suggested  that an independent national ocean acidification program could advance  our understanding of changing ocean conditions. The COAST Research Act  designates NOAA as the lead Federal agency responsible for implementing  the Federal response to ocean and coastal acidification, further  empowering the Ocean Acidification Program to scale up its efforts with  its first reauthorization in more than a decade.   Additionally, the COAST Research Act increases our understanding of  the socioeconomic effects of ocean and coastal acidification and,  importantly, it engages stakeholders. The bill creates an advisory  board of representatives of the shellfish and crab industry, finfish  industry, seafood processors, recreational fishing, academia,  nongovernmental organizations, State, local, and Tribal governments,  and regional coastal acidification networks. The regionally balanced  board will advise NOAA and the Interagency Working Group on coastal and  ocean acidification research and monitoring activities. This  collaborative process will help make sure that vulnerable and affected  communities, industries, and coastal and ocean managers have the tools  they need to adapt and mitigate the effects of coastal and ocean  acidification.   For example, at Oregon State University, Dr. Burke Hales developed  the ``Burke-o-Lator,'' a device the size of a piece of carry-on  luggage, that can analyze when shellfish growers across the Pacific  Northwest should grow larvae based on the ocean acidity and the effects  on calcium carbonates needed for shell formation. Other research at  Oregon State has demonstrated how growing particular seagrasses and  kelps can help counteract ocean acidification. These examples help  demonstrate what is possible when we invest in science and research to  help coastal communities adapt to the climate crisis.    The COAST Research Act directs NOAA to maintain a system to process,  store, archive, and provide access to data on ocean and coastal  acidification from federally funded research, including existing global  or national datasets, and research from State and local agencies,  Tribes, academic scientists, citizen scientists, and industry  organizations. These efforts will help provide for the long-term  stewardship and standardization of ocean acidification data and better  help communities adapt and mitigate the worst effects.   Madam Speaker, the health of our ocean reflects the health of our  planet. Today, we have the opportunity to help it become more resilient  by passing the bipartisan COAST Research Act.   I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas and my co- sponsors for their leadership. I urge my colleagues to support the  bill.   I reference letters from Earthjustice, Ocean Conservancy, Wild Salmon  Center, Pacific Coast Shellfish Growers Association, Integrated Ocean  Observing System Association, Surfrider Foundation, Oregon Coordinating  Council on Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia, Consortium for Ocean  Leadership, Oregon State University, Northwest Association of Networked  Ocean Observing Systems, and Pacific States Marine Fisheries  Commission, in support of the COAST Research Act.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record several of the above- referenced letters.                                        Oregon State University,                                Corvallis, Oregon, 10 February 2021.      Re The Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors and Threats           (COAST) Research Act.       Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives.      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Bonamici: We write to offer Oregon       State University's support for The Coastal and Ocean       Acidification Stressors and Threats (COAST) Research Act.        As marine habitats face new and daunting pressures       threatening their sustainability, the COAST Research Act       identifies the growing need for strategic and robust       investments in ocean acidification (OA) research, monitoring       and stakeholder collaboration.        Oregon State University is committed to interdisciplinary       approaches to address the national and global challenges       facing our  [[Page H2382]]       oceans and coast communities. OSU has a deep history of       global leadership in oceanography and engages in nationally       ranked oceanographic monitoring programs and world-leading OA       research. Further, the university recognizes that Oregon's       estuaries and coastal regions are home to some of the world's       most productive ecosystems and economically vital shellfish       farms.        The university is encouraged that the COAST Research Act       expands the definition of OA to include coastal and estuarine       systems, and identifies OA as being affected by a combination       of factors, including hypoxia. The university believes that       by expanding federal definitions of OA and by increasing       funding opportunities, researchers and managers will be able       to best utilize resources to find solutions to address OA.        The university also is encouraged that this legislation       recognizes the need for federal engagement to continue       important investments to understand and address ocean and       coastal acidification. Doing so will enhance the integration       of OA research, monitoring and adaptation strategies across       principal federal research agencies, including the National       Science Foundation, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric       Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration.        Oregon State University understands that effective and       collaborative partnerships and communication are essential       for our state and nation to find adaptive and mitigation       solutions to address OA. For example, the proposal to       establish an Ocean Acidification Advisory Board will be       essential for facilitating the important work still to be       done.        The world's ocean belongs to everyone, and ocean health is       critical to our future. In the coming decades, it will be       essential for the nation and its universities to work       collaboratively to improve and sustain the health of our       oceans. Doing so, we will assure human wellness,       environmental health and economic prosperity for future       generations.        In closing, Oregon State University believes that the COAST       Research Act proposes important new strategic tools to expand       understanding and address the problems facing our oceans and       coastal communities.            Sincerely,      Edward Feser, Ph.D.,        Provost and Executive Vice President.      Irem Tumer, Ph.D., ASME Fellow,        Vice President for Research.                                   ____                                               Pacific States Marine                                            Fisheries Commission,                                     Portland, OR, February 9, 2021.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Bonamici: On behalf of the Pacific       States Marine Fisheries Commission, I am writing in support       of the Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors and Threats       (COAST) Research Act.        The COAST Act would dedicate greater resources and focus on       the issue of ocean acidification. The legislation increases       Federal research, planning, interagency coordination, data       collection, stakeholder input, and socioeconomic study into       this growing and vexing problem impacting our marine       fisheries and wildlife. The Commission appreciates the       thoughtful and bipartisan approach you and Representatives       Young, Pingree and Posey have taken in developing the bill.        The Commission's membership includes the State fisheries       and wildlife agencies of five West Coast states, including       Alaska, California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. Our coastal       members have seen the firsthand impact of ocean acidification       with early research showing a detrimental effect on shell       formation in our crab and shellfish species. Over time, these       chemical changes to shell composition could be devastating to       our valuable Dungeness crab fishery and inshore shellfish       aquaculture operators. There is much more that needs to be       learned about the effect of ocean acidification on these and       other marine species so that appropriate public policy       measures and solutions can be pursued at both the Federal and       state levels.        Ocean acidification is one side effect of other changes in       ocean temperatures and conditions that have been harmful       along the West Coast. Regional temperature oscillation during       the El Nino/La Nina cycles has increased dramatically in       recent years. Average sea surface temperatures have increased       by as much as 7 degrees in some years resulting to many       unfortunate effects to fisheries and marine mammals,       including harmful algal blooms leading to Dungeness crab       season closures; low salmon returns due to reduced ocean       survivability of juvenile fish; shifts in whale migration       patterns causing greater entanglement in fishing gear and       shipping vessel strikes; and sea lion stranding and die-offs       from consumption of crab and shellfish poisoned by domoic       acid.        Thank you for your leadership in reintroducing the COAST       Act. The Commission stands ready to assist and serve as a       resource for you and your staff as the bill moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                      Randy Fisher,      Executive Director.                                   ____           PCSGA, Pacific Coast Shellfish Growers Association,                                                    March 18, 2021.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Bonamici: On behalf of the members of       Pacific Coast Shellfish Growers Association (PCSGA), I am       submitting this letter of support for the Coastal and Ocean       Acidification Stressors and Threats (COAST) Research Act of       2019. Shellfish growers were the first community to call       attention to the problems associated with ocean acidification       when, in 2007, they experienced severe oyster larvae       mortality in two out of three major west coast shellfish       hatcheries. Since then, PCSGA has engaged in several local,       state, and federal efforts and initiatives to ensure a future       for this historic industry.        Shellfish farming on the west coast began in the late       1800's, fueled the California Gold Rush and was the reason       for the development of many coastal towns. Today, PCSGA,       proudly represents 120 shellfish farms in Alaska, Washington,       Oregon, California and Hawaii which farm mussels, clams,       oysters and geoduck. Our members not only produce       sustainable, healthy, food, but also provide significant       ecosystem services such aquatic habitat and water filtration,       and support thousands of family-wage jobs within rural       coastal communities.        For nearly a decade, the shellfish industry has benefited       from NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program and the Integrated       Ocean Observing System (IOOS), both of which relate to the       Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring (FOARAM)       Act of 2009. These programs and the directives within FOARAM       have influenced the way shellfish growers operate their farms       among the uncertainty of changing ocean conditions.       Historically, growers only consulting their tide charts. Now,       growers rely upon a variety of real-time data and tools to       understand the ocean changes and adapt methods and practices       which allow them to continue farming in a productive and       profitable manner. There much work ahead of us and much yet       to learn. COAST Research Act provides an essential pathway       forward.        We are excited by the intent of COAST Research Act, the       opportunities it provides and that it's been included as part       of the Climate Action Plan. We see how COAST will further       investments in ocean and coastal acidification research and       monitoring, assist shellfish community with much needed       adaptation strategies and coordinate work with stakeholders.       Simply put, COAST is a logical and necessary follow-up to       FOARAM and allows us to continue asking questions and seek       innovative approaches to mitigate the impacts related to       ocean acidification.        Thank you very much for your leadership on this and for       your commitment to ensuring the long-term health of our       coastal and marine areas upon which shellfish growers depend.            Respectfully,                                                Margaret A. Pilaro,      Executive Director.                                   ____           The Oregon Coordinating Council on Ocean Acidification             and Hypoxia,                                               February 12th, 2021.      Re Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors and Threats           (COAST) Research Act.       Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      Washington, DC.        As the Co-Chairs of the State legislatively mandated,       Oregon Coordinating Council on Ocean Acidification and       Hypoxia (or ``Oregon OAH Council''), we appreciate the       opportunity to provide you with a letter of strong support       for the Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors and Threats       (COAST) Research Act. Addressing intensifying ocean       acidification (OA) conditions here in Oregon, as well as       across the United States, is critical to our Nation's       understanding of larger impacts from CO2       emissions.        Oregon is among the first places in the world to observe       direct impacts of ocean acidification and hypoxia (OAH), due       to our unique geographic and oceanographic context, putting       our fragile marine ecosystem at risk. Our coastal economies       rely on our vibrant marine ecosystem. Our nearshore waters       are home to sport and commercial fisheries, all of the       State's mariculture operations, and contain critical nursery       grounds for economically important species including       rockfish, oysters, salmon, pink shrimp, and Dungeness crab.       Oregon is not alone in experiencing the impacts from OA or       hypoxia. Through actions such as those in the COAST Research       Act we must act together as Americans to develop solutions       for our coastal communities, economies, and ecosystems to       prepare for future conditions.        In the coming years, the Oregon OAH Council will continue       to take a collaborative, science-based approach to developing       recommendations to address OAH in our state and beyond.       Through further investments and initiatives, Oregon and the       United States will benefit from adaptation and mitigation       measures and will model to the world how to develop       actionable solutions for OA adaptation and mitigation.        Oregon has identified three urgently needed strategic       actions, which directly align with objectives within the       COAST Research Act.        (1) Monitoring of key oceanographic and biological       indicators of impacts from OAH.        At the same time that OA has been impacting our coasts,       oxygen-depletion is on the rise; Oregon and much of the West       coast has seen several seasons in a row with extended periods       of hypoxia in our coastal  [[Page H2383]]       waters. The Oregon OAH Council is encouraged that the COAST       Research Act identifies the need to strengthen investments in       OA research and monitoring in the context of other       environmental stressors. Ocean acidification and hypoxia are       compounding stressors for a wide range of marine animals, and       as such must continue to be studied together. Through the       COAST Research Acts reauthorization of funding of NOAA, NSF,       and NASA, much needed resources will be made available to       researchers across the United States to continue to expand       our knowledge of OAH. The Oregon OAH Council also supports       the initiative of the COAST Research Act to create data       processing, storage, and archive facilities to provide for       the long-term stewardship and standardization of data. By       creating a central repository for OAH data it provides       governments, scientists, and industry better access to the       information need to inform their mitigation and adaption       planning. Only by maximizing our current data and filling our       knowledge gaps of OAH, can we as a Nation begin to be able to       piece together for solutions for our coastal communities.        (2) Projects or programs that promote coastal economic and       ecosystem resilience to OAH.        Fisheries and aquaculture are central to our history, are       enjoyed by Americans across the nation year-round, and remain       key to many of Oregon's coastal economies today. Yet, the       future sustainability of these marine resources and       communities' ability to rely on them, are uncertain in the       face of significant ocean changes, including OAH, and       uncertain in the face of our current state of preparation to       adapt to those changes over time. This is why the Oregon OAH       Council supports activities and initiatives that promote       resilience to increased OAH conditions, for both human       communities and ecosystems. The COAST Research Act also       stresses the importance of increasing our understanding of       the socioeconomic effects of OA by expanding federal research       to assess adaptation and mitigation strategies. There will be       costs of inaction relative to CO2 mitigation and       the United States has an obligation to relieve these costs       wherever possible for our citizens.        (3) Tools and strategies to increase awareness of OAH       science, impacts and solutions.        As the impacts of OA intensify, it is going to be vitally       important for our Nation to identify and advance       opportunities to raise awareness of and communicate OAH       science, impacts, and mitigation solutions. This is why the       Oregon OAH Council is encouraged by the fact that the COAST       Research Act recognizes the need to address the effects of OA       on estuaries and integrate research, monitoring, and       adaptation strategies. By integrating OA causes and effects,       it better demonstrates the complexity of this climate issue,       and provides a clearer message to communities. The Oregon OAH       Council also supports the COAST Research Act establishment of       an Advisory Board to increase coordination among       stakeholders, including members of industry, to work with       State and Federal governments to improve coordination.       Recognizing the importance of a broad membership, our Oregon       OAH Council includes members from industry, academia and       state government agencies. For the benefit of our marine       ecosystem and the human communities that rely on a healthy       marine ecosystem, the Nation's adaptation and mitigation       approaches to OA should include successful communication of       new science, monitoring, and adaptation strategies.        As Co-Chairs of the Oregon OAH Council, we appreciate the       opportunity to provide you with a letter of strong support       for the COAST Research Act. The strategic investment and       coordination opportunities outlined in this act are       meaningful and will make a difference in our understanding of       OAH science, impacts, and solutions. Through passage of this       Act and the subsequent investment in science, adaptation and       communications, the United States will demonstrate meaningful       action in fighting OA and the global challenges of climate       change, and preparing our citizens and economies for the       changes ahead.        Thank you for your consideration of these comments.            Sincerely,      John Barth, PhD,        Co-Chair, Oregon OAH Council, Executive Director, Marine       Studies Initiative, Oregon State University.

Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington DC.        Dear Congresswoman Bonamici: As the Director of the       Northwest Association of Ocean Observing Systems (NANOOS), I       write in support of the Coastal and Ocean Acidification       Stressors and Threats (COAST) Research Act.        NANOOS provides access to near-real time observations,       forecasts, and other tools that can be used to observe water       properties in the Salish Sea and the coastal waters off       Washington and Oregon. NANOOS can only serve our stakeholders       via NOAA's Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), which       links together Federal agencies with our collective of local       universities, government agencies, tribes, nonprofits, and       industry organizations who collect quality oceanographic and       meteorological data from moorings, buoys, and satellites from       across the Pacific Northwest region. But our resources are       limited and this COAST Research Act would help to highlight       the payoff investments can make.        In the Pacific Northwest, we know that ocean acidification       is an issue already, as witnessed by the difference that       monitoring water chemistry has made to shellfish growers. We       know that impacts from ocean acidification may affect       shellfish harvesters, fishermen, resource managers, and       tribal and other coastal communities. NANOOS' work with IOOS       and NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program have been instrumental       in aiding adaptation.        The COAST Research Act will enhance these and other efforts       to understand, monitor, and manage the nation's ability to       respond and adapt to ocean acidification. NANOOS will be       better able to meet the needs of our stakeholders if this Act       is passed.        My thanks for your leadership and insights.            Sincerely,                                                        Jan Newton,                                         NANOOS Executive Director.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, April 19, 2021.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: In recognition of the goal of       expediting consideration of H.R. 1447, the ``Coastal and       Ocean Acidification Stressors and Threats Research Act of       2021,'' the Committee on Natural Resources agrees to waive       formal consideration of the bill as to provisions that fall       within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural       Resources.        The Committee on Natural Resources takes this action with       the mutual understanding that, in doing so, we do not waive       any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. Our Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar       legislation.        Thank you for agreeing to include our exchange of letters       in the Congressional Record. I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to       work with you as this measure moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                               Raul M. Grijalva,                                                              Chair,      House Natural Resources Committee.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                    Washington, DC, April 16, 2021.      Chairman Raul M. Grijalva,      Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1447, the ``Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors and       Threats Research Act of 2021,'' which was referred to the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology on March 1, 2021.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       bill. I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall       within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural       Resources. I acknowledge that your Committee will waive       further consideration of H.R. 1447 and that this action is       not a waiver of future jurisdictional claims by the Committee       on Natural Resources over this subject matter.        I will make sure to include our exchange of letters in the       Congressional Record and will support the appointment of the       Committee on Natural Resources conferees during any House-      Senate conference. Thank you for your cooperation on this       legislation.        Sincerely,                                             Eddie Bernice Johnson,                                                        Chairwoman.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree), a cosponsor of the COAST  Research Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The basic chemistry of our ocean is changing at an unprecedented  rate. We know that even if carbon dioxide emissions were halted today,  many of the residual effects on our oceans will continue to occur over  the course of the next few decades.   Without intervention, ocean acidification is projected to become more  intense and increasingly common, especially on the Pacific Coast. We  must support vulnerable communities, industries, coastal and ocean  managers by strengthening research on how they can best prepare for  and, when possible, adapt to ocean and coastal acidification.   By passing the bipartisan COAST Research Act, we are taking one  important step forward in advancing ocean climate action.   I, again, thank Chairwoman Johnson; Ranking Member Lucas; and my co- leads on this bill, Representative Young, Pingree, and Posey for their  support.   I know Mr. Young from Alaska talked about his salmon. We would  compete with salmon in the Pacific Northwest. We also have the prize  dungeness crab, and Ms. Pingree has her lobsters. It is so critical for  these industries that we pass this bill and advance ocean climate  action.  [[Page H2385]]    I, once again, urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2533) to provide for a study by the National Academies of  Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine examining the impact of ocean  acidification and other stressors in estuarine environments.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2533         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Estuaries and       Acidification Research Act of 2021'' or the ``NEAR Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Ocean acidification impacts human health, natural       resources, and the environmental, economic, and recreational       uses of the coastline.        (2) The current understanding of ocean acidification       impacts on estuarine ecosystems is inadequate to fully       prepare and manage for changing environmental conditions in       nearshore locations.        (3) While pH can be measured with high precision and       accuracy in open ocean environments, more understanding of       the carbonate system in estuarine ecosystems is needed for       precise and accurate measurements and observations.        (4) The interaction of multiple stressors, including       salinity, pH, temperature, sea level rise, and nutrient       input, within estuarine ecosystems is inadequately understood       for managing the health, economic, recreational, and       environmental impacts driven by these interactions.        (5) A better understanding is needed of how anthropogenic       influences in coastal environments affect estuarine       ecosystems.        (6) More integration and coordination is needed among       regional, national, and global environmental observations in       estuarine environments, supporting prior investments in       related topics such as nutrient loading, hypoxia, ocean       acidification, and harmful algae bloom research and       observational systems.       SEC. 3. STUDY EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND                     OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS ON ESTUARINE                     ENVIRONMENTS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 60 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall make       appropriate arrangements with the National Academies of       Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (referred to in this Act       as the ``National Academies'') under which the National       Academies shall conduct a study that--        (1) examines the existing science of ocean acidification in       estuarine environments;        (2) examines the challenges to studying ocean acidification       and ocean acidification's interactions with other environment       stressors in estuarine environments;        (3) provides recommendations for improving future research       with respect to ocean acidification in estuarine       environments; and        (4) identifies pathways for applying science in management       and mitigation decisions relating to ocean acidification in       estuarine environments.        (b) Contents of Study.--The study described under       subsection (a) shall include--        (1) the behavior of the carbonate system within estuarine       environments;        (2) the interactions of the carbonate system with other       biotic and abiotic characteristics of estuarine ecosystems;        (3) how environmental and anthropogenic changes or       disturbances could affect abiotic and biotic processes within       estuaries;        (4) how estuarine biotic and abiotic processes will be       affected under predicted environmental changes;        (5) the current state of data collection, interpretation,       storage, and retrieval and observational infrastructure of       abiotic and biotic parameters in estuarine ecosystems;        (6) the gaps that exist in understanding the socio-economic       and health impacts of ocean acidification in estuaries;        (7) future directions for scientific research; and        (8) pathways for applying science in management and       mitigation decisions.        (c) Report.--In entering into an arrangement under       subsection (a), the Secretary shall request that the National       Academies transmit to Congress a report on the results of the       study not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of       this Act.        (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized       to be appropriated to carry out this section $1,000,000.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 2533, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Congressman Posey's National  Estuaries and Acidification Research Act. I am an original cosponsor of  this bipartisan bill, which would direct the National Academies of  Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study that examines  the science of ocean and coastal acidification in estuaries and provide  recommendations to improve future research and management to inform  mitigation decisions.   As co-chair of both the House Oceans Caucus and Congressional Estuary  Caucus, I know that acidification is not only affecting the open ocean,  estuaries and nearshore waters are also absorbing tremendous amounts of  carbon pollution and becoming more acidic.   Our understanding of ocean acidification and its interactions with  other environmental stressors, such as hypoxia, harmful algal blooms,  and warming waters, is rapidly evolving, but is still limited in scope.   Ocean and coastal acidification are often present in the context of  other coastal processes, like runoff, erosion, and upwelled water from  the oceans, making it difficult to measure its individual effects on  estuaries.   Our estuaries and nearshore waters are also experiencing the  consequences of our inaction to address the climate crisis, and  research has not kept pace with the needs of coastal communities. The  NEAR Act will help address significant research gaps and the urgent  need to improve our understanding of the ecological and socioeconomic  effects of ocean and coastal acidification.   I thank Congressman Posey for his leadership on this bipartisan bill  and his efforts to preserve our Nation's estuaries. I also thank  Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for making this bill a  priority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill to address the  urgent need for research on ocean and coastal acidification in  estuaries.   I appreciate the partnership and leadership from Chairwoman Johnson,  Ranking Member Lucas, and Congressman Posey to protect the health of  our oceans and estuaries.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support this bipartisan bill, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 210) to coordinate Federal research and development efforts  focused on STEM education and workforce development in rural areas,  including the development and application of new technologies to  support and improve rural STEM education, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 210         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rural STEM Education       Research Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The supply of STEM workers is not keeping pace with the       rapidly evolving needs of the public and private sector,       resulting in a deficit often referred to as a STEM skills       shortage.        (2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the United       States will need one million additional STEM professionals       than it is on track to produce in the coming decade.        (3) Many STEM occupations offer higher wages, more       opportunities for advancement, and a higher degree of job       security than non-STEM jobs.        (4) The 60,000,000 individuals in the United States who       live in rural settings are significantly under-represented in       STEM.        (5) According to the National Center for Education       Statistics, nine million students in the United States--      nearly 20 percent of the total K-12 population--attend rural       schools, and for reasons ranging from teacher quality to       shortages of resources, these students often have fewer       opportunities for high-quality STEM learning than their peers       in the Nation's urban and suburban schools.        (6) Rural areas represent one of the most promising, yet       underutilized, opportunities for STEM education to impact       workforce development and regional innovation, including       agriculture.        (7) The study of agriculture, food, and natural resources       involves biology, engineering, physics, chemistry, math,       geology, computer science, and other scientific fields.        (8) Employment in computer and information technology       occupations is projected to grow 11 percent from 2019 to       2029. To help meet this demand, it is important rural       students have the opportunity to acquire computing skills       through exposure to computer science learning in grades Pre-K       through 12 and in informal learning settings.        (9) More than 293,000,000 individuals in the United States       use high-speed broadband to work, learn, access healthcare,       and operate their businesses, while 19,000,000 individuals in       the United States still lack access to high-speed broadband.       Rural areas are hardest hit, with over 26 percent of       individuals in rural areas in the United States lacking       access to high-speed broadband compared to 1.7 percent of       individuals in urban areas in the United States.       SEC. 3. NIST ENGAGEMENT WITH RURAL COMMUNITIES.         (a) MEP Outreach.--Section 25 of the National Institute of       Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278k) is amended--        (1) in subsection (c)--        (A) in paragraph (6), by striking ``community colleges and       area career and technical education schools'' and inserting       the following: ``secondary schools (as defined in section       8101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965       (20 U.S.C. 7801)), community colleges, and area career and       technical education schools, including those in underserved       and rural communities,''; and        (B) in paragraph (7)--        (i) by striking ``and local colleges'' and inserting the       following: ``local high schools and local colleges, including       those in underserved and rural communities,''; and        (ii) by inserting ``or other applied learning       opportunities'' after ``apprenticeships''; and        (2) in subsection (d)(3) by striking ``, community       colleges, and area career and technical education schools,''       and inserting the following: ``and local high schools,       community colleges, and area career and technical education       schools, including those in underserved and rural       communities,''.        (b) Rural Connectivity Prize Competition.--        (1) Prize competition.--Pursuant to section 24 of the       Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C.       3719), the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Under       Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology (referred       to in this subsection as the ``Secretary''), shall, subject       to appropriations, carry out a program to award prizes       competitively to stimulate research and development of       creative technologies in order to deploy affordable and       reliable broadband connectivity to underserved rural       communities.        (2) Plan for deployment in rural communities.--Each       proposal submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall include a       plan for deployment of the technology that is the subject of       such proposal in an underserved rural community.        (3) Prize amount.--In carrying out the program under       paragraph (1), the Secretary may award not more than a total       of $5,000,000 to one or more winners of the prize       competition.

SEC. 10. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of       the National Science Foundation established under section 2       of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 (42 U.S.C.       1861).        (2) Federal laboratory.--The term ``Federal laboratory''       has the meaning given such term in section 4 of the       Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C.       3703).        (3) Foundation.--The term ``Foundation'' means the National       Science Foundation established under section 2 of the       National Science Foundation Act of 1950 (42 U.S.C. 1861).        (4) Institution of higher education.--The term       ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given       such term in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of       1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)).        (5) STEM.--The term ``STEM'' has the meaning given the term       in section 2 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of       2010 (42 U.S.C. 6621 note).        (6) STEM education.--The term ``STEM education'' has the       meaning given the term in section 2 of the STEM Education Act       of 2015 (42 U.S.C. 6621 note).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 210, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 210, the Rural STEM Education  Research Act. I thank Ranking Member Lucas for introducing this  important bill.   Every State in the country is filled with students who have an  incredible curiosity for STEM and the potential to make important  contributions in these fields. But too often, students are left behind  and are unable to fulfill their vast potential simply because of where  they live.   Students in rural areas have long faced obstacles to receiving a  high-quality STEM education. Lack of broadband access, for example, has  long been a barrier.   Schools in rural communities often struggle to access the equipment  and facilities needed to provide students with hands-on STEM  experiences. Research shows that hands-on experiences help inspire  scientific curiosity and a love of STEM in students.   Teachers are trying their best, but they have limited resources and  support. To make matters worse, the COVID-19 pandemic and the  transition to remote learning have further exacerbated these  inequalities.   Students and teachers in rural communities have worked hard to adapt,  but they need help. We have an opportunity not just to recover from  what was lost during the pandemic but to ensure a better STEM education  future for rural students.   The Rural STEM Education Act provides for research and development to  increase access to STEM education opportunities in rural schools and to  provide teachers with the resources they need to teach more  effectively.   The bill also directs NIST to develop a prize competition to advance  research and development in support of expanded broadband access.   This bill further provides for assessments of Federal investments in  rural STEM education to be conducted by the National Academies and the  Government Accountability Office.   This bill is an important step toward improving STEM education in  rural communities across America and will help build a 21st century  STEM workforce that will help the U.S. remain a global leader in  science and technology.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 210, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee and the Committee on Education and Labor, I want  to thank Mr. Lucas for mentioning not only broadband but also place- based learning. I represent several rural school districts, and I  appreciate this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again thank Ranking Member Lucas  for his work on this legislation. I thank Chairwoman Johnson for  supporting it, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 144) to forestall the loss of research talent by  establishing a temporary early career research fellowship program, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 144         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting Early-Career       Researchers Act''.  [[Page H2391]]            SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Nation's universities and industrial research labs       are facing unprecedented budget pressure as part of the       COVID-19 health crisis, resulting in considerably fewer       openings for research and teaching positions.        (2) Emergency funding is needed to forestall the loss of       research talent likely to occur if early-career researchers       are forced to seek employment outside of research due to the       sharp economic decline caused by the COVID-19 health crisis.        (3) The future of America's defense will rely on advanced       technologies to maintain its military superiority over its       rivals, including China. These technologies will require new       levels of scientific and engineering aptitude and       understanding. Early career researchers will play a critical       role in the development of these technologies, and the loss       of an entire generation of researchers due to the COVID-19       pandemic will be detrimental to the United States national       security.       SEC. 3. EARLY-CAREER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--The Director of the National Science       Foundation may establish a 2-year pilot program to award       grants to highly qualified early-career investigators to       carry out an independent research program at the qualified       institution of higher education chosen by such investigator,       to last for a period not greater than 2 years.        (b) Selection Process.--The Director of the National       Science Foundation shall select grantees under subsection (a)       from among citizens, nationals, and lawfully admitted       permanent resident aliens of the United States.        (c) Outreach.--The Director shall conduct program outreach       to recruit fellowship applicants--        (1) from all regions of the country;        (2) from historically underrepresented populations in the       fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics;       and        (3) who graduate from or intend to carry out research at a       variety of types of institutions of higher education,       including--        (A) Historically Black Colleges and Universities;        (B) Hispanic-Serving Institutions;        (C) Tribal Colleges and Universities; and        (D) institutions of higher education that are not among the       top 50 institutions in annual Federal funding for research.        (d) Special Consideration.--The Director shall give special       consideration to an application from an individual who       graduated from or is intending to carry out research at an       institution of the type listed in subsection (c)(3).        (e) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the conclusion of       the second year of the pilot program, the Director shall       submit a report to Congress that includes--        (1) statistical summary data on fellowship awardees       disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, age, years since       completion of doctoral degree, and institution type;        (2) an assessment, drawing on feedback from the research       community and other sources of information, of the       effectiveness of the pilot program for mitigating the loss of       research talent due to the pandemic; and        (3) if determined effective, a plan for permanent       implementation of the pilot program.        (f) Qualified Institution of Higher Education Defined.--The       term ``qualified institution of higher education'' has the       meaning given the term in section 102 of the Higher Education       of Act of 1965, except that such term does not include an       institution described in subsection (a)(1)(C) of such       section.

There is authorized to be appropriated to the Director of       the National Science Foundation $250,000,000 for each of       fiscal years 2021 through 2022 to carry out the activities in       this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 144, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 144, the Supporting Early- Career Researchers Act. I commend Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for introducing  this bill, which I am pleased to cosponsor.   The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of our lives, and the  U.S. research enterprise has not been spared. As research labs and  universities around the country took action to mitigate the spread of  the virus in their labs and on their campuses, research productivity  decreased dramatically. We still do not know the full financial  consequences incurred by these institutions or their full costs in  terms of lost science.   Compounding these declines in research productivity, women  researchers and researchers from groups historically underrepresented  in STEM have been particularly disadvantaged during the crisis because  of childcare and other factors.   Facing unprecedented financial difficulties, many research  universities instituted hiring freezes, and faculty job openings  declined by nearly 70 percent. This limited job market has a greater  effect on early-career researchers who may have their career derailed  before it truly begins. Already, some early-career researchers are  having to choose between applying their training and talent to an  academic career and supporting their families.   Early-career researchers play a vital role in the U.S. research  ecosystem. They are not only highly productive researchers, they also  play a significant role in training the next generation of  undergraduate and graduate STEM students. Their departure from research  careers, if we do not stop it, will have a profound and long-lasting  consequence on U.S. innovation and competitiveness in the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, as increasing numbers of Americans receive COVID-19  vaccines and the research enterprise continues its recovery, we must  make the retention of early-career researchers a priority. The  Supporting Early-Career Researchers Act directs the National Science  Foundation to establish a new $250 million post-doctoral fellowship  program to support early-career researchers.   This program will help prevent a significant loss of STEM talent.  More than 40 organizations have endorsed this legislation. I, again,  thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for their continued  deliberation on this important issue, and I look forward to working  with my colleagues on getting this bill signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 144, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the  bipartisan Supporting Early-Career Researchers Act.   I thank Mr. Lucas and Chair Johnson, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 204) to direct the Director of the Office of Science and  Technology Policy to carry out programs and activities to ensure that  Federal science agencies and institutions of higher education receiving  Federal research and development funding are fully engaging their  entire talent pool, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 204         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS; FINDINGS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``STEM       Opportunities Act''.

(c) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:        (1) Many reports over the past decade have found that it is       critical to our Nation's economic leadership and global       competitiveness that the United States educates and trains       more scientists and engineers.        (2) Research shows that women and minorities who are       interested in STEM careers are disproportionately lost at       nearly every educational transition and at every career       milestone.        (3) The National Center for Science and Engineering       Statistics at the National Science Foundation collects,       compiles, analyzes, and publishes data on the demographics of       STEM degrees and STEM jobs in the United States.        (4) Women now earn nearly 37 percent of all STEM bachelor's       degrees, but major variations persist among fields. In 2017,       women earned only 20 percent of all bachelor's degrees       awarded in engineering and 19 percent of bachelor's degrees       awarded in computer sciences. Based on Bureau of Labor       Statistics data, jobs in computing occupations are expected       to account for nearly 60 percent of the projected annual       growth of newly created STEM job openings from 2016 to 2026.        (5) In 2017, underrepresented minority groups comprised 39       percent of the college-age population of the United States,       but only 18 percent of students who earned bachelor's degrees       in STEM fields. The Higher Education Research Institute at       the University of California, Los Angeles, found that, while       freshmen from underrepresented minority groups express an       interest in pursuing a STEM undergraduate degree at the same       rate as all other freshmen, only 22.1 percent of Latino       students, 18.4 percent of African-American students, and 18.8       percent of Native American students studying in STEM fields       complete their degree within 5 years, compared to       approximately 33 percent of White students and 42 percent of       Asian students who complete their degree within 5 years.  [[Page H2393]]         (6) In some STEM fields, including the computer sciences,       women persist at about the same rate through doctorate       degrees. In other STEM fields, women persist through       doctorate degrees at a lower rate. In mathematics, women earn       just 26 percent of doctorate degrees compared with 42 percent       of undergraduate degrees. Overall, women earned 38 percent of       STEM doctorate degrees in 2016. The rate of minority students       earning STEM doctorate degrees in physics is 9 percent,       compared with 15 percent for bachelor's degree. Students from       underrepresented minority groups accounted for only 11.5       percent of STEM doctorate degrees awarded in 2016.        (7) The representation of women in STEM drops significantly       from the doctorate degree level to the faculty level.       Overall, women hold only 26 percent of all tenured and       tenure-track positions and 27 percent of full professor       positions in STEM fields in our Nation's universities and 4-      year colleges. Black and Hispanic faculty together hold about       6.8 percent of all tenured and tenure-track positions and 7.5       percent of full professor positions. Many of the numbers in       the American Indian or Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian or       Other Pacific Islander categories for different faculty ranks       were too small for the National Science Foundation to report       publicly without potentially compromising confidential       information about the individuals being surveyed.        (8) The representation of women is especially low at our       Nation's top research universities. Even in the biological       sciences, in which women now earn more than 50 percent of the       doctorates and passed the 25 percent level 37 years ago,       women make up only 25 percent of the full professors at the       approximately 100 most research-intensive universities in the       United States. In the physical sciences and mathematics,       women make up only 11 percent of full professors, in computer       sciences only 10 percent, and across engineering fields only       7 percent. The data suggest that approximately 6 percent of       all tenure-track STEM faculty members at the most research-      intensive universities are from underrepresented minority       groups, but in some fields the numbers are too small to       report publicly.        (9) By 2050, underrepresented minorities will comprise 52       percent of the college-age population of the United States.       If the percentage of female students and students from       underrepresented minority groups earning bachelor's degrees       in STEM fields does not significantly increase, the United       States will face an acute shortfall in the overall number of       students who earn degrees in STEM fields just as United       States companies are increasingly seeking students with those       skills. With this impending shortfall, the United States will       almost certainly lose its competitive edge in the 21st       century global economy.        (10) According to a 2014 Association for Women in Science       survey of over 4,000 scientists across the globe, 70 percent       of whom were men, STEM researchers face significant       challenges in work-life integration. Researchers in the       United States were among the most likely to experience a       conflict between work and their personal life at least       weekly. One-third of researchers surveyed said that ensuring       good work-life integration has negatively impacted their       careers, and, of researchers intending to leave their current       job within the next year, 9 percent indicated it was because       they were unable to balance work and life demands.        (11) Female students and students from underrepresented       minority groups at institutions of higher education who see       few others ``like themselves'' among faculty and student       populations often do not experience the social integration       that is necessary for success in all disciplines, including       STEM.        (12) One in five children in the United States attend       school in a rural community. The data shows that rural       students are at a disadvantage with respect to STEM       readiness. Among STEM-interested students, 17 percent of       students in rural high schools and 18 percent of students in       town-located high schools meet the ACT STEM Benchmark,       compared with 33 percent of students in suburban high schools       and 27 percent of students in urban high schools.        (13) A substantial body of evidence establishes that most       people hold implicit biases. Decades of cognitive psychology       research reveal that most people carry prejudices of which       they are unaware but that nonetheless play a large role in       evaluations of people and their work. Unintentional biases       and outmoded institutional structures are hindering the       access and advancement of women, minorities, and other groups       historically underrepresented in STEM.        (14) Workshops held to educate faculty about unintentional       biases have demonstrated success in raising awareness of such       biases.        (15) In 2012, the Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity       of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (in this       Act referred to as ``NASA'') completed a report that--        (A) is specifically designed to help NASA grant recipients       identify why the dearth of women in STEM fields continues and       to ensure that it is not due to discrimination; and        (B) provides guidance that is usable by all institutions of       higher education receiving significant Federal research       funding on how to conduct meaningful self-evaluations of       campus culture and policies.        (16) The Federal Government provides 55 percent of research       funding at institutions of higher education and, through its       grant-making policies, has had significant influence on       institution of higher education policies, including policies       related to institutional culture and structure.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are as follows:        (1) To ensure that Federal science agencies and       institutions of higher education receiving Federal research       and development funding are fully engaging the entire talent       pool of the United States.        (2) To promote research on, and increase understanding of,       the participation and trajectories of women, minorities, and       other groups historically underrepresented in STEM studies       and careers, including persons with disabilities, older       learners, veterans, and rural, poor, and tribal populations,       at institutions of higher education and Federal science       agencies, including Federal laboratories.        (3) To raise awareness within Federal science agencies,       including Federal laboratories, and institutions of higher       education about cultural and institutional barriers limiting       the recruitment, retention, promotion, and other indicators       of participation and achievement of women, minorities, and       other groups historically underrepresented in academic and       Government STEM research careers at all levels.        (4) To identify, disseminate, and implement best practices       at Federal science agencies, including Federal laboratories,       and at institutions of higher education to remove or reduce       cultural and institutional barriers limiting the recruitment,       retention, and success of women, minorities, and other groups       historically underrepresented in academic and Government STEM       research careers.        (5) To provide grants to institutions of higher education       to recruit, retain, and advance STEM faculty members from       underrepresented minority groups and to implement or expand       reforms in undergraduate STEM education in order to increase       the number of students from underrepresented minority groups       receiving degrees in these fields.

SEC. 7. CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS TO EXPANDING THE                     ACADEMIC AND FEDERAL STEM WORKFORCE.         (a) Best Practices at Institutions of Higher Education and       Federal Laboratories.--        (1) Development of guidance.--Not later than 12 months       after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director, in       consultation with the interagency working group on inclusion       in STEM, shall develop written guidance for institutions of       higher education and Federal laboratories on the best       practices for--        (A) conducting periodic climate surveys of STEM departments       and divisions, with a particular focus on identifying any       cultural or institutional barriers to the recruitment,       retention, or advancement of women, racial and ethnic       minorities, and other groups historically underrepresented in       STEM studies and careers; and        (B) providing educational opportunities, including       workshops as described in subsection (b), for STEM faculty,       research personnel, and administrators to learn about current       research on implicit bias in recruitment, evaluation, and       promotion of undergraduate and graduate students and research       personnel.        (2) Existing guidance.--In developing the guidance under       paragraph (1), the Director shall utilize guidance already       developed by Federal science agencies.        (3) Dissemination of guidance.--Federal science agencies       shall broadly disseminate the guidance developed under       paragraph (1) to institutions of higher education that       receive Federal research funding and Federal laboratories.        (4) Establishment of policies.--Consistent with the       guidance developed under paragraph (1)--        (A) the Director of the National Science Foundation shall       develop a policy that--        (i) applies to, at a minimum, doctoral degree granting       institutions that receive Federal research funding; and        (ii) requires each such institution, not later than 3 years       after the date of enactment of this Act, to report to the       Director of the National Science Foundation on activities and       policies developed and implemented based on the guidance       developed under paragraph (1); and        (B) each Federal science agency with a Federal laboratory       shall maintain or develop and implement practices and       policies for the purposes described in paragraph (1) for such       laboratory.        (b) Workshops To Address Cultural Barriers to Expanding the       Academic and Federal STEM Workforce.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Director, in consultation with the       interagency working group on inclusion in STEM, shall       recommend a uniform policy for Federal science agencies to       carry out a program of workshops that educate STEM department       chairs at institutions of higher education, senior managers       at Federal laboratories, and other federally funded       researchers about methods that minimize the effects of       implicit bias in the career advancement, including hiring,       tenure, promotion, and selection for any honor based in part       on the recipient's research record, of academic and Federal       STEM researchers.        (2) Interagency coordination.--The Director shall, to the       extent practicable, ensure that workshops supported under       this subsection are coordinated across Federal science       agencies and jointly supported as appropriate.        (3) Minimizing costs.--To the extent practicable, workshops       shall be held in conjunction with national or regional STEM       disciplinary meetings to minimize costs associated with       participant travel.        (4) Priority fields for academic participants.--In       considering the participation of STEM department chairs and       other academic researchers, the Director shall prioritize       workshops for the broad fields of STEM in which the national       rate of representation of women among tenured or tenure-track       faculty or nonfaculty researchers at doctorate-granting       institutions of higher education is less than 25 percent,       according to the most recent data available from the National       Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.

SEC. 14. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of       the Office of Science and Technology Policy.        (2) Federal laboratory.--The term ``Federal laboratory''       has the meaning given such term in section 4 of the       Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C.       3703).        (3) Federal science agency.--The term ``Federal science       agency'' means any Federal agency with an annual extramural       research expenditure of over $100,000,000.        (4) Institution of higher education.--The term       ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given       such term in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of       1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)).        (5) Interagency working group on inclusion in stem.--The       term ``interagency working group on inclusion in STEM'' means       the interagency working group established by section 308 of       the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C.       6626).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 204, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Committee on Science, Space, and Technology  Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for introducing this bill,  which I am also proud to cosponsor.   I thank all of the Members on both sides of the aisle who have  cosponsored the bill, the 25 organizations that have endorsed it, and  the many more organizations and individuals who contributed to it.                                time  1645    The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us all the importance of a robust  U.S. research enterprise. Not only has this been essential during the  pandemic, it will continue to be crucial to maintaining U.S. global  leadership in science and technology.   Unfortunately, this position of global leadership is eroding. To  maintain our leadership position and to lead the world in the  development of technologies that may dramatically reshape our lives,  the U.S. needs a talented STEM workforce that is fully representative  of our population.   We have a lot of work to do on that front. Women and people of color  remain severely underrepresented in STEM. As we have learned from  numerous studies, this underrepresentation results from numerous  cultural and institutional barriers, as well as a lack of access to  resources and adequate support. It is not because of a lack of talent  or interest in STEM. We have made progress on increasing the diversity  of the STEM fields in recent years, but it is nowhere near enough.   We must act now to address these inequities and begin building a more  diverse STEM workforce for the 21st century.   The STEM Opportunities Act requires comprehensive data collection by  Federal agencies so we can better understand the challenge we are  facing. It also requires the development of consistent Federal policies  for recipients of Federal research awards who have caregiving  responsibilities, an issue the pandemic has brought into sharper focus.   The bill requires OSTP to develop consistent guidelines and best  practices for grant reviewers and program officers, as well as  universities and Federal laboratories. These guidelines and best  practices will assist in reducing the effects of implicit bias and  identifying barriers limiting the recruitment, retention, and  advancement of women and minorities in STEM.   The bill also authorizes the National Science Foundation to expand  research aimed at improving the recruitment, retention, and advancement  of women and minorities in STEM. NSF is also directed to award grants  through the existing Tribal Colleges and Universities Program to  support computer science education.   We cannot leave anybody behind in the STEM fields, and H.R. 204 will  help. We give better decisions when we have people from all backgrounds  around the table.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure  this important bill is signed into law. I strongly urge my colleagues  to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, a few years ago, I held an innovation  roundtable in northwest Oregon, and I remember clearly one very  successful tech entrepreneur answered the question: What is the best  thing we can do for innovation?   He said: We need to diversify the STEM workforce because people from  different backgrounds and different experiences bring different  perspectives and help identify problems that others may not.   This bill will help in that effort.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge adoption of the  bipartisan STEM Opportunities Act, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2027) to direct Federal science agencies and the Office of  Science and Technology Policy to undertake activities to improve the  quality of undergraduate STEM education and enhance the research  capacity at the Nation's HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2027         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``MSI STEM Achievement Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Evidence suggests that the supply of STEM workers is       not keeping pace with the rapidly evolving needs of the       public and private sector, resulting in a deficit often       referred to as a STEM skills shortage.        (2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the United       States will need one million additional STEM professionals       than it is on track to produce in the coming decade.        (3) STEM occupations offer higher wages, more opportunities       for advancement, and a higher degree of job security than       non-STEM occupations.        (4) The composition of the STEM workforce does not reflect       the current or projected diversity of the Nation, with       Hispanics, African Americans, and other racial and ethnic       minorities, significantly underrepresented in the STEM       workforce compared to their presence in the workforce more       generally.        (5) A stronger national commitment to increasing the       diversity of the STEM workforce is needed to help address the       STEM skills shortage.        (6) According to a 2019 National Academies of Sciences,       Engineering, and Medicine report entitled ``Minority Serving       Institutions: America's Underutilized Resource for       Strengthening the STEM Workforce'', 2- and 4-year minority       serving institutions enroll nearly 30 percent of all       undergraduate students--a percentage that is expected to grow       in the coming years--in the United States higher education       system and play a critical role in providing important       pathways to STEM-related education, training, and careers for       students of color.        (7) HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs are highly successful at       educating underrepresented minority students in STEM fields       and can serve as best practice models for other colleges and       universities to further expand participation of       underrepresented minorities in the STEM workforce.        (8) Increased investment in STEM infrastructure at HBCUs,       TCUs, and MSIs has the potential to increase these       institutions' ability to educate even more students in the       STEM disciplines.        (9) With the demand for STEM skills exceeding the supply of       STEM graduates, success of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs in educating       and training science and engineering leaders is increasingly       important for United States economic growth and       competitiveness.       SEC. 3. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE REVIEW.         Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       report to Congress--        (1) an inventory of competitive funding programs and       initiatives carried out by Federal science agencies that are       targeted to HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs or partnerships with HBCUs,       TCUs, and MSIs;        (2) an assessment of Federal science agency outreach       activities to increase the participation and competitiveness       of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs in the funding programs and       initiatives identified in paragraph (1); and        (3) recommendations of the Comptroller General to increase       the participation of and the rate of success of HBCUs, TCUs,       and MSIs in competitive funding programs offered by Federal       science agencies.

(4) HBCU.--The term ``HBCU'' has the meaning given the term       ``part B institution'' in section 322 of the Higher Education       Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1061).        (5) Institution of higher education.--The term       ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given       such term in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965       (20 U.S.C. 1001).        (6) Minority serving institution.--The term ``minority       serving institution'' or ``MSI'' means Hispanic-Serving       Institutions as defined in section 502 of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1101a); Alaska Native       Serving Institutions and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions       as defined in section 317 of the Higher Education Act of 1965       (20 U.S.C. 1059d); and Predominantly Black Institutions,       Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving       Institutions, and Native American-Serving Nontribal       Institutions as defined in section 371 of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1067q(c)).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2027, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2027, the MSI STEM Achievement  Act.   The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how important scientists and  engineers are to helping us respond to crises and move toward a  brighter future.   Whether it is a deadly pandemic or the climate crisis, we need all of  our Nation's talent to help us understand the challenges and contribute  to solutions. We also need all of our Nation's talent to fill the high- skilled jobs of the future.   Our Nation's demographics are changing, and we are not keeping up in  diversifying our STEM workforce. Hispanics represent 18 percent of the  U.S. population, but only 9 percent of the bachelor's degrees in  mathematics and physics. And for Black students, STEM degree attainment  has either stagnated or declined since 1996.   The United States can rightly celebrate our great research  universities and the STEM talent they cultivate in their laboratories.  But these institutions represent a small fraction of the hundreds of  institutions across the Nation that graduate students with STEM  degrees, and an even smaller fraction in terms of the number of Black  and Hispanic students.   In 2018, the Academies released a report highlighting the outsized  contributions made by minority-serving institutions, or MSIs. These  institutions have a remarkable record of success in recruiting,  retaining, and graduating underrepresented minority students in STEM.  For example, HBCUs graduate 25 percent of all African-  [[Page H2400]]  American graduates with STEM degrees. Unfortunately, MSIs have  relatively insufficient resources and infrastructure.   The MSI STEM Achievement Act would make sure that education and  research opportunities are more accessible to STEM students at MSIs.  The legislation would require more transparency and accountability in  Federal science agency support for MSIs. The legislation directs the  National Science Foundation to support research on effective practices  at MSIs for recruiting and retaining minority students in STEM, and  offer strategies to build on and scale best practices.   It further directs NSF to support research and STEM education  capacity building at MSIs. The legislation also directs OSTP to develop  a strategic plan for increasing MSI participation and success in  competitive Federal research funding opportunities.   Supporting our country's minority-serving institutions through  targeted investments and outreach is essential to building our STEM  workforce for the future.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2027, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge all of my colleagues to  support the bipartisan MSI STEM Achievement Act, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2695) to provide for research to better understand the  causes and consequences of sexual harassment affecting individuals in  the scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics workforce and  to examine policies to reduce the prevalence and negative impact of  such harassment, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2695         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Combating       Sexual Harassment in Science Act''.        (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act       is as follows:  Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. Sec. 2. Findings. Sec. 3. Definitions. Sec. 4. Research grants. Sec. 5. Data collection. Sec. 6. Responsible conduct guide. Sec. 7. Interagency working group. Sec. 8. National academies assessment. Sec. 9. Authorization of appropriations.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) According to the report issued by the National       Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2018       entitled ``Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and       Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and       Medicine''--        (A) sexual harassment is pervasive in institutions of       higher education;        (B) the most common type of sexual harassment is gender       harassment, which includes verbal and nonverbal behaviors       that convey insulting, hostile, and degrading attitudes about       members of one gender;        (C) 58 percent of individuals in the academic workplace       experience sexual harassment, the second highest rate when       compared to the military, the private sector, and Federal,       State, and local government;        (D) women who are members of racial or ethnic minority       groups are more likely to experience sexual harassment and to       feel unsafe at work than White women, White men, or men who       are members of such groups;        (E) the training for each individual who has a doctor of       philosophy in the science, technology, engineering, and       mathematics fields is estimated to cost approximately       $500,000; and        (F) attrition of an individual so trained results in a loss       of talent and money.        (2) Sexual harassment undermines career advancement for       women.        (3) According to a 2017 University of Illinois study, among       astronomers and planetary scientists, 18 percent of women who       are members of racial or ethnic minority groups and 12       percent of White women skipped professional events because       they did not feel safe attending.        (4) Many women report leaving employment at institutions of       higher education due to sexual harassment.        (5) Research shows the majority of individuals do not       formally report experiences of sexual harassment due to a       justified fear of retaliation or other negative professional       or personal consequences.        (6) Reporting procedures with respect to such harassment       are inconsistent among Federal science agencies and have       varying degrees of accessibility.        (7) There is not adequate communication among Federal       science agencies and between such agencies and grantees       regarding reports of sexual harassment, which has resulted in       harassers receiving Federal funding after moving to a       different institution.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Academies.--The term ``Academies'' means the National       Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.        (2) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of       the National Science Foundation.        (3) Federal science agency.--The term ``Federal science       agency'' means any Federal agency with an annual extramural       research expenditure of over $100,000,000.        (4) Finding or determination.--The term ``finding or       determination'' means the final disposition of a matter       involving a violation of organizational policies and       processes, to include the exhaustion of permissible appeals,       or a conviction of a sexual offense in a criminal court of       law.        (5) Gender harassment.--The term ``gender harassment''       means verbal and nonverbal behaviors that convey hostility,       objectification, exclusion, or second-class status about       one's gender, gender identity, gender presentation, sexual       orientation, or pregnancy status.        (6) Grantee.--The term ``grantee'' means the legal entity       to which a grant is awarded and that is accountable to the       Federal Government for the use of the funds provided.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         There is authorized to be appropriated to the Director to       carry out this Act, $17,500,000.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 2695, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2695, the Combating  Sexual  [[Page H2403]]  Harassment in Science Act, which I am pleased to cosponsor.   In 2017, the Me Too movement sparked a national reckoning with the  pervasiveness of sexual harassment. The academic workplace has not been  spared. One study found that 58 percent of faculty and staff at  universities have experienced sexual harassment.   Sexual harassment is detrimental to individuals, often impeding  career advancement and leading some to leave academia entirely. Sexual  harassment also has significant consequences on the entire scientific  enterprise, depriving our most critical STEM fields of skilled  researchers, particularly from groups already underrepresented in STEM.   In 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Medicine released a report examining the contributing factors to sexual  harassment in academia and the effects on women in science, technology,  and medicine. The Combating Sexual Harassment in Science Act includes  key recommendations from the Academies' report and takes further steps  to combat sexual harassment in STEM.   The National Science Foundation and other agencies have already taken  significant steps to address the scourge of sexual harassment in STEM.  Unfortunately, not all agencies have taken this issue as seriously, and  the patchwork of policies and approaches causes confusion and increases  administrative burden on grantees. This legislation helps make sure  that we have consistent, governmentwide policies.   H.R. 2695 requires a coordinated approach to address sexual  harassment at grant-receiving institutions and across our Federal  agencies, including by requiring OSTP to issue uniform policy guidance  for sexual harassment reporting at Federal science agencies.   The bill also authorizes NSF research on the contributing factors to  STEM workplace harassment.   Finally, the bill would require an important follow-up study by the  National Academies.   The Combating Sexual Harassment in Science Act was developed  following extensive consultation with experts on sexual harassment and  key stakeholders, including universities. At present, 24 organizations  have endorsed this bill, representing a wide spectrum of scientific  disciplines, student groups, and professions.   I want to thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for  introducing this important bill. I also want to thank all of the  cosponsors of this bipartisan effort. I urge everyone here to help us  take action toward eliminating sexual harassment in the sciences.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2695, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I, once again, urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important and  bipartisan legislation, the Combating Sexual Harassment in Science Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
