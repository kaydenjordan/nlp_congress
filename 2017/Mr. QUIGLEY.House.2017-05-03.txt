 Mr. Speaker, today is World Press Freedom Day, a day  that deserves commemoration now more than ever.   Undermining the credibility of the free press and attempting to turn  the American people against the media is reminiscent of authoritarian  tactics, not the conduct of the leader of the free world. Yet the  President has referred to the press as the ``enemy of the people'' for  simply doing their job: reporting the facts and holding all of us  accountable.   He has also dismissed distinguished publications as fake news, again,  for simply doing their job and has threatened to change libel laws that  will weaken the First Amendment, making it easier for him to attack and  sue the press.   This antagonistic relationship between the President and the press is  not only beneath the dignity of the office, it is also dangerous for  our democracy. We have seen strongmen and autocratic countries suppress  the media through intimidation and by discrediting the integrity of the  very institution of journalism.   It is hard to believe that I have to say this in this country at this  point in our history, but as Thomas Jefferson said: ``Our liberty  cannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press, nor that be limited  without danger of losing it.''   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Harper). Members are reminded to refrain  from engaging in personalities toward the President.                            ____________________
