 Mr. Speaker, California has been blessed with a lot of  rain this year, a lot of snowfall in order to alleviate a drought. It  has gone a little extreme here, but we are still thankful for the  water.   I would like to report that Lake Oroville is stable right now with  the dam, and the spillway situation is such that they are working very  hard to make sure that that will be something, if we get continued  rainfall, we will be able to handle the new load.   I also want to commend and thank President Trump for his very rapid  reaction to our request for emergency help from the Federal Government  on Oroville Dam. His team responded very quickly to our ask, and he  understands and is working for infrastructure needs and repairs across  this whole country.   He also understands that it isn't just about building new things, but  it is going back and repairing our aging infrastructure, whether that  is our highways, our bridges, or what needs to be done, like on  Oroville Dam spillway. So I appreciate that.   Again, my full thanks to President Trump's staff, as well as the  President himself, on his speedy response to our need.                            ____________________
