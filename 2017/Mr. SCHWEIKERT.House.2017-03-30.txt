 Mr. Speaker, have you ever had that deja vu all over  again? Haven't we been doing this one since, what, 2013, 2014?   I accept I have been off the committee now for 4 years; yet we are  talking past each other. I hear the gentlewoman and some of the others  say things. It is a 12-page bill. It hasn't changed that much in the  last couple Congresses.   How many of us would like to go back to the 2013 inspector general  report that basically suggested going this direction because of the  conflicts in these advisory committees?                                time  0945    If you really, once again--and this is sort of similar to yesterday's  discussion--if you really care about the environment, then you really  care about the data and the information and sort of the ethics and  honesty of those who are both reviewing the data and giving you advice.   So what happens when the inspector general of the EPA hands you a  report and says: These committees, these advisory councils are rife  with conflicts? People who are on these advisory boards are making  money.   Now, accept much of what we do here in Washington, D.C., if not  almost all of it, is about the cash, and it is one of the ugly secrets  that is not a secret, but we all pretend. It is always about the money.   Let's try something novel. Let's actually--this was an inspector  general's report under the Obama administration. Why wouldn't we step  up and respect it? It was very simple.   Hey, we need some more diversity on these advisory boards. And  wouldn't it be wonderful if we had people advising us on air quality  policy in non-attainment areas, or in regional interests that also  weren't selling products, selling reports, making money off data with  the EPA?   I mean, if it was reversed, if it was some other agency, if this same  set of ethical lapses was reversed, I believe the left would be  apoplectic. But the fact of the matter is that so many of these  individual organizations that are represented on these advisory boards,  that are making money from the EPA, even though they are advising in  their own behalf, happen to be friends of the left. That makes it okay.   The ethical standards are the ethical standards. I have no concept  how the left can oppose the concept of structured diversity.   Why shouldn't those of us from the Southwest, where substantial  portions  [[Page H2572]]  of my State are Native American, have a voice? Why should we allow  people on these advisory committees who, once again, are selling  products, selling data, making a living, making money, one step away  from the very work they are advising on?   It is a 12-page bill. It is not that complicated. I will make the  argument that it makes our air, our water, the things around us safer,  better, healthier, and it makes the way we get there sounder and more  ethical, and we remove conflicts that right now taint the very  decisions that are coming out of these advisory boards.
