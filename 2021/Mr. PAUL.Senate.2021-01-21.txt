 Madam President, the Director of National Intelligence must  demonstrate commitment to restraining the vast power of our  intelligence agencies. They should not view themselves as an enabler or  facilitator of  [[Page S89]]  agencies that already operate without public scrutiny. We do not need  another Washington insider in this position, someone who will go along  to get along, helping to further the expansion of secret government  powers.   What we need is someone who is a skeptic of these powers. After years  of revelations of government spying on Americans and the exposure of  the unconstitutional applications of these powers, I had hoped that the  President would submit a nominee that understands the importance of  regaining the public's trust, to pledge transparency and  accountability.   The President's nominee, Avril Haines, does not meet that profile.  She played a key role in formulating the government's legal authority  to conduct summary executions by drone and was reportedly summoned in  the middle of the night to approve lethal drone strikes. As Deputy  Director of the CIA, she declined to punish any of the CIA employees  who spied on the Senate as it was investigating the CIA's torture  programs. Her record is that of an insider, someone who will defend the  broken status quo. I will not support more of the same unconstitutional  policies, and I oppose her confirmation.                            ____________________
