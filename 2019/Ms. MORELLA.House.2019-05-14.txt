 This is beautiful. What a tome. This is great. Thank  you.   I want to thank you very much, President Frost. You reminded me of  something Mae West had said: Too much of a good thing can be downright  enjoyable.   I enjoyed it, but you could have gone on even further, although you  did exceed the time limit.   Thank you very much for the laudatory and generous remarks. I want to  thank you, also, for your leadership in the organization. You are a guy  who has your eye on the objective, on the prize, and you work  unrelentingly until you succeed. And you do succeed. You never retreat.   My special thanks and appreciation to the Association of Former  Members of Congress, to the board, to my colleague Members. What an  outstanding group whose action promotes dialogue, bipartisanship, and  service.   I am very moved and humbled by this great honor, especially because  it comes from my dear friends and colleagues. There is nothing higher  than getting an award from your peers, it means a great deal. And it  means a great deal to me, because it is from people who have served,  many with me, very well in the people's House.   I reflect with awe on the list of previous recipients. Some of them  were mentioned by President Frost: Bob Michel, Lee Hamilton, Lindy  Boggs, Amo Houghton, Ray LaHood, and others. Incredible company, people  I have respected and admired. And I accept the honor for all of you. I  want to thank you for your continuous passion for the people's House  and for your friendship.   I am a lucky, happy camper. I am the daughter of immigrant parents. I  am the first in my family to go to college. I can boast of a wonderful  family. I have been able to serve, as was mentioned, in my State, my  country, here and overseas, and to work with dedicated people, Members  of Congress and former Members who are seeking solutions.    I firmly believe that everyone who seeks office is motivated by a  passionate desire to serve, a reason that would make things better for  all. For me, as was suggested, it was the women's movement that put the  movement into me. I was appointed to a commission for women in  Montgomery County in the seventies, and at that time a Member of  Congress, Martha Griffiths, introduced--not the first time--the Equal  Rights Amendment. She got it passed through a draft resolution.   The discharge petition, remember that?   She passed it. It went through the Senate, signed by the President.   But amendment was needed to approve it to become part of the  Constitution. So I started lobbying for Maryland to pass the amendment,  and, as you know, we needed 38 States. That was when I realized the  inequities, the inequities in education, credit, education. I then  decided I wanted to seek office in the Maryland Legislature to have a  seat at the table.   So, after 8 years serving in the Maryland House of Delegates, I was  elected to Congress, the 100th Congress, with many people who still  serve, like Nancy Pelosi,   John Lewis, Fred Upton, and many others who  serve and many who are former Members, some who are here today, Dave  Skaggs, Amo Houghton, Ernie Konnyu.   I served in the House for 16 years: For 8 years, I was a minority in  the minority; for 8 years, I was a minority in the majority. I  represented a highly competitive district, as you all know, and as  Charlie Cook once said: That Morella, she knows her district. She will  go ``to the opening of an envelope.''   And indeed, I did; it is true. That is still being done, but,  unfortunately, more time is being spent raising money. And I must add  something else that usurps time, and that is social media.   Well, it was an active time. We broke barriers as in women's health  research, violence against women, the Americans with Disabilities Act,  and we created opportunities in technology, in STEM. We witnessed the  fall of the Berlin Wall, the Soviet Union, apartheid in South Africa,  but also 9/11.   We also witnessed bipartisanship, working together, seeking  compromise to get results. We respected differences, whether party  label or constituencies, and we got things done.   Indeed, when I would introduce a measure, I would gather together  Democrats to sign on as sponsors, and the Democrats would do the same  thing with me for sponsorship. And why? Bipartisanship got results. In  fact, it is the only way to get desired results, and you establish  trust with your constituents.   It also strengthened the bond of friendship. And there were many  friendships from Members of Congress while I was there and many  friendships with my former Member colleagues.   My hope is that Congress Members will reach out across the aisle to  know each other personally. They will learn of their colleagues'  aspirations, their family, their issues, and, most often, become  friends.   The greatest tool of the diplomat, wherever and in whatever, is to  listen, to learn, and to lead. They will learn the greatest tool is  that. This is the path to forging compromises for our country and to  appreciating and respecting each other.   These ingredients, friends, haven't changed, as you know full well.  George Washington, when he was age 15, wrote ``Rules for Civility and  Decent Behavior.'' Rule number one:         When in the company of others, act with respect for those       who are present.    You can't beat that advice. I am a confirmed political junky. I agree  with W.B. Yeats, who wrote:         I was here to wind the clock. I want to hear it strike.    I agree and I care. And again, my thanks to all of you, my heartfelt  thanks. I have to quote Shakespeare, don't I?         For these great graces heap'd upon me, I can nothing render       but allegiant thanks.     Very good. Thank you very much.
