 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on behalf  of myself, Senators McCaskill--McSally, rather--Lankford--it was a  terrifying moment--on behalf of myself, Senator McSally, Senator  Lankford, Senator Gardner, Senator Capito, and Senator Wicker. This is  a question for the President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Blunt and other Senators is for the counsel  for the President:         What does the supermajority threshold for conviction in the       Senate, created by the Framers, say about the type of case       that should be brought by the House and the standard of proof       that should be considered in the Senate?    Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, there were  several debates among the Framers, of course: Should you have  impeachment at all? We talked about that--what the criteria for  impeachment should be. But then there was another debate: Who should  have the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether the President  should be removed?   James Madison suggested the Supreme Court of the United States as a  completely nonpartisan institution.   Alexander Hamilton was concerned about that issue, as well, but he  said the Supreme Court would be inappropriate because the judicial  branch should not become involved directly as a branch--OK to preside  over the trial--because ultimately an impeached President can be put on  trial for crimes if he committed crimes.   And Hamilton said that if he were to be put on trial, he would then  be put on trial in front of the same institution--the judiciary--that  had already impeached him, and they might have a predisposition.   So in the course of the debate, it was finally resolved that the  Senate, which was a very different institution back at the founding-- obviously, Senators were not directly elected; they were appointed by  the legislature. They were supposed to serve as an institution that  checked on the House of Representatives--more mature, more sober,  elected for longer periods of time, with an eye to the future, not so  concerned about pleasing the popular masses.   Remember, the Framers were very concerned about democracy. Nobody  ever called the United States a democracy--``a Republic, if you can  keep it,'' not a democracy--very great concern about that.   And then, when it came time to assign it to the Senate, there was  discussion about what the criteria and what the--obviously--vote should  be. The selection of a two-thirds supermajority was plainly designed-- plainly designed--to avoid partisan impeachments, plainly designed to  effectuate the very wise philosophy espoused by the Congressman and the  Senator during the Clinton campaign; that is, during the Clinton  impeachment.    Never ever have an impeachment or removal that is partisan. Always  demand that it be a widespread consensus, a widespread national  agreement, and bipartisan support. What better way of assuring  bipartisan support than requiring a two-thirds vote because almost in  every instance, in order to get a two-thirds vote, you need Members of  both parties.   The Johnson case was a perfect example. In order to get that vote,  you needed not only the party that was behind the impeachment, but you  needed people from the other side as well, and when seven Republicans  dissented based, I believe, largely on the arguments of Justice Curtis  and others--arguments I paraphrased here the other day--it lost by  merely one vote. The Clinton impeachment, if you remember correctly,  achieved a 50/50 split. Am I right about that? I think I am right about  that. And it only lost--and it could have been 51-to-49. It wouldn't  have been enough.   So I think it is plain that not only does the two-thirds requirement  serve as a check on the House, but I think it sends a message to every  Senator. It sends a message even to those Senators who would be in the  one-third to reconsider because if you are voting for a partisan  impeachment, you are violating the spirit of the two-thirds  requirement.   There are many institutions where at the end of the day--for example,  political conventions--they seek a unanimous vote just to show unity. I  would urge some Senators who favor impeachment to look at the two- thirds and say: If there is not going to be a two-thirds, there  shouldn't be an impeachment, and therefore, we are going to vote  against impeachment even though we might think that the criteria for  impeachment has been satisfied.   Do not vote for impeachment, do not vote for removal, unless you  think the criteria articulated by the Senator and the Congressman and,  I believe, by the Constitution and by Hamilton are met, namely,  bipartisan, almost universal concern by the United States of America.  That criteria is not met, and the two-thirds requirement really  illustrates the importance the Framers gave to that criteria.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Connecticut.
