 Mr. Speaker, November is National Adoption Month, and I  rise in celebration of all the families created and strengthened  through the selfless act of adoption.   Adoption has united countless children with loving, caring parents,  and every child deserves to grow up in a safe home. Many children have  had their lives significantly improved by adoptive parents seeking to  raise them as their own.   Adoption is a powerful act, Mr. Speaker, and devoted parents are  essential to any child's development and success.   My wife, Kelly, was a widow when we married. Soon after, I adopted  her daughter, Isabel, and she is wonderful, Mr. Speaker, just like her  mama. Being a father has been one of the greatest joys of my life, and  I will ever be thankful to both Kelly and Isabel for letting me be a  part of their family.   I am proud to stand on the floor of the House of Representatives, Mr.  Speaker, today to honor all the families, including my own, that have  gone through the adoption process. Folks adopt children for any number  of reasons, but above all else, they do it out of love. I am the  luckiest human on the face of the Earth, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
