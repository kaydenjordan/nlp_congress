 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from New York, the Honorable Chris Jacobs, be permitted to take the  oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Madam Speaker, it is my honor, on behalf of the New York  Congressional delegation, as the co-dean along with Chairman Eliot  Engel, to welcome our newest member, Chris Jacobs. Or perhaps I should  say welcome him back, since Mr. Jacobs began his career just out of  college working for New York Congressman Jack Kemp.   After returning home to western New York, he has pursued various  professional paths, including public service. He began an education  charity and his own small business, Avalon Development.   Mr. Jacobs served as the Erie County Clerk and most recently was a  member of the New York State Senate since 2017.   I congratulate Congressman Jacobs and look forward to working with  him at this critical time to deliver for our home State of New York in  the coming months.   I also welcome his family here today, including his wife, Martina,  and beautiful young daughter, Anna.   Madam Speaker, at this time I am pleased to yield to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. King).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield to our newest Member  of Congress, Congressman Chris Jacobs.
