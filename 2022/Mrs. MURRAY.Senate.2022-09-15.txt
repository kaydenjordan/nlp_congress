 Madam President, I rise today to recognize and honor the  life of Jodie Fingland, a dedicated public servant who passed away on  September 4 after battling a long illness.   Jodie devoted her life's work to expanding educational opportunities  for students across the country, and she will be remembered for her  wonderful, caring personality. I join my staff and so many others who  had the privilege of knowing and working with Jodie through her  tireless work at the Department of Education in mourning her passing  and remembering her life.   Over the years, Jodie held many different positions at the Department  of Education in the Obama administration. She served as chief of staff,  deputy assistant secretary, and principal adviser for legislative  affairs all in the Office for Legislation and Congressional Affairs,  and worked closely with the Senate and House in these roles.   Whether briefing Members of Congress, preparing the Secretary for a  committee hearing, or providing strategic advice to senior managers at  the Department, Jodie was known for being kind, calm, and extremely  knowledgeable. She was particularly known for her skill in higher  education policy.   Jodie dedicated her career to the advancement and improvement of  education for all, and her work impacted so many students, educators,  and families across the country. She will be remembered fondly.                            ____________________
