(Mr. SCHATZ assumed the Chair.)                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are  necessarily absent.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I have discussed the matter which Senator  Lee brings to the floor for consideration, and I thank him for  accommodating me by allowing me to object at the beginning rather than  at the end of his remarks. And I will say that it relates to a  commemorative resolution which he wanted to offer. I came to learn as  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that we have rules and  standards by which we allow these commemorative resolutions to be  considered.   I have given Senator Lee a copy of that policy--the committee  policy--and I would like to ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to  have it printed in the Record at this point.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:        Committee Policy for Consideration of Commemorative Measures         The following conditions shall govern the consideration of       holiday and commemorative legislation by the Senate Committee       on the Judiciary.        1. The measure must be bipartisan. At least one Republican       and one Democrat must support the measure.        A. If the measure is specific to a particular state, the       bipartisan requirement may be waived--provided that both home       state Senators support the measure.        2. No measure may commemorate:        A. A commercial enterprise, industry, specific product, or       fraternal, political business, labor or sectarian       organization;        B. A particular state or any political subdivision thereof,       city, town, county, school or institution of higher learning,       except for the purpose of recognizing a significant       anniversary or achievement; or        C. A living person.        3. Committee policy and committee jurisdiction will not       ordinarily be waived.        4. Committee policy will provide for an annual       commemoration, in each of two years, provided:        A. Such proposal is introduced during the first session of       a congress;        B. A substantially similar proposal has been passed by the       Senate with respect to each of the four years immediately       preceding the first year of the proposed commemoration;        C. The commemorative periods proposed would occur during       the Congress in which the resolution is introduced.        5. No measure may direct or otherwise request or encourage       the President of the United States to take action with       respect to the holiday or commemoration.        6. Written committee reports will not be filed regarding       this type of legislation.        7. The committee will not consider requests to waive any of       the above requirements unless two-thirds of the members       indicate a desire to do so.    Let me say further, he, as I understand it, is going to  be trying to offer, despite my objection, a resolution commemorating  the 50th anniversary of the Heritage Foundation.   The fact that I am applying the Committee Rules is no reflection on  that organization whatsoever. But I do want to make it clear that under  those rules, I have to object at this point.    Madam President, there is a grave threat to America's  future lurking online. Big Tech giants and other online platforms are  working every day to capture the minds of our children in order to pad  their profits.   Toddlers, before they can walk or barely talk, have learned to reach  out and touch that bright little screen. Mothers and fathers on car  rides and plane trips trust that little screen will buy them quiet  time. Captivated, mesmerized, even hypnotized, the screen experience  continues. And unless parents are very careful, it can go from bad to  worse. It starts with music and games, which many of the parents find  harmless. As the child grows up and graduates to a cell phone, there is  an opportunity to move to a new level of information and communication.   Let's face it, even the most caring, conscientious parent struggles  to keep up with all the apps and options. And the producers of these  online experiences are determined to work on the brains of these  children, capture their  [[Page S1258]]  little customers in the process, and pad their profits.   So who is protecting our kids from internet profiteers and predators?  I am sorry to say, almost no one. In fact, our laws are written to  protect the predators, not the kids.   Clearly, every child can benefit from a safe online experience. They  can make friends, expand their knowledge, learn skills. But social  media, we all know, has a dangerous dark side. Innocent children are  lured into online environments and powerful algorithms working to keep  them there. Unsuspecting kids can be sexually exploited and their  childhood images captured forever by predators and profit-taking  abusers.   Drug pushers no longer search for playgrounds to sell deadly  narcotics. Two clicks on the internet bring them their new young  customers. Many children are bullied and harassed online or pressured  into dangerous, deadly behavior.   Rose Bronstein is a mother from Chicago. She knows how cruel and  dangerous the online world can be. Rose's son Nate was a 10th grader at  a private school when he started being taunted by classmates using  texts and Snapchat. The bullying of her son was vicious, and it  included messages urging Nate to kill himself. Nate died by suicide at  the age of 15.   We have known for years about the online dangers to children's  privacy and safety. We have talked a lot about them. We have even held  hearings in Congress about them. Journalists have written so many  articles about the dangers, but the problem has only grown worse.   Research into exactly how social media use affects children is still  in its early stage, largely because of Big Tech's failure to adequately  monitor, report, and prevent violation of children's online privacy and  safety. But a picture is emerging, and it is alarming.   This chart tells a story. The gold line you see here shows the amount  of time teenagers spend scrolling through social media and watching  online videos. According to Common Sense, a group that tracks media use  by young kids and teens, kids spend an average of nearly 3 hours a day  on sites like Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube. That is a  nearly 60-percent increase in the last 6 years.   This white line shows that an increase in teens' use of social media  has been accompanied by a sharp spike in teen depression. According to  the CDC, between 2013 and 2021, the percentage of teens who reported  persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness shot up 42 percent-- between 2013 and 2021.   The blue line shows what happens with girls' mental health. Today,  nearly one in three girls in America say they have seriously considered  suicide. That is a 34-percent spike in the past decade.   We have given tech companies nearly three decades to police  themselves. They have failed miserably, and our children are paying the  price. Our teenagers are in a mental health crisis.   Congress must impose stronger, enforceable online protections for  kids. Our children are not commodities, and we can't continue to expect  parents and victims alone to stand up to Big Tech with few ways to hold  tech companies accountable.   Two months ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, held a  hearing on online threats to children's safety. We heard powerful  testimony from those working to increase children's privacy and safety  online. They included law enforcement, the National Center for Missing  & Exploited Children, the American Psychological Association, and the  child internet safety advocacy organization known as Fairplay.   We also heard from victims. The stories were frightening, frightening  to every parent and every grandparent, and heartbreaking.   Charlotte--and I am using a pseudonym here--didn't attend the  hearing, but she has allowed me to tell her story in the hope that it  may help others who have been victimized online, as she has been, by  sexual predators.   Charlotte was 16 years old when she first visited a social media site  that a friend told her about. It sounded so exciting, she said, a place  where she could meet people from all over the world. I won't use the  name of the site, but you would recognize it immediately. It is used by  tens of millions of people every single day.   Among the people Charlotte met online was a man who showered her with  attention and compliments, gained her trust, and eventually enticed  Charlotte into performing sex acts for him over the webcam and sending  explicit videos to him.   Maybe that sounds shocking to you, but be prepared. Research shows  that over one-third of teenagers today believe that it is normal to  share the same sorts of images and videos that Charlotte shared  online--one-third.   She was still in high school when the online harassment began. First  came anonymous emails, then a phone call to her parents' house calling  her vile names. Eventually, the images she shared with that man she  thought was a friend would be posted on more than 100 websites across  the world, often with her name and identifiable information included.   Charlotte filed her first of six police reports about the images when  she reached the age of 18. Eventually, she, her mother, her boyfriend,  and child safety groups would file hundreds of reports with social  media providers around the world trying to get these horrible images  taken down, often to no avail.   While she was in college studying to be a teacher--her lifelong  dream--the images were posted again, along with her name and the name  of her college. When the university found out about it, it canceled her  student teaching placement and threatened to withhold her degree.   She was a teacher of special education at a middle school when one of  her students saw the images again online. Charlotte told her principal.  She was fired a few days later.   Again and again, it was Charlotte who was blamed, not the abusers who  tormented her online. Over the years, Charlotte tried three times to  take her own life. It has now been 14 years since she met that predator  online, but the images continue to circulate again and again. The abuse  never stops, and Charlotte says she doubts she will ever feel safe  again.   This Senate can help Charlotte and countless other young people who  are sexually abused online each year by passing a bill that I am  introducing today. It is called the Stop CSAM Act. CSAM, C-S-A-M,  stands for ``child sexual abuse material.'' Federal law still uses the  old term--``pornography,'' ``child pornography''--but that is  misleading because pornography implies consent, and children under the  age of 18 cannot legally consent to the creation or sharing of sexually  explicit images of themselves.   So these images are, by definition, evidence of a crime. Yet, under  current law, it is extremely difficult to bring lawsuits against tech  companies that allow child sexual abuse materials to be posted on their  websites.   How can this be, you ask? Here is how. The Communications Decency Act  of 1996--remember that year--contains a section, section 230, that  offers near-total immunity to Big Tech. As a result, victims like  Charlotte have no way to force tech companies to remove content posted  on their sites--not even these child sexual abuse horrible images.   My bill, the Stop CSAM Act, is going to change that. It would protect  victims and promote accountability within the tech industry. Companies  that fail to remove CSAM and related imagery after being notified about  them would face significant fines. They would also be required to  produce annual reports detailing their efforts to keep children safe  from online sex predators, and any company that promotes or facilitates  online child exploitation could face new criminal and civil penalties.   When section 230 was created in 1996, Mark Zuckerberg was in the  sixth grade. Facebook and social media sites didn't even exist. It is  time that we rewrite the law to reflect the reality of today's world.   A bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Graham and Blumenthal would  also help to do that. It is called the EARN IT Act, and it would let  CSAM victims--these child sexual abuse victims--have their day in court  by amending section 230 to eliminate Big Tech's near-total immunity  from liability and responsibility.   When we learned two decades ago that Big Tobacco was lying about  their  [[Page S1259]]  efforts to hook kids on smoking, Congress took action to establish  reasonable guardrails to protect public health, and the courts held Big  Tobacco accountable for the damage and death it had caused.   Now, Big Tech is using the same playbook in order to profit by  hooking America's kids on its dangerous products. It is time to hold  them accountable just as we did with Big Tobacco.   I will close with one more story from our committee hearing. Kristin  Bride is a mother from Oregon. After being bullied relentlessly by  supposed friends using Snapchat and anonymous messaging apps, Kristin's  16-year-old son Carson hanged himself in his family's garage. After his  death, Kristin discovered the online taunts they had been throwing at  her son. She sued the anonymous messaging apps in California State  court for failing to enforce even their own safety standard.   The court dismissed the lawsuit, and what did they cite? Section 230,  our law from 1996.   As Kristin told our committee, ``It shouldn't take grieving parents  filing lawsuits to hold the industry accountable for their dangerous  and addictive product design.''   We have the bipartisan support in the Senate to protect our children  and grandchildren online. It is time that we use it.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1199         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 7. REPORTING AND REMOVAL OF PROSCRIBED VISUAL DEPICTIONS                     RELATING TO CHILDREN; ESTABLISHMENT OF CHILD                     ONLINE PROTECTION BOARD.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Over 40 years ago, the Supreme Court of the United       States ruled in New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982), that       child sexual abuse material (referred to in this subsection       as ``CSAM'') is a ``category of material outside the       protections of the First Amendment.'' The Court emphasized       that children depicted in CSAM are harmed twice: first       through the abuse and exploitation inherent in the creation       of the materials, and then through the continued circulation       of the imagery, which inflicts its own emotional and       psychological injury.        (2) The Supreme Court reiterated this point 9 years ago in       Paroline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434 (2014), when it       explained that CSAM victims suffer ``continuing and grievous       harm as a result of [their] knowledge that a large,       indeterminate number of individuals have viewed and will in       the future view images of the sexual abuse [they] endured.''        (3) In these decisions, the Supreme Court noted that the       distribution of child sexual abuse material invades the       privacy interests of the victims.        (4) The co-mingling online of CSAM with other, non-explicit       depictions of the victims links the victim's identity with       the images of their abuse. This further invades a victim's       privacy and disrupts their sense of security, thwarting what       the Supreme Court has described as ``the individual interest       in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.''        (5) The internet is awash with child sexual abuse material.       In 2021, the CyberTipline, operated by the National Center       for Missing & Exploited Children to combat online child       sexual exploitation, received reports about 39,900,000 images       and 44,800,000 videos depicting child sexual abuse.        (6) Since 2017, Project Arachnid, operated by the Canadian       Centre for Child Protection, has sent over 26,000,000 notices       to online providers about CSAM and other exploitive material       found on their platforms. According to the Canadian Centre,       some providers are slow to remove the material, or take it       down only for it to be reposted again a short time later.        (7) This legislation is needed to create an easy-to-use and       effective procedure to get CSAM and harmful related imagery       quickly taken offline and kept offline to protect children,       stop the spread of illegal and harmful content, and thwart       the continued invasion of the victims' privacy.        (b) Implementation.--        (1) Implementation.--Except as provided in paragraph (2),       not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Child Online Protection Board established under       subsection (d), shall begin operations, at which point       providers shall begin receiving notifications as set forth in       subsection (c)(2).        (2) Extension.--The Commission may extend the deadline       under paragraph (1) by not more than 180 days if the       Commission provides notice of the extension to the public and       to Congress.        (c) Reporting and Removal of Proscribed Visual Depictions       Relating to Children.--        (1) In general.--If a provider receives a complete       notification as set forth in paragraph (2)(A) that the       provider is hosting a proscribed visual depiction relating to       a child, not later than 48 hours after such notification is       received by the provider (or, in the case of a small       provider, not later than 2 business days after such       notification is received by the small provider) the provider       shall--        (A)(i) remove the proscribed visual depiction relating to a       child; and        (ii) notify the complainant that it has done so; or        (B) notify the complainant that the provider--        (i) is unable to remove the proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child using reasonable means; or        (ii) has determined that the notification is duplicative       under paragraph (2)(C)(i).        (2) Notification requirements.--        (A) In general.--To be complete under this subsection, a       notification must be a written communication to the       designated reporting system of the provider (or, if the       provider does not have a designated reporting system, a       written communication that is served on the provider in       accordance with subparagraph (F)) that includes the       following:        (i) An identification of, and information reasonably       sufficient to permit the provider to locate, the alleged       proscribed visual depiction relating to a child. Such       information may include, at the option of the complainant, a       copy of the alleged proscribed visual depiction relating to a       child or the uniform resource locator where such proscribed       visual depiction is located.        (ii) The complainant's name and contact information, to       include a mailing address, telephone number, and an       electronic mail address, except that, if the complainant is       the victim depicted in the alleged proscribed visual       depiction relating to a child, the complainant may elect to       use an alias, including for purposes of the signed statement       described in clause (v), and omit a mailing address.        (iii) If applicable, a statement indicating that the       complainant has previously notified the provider about the       alleged proscribed visual depiction relating to a child which       may, at the option of the complainant, include a copy of the       previous notification.        (iv) A statement indicating that the complainant has a good       faith belief that the information in the notification is       accurate.        (v) A signed statement under penalty of perjury indicating       that the notification is submitted by--         (I) the victim depicted in the alleged proscribed visual       depiction relating to a child;        (II) an authorized representative of the victim depicted in       the alleged proscribed visual depiction relating to a child;       or        (III) a qualified organization.         (B) Inclusion of multiple visual depictions in same       notification.--A notification may contain information about       more than one proscribed visual depiction relating to a       child, but shall only be effective with respect to each       proscribed visual depiction relating to a child included in       the notification to the extent that the notification includes       sufficient information to identify and locate such visual       depiction.        (C) Limitation on duplicative notifications.--        (i) In general.--After a complainant has submitted a       notification to a provider, the complainant may submit       additional notifications at any time only if the subsequent       notifications involve--         (I) a different proscribed visual depiction relating to a       minor;        (II) the same proscribed visual depiction relating to a       minor that is in a different location; or        (III) recidivist hosting.         (ii) No obligation.--A provider who receives any additional       notifications that do not comply with clause (i) shall not be       required to take any additional action except--         (I) as may be required with respect to the original       notification; and        (II) to notify the complainant as provided in paragraph       (1)(B)(ii).         (D) Incomplete or misdirected notification.--        (i) Requirement to contact complainant regarding       insufficient information.--         (I) Requirement to contact complainant.--If a notification       that is submitted to a provider under this subsection does       not contain sufficient information under subparagraph (A)(i)       to identify or locate the visual depiction that is the       subject of the notification but does contain the complainant       contact information described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the       provider shall, not later than 48 hours after receiving the       notification (or, in the case of a small provider, not later       than 2 business days after such notification is received by       the small provider), contact the complainant via electronic       email address to obtain such information.        (II) Effect of complainant providing sufficient       information.--If the provider is able to contact the       complainant and obtain sufficient information to identify or       locate the visual depiction that is the subject of the       notification, the provider shall then proceed as set forth in       paragraph (1), except that the applicable timeframes       described in such paragraph shall commence on the day the       provider receives the information needed to identify or       locate the visual depiction.        (III) Effect of complainant inability to provide sufficient       information.--If the provider is able to contact the       complainant but does not obtain sufficient information to       identify or locate the visual depiction that is the subject       of the notification, the provider shall so notify the       complainant not later than 48 hours after the provider       determines that it is unable to identify or locate the visual       depiction (or, in the case of a small provider, not later       than 2 business days after the small provider makes such       determination), after which no further action by the provider       is required and receipt of the notification shall not be       considered in determining whether the provider has actual       knowledge of any information described in the notification.  [[Page S1266]]         (IV) Effect of complainant failure to respond.--If the       complainant does not respond to the provider's attempt to       contact the complainant under this clause within 14 days of       such attempt, no further action by the provider is required       and receipt of the notification shall not be considered in       determining whether the provider has actual knowledge of any       information described in the notification.         (ii) Treatment of incomplete notification where complainant       cannot be contacted.--If a notification that is submitted to       a provider under this subsection does not contain sufficient       information under subparagraph (A)(i) to identify or locate       the visual depiction that is the subject of the notification       and does not contain the complainant contact information       described in subparagraph (A)(ii) (or if the provider is       unable to contact the complainant using such information), no       further action by the provider is required and receipt of the       notification shall not be considered in determining whether       the provider has actual knowledge of any information       described in the notification.        (iii) Treatment of notification not submitted to designated       reporting system.--If a provider has a designated reporting       system, and a complainant submits a notification under this       subsection to the provider without using such system, the       provider shall not be considered to have received the       notification.        (E) Option to contact complainant regarding the proscribed       visual depiction involving a minor.--        (i) Contact with complainant.--If the provider believes       that the proscribed visual depiction involving a minor       referenced in the notification does not meet the definition       of such term as provided in subsection (r)(10), the provider       may, not later than 48 hours after receiving the notification       (or, in the case of a small provider, not later than 2       business days after such notification is received by the       small provider), contact the complainant via electronic mail       address to so indicate.        (ii) Failure to respond.--If the complainant does not       respond to the provider within 14 days after receiving the       notification, no further action by the provider is required       and receipt of the notification shall not be considered in       determining whether the provider has actual knowledge of any       information described in the notification.        (iii) Complainant response.--If the complainant responds to       the provider within 14 days after receiving the notification,       the provider shall then proceed as set forth in paragraph       (1), except that the applicable timeframes described in such       paragraph shall commence on the day the provider receives the       complainant's response.        (F) Service of notification where provider has no       designated reporting system; process where complainant cannot       serve provider.--        (i) No designated reporting system.--If a provider does not       have a designated reporting system, a complainant may serve       the provider with a notification under this subsection to the       provider in the same manner that petitions are required to be       served under subsection (g)(4).        (ii) Complainant cannot serve provider.--If a provider does       not have a designated reporting system and a complainant       cannot reasonably serve the provider with a notification as       described in clause (i), the complainant may bring a petition       under subsection (g)(1) without serving the provider with the       notification.        (G) Recidivist hosting.--If a provider engages in       recidivist hosting of a proscribed visual depiction relating       to a child, in addition to any action taken under this       section, a complainant may submit a report concerning such       recidivist hosting to the CyberTipline operated by the       National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or any       successor to the CyberTipline operated by the National Center       for Missing and Exploited Children.        (H) Preservation.--A provider that receives a complete       notification under this subsection shall preserve the       information in such notification in accordance with the       requirements of sections 2713 and 2258A(h) of title 18,       United States Code. For purposes of this subparagraph, the       period for which providers shall be required to preserve       information in accordance with such section 2258A(h) may be       extended in 90 day increments on written request by the       complainant or order of the Board.        (I) Non-disclosure.--Except as otherwise provided in       subsection (g)(19)(C), for 180 days following receipt of a       notification under this subsection, a provider may not       disclose the existence of the notification to any person or       entity except to an attorney for purposes of obtaining legal       advice, the Board, the Commission, a law enforcement agency       described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of section       2258A(g)(3) of title 18, United States Code, the National       Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or as necessary to       respond to legal process.

(7) Opt-out procedure.--Within 1 week of completion of       service of the petition under paragraph (4), 1 or more       Officers of the Board shall hold a conference to explain that       the responding party has a right to opt out of the proceeding       before the Board, and describe the consequences of opting out       and not opting out as described in paragraph (6). A       responding party shall have a period of 30 days, beginning on       the date of conference, in which to provide written notice of       such choice to the petitioning party and the Child Online       Protection Board. If the responding party does not submit an       opt-out notice to the Child Online Protection Board within       that 30-day period, the proceeding shall be deemed an active       proceeding and the responding party shall be bound by the       determination in the proceeding. If the responding party opts       out of the proceeding during that 30-day period, the       proceeding shall be dismissed without prejudice.        (8) Scheduling.--Upon receipt of a complete petition and at       the conclusion of the opt out procedure described in       paragraph (7), the Board shall issue a schedule for the       future conduct of the proceeding. A schedule issued by the       Board may be amended by the Board in the interests of       justice.        (9) Conferences.--One or more Officers of the Board may       hold a conference to address case management or discovery       issues in a proceeding, which shall be noted upon the record       of the proceeding and may be recorded or transcribed.        (10) Party submissions.--A proceeding of the Board may not       include any formal motion practice, except that, subject to       applicable regulations and procedures of the Board--        (A) the parties to the proceeding and an interested owner       may make requests to the Board to address case management and       discovery matters, and submit responses thereto; and        (B) the Board may request or permit parties and interested       owners to make submissions addressing relevant questions of       fact or law, or other matters, including matters raised sua       sponte by the Officers of the Board, and offer responses       thereto.        (11) Discovery.--        (A) In general.--Discovery in a proceeding shall be limited       to the production of relevant information and documents,       written interrogatories, and written requests for admission,       as provided in regulations established by the Commission,       except that--        (i) upon the request of a party, and for good cause shown,       the Board may approve additional relevant discovery, on a       limited basis, in particular matters, and may request       specific information and documents from parties in the       proceeding, consistent with the interests of justice;        (ii) upon the request of a party or interested owner, and       for good cause shown, the Board may issue a protective order       to limit the disclosure of documents or testimony that       contain confidential information;        (iii) after providing notice and an opportunity to respond,       and upon good cause shown, the Board may apply an adverse       inference with respect to disputed facts against a party or       interested owner who has failed to timely provide discovery       materials in response to a proper request for materials that       could be relevant to such facts; and        (iv) an interested owner shall only produce or receive       discovery to the extent it relates to whether the visual       depiction at issue constitutes a proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child.        (B) Privacy.--Any alleged proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child received by the Board or the Commission       as part of a proceeding shall be filed under seal and shall       remain in the care, custody, and control of the Board or the       Commission. For purposes of discovery, the Board or       Commission shall make the proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child reasonably available to the parties and       interested owner but shall not provide copies. The privacy       protections described in section 3509(d) of title 18, United       States Code, shall apply to the Board, Commission, provider,       complainant, and interested owner.        (12) Responses.--The responding party may refute any of the       claims or factual assertions made by the petitioning party,       and may also claim that the petition was not filed in the       applicable timeframe or is barred under subsection (h). If a       complainant is the petitioning party, a provider may claim in       response that the notification was incomplete and could not       be made complete under subsection (c)(2)(D)(i). The       petitioning party may refute any responses submitted by the       responding party.        (13) Interested owner.--An individual notified under       paragraph (19)(C)(ii) may, within 14 days of being so       notified, file a motion to join the proceeding for the       limited purpose of claiming that the visual depiction at       issue does not constitute a proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child. The Board shall serve the motion on both       parties. Such motion shall include a factual basis and a       signed statement, submitted under penalty of perjury,       indicating that the individual produced or created the visual       depiction at issue. The Board shall dismiss any motion that       does not include the signed statement or that was submitted       by an individual who did not produce or create the visual       depiction at issue. If the motion is granted, the interested       owner may also claim that the notification and petition were       filed with an intent to harass the interested owner. Any       party may refute the claims and factual assertions made by       the interested owner.        (14) Evidence.--The Board may consider the following types       of evidence in a proceeding, and such evidence may be       admitted  [[Page S1269]]       without application of formal rules of evidence:        (A) Documentary and other nontestimonial evidence that is       relevant to the petitions or responses in the proceeding.        (B) Testimonial evidence, submitted under penalty of       perjury in written form or in accordance with paragraph (15),       limited to statements of the parties and nonexpert witnesses,       that is relevant to the petitions or responses in a       proceeding, except that, in exceptional cases, expert witness       testimony or other types of testimony may be permitted by the       Board for good cause shown.        (15) Hearings.--Unless waived by all parties, the Board       shall conduct a hearing to receive oral presentations on       issues of fact or law from parties and witnesses to a       proceeding, including oral testimony, subject to the       following:        (A) Any such hearing shall be attended by not fewer than       two of the Officers of the Board.        (B) The hearing shall be noted upon the record of the       proceeding and, subject to subparagraph (C), may be recorded       or transcribed as deemed necessary by the Board.        (C) A recording or transcript of the hearing shall be made       available to any Officer of the Board who is not in       attendance.        (16) Voluntary dismissal.--        (A) By petitioning party.--Upon the written request of a       petitioning party, the Board shall dismiss the petition, with       or without prejudice.        (B) By responding party or interested owner.--Upon written       request of a responding party or interested owner, the Board       shall dismiss any responses to the petition, and shall       consider all claims and factual assertions in the petition to       be true.        (17) Factual findings.--Subject to paragraph (11)(A)(iii),       the Board shall make factual findings based upon a       preponderance of the evidence.        (18) Determinations.--        (A) Nature and contents.--A determination rendered by the       Board in a proceeding shall--        (i) be reached by a majority of the Board;        (ii) be in writing, and include an explanation of the       factual and legal basis of the determination; and        (iii) include a clear statement of all fines, costs, and       other relief awarded.        (B) Dissent.--An Officer of the Board who dissents from a       decision contained in a determination under subparagraph (A)       may append a statement setting forth the grounds for that       dissent.        (19) Publication and disclosure.--        (A) Publication.--Each final determination of the Board       shall be made available on a publicly accessible website,       except that the final determination shall be redacted to       protect confidential information that is the subject of a       protective order under paragraph (11)(A)(ii) or information       protected pursuant to paragraph (11)(B) and any other       information protected from public disclosure under the       Federal Trade Commission Act or any other applicable       provision of law.        (B) Freedom of information act.--All information relating       to proceedings of the Board under this section is exempt from       disclosure to the public under section 552(b)(3) of title 5,       except for determinations, records, and information published       under subparagraph (A). Any information that is disclosed       under this subparagraph shall have redacted any information       that is the subject of a protective order under paragraph       (11)(A)(ii) or protected pursuant to paragraph (11)(B).        (C) Effect of petition on non-disclosure period.--        (i) Submission of a petition extends the non-disclosure       period under subsection (c)(2)(I) for the pendency of the       proceeding. The provider may submit an objection to the Board       that nondisclosure is contrary to the interests of justice.       The complainant may, but is not required to, respond to the       objection. The Board should sustain the objection unless       there is reason to believe that the circumstances in section       3486(a)(6)(B) of title 18, United States Code, exist and       outweigh the interests of justice.        (ii) If the Board sustains an objection to the       nondisclosure period, the provider or the Board may notify       the apparent owner of the visual depiction in question about       the proceeding, and include instructions on how the owner may       move to join the proceeding under paragraph (13).        (iii) If applicable, the nondisclosure period expires 120       after the Board's determination becomes final, except it       shall expire immediately upon the Board's determination       becoming final if the Board finds that the visual depiction       is not a proscribed visual depiction relating to a minor.        (iv) The interested owner of a visual depiction may not       bring any legal action against any party related to the       proscribed visual depiction relating to a child until the       Board's determination is final. Once the determination is       final, the owner of the visual depiction may pursue any legal       relief available under the law, subject to subsections (h),       (k), and (l).        (20) Responding party's default.--If the Board finds that       service of the petition on the responding party could not       reasonably be completed, or the responding party has failed       to appear or has ceased participating in a proceeding, as       demonstrated by the responding party's failure, without       justifiable cause, to meet one or more deadlines or       requirements set forth in the schedule adopted by the Board,       the Board may enter a default determination, including the       dismissal of any responses asserted by the responding party,       as follows and in accordance with such other requirements as       the Commission may establish by regulation:        (A) The Board shall require the petitioning party to submit       relevant evidence and other information in support of the       petitioning party's claims and, upon review of such evidence       and any other requested submissions from the petitioning       party, shall determine whether the materials so submitted are       sufficient to support a finding in favor of the petitioning       party under applicable law and, if so, the appropriate relief       and damages, if any, to be awarded.        (B) If the Board makes an affirmative determination under       subparagraph (A), the Board shall prepare a proposed default       determination, and shall provide written notice to the       responding party at all addresses, including email addresses,       reflected in the records of the proceeding before the Board,       of the pendency of a default determination by the Board and       of the legal significance of such determination. Such notice       shall be accompanied by the proposed default determination       and shall provide that the responding party has a period of       30 days, beginning on the date of the notice, to submit any       evidence or other information in opposition to the proposed       default determination.        (C) If the responding party responds to the notice provided       under subparagraph (B) within the 30-day period provided in       such subparagraph, the Board shall consider responding       party's submissions and, after allowing the petitioning party       to address such submissions, maintain, or amend its proposed       determination as appropriate, and the resulting determination       shall not be a default determination.        (D) If the respondent fails to respond to the notice       provided under subparagraph (B), the Board shall proceed to       issue the default determination. Thereafter, the respondent       may only challenge such determination to the extent permitted       under paragraph (28).        (21) Petitioning party or interested owner's failure to       proceed.--If a petitioning party or interested owner who has       joined the proceeding fails to proceed, as demonstrated by       the failure, without justifiable cause, to meet one or more       deadlines or requirements set forth in the schedule adopted       by the Board, the Board may, upon providing written notice to       the petitioning party or interested owner and a period of 30       days, beginning on the date of the notice, to respond to the       notice, and after considering any such response, issue a       determination dismissing the claims made by the petitioning       party or interested owner. The Board may order the       petitioning party to pay attorneys' fees and costs under       paragraph (26)(B), if appropriate. Thereafter, the       petitioning party may only challenge such determination to       the extent permitted under paragraph (28).        (22) Request for reconsideration.--A party or interested       owner may, within 30 days after the date on which the Board       issues a determination under paragraph (18), submit to the       Board a written request for reconsideration of, or an       amendment to, such determination if the party or interested       owner identifies a clear error of law or fact material to the       outcome, or a technical mistake. After providing the other       parties an opportunity to address such request, the Board       shall either deny the request or issue an amended       determination.        (23) Review by commission.--If the Board denies a party or       interested owner a request for reconsideration of a       determination under paragraph (22), the party or interested       owner may, within 30 days after the date of such denial,       request review of the determination by the Commission in       accordance with regulations established by the Commission.       After providing the other party or interested owner an       opportunity to address the request, the Commission shall       either deny the request for review, or remand the proceeding       to the Board for reconsideration of issues specified in the       remand and for issuance of an amended determination. Such       amended determination shall not be subject to further       consideration or review, other than under paragraph (28).        (24) Favorable ruling on complainant petition.--        (A) In general.--If the Board grants a complainant's       petition filed under this section, notwithstanding any other       law, the Board shall--        (i) order the provider to immediately remove the proscribed       visual depiction relating to a child, and to permanently       delete all copies of the visual depiction known to and under       the control of the provider unless the Board orders the       provider to preserve the visual depiction;        (ii) impose a fine of $50,000 per proscribed visual       depiction relating to a child covered by the determination,       but if the Board finds that--         (I) the provider removed the proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child after the period set forth in subsection       (c)(1)(A)(i), but before the complainant filed a petition,       such fine shall be $25,000;        (II) the provider has engaged in recidivist hosting for the       first time with respect to the proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child in question, such fine shall be $100,000       per proscribed visual depiction relating to a child; or        (III) the provider has engaged in recidivist hosting of the       proscribed visual depiction relating to a child in question 2       or more times, such fine shall be $200,000 per proscribed       visual depiction relating to a child;         (iii) order the provider to pay reasonable costs to the       complainant; and  [[Page S1270]]         (iv) refer any matters involving intentional or willful       conduct by a provider with respect to a proscribed visual       depiction relating to a child, or recidivist hosting, to the       Attorney General for prosecution under any applicable laws.        (B) Provider payment of fine and costs.--Notwithstanding       any other law, the Board shall direct a provider to promptly       pay fines and costs imposed under subparagraph (A) as       follows:        (i) If the petition was filed by a victim, such fine and       costs shall be paid to the victim.        (ii) If the petition was filed by an authorized       representative of a victim--         (I) 30 percent of such fine shall be paid to the authorized       representative and 70 percent of such fine paid to the       victim; and        (II) costs shall be paid to the authorized representative.         (iii) If the petition was filed by a qualified       organization--         (I) the fine shall be paid to the Child Pornography Victims       Reserve as provided in section 2259B of title 18, United       States Code; and        (II) costs shall be paid to the qualified organization.         (25) Effect of denial of provider petition.--        (A) In general.--If the Board denies a provider's petition       to contest a notification filed under paragraph (2), it shall       order the provider to immediately remove the proscribed       visual depiction relating to a child, and to permanently       delete all copies of the visual depiction known to and under       the control of the provider unless the Board orders the       provider to preserve the visual depiction.        (B) Referral for failure to remove material.--If a provider       does not remove and, if applicable, permanently delete a       proscribed visual depiction relating to a child within 48       hours of the Board issuing a determination under subparagraph       (A), or not later than 2 business days of the Board issuing a       determination under subparagraph (A) concerning a small       provider, the Board shall refer the matter to the Attorney       General for prosecution under any applicable laws.        (C) Costs for frivolous petition.--If the Board finds that       a provider filed a petition under paragraph (2) for a       harassing or improper purpose or without reasonable basis in       law or fact, the Board shall order the provider to pay the       reasonable costs of the complainant.        (26) Effect of denial of complainant's petition or       favorable ruling on provider's petition.--        (A) Restoration.--If the Board grants a provider's petition       filed under paragraph (2) or if the Board denies a petition       filed by the complainant under paragraph (1), the provider       may restore access to any visual depiction that was at issue       in the proceeding.        (B) Costs for incomplete or frivolous notification and       harassment.--If, in granting or denying a petition as       described in subparagraph (A), the Board finds that the       notification contested in the petition could not be made       complete under subsection (c)(2)(D), is frivolous, or is       duplicative under subsection (c)(2)(C)(i), the Board may       order the complainant to pay costs to the provider and any       interested owner, which shall not exceed a total of $10,000,       or, if the Board finds that the complainant filed the       notification with an intent to harass the provider or any       person, a total of $15,000.        (27) Civil action; other relief.--        (A) In general.--Whenever any provider or complainant fails       to comply with a final determination of the Board issued       under paragraph (18), the Department of Justice may commence       a civil action in a district court of the United States to       enforce compliance with such determination.        (B) Savings clause.--Nothing in this section shall be       construed to limit the authority of the Commission or       Department of Justice under any other provision of law.        (28) Challenges to the determination.--        (A) Bases for challenge.--Not later than 45 days after the       date on which the Board issues a determination or amended       determination in a proceeding, or not later than 45 days       after the date on which the Board completes any process of       reconsideration or the Commission completes a review of the       determination, whichever occurs later, a party may seek an       order from a district court, located where the provider or       complainant conducts business or resides, vacating,       modifying, or correcting the determination of the Board in       the following cases:        (i) If the determination was issued as a result of fraud,       corruption, misrepresentation, or other misconduct.        (ii) If the Board exceeded its authority or failed to       render a determination concerning the subject matter at       issue.        (iii) In the case of a default determination or       determination based on a failure to prosecute, if it is       established that the default or failure was due to excusable       neglect.        (B) Procedure to challenge.--        (i) Notice of application.--Notice of the application to       challenge a determination of the Board shall be provided to       all parties to the proceeding before the Board, in accordance       with the procedures applicable to service of a motion in the       court where the application is made.        (ii) Staying of proceedings.--For purposes of an       application under this paragraph, any judge who is authorized       to issue an order to stay the proceedings in an any other       action brought in the same court may issue an order, to be       served with the notice of application, staying proceedings to       enforce the award while the challenge is pending.        (29) Final determination.--A determination of the Board       shall be final on the date that all opportunities for a party       or interested owner to seek reconsideration or review of a       determination under paragraph (22) or (23), or for a party to       challenge the determination under paragraph (28), have       expired or are exhausted.        (h) Effect of Proceeding.--        (1) Subsequent proceedings.--The issuance of a final       determination by the Board shall preclude the filing by any       party of any subsequent petition that is based on the       notification at issue in the final determination. This       paragraph shall not limit the ability of any party to file a       subsequent petition based on any other notification.        (2) Determination.--Except as provided in paragraph (1),       the issuance of a final determination by the Board, including       a default determination or determination based on a failure       to prosecute, shall not preclude relitigation of any factual       matter in any subsequent legal action or proceeding before       any court, tribunal, or the Board, and any determination of       the Board may not be cited or relied upon as legal precedent       in any such legal action or proceeding except that--        (A) no party or interested owner may relitigate any       allegation, factual claim, or response that was properly       asserted and considered by the Board in any subsequent       proceeding before the Board involving the same parties or       interested owner and the same proscribed visual depiction       relating to a minor; and        (B) a finding by the Board that a visual depiction       constitutes a proscribed visual depiction relating to a child       may not be relitigated in any civil proceeding brought by an       interested owner.        (3) Other materials in proceeding.--A submission or       statement of a party, interested owner, or witness made in       connection with a proceeding before the Board, including a       proceeding that is dismissed, may not serve as the basis of       any action or proceeding before any court or tribunal except       for any legal action related to perjury or for conduct       described in subsection (k)(2) . A statement of a party,       interested owner, or witness may be received as evidence, in       accordance with applicable rules, in any subsequent legal       action or proceeding before any court, tribunal, or the       Board.

A bill to require the Secretary of Labor to implement the  industry-recognized apprenticeship program process, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Madam President, there is a grave threat to America's  future lurking online. Big Tech giants and other online platforms are  working every day to capture the minds of our children in order to pad  their profits.   Toddlers, before they can walk or barely talk, have learned to reach  out and touch that bright little screen. Mothers and fathers on car  rides and plane trips trust that little screen will buy them quiet  time. Captivated, mesmerized, even hypnotized, the screen experience  continues. And unless parents are very careful, it can go from bad to  worse. It starts with music and games, which many of the parents find  harmless. As the child grows up and graduates to a cell phone, there is  an opportunity to move to a new level of information and communication.   Let's face it, even the most caring, conscientious parent struggles  to keep up with all the apps and options. And the producers of these  online experiences are determined to work on the brains of these  children, capture their  [[Page S1258]]  little customers in the process, and pad their profits.   So who is protecting our kids from internet profiteers and predators?  I am sorry to say, almost no one. In fact, our laws are written to  protect the predators, not the kids.   Clearly, every child can benefit from a safe online experience. They  can make friends, expand their knowledge, learn skills. But social  media, we all know, has a dangerous dark side. Innocent children are  lured into online environments and powerful algorithms working to keep  them there. Unsuspecting kids can be sexually exploited and their  childhood images captured forever by predators and profit-taking  abusers.   Drug pushers no longer search for playgrounds to sell deadly  narcotics. Two clicks on the internet bring them their new young  customers. Many children are bullied and harassed online or pressured  into dangerous, deadly behavior.   Rose Bronstein is a mother from Chicago. She knows how cruel and  dangerous the online world can be. Rose's son Nate was a 10th grader at  a private school when he started being taunted by classmates using  texts and Snapchat. The bullying of her son was vicious, and it  included messages urging Nate to kill himself. Nate died by suicide at  the age of 15.   We have known for years about the online dangers to children's  privacy and safety. We have talked a lot about them. We have even held  hearings in Congress about them. Journalists have written so many  articles about the dangers, but the problem has only grown worse.   Research into exactly how social media use affects children is still  in its early stage, largely because of Big Tech's failure to adequately  monitor, report, and prevent violation of children's online privacy and  safety. But a picture is emerging, and it is alarming.   This chart tells a story. The gold line you see here shows the amount  of time teenagers spend scrolling through social media and watching  online videos. According to Common Sense, a group that tracks media use  by young kids and teens, kids spend an average of nearly 3 hours a day  on sites like Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube. That is a  nearly 60-percent increase in the last 6 years.   This white line shows that an increase in teens' use of social media  has been accompanied by a sharp spike in teen depression. According to  the CDC, between 2013 and 2021, the percentage of teens who reported  persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness shot up 42 percent-- between 2013 and 2021.   The blue line shows what happens with girls' mental health. Today,  nearly one in three girls in America say they have seriously considered  suicide. That is a 34-percent spike in the past decade.   We have given tech companies nearly three decades to police  themselves. They have failed miserably, and our children are paying the  price. Our teenagers are in a mental health crisis.   Congress must impose stronger, enforceable online protections for  kids. Our children are not commodities, and we can't continue to expect  parents and victims alone to stand up to Big Tech with few ways to hold  tech companies accountable.   Two months ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, held a  hearing on online threats to children's safety. We heard powerful  testimony from those working to increase children's privacy and safety  online. They included law enforcement, the National Center for Missing  & Exploited Children, the American Psychological Association, and the  child internet safety advocacy organization known as Fairplay.   We also heard from victims. The stories were frightening, frightening  to every parent and every grandparent, and heartbreaking.   Charlotte--and I am using a pseudonym here--didn't attend the  hearing, but she has allowed me to tell her story in the hope that it  may help others who have been victimized online, as she has been, by  sexual predators.   Charlotte was 16 years old when she first visited a social media site  that a friend told her about. It sounded so exciting, she said, a place  where she could meet people from all over the world. I won't use the  name of the site, but you would recognize it immediately. It is used by  tens of millions of people every single day.   Among the people Charlotte met online was a man who showered her with  attention and compliments, gained her trust, and eventually enticed  Charlotte into performing sex acts for him over the webcam and sending  explicit videos to him.   Maybe that sounds shocking to you, but be prepared. Research shows  that over one-third of teenagers today believe that it is normal to  share the same sorts of images and videos that Charlotte shared  online--one-third.   She was still in high school when the online harassment began. First  came anonymous emails, then a phone call to her parents' house calling  her vile names. Eventually, the images she shared with that man she  thought was a friend would be posted on more than 100 websites across  the world, often with her name and identifiable information included.   Charlotte filed her first of six police reports about the images when  she reached the age of 18. Eventually, she, her mother, her boyfriend,  and child safety groups would file hundreds of reports with social  media providers around the world trying to get these horrible images  taken down, often to no avail.   While she was in college studying to be a teacher--her lifelong  dream--the images were posted again, along with her name and the name  of her college. When the university found out about it, it canceled her  student teaching placement and threatened to withhold her degree.   She was a teacher of special education at a middle school when one of  her students saw the images again online. Charlotte told her principal.  She was fired a few days later.   Again and again, it was Charlotte who was blamed, not the abusers who  tormented her online. Over the years, Charlotte tried three times to  take her own life. It has now been 14 years since she met that predator  online, but the images continue to circulate again and again. The abuse  never stops, and Charlotte says she doubts she will ever feel safe  again.   This Senate can help Charlotte and countless other young people who  are sexually abused online each year by passing a bill that I am  introducing today. It is called the Stop CSAM Act. CSAM, C-S-A-M,  stands for ``child sexual abuse material.'' Federal law still uses the  old term--``pornography,'' ``child pornography''--but that is  misleading because pornography implies consent, and children under the  age of 18 cannot legally consent to the creation or sharing of sexually  explicit images of themselves.   So these images are, by definition, evidence of a crime. Yet, under  current law, it is extremely difficult to bring lawsuits against tech  companies that allow child sexual abuse materials to be posted on their  websites.   How can this be, you ask? Here is how. The Communications Decency Act  of 1996--remember that year--contains a section, section 230, that  offers near-total immunity to Big Tech. As a result, victims like  Charlotte have no way to force tech companies to remove content posted  on their sites--not even these child sexual abuse horrible images.   My bill, the Stop CSAM Act, is going to change that. It would protect  victims and promote accountability within the tech industry. Companies  that fail to remove CSAM and related imagery after being notified about  them would face significant fines. They would also be required to  produce annual reports detailing their efforts to keep children safe  from online sex predators, and any company that promotes or facilitates  online child exploitation could face new criminal and civil penalties.   When section 230 was created in 1996, Mark Zuckerberg was in the  sixth grade. Facebook and social media sites didn't even exist. It is  time that we rewrite the law to reflect the reality of today's world.   A bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Graham and Blumenthal would  also help to do that. It is called the EARN IT Act, and it would let  CSAM victims--these child sexual abuse victims--have their day in court  by amending section 230 to eliminate Big Tech's near-total immunity  from liability and responsibility.   When we learned two decades ago that Big Tobacco was lying about  their  [[Page S1259]]  efforts to hook kids on smoking, Congress took action to establish  reasonable guardrails to protect public health, and the courts held Big  Tobacco accountable for the damage and death it had caused.   Now, Big Tech is using the same playbook in order to profit by  hooking America's kids on its dangerous products. It is time to hold  them accountable just as we did with Big Tobacco.   I will close with one more story from our committee hearing. Kristin  Bride is a mother from Oregon. After being bullied relentlessly by  supposed friends using Snapchat and anonymous messaging apps, Kristin's  16-year-old son Carson hanged himself in his family's garage. After his  death, Kristin discovered the online taunts they had been throwing at  her son. She sued the anonymous messaging apps in California State  court for failing to enforce even their own safety standard.   The court dismissed the lawsuit, and what did they cite? Section 230,  our law from 1996.   As Kristin told our committee, ``It shouldn't take grieving parents  filing lawsuits to hold the industry accountable for their dangerous  and addictive product design.''   We have the bipartisan support in the Senate to protect our children  and grandchildren online. It is time that we use it.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1199         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 7. REPORTING AND REMOVAL OF PROSCRIBED VISUAL DEPICTIONS                     RELATING TO CHILDREN; ESTABLISHMENT OF CHILD                     ONLINE PROTECTION BOARD.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Over 40 years ago, the Supreme Court of the United       States ruled in New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982), that       child sexual abuse material (referred to in this subsection       as ``CSAM'') is a ``category of material outside the       protections of the First Amendment.'' The Court emphasized       that children depicted in CSAM are harmed twice: first       through the abuse and exploitation inherent in the creation       of the materials, and then through the continued circulation       of the imagery, which inflicts its own emotional and       psychological injury.        (2) The Supreme Court reiterated this point 9 years ago in       Paroline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434 (2014), when it       explained that CSAM victims suffer ``continuing and grievous       harm as a result of [their] knowledge that a large,       indeterminate number of individuals have viewed and will in       the future view images of the sexual abuse [they] endured.''        (3) In these decisions, the Supreme Court noted that the       distribution of child sexual abuse material invades the       privacy interests of the victims.        (4) The co-mingling online of CSAM with other, non-explicit       depictions of the victims links the victim's identity with       the images of their abuse. This further invades a victim's       privacy and disrupts their sense of security, thwarting what       the Supreme Court has described as ``the individual interest       in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.''        (5) The internet is awash with child sexual abuse material.       In 2021, the CyberTipline, operated by the National Center       for Missing & Exploited Children to combat online child       sexual exploitation, received reports about 39,900,000 images       and 44,800,000 videos depicting child sexual abuse.        (6) Since 2017, Project Arachnid, operated by the Canadian       Centre for Child Protection, has sent over 26,000,000 notices       to online providers about CSAM and other exploitive material       found on their platforms. According to the Canadian Centre,       some providers are slow to remove the material, or take it       down only for it to be reposted again a short time later.        (7) This legislation is needed to create an easy-to-use and       effective procedure to get CSAM and harmful related imagery       quickly taken offline and kept offline to protect children,       stop the spread of illegal and harmful content, and thwart       the continued invasion of the victims' privacy.        (b) Implementation.--        (1) Implementation.--Except as provided in paragraph (2),       not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Child Online Protection Board established under       subsection (d), shall begin operations, at which point       providers shall begin receiving notifications as set forth in       subsection (c)(2).        (2) Extension.--The Commission may extend the deadline       under paragraph (1) by not more than 180 days if the       Commission provides notice of the extension to the public and       to Congress.        (c) Reporting and Removal of Proscribed Visual Depictions       Relating to Children.--        (1) In general.--If a provider receives a complete       notification as set forth in paragraph (2)(A) that the       provider is hosting a proscribed visual depiction relating to       a child, not later than 48 hours after such notification is       received by the provider (or, in the case of a small       provider, not later than 2 business days after such       notification is received by the small provider) the provider       shall--        (A)(i) remove the proscribed visual depiction relating to a       child; and        (ii) notify the complainant that it has done so; or        (B) notify the complainant that the provider--        (i) is unable to remove the proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child using reasonable means; or        (ii) has determined that the notification is duplicative       under paragraph (2)(C)(i).        (2) Notification requirements.--        (A) In general.--To be complete under this subsection, a       notification must be a written communication to the       designated reporting system of the provider (or, if the       provider does not have a designated reporting system, a       written communication that is served on the provider in       accordance with subparagraph (F)) that includes the       following:        (i) An identification of, and information reasonably       sufficient to permit the provider to locate, the alleged       proscribed visual depiction relating to a child. Such       information may include, at the option of the complainant, a       copy of the alleged proscribed visual depiction relating to a       child or the uniform resource locator where such proscribed       visual depiction is located.        (ii) The complainant's name and contact information, to       include a mailing address, telephone number, and an       electronic mail address, except that, if the complainant is       the victim depicted in the alleged proscribed visual       depiction relating to a child, the complainant may elect to       use an alias, including for purposes of the signed statement       described in clause (v), and omit a mailing address.        (iii) If applicable, a statement indicating that the       complainant has previously notified the provider about the       alleged proscribed visual depiction relating to a child which       may, at the option of the complainant, include a copy of the       previous notification.        (iv) A statement indicating that the complainant has a good       faith belief that the information in the notification is       accurate.        (v) A signed statement under penalty of perjury indicating       that the notification is submitted by--         (I) the victim depicted in the alleged proscribed visual       depiction relating to a child;        (II) an authorized representative of the victim depicted in       the alleged proscribed visual depiction relating to a child;       or        (III) a qualified organization.         (B) Inclusion of multiple visual depictions in same       notification.--A notification may contain information about       more than one proscribed visual depiction relating to a       child, but shall only be effective with respect to each       proscribed visual depiction relating to a child included in       the notification to the extent that the notification includes       sufficient information to identify and locate such visual       depiction.        (C) Limitation on duplicative notifications.--        (i) In general.--After a complainant has submitted a       notification to a provider, the complainant may submit       additional notifications at any time only if the subsequent       notifications involve--         (I) a different proscribed visual depiction relating to a       minor;        (II) the same proscribed visual depiction relating to a       minor that is in a different location; or        (III) recidivist hosting.         (ii) No obligation.--A provider who receives any additional       notifications that do not comply with clause (i) shall not be       required to take any additional action except--         (I) as may be required with respect to the original       notification; and        (II) to notify the complainant as provided in paragraph       (1)(B)(ii).         (D) Incomplete or misdirected notification.--        (i) Requirement to contact complainant regarding       insufficient information.--         (I) Requirement to contact complainant.--If a notification       that is submitted to a provider under this subsection does       not contain sufficient information under subparagraph (A)(i)       to identify or locate the visual depiction that is the       subject of the notification but does contain the complainant       contact information described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the       provider shall, not later than 48 hours after receiving the       notification (or, in the case of a small provider, not later       than 2 business days after such notification is received by       the small provider), contact the complainant via electronic       email address to obtain such information.        (II) Effect of complainant providing sufficient       information.--If the provider is able to contact the       complainant and obtain sufficient information to identify or       locate the visual depiction that is the subject of the       notification, the provider shall then proceed as set forth in       paragraph (1), except that the applicable timeframes       described in such paragraph shall commence on the day the       provider receives the information needed to identify or       locate the visual depiction.        (III) Effect of complainant inability to provide sufficient       information.--If the provider is able to contact the       complainant but does not obtain sufficient information to       identify or locate the visual depiction that is the subject       of the notification, the provider shall so notify the       complainant not later than 48 hours after the provider       determines that it is unable to identify or locate the visual       depiction (or, in the case of a small provider, not later       than 2 business days after the small provider makes such       determination), after which no further action by the provider       is required and receipt of the notification shall not be       considered in determining whether the provider has actual       knowledge of any information described in the notification.  [[Page S1266]]         (IV) Effect of complainant failure to respond.--If the       complainant does not respond to the provider's attempt to       contact the complainant under this clause within 14 days of       such attempt, no further action by the provider is required       and receipt of the notification shall not be considered in       determining whether the provider has actual knowledge of any       information described in the notification.         (ii) Treatment of incomplete notification where complainant       cannot be contacted.--If a notification that is submitted to       a provider under this subsection does not contain sufficient       information under subparagraph (A)(i) to identify or locate       the visual depiction that is the subject of the notification       and does not contain the complainant contact information       described in subparagraph (A)(ii) (or if the provider is       unable to contact the complainant using such information), no       further action by the provider is required and receipt of the       notification shall not be considered in determining whether       the provider has actual knowledge of any information       described in the notification.        (iii) Treatment of notification not submitted to designated       reporting system.--If a provider has a designated reporting       system, and a complainant submits a notification under this       subsection to the provider without using such system, the       provider shall not be considered to have received the       notification.        (E) Option to contact complainant regarding the proscribed       visual depiction involving a minor.--        (i) Contact with complainant.--If the provider believes       that the proscribed visual depiction involving a minor       referenced in the notification does not meet the definition       of such term as provided in subsection (r)(10), the provider       may, not later than 48 hours after receiving the notification       (or, in the case of a small provider, not later than 2       business days after such notification is received by the       small provider), contact the complainant via electronic mail       address to so indicate.        (ii) Failure to respond.--If the complainant does not       respond to the provider within 14 days after receiving the       notification, no further action by the provider is required       and receipt of the notification shall not be considered in       determining whether the provider has actual knowledge of any       information described in the notification.        (iii) Complainant response.--If the complainant responds to       the provider within 14 days after receiving the notification,       the provider shall then proceed as set forth in paragraph       (1), except that the applicable timeframes described in such       paragraph shall commence on the day the provider receives the       complainant's response.        (F) Service of notification where provider has no       designated reporting system; process where complainant cannot       serve provider.--        (i) No designated reporting system.--If a provider does not       have a designated reporting system, a complainant may serve       the provider with a notification under this subsection to the       provider in the same manner that petitions are required to be       served under subsection (g)(4).        (ii) Complainant cannot serve provider.--If a provider does       not have a designated reporting system and a complainant       cannot reasonably serve the provider with a notification as       described in clause (i), the complainant may bring a petition       under subsection (g)(1) without serving the provider with the       notification.        (G) Recidivist hosting.--If a provider engages in       recidivist hosting of a proscribed visual depiction relating       to a child, in addition to any action taken under this       section, a complainant may submit a report concerning such       recidivist hosting to the CyberTipline operated by the       National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or any       successor to the CyberTipline operated by the National Center       for Missing and Exploited Children.        (H) Preservation.--A provider that receives a complete       notification under this subsection shall preserve the       information in such notification in accordance with the       requirements of sections 2713 and 2258A(h) of title 18,       United States Code. For purposes of this subparagraph, the       period for which providers shall be required to preserve       information in accordance with such section 2258A(h) may be       extended in 90 day increments on written request by the       complainant or order of the Board.        (I) Non-disclosure.--Except as otherwise provided in       subsection (g)(19)(C), for 180 days following receipt of a       notification under this subsection, a provider may not       disclose the existence of the notification to any person or       entity except to an attorney for purposes of obtaining legal       advice, the Board, the Commission, a law enforcement agency       described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of section       2258A(g)(3) of title 18, United States Code, the National       Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or as necessary to       respond to legal process.

(7) Opt-out procedure.--Within 1 week of completion of       service of the petition under paragraph (4), 1 or more       Officers of the Board shall hold a conference to explain that       the responding party has a right to opt out of the proceeding       before the Board, and describe the consequences of opting out       and not opting out as described in paragraph (6). A       responding party shall have a period of 30 days, beginning on       the date of conference, in which to provide written notice of       such choice to the petitioning party and the Child Online       Protection Board. If the responding party does not submit an       opt-out notice to the Child Online Protection Board within       that 30-day period, the proceeding shall be deemed an active       proceeding and the responding party shall be bound by the       determination in the proceeding. If the responding party opts       out of the proceeding during that 30-day period, the       proceeding shall be dismissed without prejudice.        (8) Scheduling.--Upon receipt of a complete petition and at       the conclusion of the opt out procedure described in       paragraph (7), the Board shall issue a schedule for the       future conduct of the proceeding. A schedule issued by the       Board may be amended by the Board in the interests of       justice.        (9) Conferences.--One or more Officers of the Board may       hold a conference to address case management or discovery       issues in a proceeding, which shall be noted upon the record       of the proceeding and may be recorded or transcribed.        (10) Party submissions.--A proceeding of the Board may not       include any formal motion practice, except that, subject to       applicable regulations and procedures of the Board--        (A) the parties to the proceeding and an interested owner       may make requests to the Board to address case management and       discovery matters, and submit responses thereto; and        (B) the Board may request or permit parties and interested       owners to make submissions addressing relevant questions of       fact or law, or other matters, including matters raised sua       sponte by the Officers of the Board, and offer responses       thereto.        (11) Discovery.--        (A) In general.--Discovery in a proceeding shall be limited       to the production of relevant information and documents,       written interrogatories, and written requests for admission,       as provided in regulations established by the Commission,       except that--        (i) upon the request of a party, and for good cause shown,       the Board may approve additional relevant discovery, on a       limited basis, in particular matters, and may request       specific information and documents from parties in the       proceeding, consistent with the interests of justice;        (ii) upon the request of a party or interested owner, and       for good cause shown, the Board may issue a protective order       to limit the disclosure of documents or testimony that       contain confidential information;        (iii) after providing notice and an opportunity to respond,       and upon good cause shown, the Board may apply an adverse       inference with respect to disputed facts against a party or       interested owner who has failed to timely provide discovery       materials in response to a proper request for materials that       could be relevant to such facts; and        (iv) an interested owner shall only produce or receive       discovery to the extent it relates to whether the visual       depiction at issue constitutes a proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child.        (B) Privacy.--Any alleged proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child received by the Board or the Commission       as part of a proceeding shall be filed under seal and shall       remain in the care, custody, and control of the Board or the       Commission. For purposes of discovery, the Board or       Commission shall make the proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child reasonably available to the parties and       interested owner but shall not provide copies. The privacy       protections described in section 3509(d) of title 18, United       States Code, shall apply to the Board, Commission, provider,       complainant, and interested owner.        (12) Responses.--The responding party may refute any of the       claims or factual assertions made by the petitioning party,       and may also claim that the petition was not filed in the       applicable timeframe or is barred under subsection (h). If a       complainant is the petitioning party, a provider may claim in       response that the notification was incomplete and could not       be made complete under subsection (c)(2)(D)(i). The       petitioning party may refute any responses submitted by the       responding party.        (13) Interested owner.--An individual notified under       paragraph (19)(C)(ii) may, within 14 days of being so       notified, file a motion to join the proceeding for the       limited purpose of claiming that the visual depiction at       issue does not constitute a proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child. The Board shall serve the motion on both       parties. Such motion shall include a factual basis and a       signed statement, submitted under penalty of perjury,       indicating that the individual produced or created the visual       depiction at issue. The Board shall dismiss any motion that       does not include the signed statement or that was submitted       by an individual who did not produce or create the visual       depiction at issue. If the motion is granted, the interested       owner may also claim that the notification and petition were       filed with an intent to harass the interested owner. Any       party may refute the claims and factual assertions made by       the interested owner.        (14) Evidence.--The Board may consider the following types       of evidence in a proceeding, and such evidence may be       admitted  [[Page S1269]]       without application of formal rules of evidence:        (A) Documentary and other nontestimonial evidence that is       relevant to the petitions or responses in the proceeding.        (B) Testimonial evidence, submitted under penalty of       perjury in written form or in accordance with paragraph (15),       limited to statements of the parties and nonexpert witnesses,       that is relevant to the petitions or responses in a       proceeding, except that, in exceptional cases, expert witness       testimony or other types of testimony may be permitted by the       Board for good cause shown.        (15) Hearings.--Unless waived by all parties, the Board       shall conduct a hearing to receive oral presentations on       issues of fact or law from parties and witnesses to a       proceeding, including oral testimony, subject to the       following:        (A) Any such hearing shall be attended by not fewer than       two of the Officers of the Board.        (B) The hearing shall be noted upon the record of the       proceeding and, subject to subparagraph (C), may be recorded       or transcribed as deemed necessary by the Board.        (C) A recording or transcript of the hearing shall be made       available to any Officer of the Board who is not in       attendance.        (16) Voluntary dismissal.--        (A) By petitioning party.--Upon the written request of a       petitioning party, the Board shall dismiss the petition, with       or without prejudice.        (B) By responding party or interested owner.--Upon written       request of a responding party or interested owner, the Board       shall dismiss any responses to the petition, and shall       consider all claims and factual assertions in the petition to       be true.        (17) Factual findings.--Subject to paragraph (11)(A)(iii),       the Board shall make factual findings based upon a       preponderance of the evidence.        (18) Determinations.--        (A) Nature and contents.--A determination rendered by the       Board in a proceeding shall--        (i) be reached by a majority of the Board;        (ii) be in writing, and include an explanation of the       factual and legal basis of the determination; and        (iii) include a clear statement of all fines, costs, and       other relief awarded.        (B) Dissent.--An Officer of the Board who dissents from a       decision contained in a determination under subparagraph (A)       may append a statement setting forth the grounds for that       dissent.        (19) Publication and disclosure.--        (A) Publication.--Each final determination of the Board       shall be made available on a publicly accessible website,       except that the final determination shall be redacted to       protect confidential information that is the subject of a       protective order under paragraph (11)(A)(ii) or information       protected pursuant to paragraph (11)(B) and any other       information protected from public disclosure under the       Federal Trade Commission Act or any other applicable       provision of law.        (B) Freedom of information act.--All information relating       to proceedings of the Board under this section is exempt from       disclosure to the public under section 552(b)(3) of title 5,       except for determinations, records, and information published       under subparagraph (A). Any information that is disclosed       under this subparagraph shall have redacted any information       that is the subject of a protective order under paragraph       (11)(A)(ii) or protected pursuant to paragraph (11)(B).        (C) Effect of petition on non-disclosure period.--        (i) Submission of a petition extends the non-disclosure       period under subsection (c)(2)(I) for the pendency of the       proceeding. The provider may submit an objection to the Board       that nondisclosure is contrary to the interests of justice.       The complainant may, but is not required to, respond to the       objection. The Board should sustain the objection unless       there is reason to believe that the circumstances in section       3486(a)(6)(B) of title 18, United States Code, exist and       outweigh the interests of justice.        (ii) If the Board sustains an objection to the       nondisclosure period, the provider or the Board may notify       the apparent owner of the visual depiction in question about       the proceeding, and include instructions on how the owner may       move to join the proceeding under paragraph (13).        (iii) If applicable, the nondisclosure period expires 120       after the Board's determination becomes final, except it       shall expire immediately upon the Board's determination       becoming final if the Board finds that the visual depiction       is not a proscribed visual depiction relating to a minor.        (iv) The interested owner of a visual depiction may not       bring any legal action against any party related to the       proscribed visual depiction relating to a child until the       Board's determination is final. Once the determination is       final, the owner of the visual depiction may pursue any legal       relief available under the law, subject to subsections (h),       (k), and (l).        (20) Responding party's default.--If the Board finds that       service of the petition on the responding party could not       reasonably be completed, or the responding party has failed       to appear or has ceased participating in a proceeding, as       demonstrated by the responding party's failure, without       justifiable cause, to meet one or more deadlines or       requirements set forth in the schedule adopted by the Board,       the Board may enter a default determination, including the       dismissal of any responses asserted by the responding party,       as follows and in accordance with such other requirements as       the Commission may establish by regulation:        (A) The Board shall require the petitioning party to submit       relevant evidence and other information in support of the       petitioning party's claims and, upon review of such evidence       and any other requested submissions from the petitioning       party, shall determine whether the materials so submitted are       sufficient to support a finding in favor of the petitioning       party under applicable law and, if so, the appropriate relief       and damages, if any, to be awarded.        (B) If the Board makes an affirmative determination under       subparagraph (A), the Board shall prepare a proposed default       determination, and shall provide written notice to the       responding party at all addresses, including email addresses,       reflected in the records of the proceeding before the Board,       of the pendency of a default determination by the Board and       of the legal significance of such determination. Such notice       shall be accompanied by the proposed default determination       and shall provide that the responding party has a period of       30 days, beginning on the date of the notice, to submit any       evidence or other information in opposition to the proposed       default determination.        (C) If the responding party responds to the notice provided       under subparagraph (B) within the 30-day period provided in       such subparagraph, the Board shall consider responding       party's submissions and, after allowing the petitioning party       to address such submissions, maintain, or amend its proposed       determination as appropriate, and the resulting determination       shall not be a default determination.        (D) If the respondent fails to respond to the notice       provided under subparagraph (B), the Board shall proceed to       issue the default determination. Thereafter, the respondent       may only challenge such determination to the extent permitted       under paragraph (28).        (21) Petitioning party or interested owner's failure to       proceed.--If a petitioning party or interested owner who has       joined the proceeding fails to proceed, as demonstrated by       the failure, without justifiable cause, to meet one or more       deadlines or requirements set forth in the schedule adopted       by the Board, the Board may, upon providing written notice to       the petitioning party or interested owner and a period of 30       days, beginning on the date of the notice, to respond to the       notice, and after considering any such response, issue a       determination dismissing the claims made by the petitioning       party or interested owner. The Board may order the       petitioning party to pay attorneys' fees and costs under       paragraph (26)(B), if appropriate. Thereafter, the       petitioning party may only challenge such determination to       the extent permitted under paragraph (28).        (22) Request for reconsideration.--A party or interested       owner may, within 30 days after the date on which the Board       issues a determination under paragraph (18), submit to the       Board a written request for reconsideration of, or an       amendment to, such determination if the party or interested       owner identifies a clear error of law or fact material to the       outcome, or a technical mistake. After providing the other       parties an opportunity to address such request, the Board       shall either deny the request or issue an amended       determination.        (23) Review by commission.--If the Board denies a party or       interested owner a request for reconsideration of a       determination under paragraph (22), the party or interested       owner may, within 30 days after the date of such denial,       request review of the determination by the Commission in       accordance with regulations established by the Commission.       After providing the other party or interested owner an       opportunity to address the request, the Commission shall       either deny the request for review, or remand the proceeding       to the Board for reconsideration of issues specified in the       remand and for issuance of an amended determination. Such       amended determination shall not be subject to further       consideration or review, other than under paragraph (28).        (24) Favorable ruling on complainant petition.--        (A) In general.--If the Board grants a complainant's       petition filed under this section, notwithstanding any other       law, the Board shall--        (i) order the provider to immediately remove the proscribed       visual depiction relating to a child, and to permanently       delete all copies of the visual depiction known to and under       the control of the provider unless the Board orders the       provider to preserve the visual depiction;        (ii) impose a fine of $50,000 per proscribed visual       depiction relating to a child covered by the determination,       but if the Board finds that--         (I) the provider removed the proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child after the period set forth in subsection       (c)(1)(A)(i), but before the complainant filed a petition,       such fine shall be $25,000;        (II) the provider has engaged in recidivist hosting for the       first time with respect to the proscribed visual depiction       relating to a child in question, such fine shall be $100,000       per proscribed visual depiction relating to a child; or        (III) the provider has engaged in recidivist hosting of the       proscribed visual depiction relating to a child in question 2       or more times, such fine shall be $200,000 per proscribed       visual depiction relating to a child;         (iii) order the provider to pay reasonable costs to the       complainant; and  [[Page S1270]]         (iv) refer any matters involving intentional or willful       conduct by a provider with respect to a proscribed visual       depiction relating to a child, or recidivist hosting, to the       Attorney General for prosecution under any applicable laws.        (B) Provider payment of fine and costs.--Notwithstanding       any other law, the Board shall direct a provider to promptly       pay fines and costs imposed under subparagraph (A) as       follows:        (i) If the petition was filed by a victim, such fine and       costs shall be paid to the victim.        (ii) If the petition was filed by an authorized       representative of a victim--         (I) 30 percent of such fine shall be paid to the authorized       representative and 70 percent of such fine paid to the       victim; and        (II) costs shall be paid to the authorized representative.         (iii) If the petition was filed by a qualified       organization--         (I) the fine shall be paid to the Child Pornography Victims       Reserve as provided in section 2259B of title 18, United       States Code; and        (II) costs shall be paid to the qualified organization.         (25) Effect of denial of provider petition.--        (A) In general.--If the Board denies a provider's petition       to contest a notification filed under paragraph (2), it shall       order the provider to immediately remove the proscribed       visual depiction relating to a child, and to permanently       delete all copies of the visual depiction known to and under       the control of the provider unless the Board orders the       provider to preserve the visual depiction.        (B) Referral for failure to remove material.--If a provider       does not remove and, if applicable, permanently delete a       proscribed visual depiction relating to a child within 48       hours of the Board issuing a determination under subparagraph       (A), or not later than 2 business days of the Board issuing a       determination under subparagraph (A) concerning a small       provider, the Board shall refer the matter to the Attorney       General for prosecution under any applicable laws.        (C) Costs for frivolous petition.--If the Board finds that       a provider filed a petition under paragraph (2) for a       harassing or improper purpose or without reasonable basis in       law or fact, the Board shall order the provider to pay the       reasonable costs of the complainant.        (26) Effect of denial of complainant's petition or       favorable ruling on provider's petition.--        (A) Restoration.--If the Board grants a provider's petition       filed under paragraph (2) or if the Board denies a petition       filed by the complainant under paragraph (1), the provider       may restore access to any visual depiction that was at issue       in the proceeding.        (B) Costs for incomplete or frivolous notification and       harassment.--If, in granting or denying a petition as       described in subparagraph (A), the Board finds that the       notification contested in the petition could not be made       complete under subsection (c)(2)(D), is frivolous, or is       duplicative under subsection (c)(2)(C)(i), the Board may       order the complainant to pay costs to the provider and any       interested owner, which shall not exceed a total of $10,000,       or, if the Board finds that the complainant filed the       notification with an intent to harass the provider or any       person, a total of $15,000.        (27) Civil action; other relief.--        (A) In general.--Whenever any provider or complainant fails       to comply with a final determination of the Board issued       under paragraph (18), the Department of Justice may commence       a civil action in a district court of the United States to       enforce compliance with such determination.        (B) Savings clause.--Nothing in this section shall be       construed to limit the authority of the Commission or       Department of Justice under any other provision of law.        (28) Challenges to the determination.--        (A) Bases for challenge.--Not later than 45 days after the       date on which the Board issues a determination or amended       determination in a proceeding, or not later than 45 days       after the date on which the Board completes any process of       reconsideration or the Commission completes a review of the       determination, whichever occurs later, a party may seek an       order from a district court, located where the provider or       complainant conducts business or resides, vacating,       modifying, or correcting the determination of the Board in       the following cases:        (i) If the determination was issued as a result of fraud,       corruption, misrepresentation, or other misconduct.        (ii) If the Board exceeded its authority or failed to       render a determination concerning the subject matter at       issue.        (iii) In the case of a default determination or       determination based on a failure to prosecute, if it is       established that the default or failure was due to excusable       neglect.        (B) Procedure to challenge.--        (i) Notice of application.--Notice of the application to       challenge a determination of the Board shall be provided to       all parties to the proceeding before the Board, in accordance       with the procedures applicable to service of a motion in the       court where the application is made.        (ii) Staying of proceedings.--For purposes of an       application under this paragraph, any judge who is authorized       to issue an order to stay the proceedings in an any other       action brought in the same court may issue an order, to be       served with the notice of application, staying proceedings to       enforce the award while the challenge is pending.        (29) Final determination.--A determination of the Board       shall be final on the date that all opportunities for a party       or interested owner to seek reconsideration or review of a       determination under paragraph (22) or (23), or for a party to       challenge the determination under paragraph (28), have       expired or are exhausted.        (h) Effect of Proceeding.--        (1) Subsequent proceedings.--The issuance of a final       determination by the Board shall preclude the filing by any       party of any subsequent petition that is based on the       notification at issue in the final determination. This       paragraph shall not limit the ability of any party to file a       subsequent petition based on any other notification.        (2) Determination.--Except as provided in paragraph (1),       the issuance of a final determination by the Board, including       a default determination or determination based on a failure       to prosecute, shall not preclude relitigation of any factual       matter in any subsequent legal action or proceeding before       any court, tribunal, or the Board, and any determination of       the Board may not be cited or relied upon as legal precedent       in any such legal action or proceeding except that--        (A) no party or interested owner may relitigate any       allegation, factual claim, or response that was properly       asserted and considered by the Board in any subsequent       proceeding before the Board involving the same parties or       interested owner and the same proscribed visual depiction       relating to a minor; and        (B) a finding by the Board that a visual depiction       constitutes a proscribed visual depiction relating to a child       may not be relitigated in any civil proceeding brought by an       interested owner.        (3) Other materials in proceeding.--A submission or       statement of a party, interested owner, or witness made in       connection with a proceeding before the Board, including a       proceeding that is dismissed, may not serve as the basis of       any action or proceeding before any court or tribunal except       for any legal action related to perjury or for conduct       described in subsection (k)(2) . A statement of a party,       interested owner, or witness may be received as evidence, in       accordance with applicable rules, in any subsequent legal       action or proceeding before any court, tribunal, or the       Board.
