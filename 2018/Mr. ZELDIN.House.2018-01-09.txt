 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of this resolution  demonstrating our support for the Iranian people's cry for democracy.   On December 28, 2017, tens of thousands of Iranians courageously  poured into the streets to protest the brutality of President Rouhani's  regime. Instead of caring for its own people, the Iranian regime  focuses all of its energy on suffocating their cry, murdering  protestors, while choking off communication via the internet and social  media apps.   We have been down this road before. This is our second chance.   The Iranian people, smothered by their own government, look to us,  and, instead of the chill of silence, this time, they are rightfully  met with the full, immediate, and resounding support of the United  States. We stand in solidarity with millions of Iranians desperate for  support to help them turn the tide in Tehran and all throughout Iran.   The people of Iran will be losing a great champion with the  retirement of Chairman Royce, who has served over the course of the  last three terms as chairman of our committee. The fight continues.   Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution.
