Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 42 disapproving the rule  submitted by the Department of Labor relating to drug testing of  unemployment compensation applicants.   The goal of the 2012 bipartisan law signed by President Obama in  February 2012 is to reassure employers who fund the unemployment  compensation system that unemployment compensation claimants reentering  the workforce are truly able and available for work.   When I speak with employers in Nebraska's Third District, they  express a strong desire to hire individuals in a way that is beneficial  for both the employer and the employee.   According to UWC, the national association representing businesses in  the areas of unemployment compensation  [[Page H1202]]  and workers' compensation: ``The regulations adopted in final form not  only severely limited the circumstances under which a state may conduct  a drug test, but also unduly limited the types of tests that a state  would be permitted to conduct. . . .''   States, which are responsible for administration of the unemployment  compensation program, are also concerned.   Back in 2014, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker wrote to the Secretary  of Labor saying: ``Providing States more flexibility in defining  occupations that regularly conduct drug testing not only better serves  the public interest, but recognizes the unique labor force and  diversity in industry in each State.''   In recognition of the support we have received from employers who  fund the system and States which administer it, I include in the Record  their letters of support.                                                  February 10, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: We write to you today in support of       H.J. Res. 42, your legislation that would disapprove of the       United States Department of Labor's recent regulation       regarding states' ability to drug test individuals who apply       for unemployment insurance (UI).        Congress authorized the Labor Department to craft a rule       that would provide states the option to drug test       unemployment insurance applicants. Unfortunately, the Obama       Administration drafted the rule too narrowly, undermining the       intent of Congress and permitting drug testing in too few       instances.        Drug testing UI applicants can help individuals suffering       from substance abuse to access necessary care and treatment       so they may re-enter the workforce as healthy and productive       members of society. We believe this rule should be replaced       with a new rule that allows increased flexibility for states       to implement UI drug testing that best fits the needs of each       state.        Thank you for introducing this important legislation and we       look forward to working with Congress on this issue going       forward.            Sincerely,      Scott Walker,        Governor of Wisconsin.      Gary R. Herbert,        Governor of Utah.      Greg Abbott,        Governor of Texas.      Phil Bryant,        Governor of Mississippi.                                   ____                                                  State of Nebraska,                                          Office of the Governor,                                     Lincoln, NE, February 14, 2017.      Re H.J. Res. 42--Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation           Recipients.       Hon. Adrian Smith,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Smith: Thank you for being a co-introducer       of House Joint Resolution 42. The regulations which H.J. Res.       42 seeks to disapprove greatly exceed the authority granted       to the U.S. Department of Labor under Section 2105 of the       Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L.       112-96).        The U.S. Department of Labor regulations effectively limit       the application of P.L. 112-96 authorized drug testing to the       point that a state is, for all practical purposes, prevented       from adopting a meaningful drug testing program for       unemployment compensation claimants. These regulations are an       exhibit of executive overreach where the U.S. Department of       Labor effectively seeks to block the implementation of an Act       of Congress.        I thank you for your efforts to restore to the states their       right to enact drug testing requirements for unemployment       compensation claimants.            Sincerely,                                                     Pete Ricketts,      Governor.                                   ____                                                              UWC,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal: I am writing       on behalf of UWC--Strategic Services on Unemployment and       Workers' Compensation (UWC) in support of Resolution H.J. Res       42 that would disallow the final regulations posted by the       United States Department of Labor on August 5, 2016.        UWC is a national association representing business,       specifically in the areas of Unemployment Compensation and       Workers' Compensation. UWC members include many Fortune 500       companies as well as business associations and small       businesses impacted by unemployment law and policy.        The regulations as posted in final form are inconsistent       with the intent of Congress in enacting the Middle Class Tax       Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 and unduly restrict state       agencies choosing to test applicants for the use of       controlled substances.        Drug testing is a critical requirement of employment in       many industries and generally in determining whether a       prospective employee will be able to perform the       responsibilities of work for which the individual has       applied. The results of drug tests are also indications of       whether an individual is able to work and available to work       so as to be eligible to be paid unemployment compensation.        It is a federal statutory requirement of administrative       grants to states that as a condition of being paid       unemployment compensation for a week or weeks an individual       must be able to work, available to work, and actively seeking       work. The additional authority provided in Section 2105 of       the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012       permitted states to test for controlled substances consistent       with the able to work and available to work requirements that       were also included in the act.        The regulations adopted by the U.S. Department of Labor       were so narrowly drawn as to severely limit states from       electing to provide for drug testing of applicants. By       limiting the time within which a test may be conducted to the       period between the date of application and the date at which       the applicant began to claim a week of unemployment       compensation, such a test would be less likely to connect a       positive drug test with a subsequent week of unemployment       compensation that could be claimed up to 52 weeks after the       date of initial application.        The effect of such an interpretation is to render a test       useless for weeks claimed many weeks after the individual       became unemployed and prohibit testing for the weeks of       unemployment compensation as they are claimed.        The regulations adopted in final form not only severely       limited the circumstances under which a state may conduct a       drug test, but also unduly limited the types of tests that a       state would be permitted to conduct, the claimants that could       be tested, and the occupations with respect to which tests       could be conducted.        A number of states have indicated an interest in enacting       legislation consistent with federal law to permit drug       testing, but the severe limitations imposed by the       regulations have frustrated administration of drug testing as       part of the UI administrative process.        Employers pay the federal and state unemployment taxes       required to fund administration and benefits paid through the       Unemployment Insurance system. Drug testing of UI claimants       should be permitted as part of proper administration by       states to assure that only eligible claimants are paid and       that unemployed workers are able and available to work to       meet workforce needs of employers.        Thank you for the opportunity to express our support for       H.J. Res 42.            Sincerely,                                                 Douglas J. Holmes,      President.                                   ____                                    Secretaries' Innovation Group,                                    Milwaukee, WI, January 31, 2017.      Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: I am writing you on the topic of drug       screening and testing of Unemployment Insurance claimants in       my capacity as the Executive Director of the Secretaries'       Innovation Group, after consultation with Texas Workforce       Commission Executive Director Larry Temple and workforce       secretary members of SIG on a recent national conference       call. As you know, the Secretaries' Innovation Group is a       network of state workforce and human service secretaries from       states with Republican governors making up about half of the       country. We meet to exchange state program innovations and       opportunities and to press for national policies favoring       work, healthy families, federalism and limited government.        By way of background, in 2012, the bipartisan Middle Class       Tax Relief and Job Creation Act made a number of reforms to       the UI program, including overturning a 1960s-era DOL ban on       the screening or testing of UI applicants for illegal drugs.       The 2012 provision allowed (but did not require) states to       test UI applicants who either (1) lost their job due to drug       use, or (2) were seeking a new job that generally required       new employees to pass a drug test. However, in implementing       this law through regulation, DOL issued an overly       prescriptive final regulation making it almost impossible for       most states to implement the provision.        Our SIG state secretaries who run UI, WIOA and welfare to       work programs routinely meet with employers to seek their       input as to what characteristics they require to meet their       business needs. By far the most common stated requirements       are requests for individuals who are reliable and can pass a       drug test. Therefore it is highly important that states to       have the ability and authority to operate drug screening and       testing. It is also important they have the option to       condition UI benefits on cooperation in such tests and to       mandate treatment, if and when necessary, on a case by case       basis. States do not have the ability to operate this way       under the current restrictive regulation promulgated by the       Department of Labor.        During the national conference call with SIG workforce       secretaries to discuss drug screening and testing which took       place on  [[Page H1203]]       January 24th and included TX, AL, AR, ID, KS, ME, MD, MS, NE,       NM, NH, NV, ND, OH, OK, UT, WI, WY, none of the secretary       participants endorsed the DOL rule in question as written.        We hope the Congress will take up this issue and permit       states who wish to do so the ability to implement screening       and testing of UI claimants with the flexibility intended by       Congress.            Yours truly,                                                      Jason Turner,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, as Chairman Brady highlighted  earlier, Members of this body have clearly stated their intent time and  time again over the last few years through letters, hearings, public  comments, and meetings. Yet, the Department of Labor has continued to  push Congress' concerns to the side and legislate from the executive  branch.   Supporting this resolution means supporting the role of Congress to  write laws and for them to be implemented as intended.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Workers collecting unemployment benefits earned their benefits by  working hard. Workers only receive benefits if they are out of work  through no fault of their own and are actively searching for new jobs.   There are considerable challenges facing our unemployment system.  More than half of the State trust funds, including that in my home  State, are insolvent and could only pay earned benefits for a short  period of time if a recession hits. Only about one in four unemployed  workers currently receives unemployment insurance benefits. Some States  have cut benefits, increasing the chance that workers will exhaust  benefits before finding jobs. H.J. Res. 42 does not address these  challenges.   There are also real problems with drug use in this country and a  severe shortage of treatment options for those who need them. H.J. Res.  42 does not address these problems either.   Instead, we are considering a policy that slanders unemployed workers  by assuming that they are drug users; that ignores all research showing  that drug use is not higher among unemployed workers than in the  general population; and that violates the constitutional protection  against illegal search and seizure, a protection that courts have  clearly said exists regardless of whether one receives public benefits.   The statutory provision that has required this regulation was  appropriately limited to a very narrow group of workers, those for whom  finding suitable work required a drug test.   Counter to some GOP arguments, this resolution is not about helping  those with drug problems get treatment. It is about cutting benefits.  States with drug-testing provisions do not pay for expensive treatment  services for those who test positive. Moreover, workers cannot receive  benefits while in treatment because they are not actively seeking work.  Thus, they lose their earned unemployment benefits.   Congress should be helping communities suffering from high  unemployment, addressing persistent long-term unemployment, aiding  workers in upgrading their skills to get good jobs. Congress should be  strengthening our unemployment insurance system to make sure it is  ready to respond in the next recession.                                time  1345    We should not encourage States to waste resources on an  unconstitutionally-based drug testing requirements for struggling  unemployed workers who claim benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) who had an office next to mine  for many years. I know she has tremendous commitment, energy, and  fortitude.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman,  and I thank the manager of this legislation. But my distinguished  friend, Mr. Davis, and I have worked on societal issues dealing across  the gamut, and the respect that he holds in the communities across  America that recognize that second chances, unemployment compensation,  summer jobs, and a whole manner of opportunities for individuals to  restore their lives is the right way for America to go.   In the backdrop of an executive order that saw one of my  constituents, a 16-year-old with proper papers coming in from Jordan,  held for 50 hours at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, in defense  of those employees that I respect, CBP, they had no information how he  got in, but they took this young man. Lo and behold, he wound up in  Chicago because he didn't speak English, and that was the only bed they  have.   Why am I mentioning this? I am mentioning this because sometimes  government gets it wrong. They get it wrong. This disapproval is wrong.   What did happen was right, because what happened was that this rule  didn't just pop up in the administration, meaning the Obama  administration. It came about through a compromise--an intelligent  compromise--dealing with middle class tax relief and job creation.  Because at that time, there were people who randomly wanted to drug  test, but wise individuals said this, they said that you could allow  drug tests if you had lost your job or you are a drug user, so we want  to get you right; therefore, you could be tested.   Some people agree to disagree, but that is reasonable. Or that the  job that you were looking for or had a job that required the kind of  criteria and the kind of skills that drug use would impair or impact,  that makes sense.   But now you are talking about someone at the lowest ebb of life,  losing jobs through no fault of their own, giving States that may be  sensitive to human needs or reckless the ability to randomly test  people because they lost their jobs, because they have been defeated.   Well, I know it is too late, but maybe we should amend for  Congresspersons, Senators, and Governors who get unelected. They lost a  job; didn't they? It doesn't make sense.   I rushed to the floor. We are in the Judiciary Committee addressing  the question of how we are going to utilize the oversight plan, whether  we want to investigate and fix for the American people this horrible  scenario of the Russian involvement in the elections and the connection  to the present administration.    We want to fix things, but what you are doing here is that you are  casting a bad light on people who are in need. I just want to say  States have the ability to administer drug testing, and this change  would needlessly shift employer costs to the States. State unemployment  programs already penalize job-related drug use.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Webster of Florida). The time of the  gentlewoman has expired.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman  an additional 30 seconds.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Twenty States also explicitly deny benefits for any job loss  connected with drug use or a failed drug test. In addition, six  States--Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, and  Wisconsin--passed legislation equating a failed or refused  preemployment drug screen for refusing suitable work. We are already  condemning everybody. Other States have other programs. This is not one  that falls under the 10th Amendment.   But the specialist drug testing of government-benefit recipients  likely violates the Fourth Amendment, and it is cruel and inhuman  treatment.   I ask my colleagues to reject this cruel and inhuman treatment of  individuals who, through no fault of their own, are unemployed or they  may be poor or they may be needing public assistance. Let America's  humanity shine. Vote ``no'' on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I want to hopefully draw some  attention to the fact that we have a problem on our hands. We have a  problem with the Federal Government going too far, and we have a  problem with the State governments coming to us as policymakers at the  Federal level wanting to help their own constituents, their own  citizens in need. Right now the Federal Government stands in the way.   It is time for us as policymakers hopefully to act in a responsible  fashion to assist States in their need and their desire to help their  own citizens. States are better at that than is the Federal Government,  and I hope that we can empower the States to help their own  constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as I prepare to close,  let me just, first of all, thank the more than 40 organizations who  have sent letters in opposition to this legislation, especially the  African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African American Ministers in  Action, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and  many others. They have sent letters because they have a will to help,  not a will to hurt. They have a will to assist. They know that the  individuals we are talking about have lost their jobs, their  opportunity to work, and their connection, in many instances, with  humanity.   I would urge that we do everything in our power to help them find  their way back and not hurt them. Therefore, I would urge all of my  colleagues to oppose this legislation and vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, since the law was enacted some 5 years ago, Members of  this body have clearly stated their intent time and time again through  letters, hearings, public comments, and meetings, and yet the previous  Department of Labor continued to push Congress' concerns to the side  and legislate from the executive branch.   Again, supporting this resolution means supporting the role of  Congress  [[Page H1206]]  to write laws and for the laws to be implemented as intended.   I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 42, disapproving of the  Department of Labor's regulation of the drug testing on unemployment  insurance applicants.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the joint  resolution.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint  resolution.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third  time, and was read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint  resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
