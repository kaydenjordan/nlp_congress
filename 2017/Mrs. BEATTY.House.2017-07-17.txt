 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Veasey for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to stand on this floor, but when I  think that tonight I have to stand here and talk about the topic that  the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor to speak out  against is a sad day.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my classmate and colleague and friend,  Congressman Marc Veasey, for taking a leadership role and for making  that clarion call to ask us to come.                                time  1945    Many of us will come tonight and speak out. Several of us will file  our message so it can be recorded. Others will be back in their  districts fighting for voting rights.   This is something we have to do because, unfortunately, it has been  over 50 years since President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Voting  Rights Act of 1965, which has been the most powerful tool in defending  the voting rights of minorities.   The Voting Rights Act, as you have heard tonight and you will  continue to hear, outlawed the harassment, the intimidation, and the  violence that many African Americans experienced when trying to  exercise their right to vote.   It ended some of the most overtly discriminatory practices in our  country's history by banning literacy tests, appointing Federal  examiners in certain problematic areas to register voters and monitor  elections, and criminalizing voter intimidation threats and coercion.   Also key to the Voting Rights Act, you have heard many of our  attorneys explain it and talk about the creation of the preclearance  process that required certain places with some of the worst histories  of discrimination to gain approval from a Federal court or the  Department of Justice before making election changes.   However, Mr. Speaker, during my first term in Congress, I became a  part of this history. It was in 2013 that the United States Supreme  Court struck down this crucial provision of the Voting Rights Act in  the Shelby County v. Holder decision, opening the door for States to  reduce--I am going to say that again, Mr. Speaker--opening the door to  reduce the electoral power of minority communities.   And with that door open, many States are taking this opportunity to  pass a slew or a wave of laws, including strict voter ID requirements,  early voting cutbacks, and registration restrictions, making it harder  for many hardworking Americans to vote. That is just not right. Every  citizen should have the right to vote.   Following the 2016 election, President Trump falsely claimed that  millions voted illegally, perpetuating the myth of voter fraud long  used to justify restrictive legislation that suppresses voters in low- income areas. I stand here today to tell you that it is not true.   And when the Congressional Black Caucus hears the President of these  United States using terms like ``voter fraud'' or ``illegally voted,''  we can read between the lines, Mr. Speaker. He is signaling his intent,  in my opinion, to suppress the vote. He is signaling the support for  efforts that will make it even harder for poor people, people of color,  women, elderly people, to vote, one of the fundamental rights that we  have to vote.   While the legislative maneuvers to restrict our citizens' fundamental  right to vote should shock the conscience, it has not, and that is why  we are standing on this floor today. That is why we are asking  Democrats and Republicans to work together to correct this wrong.   We have witnessed the history of some 50-plus years of what happened  to many people in some of our Southern States. Mr. Speaker, it is just  not right, and that is why we are here today.   As former President Barack Obama said: ``This is something that has  constantly been disproved.'' As a matter of fact, ``This is fake  news.''   Now, one of my colleagues came to the floor tonight and said this is  not a Democrat or a Republican issue. Well, let me say it a little  differently. This should not be a Democrat or Republican issue; but if  it were a bipartisan issue, we wouldn't be standing here in this  Special Order hour demanding and asking that we come together, as  Democrats and Republicans, and restore the voting rights.   So let me be very clear. The Congressional Black Caucus, through the  leadership of our chairman, Congressman Cedric Richmond, through the  leadership of our power-of-the-hour chair, Congressman Marc Veasey, and  the other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, one of the largest  minority caucuses in this House, we stand ready to advocate, we stand  ready to protect those who we come here to protect.   So as elected officials, we have a responsibility to ensure the right  of ``one person, one vote,'' and part of this responsibility includes  making it easier, Mr. Speaker, not harder for citizens to vote. And we  will not stop our quest in ensuring justice for all Americans.
