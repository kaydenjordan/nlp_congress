 Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion lately,  here in Congress, about the national security concerns posed by TikTok,  whose parent company is Chinese-owned ByteDance.   Chinese law requires social media technology companies to provide  information, including individually identifiable personal information,  to the Chinese Government, when asked.   This obviously has implications for Americans' personal security and  privacy and raises troubling questions about how the Chinese Communist  Party could use TikTok for its own ends, whether that is using personal  data to develop sources for espionage or manipulating content to  advance the Communist Party's agenda. The Director of the CIA, the FBI  Director, and the Director of National Intelligence have all outlined  national security concerns with TikTok, and Members of Congress are  currently discussing various ways of addressing these concerns.   In March, Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence  Committee, and I introduced bipartisan legislation called the  Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and  Communications Technology Act--or the RESTRICT Act, the acronym--to  address the national security concerns posed not just by TikTok but by  other technologies from foreign adversary countries.   I am pleased that our bill, which is cosponsored by a full quarter of  the U.S. Senate, has received a lot of attention in the media,  attention that I hope will ensure our legislation receives a full  hearing in the Commerce Committee and a vote on the Senate floor, but  along with the attention our bill has received has come a lot of  misrepresentation about the bill's content. And I want to take just a  moment today to set the record straight on some misconceptions about  the RESTRICT Act.   First of all, many critics of the bill seem to be unaware of the fact  that the bill is closely modeled after a 2019 Executive order by  President Trump as well as a subsequent rule by the Trump Commerce  Department. So I wanted to underscore that the RESTRICT Act seeks to  codify a policy that was put in place by President Trump. Unlike some  of the other TikTok bills out there, our bill is not exclusively  focused on TikTok and would instead create a framework for reviewing  not only TikTok but any technology from a foreign adversary nation that  poses an undue national security risk.   This has led to some claims that our bill is too broad or gives the  Federal Government too much power, but nothing could be further from  the truth.   Our bill is, in fact, narrowly tailored, and it is designed not to  expand the Federal Government's power but to update authorities the  Federal Government already has to account for the digital age.   Both Democrat and Republican administrations have taken Executive  action to counter the threat posed by technology from foreign adversary  countries, but they have been limited by the fact that current law was  written before the age of the internet and is not always easily applied  to digital threats.   Our legislation, which, again, codifies an Executive order issued by  President Trump as well as a subsequent rule by the Trump Commerce  Department, would fill in the gaps in current law and ensure that it is  possible to address not just traditional risks from foreign-owned  companies but the specific  [[Page S1224]]  threats posed by foreign-owned digital technology.   I imagine some claims that our bill is too broad have arisen because  our bill is not limited to TikTok, but there is a reason for that.  First, there is reason to believe that legislation targeted solely at  TikTok would be overturned by the courts because of the Constitution's  prohibition on bills of attainder. Second, our bill would apply a way  to address more than just TikTok because this is not the first time  technology from a hostile nation has posed a serious national security  concern, and it probably won't be the last.   Before there was TikTok, we had to engage in a protracted effort to  remove technology from Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE from our  telecommunications networks--after U.S. security officials raised  concerns that much of Huawei and ZTE's equipment was built with  backdoors, giving the Chinese Communist Party access to global  communications networks.   And before Huawei and ZTE, there was Russia's Kaspersky, which  threatened the security of government-owned digital devices, and that  is just looking backward in time.   Looking forward, we are also confronting risky platforms like WeChat,  a Chinese app that has 19 million users in the United States. By many  accounts, WeChat is even worse than TikTok in terms of the Chinese  Communist Party being able to steal data, censor information, and  propagandize Americans.   No other bipartisan bill introduced in Congress does anything to  address the risks posed by this platform or other dangerous apps or  technologies. Only the RESTRICT Act contains the necessary authorities  for the Federal Government to do something about not only TikTok but  other technologies that present a potential national security risk.   Instead of trying to play catchup and find a way to individually  address each threat after it emerges, as has happened in the past, we  need a process in place to provide for an orderly and transparent  review of technologies from foreign adversary countries, and that is  what our bill would provide.    Under our bill, the Department of Commerce, in both Republican and  Democrat administrations, would review any information and  communications technology product from a foreign adversary company that  is deemed to present a potential security threat, with an emphasis on  products used in critical telecommunications infrastructure or with  serious national security implications.   And the Secretary of Commerce would be required to develop a range of  measures to mitigate the danger posed by these products, up to and  including a ban on the product in question.   Importantly, our bill would ensure transparency by requiring the  Commerce Secretary to coordinate with the Director of National  Intelligence to provide declassified information on why any measure  against technology products from foreign adversary countries were  taken.   I have mentioned that our bill is narrowly tailored. That is true  about the process created by the bill, which is designed not to expand  government but to fill a hole in current law. But it is true about the  countries whose technology is targeted for review by this bill.   The RESTRICT Act would provide for the review of technology from just  six foreign adversary countries: China, Russia, North Korea, Iran,  Venezuela, and Cuba. The Secretary of Commerce would be allowed to add  countries to this list if it became necessary, but Congress would have  the authority to reject any addition.   And contrary to claims that the act would exclude judicial review,  the RESTRICT Act specifically provides that any challenges to the act  be considered at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit.   Other charges that have been leveled against the RESTRICT Act are  about the impact the bill would supposedly have on individual  Americans. Opponents of the bill have suggested that the RESTRICT Act  would somehow infringe on Americans' First Amendment rights or target  individual Americans. Again, nothing could be further from the truth.   The RESTRICT Act would do nothing--nothing--to restrict the content  Americans can post online. Now, let me just repeat that because this is  very important: The RESTRICT Act would do nothing to restrict the  content Americans can post online.   If the RESTRICT Act becomes law, Americans will be free to post  exactly the same online content that they are posting right now.  Nothing in the bill would in any way censor what Americans can put on  the internet. And the bill would not allow the Federal Government to  surveil Americans' online content or give the government authority to  access any American's personal communications device.   Nor would the bill target individual Americans in any way. No  individual user would be prosecuted for using something like a private  VPN network to get around a potential ban on an entity like TikTok.  This legislation would simply allow for the possibility of banning  certain technologies from foreign adversary countries that pose a  threat to national security.   And the only entities that would possibly be subject to prosecution  under this legislation would be companies that deliberately violated a  prohibition on technologies that had been determined to be dangerous  enough to trigger a ban.   The digital age has provided us with enormous benefits, but  inevitably it has also come with its own unique risks and threats--not  least the risk of a hostile foreign government exploiting  communications technology for nefarious purposes.   And those threats increase substantially when we are talking about  technology produced by companies in hostile nations and affiliated with  hostile governments.   We need a process to address those threats, a narrowly targeted way  to mitigate the dangers of digital technologies from foreign adversary  countries while protecting the rights and liberties of American  citizens.   That is exactly what the RESTRICT Act would provide. I am proud of  the legislation that we have developed, and I look forward to working  with colleagues of both parties to further improve this legislation and  advance it here in the U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, today I recognize the distinguished  career, public service, and leadership of Thomas J. Heller.   Tom has served as president and CEO of Missouri River Energy Services  for 30 years, joining the company in 1992 as its fourth CEO since the  organization's founding in 1965. After leading the organization for  three decades, Tom announced his retirement, effective June 30, 2023.   Under his leadership, Missouri River Energy Services navigated a  changing energy landscape to provide reliable and resilient electricity  to 61 member communities across South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, and  North Dakota. Tom's hard work has certainly not gone unnoticed. In  2014, he was the recipient of the American Public Power Association's  Alan H. Richardson Statesmanship Award, and, in 2020, he received the  Mark Crisson Leadership and Managerial Excellence Award. Tom's  colleagues speak highly of both his work and his character, and his  departure will certainly leave big shoes to fill.   Before joining Missouri River Energy Services, Tom worked for the  Moorhead Public Service Department for 16 years, including 7 years as  general manager. Nationally, Tom serves on the executive committee of  the Transmission Access Policy Study Group, the Missouri Basin Power  Project Management Committee of Laramie River Station, and the American  Public Power Association's CEO Climate Change and Generation Policy  Task Force.   Following his retirement, Tom plans to spend more time with his  grandkids Graham and Matilda. I am grateful for his commitment to  public service, his hard work on behalf of Missouri River Energy  Services and its member communities, and, more importantly, I am proud  to call him a friend.   I commend Tom for his many great contributions throughout his long  career and wish him all the best in his well-earned retirement.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
