 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the freshman  class's effort to encourage civility in this Chamber and in our  political discourse generally.   Americans are divided. Hate speech and hate crimes are spiking. Fake  news is increasing. Terrorism threatens the world, and 60 million  refugees are displaced across the globe.   The public is convinced that elected officials don't seem to get much  done regarding the shrinking middle class, immigration reform, climate  change, gun violence, and a whole bunch more. What should we do?   Love thy neighbor: That may seem like a simplistic public policy  prescription, but love thy neighbor is a concept that can be found  across many traditions.   If we are going to get Republicans and Democrats to actually come  together as people of goodwill in search of the common good, it is  going to require us to rely on some shared principles.   Faith and religious beliefs are the most effective, existing sources  of commonality that may be relied upon. If people of different  political philosophies actually believed that their opponents were  similarly motivated by a common set of values to love thy neighbor, I  believe we would get a lot more talking and problem-solving and, yes,  less yelling and screaming.   Even nonreligious Americans have a fundamental belief in the  religion-based concept of love thy neighbor. Discussing issues civilly  and rooted in shared faith and values will result in more good work  being accomplished.   The good news is that, during the first 6 weeks, I found that many of  my colleagues seemed genuinely inspired by their faith and their  values. Maybe if we all agree to be civil and recognize that many of us  here are motivated by the same command to love thy neighbor, we might  be a little more effective.
