 Mr. President, for the last century--the whole last  century--America's prosperity was anchored on our country's unmatched  commitment to science research, technological growth, innovation, and  advanced manufacturing.   The question before the Senate, then, is simple: Will that prosperity  live on in the century to come? Are we on the brink of another  generation of American ingenuity, of American discovery, of American  leadership? By passing our CHIPS and Science bill today, the Senate  says: Yes, we are, and in a loud, bipartisan voice.   Today, by approving one of the largest investments in science,  technology, and manufacturing in decades--in decades--we say that  America's best years are yet to come.   This is a very good day for the American people and for American  innovation. The legislation is going to create good-paying jobs. It  will alleviate supply chains; it will help lower costs; and it will  protect America's national security interests.   I am confident that future generations will look back on the passage  of this bill as a turning point for American leadership in the 21st  century.   I admit that some of the policies--not all, but some are esoteric,  but they are vital. All too often we are told government and business  think short term. This is one of the most significant pieces of long- term effect and thinking legislation that we have seen in this body in  a very long time.   I believe that our grandchildren and our grandchildren's  grandchildren will work in jobs we cannot yet imagine because of the  investments we are making here today.   Like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the recent gun  safety law, the CHIPS and Science bill is one of the major bipartisan  achievements of this Congress. But reaching this point was anything but  easy.   On the contrary, the legislation has been several years in the  making, and it took a lot of twists and turns before reaching the  finish line. It brought together industry, labor, universities,  [[Page S3708]]  Governors, mayors from both parties and from every region. And I thank  my colleagues and their staff for pushing it over the line.   In 2019, I approached my Republican colleague Todd Young. We had  talked in the gym that he was interested in the same types of  investments that I was. And I said: Let's work together on legislation  to revive America's commitment to science and innovation. Together, we  drafted the first version of the Endless Frontier Act, a bill whose  policies shaped today's legislation.   A year later, we joined with Senators Cornyn and Warner to begin  addressing our Nation's chip crisis by pushing for an authorization of  new Federal chips as an incentive as part of the NDAA. And Senator  Kelly of Arizona has been a major advocate for getting these chip  programs done.   So even before this Congress began, Members on both sides knew that  we had to work together if we were to keep America competitive in the  21st century. We also knew that if we didn't get there first, our  rivals--chief among them the Chinese Communist Party--would likely beat  us to the punch and reshape the world in their authoritarian image, a  frightening, frightening process.   A month after I became majority leader, I directed the chairs and  members of our relevant committees to start drafting a legislative  package to outcompete China and create new American jobs, with the  Endless Frontier Act serving as the core of this effort.   I also instructed them to draft legislation to plug the dangerous  holes in America's semiconductor industry. I said to everyone, to  people on both sides of the aisle, that if both sides work together, I  would put a bill on the floor of the Senate later that spring, and that  is what happened when we overwhelmingly passed the U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act in June 2021. It took 3 weeks, lots of debate,  amendments, just as the Senate ought to work, even on major and  difficult legislation, as this has been.   Senators Cantwell and Wicker were tremendous leaders in this effort  and skillfully managed the floor process. They deserve a great deal of  praise not only for passing last year's bill but for their efforts this  year as well.   A year later, the legislation we are passing today contains many of  the critical investments in that bill. Both bills make historic  investments in science and innovation--the original Endless Frontier  and USICA bill and the bill we are passing today, CHIPS plus Science.  Both bills make those investments.   We will plant the seeds for developing the tech hubs of tomorrow in  places with great potential but which have been overshadowed by cities  like San Francisco or Boston or Austin or New York City. The bill will  help turn cities like Buffalo and Indianapolis into new centers for  innovation, and the result will be countless new, good-paying jobs and  a bright future for those areas for years to come.   Both bills will help end the chips crisis by offering tens of  billions of dollars to encourage American chip manufacturing and R&D.  And, if anything, this year's version is stronger because of the ITC  provisions. It will create tens of thousands of high-tech manufacturing  and Davis-Bacon construction jobs from Albany, NY, to New Albany, OH,  and beyond. It is going to lower costs for cars, washing machines, and  so much more in the long run because our chip shortage will be  alleviated.   Both bills establish the National Foundation tech directorate and  provide funding to the Department of Energy to achieve new  breakthroughs in the technologies like AI, quantum computing, cyber  security, renewable energy, 5G, biotech, and other discoveries yet  unknown. And both bills provide funding to build wireless communication  supply chain to counter Huawei. This was a top priority for my  colleague Mark Warner, and I thank him for his efforts in this regard.   The bottom line is this: Today's legislation is one of the largest  investments in science, technology, and advanced manufacturing in  decades.   Now, of course, while this bill contains many critical investments in  chips and scientific research, there are other major proposals from  both sides that are still in the works within the conference committee.  That important work must continue. It will. And it is my intention to  put the conference committee on the floor in September after the work  is complete.   So let me be clear. Today is a very good day for the American people  and for the future of our country. I believe firmly that, when signed  into law, this bill will reawaken the spirit of discovery, innovation,  and optimism that made America the envy of the world and will continue  to do so. Because of the investments we are approving today, America  will be the place where the next transformational breakthroughs in  industry and science occur.   Nearly 80 years ago, Dr. Vannevar Bush, the head of the U.S. Office  of Scientific Research, wrote in a report to President Truman that  ``without scientific progress, no amount of achievement in other  directions can ensure our health, prosperity, and security in the  modern world.'' The name of that report? It was called ``Science: The  Endless Frontier.'' It is the inspiration for much of the work we have  dedicated to passing this bill today.   In the wake of Dr. Bush's report, we created the National Science  Foundation, funded the National Energy Laboratories, split the atom,  spliced the gene, landed a man on the Moon, and unleashed the internet.  We generated decades of American prosperity and fostered an innate  sense of optimism in the American spirit.   Today, we face the great task of renewing and strengthening that  legacy in a world of fierce competition. It is no longer a situation  where we can just leave it up to corporate America because we didn't  have competition. Now there are nation-states funding and aiding their  corporations, and authoritarian governments around the world are doing  that and cheering for us to fail--cheering for us, hoping that we will  sit on our hands and not adapt to the changes in the 21st century. They  believe that squabbling democracies like ours can't unite around  national priorities like this one. They believe that democracy itself  is a relic of the past and that, by beating us to emerging  technologies, autocracies around the world hope to reshape the world in  their own image.   Well, let me tell you something: I believe in America. I believe in  our system. I believe that they will not succeed. I believe that this  legislation will enable the United States to outinnovate, outproduce,  and outcompete the world in the industries of the future, and I believe  that the strongly bipartisan work on this bill revealed that, in this  Chamber, we all believe--all of us, Democrats and Republicans--that  another American century lies on the horizon.   For this, these many worthy reasons, let us pass the CHIPS and  Science bill today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes.    Mr. President, this is a very good day for the American  people, for American leadership, and for American prosperity in the  21st century. After years of hard work, the Senate is passing the  largest investment in science, technology, and advanced manufacturing  in decades.   This CHIPS and Science bill is going to create millions of good- paying jobs down the road. It will alleviate supply chains, it will  help lower costs, and it  [[Page S3715]]  will protect America's national security interests.   All too often, our government and our businesses are accused of being  too short term, but this is one of the most significant long-term  thinking bills we have passed in a very long time. I told our caucus  yesterday that our grandchildren will hold good-paying jobs in  industries we can't even imagine because of what we are doing right  now.   And we did it together, both sides cooperating in good faith on some  truly difficult issues. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle for their superb work on this legislation: my colleague  Senator Young, with whom I originally authored the Endless Frontier  Act, as well as Senator Cantwell, our conference chair, and Senators  Wicker and Warner and Cornyn and Kelly. I also want to thank Senators  Warnock, Brown, and Sinema for their help and Leader McConnell for his  support as well as all members of the conference committee and all the  individual Senators--just about every one of us--who helped shape this  legislation. These are moments when the Senate is at its very best.   This is going to go down as one of the major bipartisan achievements  of this Congress, along with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  and the recent gun safety law. The American people deserve to see more  examples like this, of both sides coming together to do very, very big  things that will leave a lasting impact on our country.   And I am confident that future generations will look back on the  passage of this bill as a turning point for American leadership in the  21st century. And we are paying attention to all of America. We are  making sure tech hubs will be located not just in the big, big  megalopolises like San Francisco or New York City or Boston but in  places like Buffalo and Syracuse and Rochester and Indianapolis and  Omaha--not just major cities.   For decades, it was America's fierce commitment to scientific  research, technological growth, and advanced manufacturing that made us  the envy of the world. That funding that we put into science created  the greatest laboratories, split the atom, spliced the gene, landed a  man on the Moon, and unleashed the internet. We generated decades of  American prosperity and fostered an innate sense of optimism in the  American spirit. And we made the world a safer, more hospitable place  for our democratic values.   Today, we face the great task of renewing and strengthening that  spirit in this century, in a world of fierce competition and hungry  authoritarians. It is no longer the case where we can just leave it up  to corporate America. Now there are nation-states and authoritarian  governments funding and aiding these corporations to come to their  shores. Authoritarian nations are cheering for us to fail, hoping we  sit on our hands and fail to adapt to the changes of the 21st century.   We dare not cede the mantle of global leadership on our watch. We  dare not permit America to become a middling nation in the middle of  this century.   No, we mean for America to lead this century. We mean for America to  prosper and grow just as we have done throughout history. It won't  happen on its own, but today we are laying the foundation for a bold  and thriving future. Today, by passing this CHIPS and Science bill, we  are making clear that we believe America's best days are yet to come.   I yield the floor.                           Vote on Motion to Concur     Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the failed  cloture vote.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for  evidence in a criminal action pending in Ohio State court. In this  action, the defendant is charged with inducing panic and aggravated  menacing at a Social Security office arising out of threatening  statements he allegedly made in a telephone call with an employee in  Senator Portman's Columbus, OH, office.   Trial in this case is scheduled to commence on July 28, 2022, in Ohio  State court. The prosecutor is seeking testimony at trial from Aidan  Gavin, an employee in the Senator's office who received the call at  issue. Senator Portman would like to cooperate with this request by  providing relevant Senate employee testimony and, if necessary,  documents.   This resolution would authorize the production of relevant testimony  and documents from Mr. Gavin, with representation by the Senate legal  counsel.    Mr. President, another criminal trial arising out of the  events of January 6, 2021, is scheduled to begin on August 15, 2022, in  Federal district court in the District of Columbia. The defendant in  this case is charged with five counts: obstructing the counting by  Congress of the electoral ballots for President and Vice President;  entering and remaining in a restricted area within the United States  Capitol grounds; unlawful parading, demonstrating, and picketing; and  two counts of engaging in disorderly and disruptive conduct.   The prosecution has requested trial testimony, if necessary, from  Jeffrey Kent, Director of the Press Photographers' Gallery, which  operates under the authority of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of  the Senate, relating to the Gallery's regulation of access to the  Capitol by bona fide news photographers and heads of photographic news  bureaus.   The prosecution is also seeking trial testimony, if necessary, from  Nate Russell and Diego Torres, custodians of records in the Senate  Recording Studio, which also operates under the authority of the  Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, to authenticate Senate  Recording Studio video of that day.   Senate Sergeant at Arms Gibson would like to cooperate with these  requests by providing relevant testimony in this proceeding from  Messrs. Kent, Russell, and Torres, respectively.   In keeping with the rules and practices of the Senate, this  resolution would authorize the production of relevant testimony from  Messrs. Kent, Russell, and Torres, with representation by the Senate  legal counsel.  [[Page S3738]]
