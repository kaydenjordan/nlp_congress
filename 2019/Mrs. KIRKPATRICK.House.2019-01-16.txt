 Madam Speaker, I stand here today on behalf of  southern Arizonans and all our Federal employees. I stand here as their  public servant because I work for them. They have called, sent letters,  and shown up in our offices, pleading for action. They are scared, and  not because of immigration. They are scared they can't pay rent, and  they are scared they might not be able to feed their children.   To our constituents at home, I am sorry, but be outraged.   It is outrageous that John from southern Arizona, a Customs and  Border Patrol agent, is furloughed and worried about how he is going to  keep the lights on.   It is outrageous that Cochise County Community College students, many  of whom are veterans, are worried they may not receive their financial  aid.   It is outrageous that over 900,000 Arizona participants in SNAP, 72  percent of them with children, are in jeopardy of losing their  nutrition assistance.   Madam Speaker, the majority in this House has publicly stated our  willingness to work with the President. We must reopen government. Be  outraged, because I sure am.                            ____________________
