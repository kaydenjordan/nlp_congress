 Mr. Speaker, President Biden promised to ``shut down the  COVID-19 virus, not the country.'' He also promised ``access to  regular, reliable, and free COVID-19 testing.''   But as we near a year into his Presidency, he has failed to deliver  on these basic promises. In the Trump administration we got Operation  Warp Speed. However, for the Biden administration we seem to be getting  operation no rush.   President Biden alone is to blame for the current testing shortage  that the American people are facing. Just look at the facts.   In the spring of 2021, when a group of health agency officials  approached the White House on a proposal to purchase millions of rapid  tests, the White House officials never followed up.   In October 2021, White House officials rejected a proposal for free  rapid tests for the holiday season.   In December 2021, President Biden announced that 500 million tests  would be sent out in January 2022, however, the contract for these  tests has yet to be signed.   The bottom line is that President Biden failed to meet his promises,  and the American people are paying the price.                            ____________________
