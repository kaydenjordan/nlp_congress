 Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the House  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and  Central Asia, I am grateful to recognize the third anniversary of the  successful Abraham Accords on September 15.   Under the leadership of President Donald Trump, this historic  agreement between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, the United States,  and later Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan represents the most significant  step toward a stable and positive Arab-Israeli relationship in modern  history.   It marked the first public normalization of relations between an Arab  country and Israel since Jordan in 1994.   In June, I led the bipartisan U.S.-Israel Partnership and Abraham  Accords Enhancement Act of 2023, which reauthorizes key cooperative  programs between the United States and Israel and fosters the  utilization of existing programs to help expand the Abraham Accords.   Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Morocco in earthquake  recovery.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with the Biden open borders.                            ____________________
