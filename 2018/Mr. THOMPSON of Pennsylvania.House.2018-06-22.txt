 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, today marks the beginning  of Religious Freedom Week.   Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right and protected by our  Constitution. The First Amendment's protection of freedom of religion,  along with the freedom of speech and the press, afford us the  opportunity to have open and thoughtful debates on the floor of the  House every day, and it protects the space in which members of all  religions can peacefully join together and solve the world's most  pressing issues.   For thousands of years, people have sought the freedom to practice  their religion without the fear of persecution. Since our founding, we  have continued to recognize freedom for all.   Our great Nation and its foundation of freedom and liberty for all  were conceived by individuals in search of religious freedom.   Mr. Speaker, the United States of America will always be a beacon of  light in the world, and we will always  [[Page H5510]]  protect our fundamental unified commitment of religious freedom. It is  a central part of what makes us exceptional and affords our citizens  the right to live in a free society.                            ____________________
