 Mr. Speaker, this is a big day. Today we pass the first  minimum wage increase for workers in decades.   And, yes, I am proud to represent Seattle, a leader in the Fight for  $15, where I served on the committee that actually drafted the  legislation that passed, ultimately.   It has been 4 years since Seattle raised the wage, and I want to tell  my colleagues across the aisle what the effect of that increase has  been.   Seattle is flourishing. Today we have one of the lowest unemployment  rates in the country, and jobs are growing steadily.   Last year, Forbes ranked Seattle the number one best place for  business and careers in 2018, and despite the doom and gloom  predictions from the National Restaurant Association when we passed the  bill, what we have seen is what The Seattle Times called ``a crazy  restaurant boom''--that is a quote--with new jobs created every year.   The most recent and credible research shows that wages for Seattle's  low-wage workers went up without any negative impact on employment, and  local food prices remained constant so that families could better  afford to buy healthy food.   When we increased the minimum wage in Seattle, Mr. Speaker, we got  strong businesses, healthy families, and flourishing communities. All  American workers deserve the same thing. Let's raise the wage today.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a second letter from the  National Employment Law Project in support of this legislation.                                                      July 16, 2019.        The undersigned organizations enthusiastically support the       Raise the Wage Act of 2019, introduced by Senators Bernie       Sanders (VT) and Patty Murray (WA), Representatives Robert C.       ``Bobby'' Scott (VA), Mark Paean (WI) and Stephanie Murphy       (FL).        If enacted, this legislation would:        Gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour in       2025;        After 2025, adjust the minimum wage each year to keep pace       with growth in the typical worker's wages;        Phase out the outdated subminimum wage for tipped workers,       which has been frozen at a meager $2.13 since 1991; and,        Sunset the much criticized ability of employers to pay       workers with disabilities a subminimum wage through       certificates issued by DOL.        Phase out the subminimum wage for workers under the age of       20.        At a time when wage stagnation and income inequality pose       serious threats to our families and our economy, the Raise       the Wage Act of 2019 will begin to reverse that cycle and       raise pay broadly across the bottom of the workforce.       According to the Economic Policy Institute, this Act will       deliver long-overdue raises to more than 1 in 4 workers, 90%       of whom are over the age of 20. The average age of workers       who would get a raise is 35, nearly half have some years of       college education. In fact, those who work year-round would       see a raise in the order of $3,000 a year, which is enough to       make a tremendous difference in the life of a preschool       teacher, bank teller, or fast-food worker who today struggles       to get by on around $20,000 per year.        28 percent are working parents with children, and half have       family incomes of less than $40,000 per year. Women make up       nearly 58 percent of the workers who would benefit from a $15       minimum wage, which would be instrumental in helping to close       the gender-wage-gap. Raising the minimum wage to $15 would       also significantly benefit workers of color, with 38 percent       of African American workers and 33 percent of Latinos seeing       a pay increase once this law goes into effect.        These are the frontline workers who make America run-yet       due to the erosion of the real value of the minimum wage over       the last half century, they are struggling even as our       economy enjoys a solid recovery.        The time for the Raise the Wage Act is long overdue, and we       cannot delay in working toward its passage. We call on       Congress to enact this important piece of legislation as       quickly as possible, and for President Trump to sign it when       it comes to his desk.
