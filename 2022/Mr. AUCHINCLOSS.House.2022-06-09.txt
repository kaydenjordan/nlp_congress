 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  commonsense gun safety legislation my colleagues and I have introduced  this week. The horrific shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde are a painful  reminder that action to stop gun violence is long overdue and that  Republicans' decades of stonewalling is an intentional decision to  allow Americans, including children, to continue to be slaughtered.   In particular, the GOP and its gun policy puppet master, the NRA, is  obsessed with assault weapons. As a marine, I ate, trained, patrolled,  and slept with an assault weapon for 4 years. These are weapons of war  designed to kill humans. There is no constitutional defense for  civilian ownership of assault weapons even under the District of  Columbia v. Heller interpretation of the Second Amendment, and there is  certainly no rational explanation for why a mentally disturbed young  man should be able to purchase a weapon of war along with high-capacity  magazines with no questions asked.   The GOP needs to stand up to the NRA and its dangerous and juvenile  obsession with assault weapons. Otherwise, this slaughter will  continue.                            ____________________
