 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   When I was younger, we seemed to have a lot of American heroes  around, from the Greatest Generation that won World War II to the civil  rights leaders of the 1950s, to the men who walked on the Moon. To call  one of them a colleague was one of the greatest honors of my life, and  it hit me every day I saw John Lewis on the House floor.   ``Good morning, sir,'' was may usual greeting. Not because of my  Marine background or his age--most people in Congress are older than  me--but simply because there is nobody in Congress who had more  respect. Nobody.   But he was much more than just a towering figure. He was a loving,  caring, indefatigably optimistic friend and mentor, especially to young  people like me.   John and I took bets on the 2017 Super Bowl, with the winner  committing to visiting the loser's district. After the Patriots had the  greatest comeback in Super Bowl history, we started talking dates for  his trip to Massachusetts. But with a few conflicts and his getting  older, I proposed an alternative: a visit to some of the civil rights  sites in his hometown.   Through all the turmoil of the last few years, there are only two  times I have cried in Congress: visiting the prison in Hanoi with John  McCain and visiting Atlanta with John Lewis.   If you ever doubt what a hero John and his fellow American patriots  were, spend some time in Atlanta or Birmingham or Selma, where he came  within an inch of his life fighting to uphold a nation's ideals even  when the nation said they don't apply to you or your family.   I found myself wondering if I would have had the courage to join in  those protests to be a freedom fighter, to change a nation. That is  what John Lewis did. He changed America, and in so doing, he changed  the world.   And he never lost faith in either as he did it.  [[Page H3688]]    During the impeachment trial, I asked him if he had ever seen it this  bad. And while he told me never, not even during the civil rights  movement, because he said there was more hope, more movement, he  nonetheless maintained his characteristic optimism and looked at me  confidently like a preacher to his Sunday school student and said: But,  don't worry. We will get through it. Keep the faith, brother. Keep the  faith.   We miss you, John.                                time  2115
