 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member  Walz. What an honor it is to work with these two gentlemen on veterans'  issues.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 467, the VA  Scheduling Accountability Act.    This commonsense legislation codifies an important measure of  oversight and accountability of VA facilities to prevent scheduling  manipulation or, in the vernacular, ``cooking the books,'' that has  harmed veterans for so long.   Hearings held by the House VA Committee and investigations by the VA  inspector general and the GAO have, unfortunately, confirmed many of  the allegations of cooking books and falsified wait-time data at  facilities around the country.   The VA has a procedure for scheduling veterans' medical appointments,  which includes 19 different items, such as ensuring that a patient's  desired appointment date is not altered and that staff are fully  trained. Importantly, the directive requires each facility to certify  compliance with all of these 19 items every year.   However, an August 2014 VA inspector general report uncovered that,  in May 2013, a senior VA official waived the certification requirement  that year, essentially putting the facility on an honor system,  allowing them to self-certify.   Without this crucial accountability mechanism, bad actors were given  free rein to manipulate wait-time data and ignore the VA's required  scheduling practices. Meanwhile, veterans faced significant delays in  getting the care they needed while, in some extreme cases, veterans  died.   Since that time, the VA has reinstated the certification  requirements. However, serious problems remain, as evidenced by a  recent VA investigation of a clinic in my own district that I requested  after some brave individuals came forward with allegations of  wrongdoing.                                time  1515    The VA found that the clinic scheduled appointments for veterans  without the veterans' knowledge and canceled them on the day of the  appointment in order to fill their schedule for that day. If the VA had  conducted proper audits of that facility's scheduling practices last  year, this misconduct could have been prevented. The VA's report  recommended a review of scheduling compliance for all medical  facilities in the region.   The VA's continued inability to reform itself from within is the  reason we need to pass this bill. This bill will require each facility  director to annually certify compliance with the current scheduling  directive or any successive directive that replaces it, and, most  importantly, it will prohibit any future waivers. The bill also  provides accountability by making a director ineligible for salary  bonuses if their facility fails to certify compliance, and it requires  the VA to report to Congress a list of these facilities that are not in  compliance. This will provide more oversight of the VA, ensure that  Congress is aware of noncompliant facilities, and end the reckless  practice of self-certification.   Mr. Speaker, our veterans risked life and limb for our freedom, but  too often the VA has let them down. It is time to put an end to this  scheduling manipulation--the cooking of the books--and the false wait- time data.   Holding every VA facility accountable for following scheduling rules  is an important, commonsense step as we work to fix the VA so it works  for the veterans in our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 467, the VA  Scheduling Accountability Act.
