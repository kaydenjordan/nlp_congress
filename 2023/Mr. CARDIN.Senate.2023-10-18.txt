 Madam President, next week, on October 24, family and  friends will gather to celebrate the life of Joyce Leviton, a beloved  member of my staff who passed away after a courageous battle with  cancer. I imagine it will be a rather large gathering because Joyce  touched so many people. And while we grieve her death, the event will  indeed be a celebration of her life, a life she lived brimming with  contagious happiness and enthusiasm and kindness.   Joyce was born and raised in Baltimore and graduated from Forest Park  High School and Towson University, earning her bachelor's degree in  history in 1966. In 1970, she went to work for the Baltimore City  Department of Planning as a community planner for the Third District, a  position she held until 1988, when she became chief of community  planning. She excelled at her job because she loved it but, more  importantly, because she loved people and she loved Baltimore. Joyce  had a knack for bringing people together and giving them a voice in  their communities and in the city. Everyone was Joyce's neighbor. As I  said at the time of her death, ``Joyce is Baltimore and she loved our  community and wanted it to be the best it could possibly be, and always  went the extra mile. When she spoke about Baltimore, it was from the  heart. She was a person who made a difference.''   I was fortunate to have Joyce work on my Senate campaign in 2006 and  then join my staff as a trusted senior adviser and community liaison  after the election. Joyce would organize groups of people from  Baltimore and across the State and bring them to the Capitol for tours  and luncheons and lectures. She met and worked with Maryland's arts and  humanities and cultural organizations. She was my ambassador. Everyone  I met--from all corners of Maryland, it seemed--already knew Joyce and  was so fond of her.   The Baltimore Sun obituary referred to Joyce as a ``political  junkie.'' That is an understatement. Joyce started working on campaigns  at an early age, and she never stopped. She was deeply involved from  the national to the State to the local level. As the Sun noted, Joyce  was one of the founders of the Second District New Democratic Club in  the early 1970s ``one of the first political groups that joined Black  and white residents from across the city and resulted in integrated and  progressive tickets for city and state elections.''   Joyce was never content to rest on her laurels--or even rest at all.  She was a member of the steering committee for the Baltimore City Fair  and National Advisory Council of Neighborhood Reinvestment; a board  member and vice president of the Citizens Planning and Housing  Association; a founder of Women Employed in Baltimore and Live  Baltimore, an organization that encouraged people to move to Baltimore;  a member of the National Organization for Women; executive secretary of  Young Democrats of Baltimore; and an active member of Beth Am  Synagogue. She formed or joined book clubs, and she loved to attend  cultural events. Joyce was the epitome of a civic activist and  absolutely committed to social justice, what we members of the Jewish  faith call ``Tzedakah''--making the world a fair and more just place-- and ``Tikkun Olam''--repairing the world. We are closer to that ideal  because of Joyce.   Another one of Joyce's lifelong passions was the Baltimore Orioles.  She moved to Otterbein in 1981. When Oriole Park at Camden Yards opened  in 1992, she could walk to the stadium to attend games, which she did-- often. She was no casual fan. The regular season wasn't enough for  Joyce; she enjoyed going to Sarasota to watch the team during spring  training.   Joyce loved people, but she especially loved her family: her sisters  Susan and Audrey and their husbands Jeffrey Lauren and Peter Martin.  She doted on her nephews and nieces and their spouses, Jake (Stephanie  Martin), Liz (Shai Lauros), and Josh (Taieri McKenzie) and their  children: Max, Lucy, and Emma Martin; Reuben and Micah Lauros; and Lola  Lauren. Extended family includes her cousin Neil Tucker, who was more  like a brother to her, his wife Laura, and their children Michael,  Molly, and Will. She loved to spend weekends and vacations with her  family in Rehoboth Beach, Maine, and Vermont.   Everyone who knew Joyce will miss her, but we are all so grateful for  the opportunity we had to share her friendship and love. And we are all  so grateful for the indelible mark she made on Baltimore and across  Maryland.   The Baltimore Sun had a lovely obituary, and I would ask unanimous  consent that it be printed in the Record following my remarks.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Baltimore Sun, Jul. 27, 2023]   Joyce E. Leviton, Former Baltimore Community Planning Chief, Activist                          and Civic Booster, Dies                        (By Frederick N. Rasmussen)         Joyce E. Leviton, a political activist and civic booster       who was chief of community planning for the Baltimore       Department of Planning and later became a member of Sen.       Benjamin L. Cardin's staff, died of cancer July 19 at       Gilchrist Center in Towson. The longtime Otterbein resident       was 78.        ``Joyce is Baltimore and she loved our community and wanted       it to be the best it could possibly be, and always went the       extra mile,'' Sen. Cardin said. ``When she spoke about       Baltimore, it was from the heart. She was a person who made a       difference. She touched so many lives in a genuine and       special way.''        Former City Council President Mary Pat Clarke said: ``She       meant the world to me and was the center of life itself and       in all of its dimensions. The loss of Joyce is the loss of       the center of life that no one can replace. Everywhere and       everyone, she loved all comers.''        ``Joyce was ebullient, colorful, kind, a great listener and       dedicated to public service,'' said Phoebe Stein, director of       the Federation of State Humanities Councils and former       executive director of Maryland Humanities, who was a longtime       friend.        ``She was very vibrant and curious about the world and took       joy in her work and connecting with people. She lived life to       the fullest, her family was her joy, and she was interested       in everything that was going on in Maryland and particularly       Baltimore.''        Joyce Ellen Leviton, daughter of Max Leviton, a       bacteriologist and manager at the Joseph E. Seagram and Sons       Inc. distillery in Relay, and Goldie Bernstein Leviton, an       administrative assistant for the state Department of Human       Resources, was born in Baltimore and raised in Pimlico       neighborhood.  [[Page S5084]]         She was a graduate of Forest Park High School and attended       the University of Maryland, College Park before earning a       bachelor's degree in history in 1966 from what is now Towson       University.        ``From an early age, Joyce didn't want to be politically       like our parents. She was a progressive Democrat and wanted       to fight for people,'' said a sister, Susan Leviton of       Otterbein.        A political junkie from an early age, Ms. Leviton worked on       Rep. Carlton R. Sickles' unsuccessful 1966 Maryland       gubernatorial run, in which he narrowly lost the Democratic       nomination to George P. Mahoney--a contest that had racial       overtones.        Ms. Leviton was one of the founders in the 1970s of the       Second District New Democratic Club, which was one of the       first political groups that joined Black and white residents       from across the city and resulted in integrated and       progressive tickets for city and state elections.        ``The success of that campaign led to future campaigns such       as the Clarke/Dalton team, Mary Pat Clarke, Clarence H. `Du'       Burns, Nathan Irby, Maggie McIntosh, Anne Perkins and many       others,'' according to a biographical profile submitted by       Ms. Leviton's family.        She was a member of the national staff for George McGovern       and John Kerry. In 2006, she was a volunteer coordinator and       advance coordinator for Sen. Cardin's campaign. She attended       five Democratic conventions.        If politics helped define who Ms. Leviton was, it was also       her abiding love for Baltimore that shaped her long career       with the city planning department.        Ms. Leviton joined the department as a 3rd District       community planner in 1970, when it was headed by the       legendary and visionary Larry Reich. She held this role until       being appointed chief of community planning in 1988.        ``She loved communities and liked getting neighbors       involved and having a voice in the city. That's the theme of       Joyce,'' her sister said. ``She loved the city and was quite       the ambassador for Baltimore. When new people came to town,       she got them to move to the city and stay in the city.''        ``Joyce and I met at the planning department in 1971 when       we were both assigned to review hundreds of zoning changes       for the Planning commission under the recently adopted zoning       code,'' Alfred W. Barry III, who retired as assistant       planning director in 1995, wrote in an email.        ``This work took her throughout the city and her interest       in neighborhoods blossomed. From there she became the 3rd       District community planner and subsequently chief of       community planning, where she hired and mentored two       community planners, Thomas J. Stosur and Chris Ryer, who       later became planning directors,'' wrote Mr. Barry, the       founder and president of AB Associates.        Said Mr. Stosur, who headed the department from 2009 until       retiring in 2018: ``First of all, Joyce was an incredible       Baltimore booster and was so enthusiastic and brought that to       her work with the planning department and was overjoyed to be       a part of it.        ``She said it was her `favorite job ever,' and she was very       good at developing relationships with neighborhoods and       politicians. She was the combination of enthusiasm and       honesty, and that's what was so impressive about Joyce. As a       founding member of the New Democratic Club, her love and       skill at community-based politics fed naturally into her       successful role planning to ensure that city neighborhoods       had a voice.''        After working on Sen. Cardin's 2006 campaign, Ms. Leviton       joined his Capitol Hill staff in 2007 as a senior adviser.        ``When Joyce died, I heard from dozens and dozens of people       from all walks of life who had been touched by her,'' he       said. ``When she was given the diagnosis of cancer about a       year ago, she still kept going and remained fully engaged.       She was just a lovely person.''        ``Joyce's position on Sen. Cardin's staff could never       summarize all that she did for the people of Maryland,'' said       Phoebe Stein, director of the Federation of State Humanities       Councils and former executive director of Maryland       Humanities, who is a longtime friend.        ``She had an amazing ability, a gift really, to bridge the       D.C. and Baltimore, and many communities in between. Of       course, she was at every Cardin event, but more amazingly,       she was at every cultural event in Maryland that mattered to       her and the senator.        ``And when she arrived, she was informed, focused, smiling       and authentically supportive. She knew the ins and outs of       every cultural organization in Maryland. You will not find a       smarter, kinder, more capable, more knowledgeable advocate       for Maryland's cultural sector anywhere.''        Said Mr. Barry: ``Her role as an advance person for       political campaigns came naturally. She could enter a room       filled with strangers and leave with five invitations for       dinner.''        With the coronavirus pandemic coming in 2020, Ms. Leviton       began working from Sen. Cardin's office and had not retired       at her death.        Ms. Leviton cut a wide swath across numerous boards and       commissions in the city, including serving as a member of the       steering committee for the Baltimore City Fair and National       Advisory Council of Neighborhood Reinvestment, and as a board       member and vice president of Citizens Planning and Housing       Association.        She was a founder of Women Employed in Baltimore and Live       Baltimore, an organization that encouraged people to settle       and stay in the city. She was also a member of the National       Organization for Women, executive secretary of Young       Democrats of Baltimore, and a member of Beth Am Synagogue,       where she on the social action committee.        Being a resident of Otterbein since 1981 allowed Ms.       Leviton to indulge her lifelong passion for the Orioles and       walk to games at Camden Yards.        She was an integral part of the South Baltimore-Federal       Hill social scene, where she had established a book club and       enjoyed dining in restaurants and cafes.        An inveterate traveler, she enjoyed visiting Europe,       Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Maine and Vermont.        Plans for an autumn celebration of life gathering are       incomplete.        In addition to her sister, Ms. Leviton is survived by       another sister, Audrey Leviton of Homeland, and several       nieces and nephews.                            ____________________     Madam President, on October 26, the University of  Baltimore Merrick School of Business Real Estate and Economic  Development Advisory Board are hosting their annual ``Lessons from  Legends'' celebration. This  [[Page S5085]]  year's honoree is my dearest friend, Stanley S. Fine, a partner at  Rosenberg Martin Greenberg, LLP. Stanley is indeed a legend. As the  announcement of the celebration notes, ``The city's skyline and  neighborhoods highlight Stanley's vast impact on Baltimore; from office  buildings to shopping centers and local businesses, from industrial  buildings and office parks to neighborhood restaurants and pickleball  courts.'' As his lifelong friend and law partner Ben Rosenberg has  said, ``Wherever you look at bright spots in Baltimore, chances are  you'll see something that Stanley has helped bring about.'' Stanley and  Ben went through grade school, college--Johns Hopkins University--law  school--the University of Maryland School of Law--and service in the  U.S. Coast Guard Reserve together.   My wife Myrna and I have known Stanley since we were all in junior  high school together. For us, it is a family affair: Stanley's wife  Bailey ran my reelection campaign to the Maryland House of Delegates in  1982 and then served as my campaign aide during my first congressional  race in 1986; as my district director for 20 years; and, finally, as my  State director during my first term in the Senate before she retired at  the end of 2012. This couple has devoted their lives to strengthening  our community and helping those in need. Stanley and Bailey will be  celebrating their 52nd wedding anniversary on November 28. They have  two lovely adult children Michael and Laura and four grandchildren.  Michael and his wife Whitney have two daughters Riley and Blakely;  Laura and her husband Ben Liebman have two sons Eli and Brooks.   If I were to recite all of Stanley's accomplishments and awards, I  would surely run out of breath. But I will mention a few: recipient of  the Baltimore District Council of the Urban Land Institute's--ULI--2016  Lifetime Achievement Award; cofounder of the Baltimore Development  Workgroup; director of the Maryland State Lottery Agency and chairman  of the Maryland State Lottery Commission; former member of the  Baltimore City Planning Commission; and president of a community  association. Best Lawyers in America magazine has repeatedly recognized  Stanley as ``Land Use & Zoning Lawyer of the Year.'' Baltimore Magazine  has repeatedly recognized Stanley as one of ``Maryland's Super  Lawyers.''   Stanley's brilliance as a lawyer merely followed his brilliance as an  athlete. While he was a freshman at Johns Hopkins University, he played  in the first game of Baltimore's box lacrosse league, televised live in  1962, and scored a game-high four goals for his club team, which won  the game. He had a wicked left-handed shot. At the university, he was  the backbone of a tenacious midfield for the Blue Jays varsity lacrosse  team and joined the Phi Sigma Delta fraternity. His athletic skills  continue to this day, for you can normally find Stanley in the mornings  on a pickleball court. He still has a wicked left-handed shot.   If you didn't know all of this about Stanley, you wouldn't learn it  from him. He is inherently self-effacing. He never seeks plaudits or  accolades or publicity. He is content to continue finding creative  solutions to some of Baltimore's toughest land use challenges by  patiently building consensus among all stakeholders: city, county, and  State government officials, developers and other business interests,  community planners, architects, engineering firms, historic  preservationists, and the like.   In 1943, as members of the British House of Commons debated how to  rebuild their chamber after Nazi incendiary bombs destroyed it, Prime  Minister Winston Churchill stated, ``We shape our buildings and  afterwards our buildings shape us.'' Baltimoreans are so fortunate that  Stanley Fine has dedicated his extraordinary life to shaping the city's  buildings. I ask my Senate colleagues to join Myrna and me, Stanley's  family, and his colleagues, friends, and admirers too numerous to count  in celebrating one of Baltimore's true legends.                            ____________________
