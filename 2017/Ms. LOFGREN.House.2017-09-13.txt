 Mr. Speaker, the title of this bill is the Criminal  Alien Gang Member Removal Act, but, as we have seen in the past, the  name of a bill is not always reflected in the actual text of the bill,  and that is true in this case, regrettably.   As has been mentioned, section 2(a) of the bill defines criminal  gangs so broadly as to sweep in many individuals that no one would  think of as a gang member.   The bill, for example, would classify any group of five that engages  in harboring as a criminal gang. Now, harboring includes giving shelter  to, or transporting, or providing other kinds of aid to undocumented  immigrants. This means, as has been mentioned, that a religious  organization that aids undocumented immigrants could be defined as a  criminal gang. And any immigrant clergy or congregationalist that  assists that organization would be deportable if they are a legal  permanent resident, or on a religious worker visa, or the like.   Now, this isn't just a hypothetical. During the 1980s, members of the  religious communities were repeatedly prosecuted for providing  transportation to undocumented immigrants. In one fell swoop, this bill  could turn nuns into gang members. And that is why I include in the  Record, Mr. Speaker, the letter that Mr. Hastings referenced from the  nuns objecting to this piece of legislation for those reasons.                                               Network Advocates for                                         Catholic Social Justice.         Dear Members of the House of Representatives: Exactly one       week ago, President Trump announced the termination of the       Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program,       putting at risk the lives and well-being of undocumented       immigrant youth who are valued members of our communities.       DACA has protected nearly 800,000 immigrant youth from       deportation and allowed them to work, attend school, and be       publicly participating members of our communities.        The President's action threatens every DACA recipient and       causes great anxiety. This anxiety exists not just with the       DACA youth but also in the broader community. We all are       concerned about their future and fear their deportation to a       country they neither know nor call home. Today, rather than       taking up President Trump's challenge to ``fix'' DACA, the       House Judiciary Committee is choosing instead to stir up       politics of fear in our communities by proceeding with H.R.       3697 in an effort to criminalize the undocumented status of       some members of our communities. Network Lobby for Catholic       Social Justice strongly urges Members of the House to vote NO       on H.R. 3697.        The faith community has vigorously opposed any bill that       would promote the Trump Administration's stated goal of       engaging in ``mass deportation'' of immigrants. The Trump       agenda seeks to allow for the detention and removal of large       numbers of immigrants without any criminal records. H.R. 3697       is just the latest bill targeted to achieve this goal. The       bill purports to make communities safer by targeting the       deportation of people involved in criminal activity in gangs.       However, it is poorly drafted and overboard with sweeping       generalizations. It even allows for the removal of       individuals based on the mere subjective belief of an       association to criminal activity. There is no requirement of       a criminal conviction for deportation. This violates any       principle of fairness as well as the Constitution's guarantee       of due process.        As people of faith, we are called to love our neighbor and       welcome the stranger. As such, we stand in solidarity with       all people including our immigrant sisters and brothers.       Catholic Sisters have a long history of work with immigrant       communities and a commitment to their safety and security.       Under this bill, religious workers who are engaged in       immigrant ministry could be subject to prosecution. The       bill's harboring provisions under INA 274 are so sweeping       that religious workers who provide shelter, transportation or       support to undocumented immigrants could be found liable of       criminal activity. The federal courts have found that       ``harboring'' includes offering a known undocumented       individual a place to stay. This statute has been used       against religious workers in the past, and this bill tries to       make it a weapon for the future.        It is time for Congress to stop playing games with the       lives of our immigrant sisters and brothers. The real problem       Congress should be working on today is an effort to pass the       bipartisan Dream Act of 2017 championed by Congresswoman Ros-      Lehtinen (R-FL) and Congresswoman Roybal-Allard (D-CA). That       bill has broad support from the faith community and is a       substantive improvement to our fractured immigration system.        We urge you to vote NO on H.R. 3697. It is poorly drafted       legislation that would increase the disruption in our       communities! Instead, work for the common good and take up       H.R. 3440 and pass the bipartisan Dream Act. Faith and       patriotism demand it.            Sincerely,                                    Sister Simone Campbell, SSS,                                                 Executive Director,                         NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice.     Mr. Speaker, the bill also refers to felony drug  offenses. That includes, actually, use of drugs repeatedly that is  lawful in the State where it has been approved, but still unlawful  under Federal law.   That means, for example, in California, the voters of California  first approved medical marijuana, and then marijuana more broadly.  Groups of cancer patients take marijuana, and also epilepsy sufferers,  to assist in their medical condition. Under this bill, those  individuals who are repeatedly using marijuana in groups of five or  above would be a criminal gang.   Sections 2(b) and 2(c) of the bill authorize DHS officers and  immigration judges to deport any immigrant, including lawful permanent  residents of the United States, without requiring a conviction or even  an arrest.   Instead, the DHS would rely on evidence as minimal as the color of a  person's shirt, the neighborhood they live in, the individual in their  family, the belief of the officer. This is not just unreasonable, it is  probably unconstitutional.   Now, Chairman Goodlatte had an amendment that apparently recognized  this fact, but it only fixes one part of the problem. His amendment,  which would be effectuated through adoption of the rule, eliminates the  extremely low reason-to-believe standard with respect to deportation,  which applies, of course, to permanent residents and other immigrants  in the United States.   But even with this amendment, the bill authorizes the broad  deportation of noncriminals, including religious workers, and, as I  say, users of medical marijuana. And here is the other kicker: it could  deny admission, without any review, to anyone who is suspected of doing  a thing outlined in the bill, for example, using marijuana or a  religious worker harboring someone who is undocumented.   How would that work? If you are a legal permanent resident of the  United States and you go visit your family in another country, when you  try to come back in, you are stopped, and you are denied readmission,  even if you have been here 10, 20, 30 years, and there is no appeal.  You are out of luck.   That is not fighting MS-13. That is not about gang reduction. That is  really an overreach on this bill that none of us should agree with.   There is another way this would work, which is an adjustment of  status. Let's give this example: your son marries a woman from another  country who is here on a legal visa, but she is part of a church that  is providing sanctuary for a DREAMer. She is, therefore, suspected as  being part of this criminal gang, a group of five or more, that is  harboring this undocumented person.   When your son goes to petition for his now-wife to become a legal  permanent resident, she is going to be denied, and it is a reasonable- belief standard, not the higher standard that Mr. Goodlatte has tried  to impose. There is no hearing. There is no appeal on that. Your  daughter-in-law, and probably your son, are going to have to leave the  country, and your grandchildren raised in another country.  [[Page H7328]]    This is really not the American way. It is unproductive. It doesn't  keep us any safer, and it doesn't do anything about MS-13.   I would hope that we could vote ``no'' on this rule and that we  could, instead, sit down together, reason together, come up with a plan  that actually does something about gang violence.   I am sure that, if we work together, we could come up with a bill  that meets the requirements of the Constitution; that is targeted  towards gang members, not nuns; and that actually makes our country  safer.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hastings for allowing my comments on this. I  think the bill is mistitled, and it would be a mistake to allow it to  proceed without further changes.
