 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation  that would implement the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to  Published Works for Persons Who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or  Otherwise Print Disabled (``Marrakesh Treaty''). I'm pleased that  Senators Feinstein, Corker, Menendez, Hatch, Harris and Leahy are  joining me as original cosponsors.   The Marrakesh Treaty was signed by the United States in October 2013.  It seeks to help address the global ``book famine'' and facilitate  access to printed works for visually impaired individuals by providing,  with appropriate safeguards, that copyright protection should not  impede the creation and distribution of accessible format copies,  including the exchange of such copies internationally.   The Marrakesh Treaty Implementation Act represents a consensus  approach developed by the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations  Committees with stakeholders within the publishers, libraries and print  disabilities communities, in consultation with the U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office and the U.S. Copyright Office as well as other  interested industry and public interest stakeholders. I particularly  want to commend the National Federation of the Blind, the Association  of American Publishers and the Library Copyright Alliance for working  with us in reaching an agreement on legislative text and proposed  legislative history. We would not be here today without their efforts.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Foreign Relations  Committee, Chairman Corker and Ranking Member Menendez, on ratification  of the Marrakesh Treaty in the Senate, and with Judiciary Committee  Ranking Member Feinstein on passing the Marrakesh Treaty Implementation  Act.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Capito):   S. 2561. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to suspend a  controlled substances registration if there is a likelihood of a threat  of diversion of a controlled substance, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
