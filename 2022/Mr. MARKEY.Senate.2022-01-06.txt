 Mr. President, first, I want to thank Senator Booker for  his powerful, powerful statement. The whole country has to hear what he  said.   I want to thank Senator Kaine for your powerful words as well. It is  just so important that people of your stature speak to our country on  what we should be aspiring to do. Thank you for your leadership.   Thank you to Senator Klobuchar for organizing this incredibly  important moment on the first anniversary of the insurrection against  the Capitol.   One year ago, my colleagues and I started the day in this Chamber,  ready to ratify the electoral college votes and declare Joe Biden the  next President of the United States. Instead, Members of Congress were  forced to take shelter under their desks and under Gallery benches,  place gas masks over their heads, and pray that they would make it home  to their families that day. Our staffs, journalists, Capitol workers  wondered if they would live through the day, and their views of their  workplace changed forever.   Instead of a day celebrating the workings of our democracy, our  Nation was met with anti-democratic, White supremacist forces storming  their way inside this building, violently attempting to overturn the  results of the 2020 election. It was an insurrection.   One year ago, the people's Houses changed, but even though the  ratification process, which recognizes the will of the American people,  was interrupted, it was not defeated. On the night of January 6, 2021,  as Members of Congress returned to the Chamber to ratify the results of  the election of 2020, our democracy prevailed.   We thank the Capitol Police. We thank them for what they did that  day. Some lost their lives. Some were injured. Some still suffer from  the traumatic impact of what they had to do in order to protect these  Chambers, in order to protect the electoral college votes that were in  the well of this Chamber. The whole country owes a  [[Page S75]]  debt of obligation to those police officers and what they did to stand  here and to protect all of us--the staff, the Members, the  Parliamentarians--but to, more importantly, protect democracy because  we were able to return here after 8 p.m. that night in order to cast  those votes. We owe a great debt of gratitude to those police officers  who sacrificed so much on that day.   Tragically, former President Donald Trump's Big Lie has turned into  the Big Threat to our democracy. The insurrectionists were unsuccessful  in overturning election results, but the death, injury, and breach of  national security they caused must be held to account.   I want to thank the House of Representatives' Select Committee to  Investigate the January 6th Attack for their commitment to that ongoing  mission as well as the hard-working men and women of the Department of  Justice who have already brought charges against more than 725  individuals for their involvement in the insurrection.   Donald Trump does lie, but the video, texts, and messages from  January 6 do not lie. We all saw what happened that day, and anyone who  orchestrated, abetted, or participated in the January 6 attack must be  held accountable. That includes those at the very highest level of our  government. It means, as Attorney General Merrick Garland said  yesterday, ``follow[ing] the facts wherever they [may] lead.'' If the  facts lead to Donald Trump's criminal responsibility for the  insurrection, then he should face the same consequences as anyone else,  even if it means the only place he will be in 2024 is in jail.   Even as we now reflect on this day 1 year later, we must understand  that investigation and prosecution alone will not prevent another  attack on our democracy. This problem is larger than any one person or  candidate or election cycle. We cannot forget the role that online  platforms played during the lead-up to the insurrection. Make no  mistake, social media platforms have become hotbeds of disinformation,  hate speech, and dangerous conspiracy theories. Today, the seeds of  offline harms are planted, grown, and spread online.   In the days before insurrectionists attacked the building, social  media platforms, black boxes, algorithms promoted election  misinformation and political groups that spread Trump's Big Lie. We  need to open the hood to the online systems that are pushing toxic  content to the public and feeding dangerous social movements online.   But the January 6 mob was fueled not only by the Big Lie but by the  global rise of authoritarian and nationalist movements that reject the  basic principles of American democracy of quality, freedom, and the  peaceful transfer of power. The attack on the Capitol revealed the  growing fragility in our democratic processes and institutions and a  systemic weakness caused by years of falsehoods and policies meant to  undermine our right to vote in free and fair elections. It is  unbearable to think that a big part of America no longer believes in  any kind of democracy. They no longer believe in the rules that we all  live by and the pursuit of goodness and fairness and progress.   Donald Trump is gone from the White House, but we know that the hate  and division that defined his corrupt tenure has been with us since our  founding. So many were willing to believe lies about the legitimacy of  President Biden's victory because they had lost faith in the integrity  of our democratic system. Some were even willing to engage in horrific  violence because they believed elections could be stolen. The  architects of the January 6 authoritarians, White nationalists, and  those who stand to benefit from the continued undermining of our  democracy want us to feel this way.   For years, the dangerous coalition has worked to limit access to the  ballot box, undermine fair voting districts, and continuously spread  disinformation about voter fraud. In the wake of their attack on the  Capitol, they now have accelerated their efforts. In 2021 alone, 19  States have passed 34 laws restricting the access to voting, continuing  the assault on our electoral system. These efforts have eroded  Americans' faith that they can actually choose their own elected  Representatives, sabotage public truth in electoral outcomes, and  disenfranchise countless voters, especially communities of color,  indigenous people, the poor, young Americans, and individuals with  disabilities.   The Big Lie is that the election was stolen from Donald Trump in  2020. It was not. The Big Truth is that Donald Trump and his allies  have put in place a process to steal the election of 2022 and 2024.  That is the Big Truth of what is going on in this country, right now.  And the way they are going to accomplish that Big Truth is by having  State after State in the United States pass laws which restrict the  access to vote for Black and Brown and indigenous, and poor and  disabled Americans. That is the Big Truth about what is going on in our  country right now--a systematic plan to steal the election of 2022, to  steal the Presidency in 2024.   And the Republican Party has become a wholly owned subsidiary of  Donald Trump on the issue of voter suppression, on the issue of making  it impossible for this body, for the U.S. Congress, to pass laws which  protect the rights of every American to vote.   But we do have a chance, right now, on the Senate floor, to stand up  to this anti-democratic movement and to banish these discriminatory  policies and put them in the political dust bin of history.   The Senate can and must take action to pass the John Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, and we must abolish  the filibuster, if just for this issue, to protect the right to vote  for every person in our country.   With these bills, if we modify the filibuster, American voices will  no longer be drowned out by special interests, by redistricting that  keeps Black and Brown communities marginalized, and by voting laws that  are reminiscent of poll taxes and literacy tests that were used for  centuries to stop Black voters, minority voters from participating in  our democracy.   We need expanded early and mail-in voting. We need automatic and  same-day voter registration. We need to make election day a national  holiday. We need to get rid of hours-long voting lines. We need to ban  partisan gerrymandering. We need to get dark money out of our  elections. We need to end the discriminatory voting laws that restrict  access to the ballot box on the basis of race and age and income and  more.   We now have the opportunity to make sure that every voice is heard in  our democracy: the 85-year-old Black woman in Georgia who has waited  hours to cast her ballot without even a bottle of water; the newly  naturalized family in Arizona who took the bus 45 minutes to the  closest voting location, energized by the chance to fully participate  in American democracy; the mother of four in Massachusetts who works  two jobs just to make ends meet and desperately needs that mail-in  ballot. These are the voices that the ugly mob of hate and violence and  division that attacked the Capitol on January 6 do not want to be heard  in American politics, in 2022, in the United States of America.   But will we stand up? We have to ensure that at our moment in  American history, there is enough evidence to convict us of having  stood up for democracy, of having fought for all of those who will  otherwise be disenfranchised this year, 2022, in the United States of  America. Otherwise, we will have been found wanting in preserving the  foundations of our democracy, that we will have fixed this broken  system of government that is being dismantled by Republicans across  this country, State after State, with Republicans here in Washington  unwilling to cast a single vote--not one Republican willing to stand up  and say: We must pass laws to protect against what is happening in  State after State to suppress the votes of Black and Brown and disabled  and poor and indigenous Americans.   With the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to  Vote Act, we will not only guarantee that all Americans can exercise  their vote--their right to vote in free and fair elections--we can also  counter the distrust and the disenfranchisement that the  insurrectionists exploited on January 6. These reforms can restore  Americans' faith in the peaceful transfer of power and prevent another  attempt at insurrection by ensuring we have a government that is truly  of, by, and for the American people.  [[Page S76]]    One year after the attack on the Capitol, we understand how fragile  our democracy is and that the fight to protect it requires vigilance  and clear-eyed determination. The very least we can offer the American  people--all American people--on this day is our commitment to protect  their right to vote.   Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who helped draft the original  Voting Rights Act in 1965, once said:         A right is not what someone gives you; it's what no one can       take from you.    Let us pass this historic legislation so that no one can take the  fundamental right to vote away from those who rightfully have it today.   The job of building and protecting a healthy and strong democracy is  the sacred duty of this institution. The fate of the United States  depends on us doing our jobs. May this day, January 6, always remind us  that we must never give up that fight. And, here, in 2022, let us win  this fight on the floor of the U.S. Senate to protect the right to vote  for every American, regardless of the State they live in, regardless of  their color, their religion, their country of origin. That is our  historic responsibility.   God help the Senate if it does not respond to this historic  challenge.   I yield back.
