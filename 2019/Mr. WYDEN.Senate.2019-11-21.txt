 Mr. President, I think we are running a few minutes  behind. We have had a real crush of business here in the last hour. I  ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes.    Mr. President, every Senator knows the House is now in the  middle of an impeachment inquiry. Here in this Chamber, the Senate has  been considering the nomination of Dan Brouillette to be Energy  Secretary, replacing Rick Perry.   In my view, questions about Secretary Perry's conduct in Ukraine--and  what Mr. Brouillette may know about that conduct--tie this nomination  to the impeachment inquiry in an important way. I have come to believe  there are several significant unanswered questions about Secretary  Perry's role in changing the board of a state-owned energy company  called Naftogaz.   What Secretary Perry, his campaign donors, and certain crooked  associates of Rudy Giuliani stood to gain from those changes is  something the Senate ought to be digging into. We have been hearing  about Secretary Perry's role in Donald Trump's scheme with respect to  withholding a meeting and military aid until Ukrainian President  Zelensky agreed to interfere in the 2020 elections in the United  States.   The investigations seem to be piling up. Every time a new piece of  information comes to light, it raises yet more and more questions about  schemes that sure look, based on the facts, to be corrupt. Somehow,  Secretary Perry seems to be making his way out the door without facing  much, if any, scrutiny. Now the Senate is trying to fast-track his  replacement.   I will put it simply: Enough, enough. It is time for the Senate to  get some answers instead of just saying everything is A-OK at the  Energy Department.   I am going to take just a few minutes to explain what this is all  about. Mr. Perry is famously one of the ``three amigos'' who took  control of U.S. ties with Ukraine under the direction of the President  and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Secretary Perry attended  President Zelensky's inauguration in May. They held a private meeting.  It has been reported that Secretary Perry pushed President Zelensky to  fire members of the board of Naftogaz--a Ukrainian energy giant--and  replace them with Secretary Perry's own political donors.   At a second meeting with Ukrainian government and energy sector  officials, Secretary Perry reportedly said the entire board ought to be  replaced. The Associated Press reported that one person who attended  the meeting said that ``he was floored by the American requests because  the person had always viewed the U.S. government `as having a higher  ethical standard.' ''   The changes Secretary Perry was seeking lined up with changes sought  by two shady characters named Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of  Rudy Giuliani's. They also wanted different leadership at Naftogaz.   I am going to read now from an Associated Press report.         As Rudy Giuliani was pushing Ukrainian officials last       spring to investigate one of Donald Trump's main political       rivals, a group of individuals with ties to the president and       his personal lawyer were also active in the former Soviet       republic. Their aims were profit, not politics.        This circle of businessmen and Republican donors touted       connections to Giuliani and Trump while trying to install new       management at the top of Ukraine's massive state gas company.       Their plan was to then steer lucrative contracts to companies       controlled by Trump allies, according to two people with       knowledge of their plans.    Federal prosecutors are now investigating Rudy Giuliani's role. A  Naftogaz official is reportedly cooperating in the investigation, and  some of Rick Perry's political donors did get a lucrative oil and gas  deal in Ukraine after Perry began pressuring the Ukrainian President  for changes.   Perry admits he was in contact with Giuliani about Ukraine. It was  also revealed in impeachment testimony that Perry was seemingly made  aware in July of the Trump scheme where it seemed like everybody was  involved in Ukraine.    To get it straight, I think this is the bottom line: Secretary Perry  has somehow managed to stay on the fringes of this whole scheme, but it  sure looks to me like he was right at the heart of serious ethical  compromises. President Trump has claimed he made the call to Ukraine's  President that prompted the whistleblower's complaint at Perry's  request. Everywhere you look in the Ukraine scandal, it looks like  there is crooked behavior all over.   I have a hard time believing that Secretary Perry booked his own  flight for these meetings, sauntered out the back door of the Energy  Department, and freelanced his own shady Ukraine policy without anybody  knowing about it.   That brings me back to the Brouillette nomination. Dan Brouillette is  currently the Deputy Energy Secretary. He is the No. 2 person at the  Department. He is the Deputy to the ``amigo.''   At his confirmation hearing, sitting on the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee, which I at one time chaired, I thought it was  important to ask Mr. Brouillette some basic questions about what I have  outlined here. What I wanted to know wasn't real complicated: Whom did  Secretary Perry meet with regarding Ukraine and Naftogaz? He was a  powerful guy, and he wielded major influence over a nation that is  dependent on aid from the United States as it resists aggression by  Russia. Who else was in the loop with Secretary Perry?   Deputy Secretary Brouillette acknowledged in my questions only that  there were meetings but provided no further details about who took part  in them. In followup written questions, again, he just wasn't  forthcoming. He wouldn't provide any answers.   I am sending a letter to Deputy Secretary Brouillette to give him yet  another chance to answer basic questions: To whom was Mr. Brouillette  referring when he acknowledged Perry held meetings on seeking changes  at Naftogaz; when and where did those meetings take place; to whom  outside the Department did Secretary Perry speak regarding changes in  Naftogaz and the substance of those communications; and then, whether  Department staff were involved in meetings at which changes to Naftogaz  leadership came up, who the staff were, and what materials were  produced.   I will make it clear, I find it implausible the Secretary of Energy  was unstaffed on all this. I would think, for an important meeting like  this, Secretary Perry would have individuals from the Department of  Energy who were involved in these discussions that Mr. Brouillette has  now acknowledged took place, but we can't get any names. We can't get  any answers at all.   I think it is seriously an error for the Senate to just rush to this  nomination without getting answers to the questions I have outlined.  Indictments are flying. Investigations reveal major wrongdoing. Every  stone that gets overturned in this process reveals a lot more generally  about a rotten scheme. It just seems to me that Secretary Perry is a  significant figure in this scandal, and he is just trying to get out of  dodge.   To me, this ought to be an opportunity for this body, the U.S.  Senate, to stand up and demand accountability from the Trump  administration and all of those in the administration who can provide  information that, I think, provides a modest amount of information--a  modest amount of information--about discussions that could very well be  relevant to this whole Ukraine scheme.   Mr. Giuliani already had associates indicted. Just yesterday, there  were differences of opinion in the testimony about what Mr. Perry's  involvement was all about. Practically every day there are unanswered  questions about this matter. Because I believe the Senate deserves to  have answers to the questions I have raised, because I think this is  just accountability 101 to have this information, I will be voting no  today on cloture. My understanding is that no matter how the Senate is  recorded today, there will be some opportunity over the holiday break  for Senators, staff, and those who are doing investigative work on this  to get more details. I certainly think that without the question I have  been asking and the modest amount of information they would disclose-- information, frankly, I think Secretary Perry, the Energy Department,  and the Trump administration could produce quite  [[Page S6739]]  quickly if they didn't want to spend the time stonewalling--I think  given that, it is not responsible to advance this nomination through an  affirmative cloture vote today, so I will be voting no. My hope is that  over the next week or so, we can start to get some answers to these  basic questions.    I will tell you, I have just gone through five townhall meetings at  home in rural and urban areas. Everybody I represent at home thinks  there ought to be more accountability in Washington, DC, rather than  less.   Without answers to the questions I have outlined today, there is no  question that with respect to accountability, the Senate, by voting  cloture today, would be settling for less.   I yield the floor.
