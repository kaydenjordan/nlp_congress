 Mr. President, it is with sadness and reflection that I  take a moment today to remember the shooting at Thurston High School in  Springfield, OR, 20 years ago.   At the time, we thought of Thurston as a tragic anomaly and not as  the forerunner of the horrific epidemic of gun violence in our schools  we are living today. This plague rips away the lives of children and  teachers, forever wounding the body and spirit of entire communities  which never truly heal.   Twenty years have passed since a 15-year-old Thurston student went to  his school, after killing his parents in their home, and opened fire on  his classmates, but the rollcall of mass shootings and gun violence  continues to grow. In my own home State of Oregon, in the past 20  years, we endured Thurston, Reynolds High School, Clackamas Town  Center, and Umpqua Community College, among other acts of gun violence.  Every time, we say this will be the last, and every time, it is not.   Even one, the shooting at Thurston, is too long a list, in my book;  yet, tragically this epidemic of gun violence struck yet another  community just last week in Santa Fe, Texas.   The students, teachers, families, and communities devastated by the  mass shootings at Thurston, Newtown, Parkland, Santa Fe, and all of  those not listed here deserve and rightfully demand so much more than  thoughts and prayers.   They demand action. Congress must push back against special interests  that have blocked every reasonable effort to protect our children and  communities from gun violence. Congress must finally honor the lives  lost and those many lives that have been so irrevocably altered by  passing common sense gun laws.   All of our students and teachers and all of their families and  communities deserve to go about their regular daily lives free from the  fear of gun violence. Sadly, today, that is not our reality.   When I see the students and young people who organized the March for  Our Lives in our Nation's Capital, in Oregon, and across the country, I  see the spirit of those Thurston youngsters violently stolen from their  families and loved ones. Let's honor them with action to protect our  future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on February 2, Portland lost a dedicated  man of faith, Rev. W.G. Hardy, Jr. As our community mourns the loss of  this great spiritual leader, we also pause to celebrate all he did for  our community.   During the 22 years that Pastor Hardy served as senior pastor of the  Highland Christian Center in northeast Portland, he committed himself  heart and soul to helping every person who walked through the doors of  his church, as well as those who did not.   Preaching wasn't just a duty for Pastor Hardy; it was a calling that  helped Portland be a better place to live. Many will remember Pastor  Hardy inviting any and all to come to his church. Often you would see  him on the weekends supporting the church's many activities and events.  He spent endless hours advocating for those who are homeless, working  with nonprofits and local governments to find solutions on mental  illness, and developing programs to prevent young people from falling  through the cracks.   Pastor Hardy was justifiably proud that Highland Christian Center  hosted the annual ``Keep Alive the Dream'' events, which earned  official designation from the National Martin Luther King Jr. Federal  Holiday Commission. Over the years, I had the fortune of attending this  unique program, recognized as the largest tribute to Dr. King in the  State of Oregon.   As a third-generation preacher, Pastor Hardy understood and valued  the power of faith. He was steadfast in his advocacy and had the ear  and phone numbers of countless city, county, and State leaders. His  passion and energy for this work showed in his powerful and poignant  sermons. Every time I would see Pastor Hardy, whether after one of his  many inspiring services or during a visit to Washington, DC, he always  had a smile on his face and an important issue to discuss.   Through his beloved wife, Ali Hardy, his children, grandchildren, and  a host of other loving relatives, Pastor Hardy's life and legacy will  last forever throughout Portland. His good work will continue through  the leaders he helped lift up and create. While this is a loss for  many, the gains he made will be felt by many for years to come.                            ____________________
