 Madam Speaker, with solemn remembrance and a  heavy heart, I rise today to honor the life of my uncle, Colonel Joseph  S. Hice.   We knew him as Uncle Spurge. He was a great husband, a father, a  friend to everyone who knew him, and an amazing American patriot.   Colonel Hice was born in 1928 in Cherry Log, Georgia. He attended the  University of Georgia, where he graduated with a degree in aeronautical  engineering.   His passion for flight led him to an amazing career in the United  States Air Force, where he served with honor for 21 years. He was among  the first jet pilots in our Nation's history who commanded the P-80, F- 84, F-86, F-100, F-104, KC-135, and B-52.   During his distinguished career, he earned the World War II Victory  Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the Air Force Outstanding Unit  Award with oak leaf cluster, the Air Force Commendation Medal, the  National Defense Service Medal, and the Bronze Star service medal.   Colonel Hice served his Nation with great honor during both the  Korean and Vietnam wars and led the first squadron of jet aircraft to  circumnavigate the globe nonstop.   During the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Colonel Hice served at  Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base in  Nebraska, where he helped coordinate various branches involved in  Operation Looking Glass, and he was responsible for briefing President  John Kennedy in real time.   Following his career in the Air Force, Colonel Hice celebrated a 20- year career with Eastern Air Lines in Miami, Florida, as a chief flight  instructor. Later, he worked in real estate in both south Florida and  Atlanta, Georgia, after his retirement from the airline.   Colonel Hice was preceded in death by his wife, Mary Phil Blankley  Hice. He is survived by his children, Joseph Hice, Jr., Charles N.  Hice, Leslie Jane Hice Coleman; his brother, my father, Thomas Hice; 10  grandchildren and great-grandchildren; his many nieces and nephews; and  his beloved pup, Louie.   Colonel Hice led an illustrious life of great honor and marked  dignity in service and commitment to his family, his friends, and his  Nation. He will receive full military honors during a ceremony at the  Georgia National Cemetery in Canton, Georgia, on Friday, October 4,  2019--10/4/2019.    Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this  amazing American hero, Colonel Joseph S. Hice: Fly low and slow, and  keep the doors open. 10-4.                            ____________________
