 Mr. Speaker, I was stunned to hear our friend from  North Carolina talk about the rosy economic situation.   Let me give one example. For the last year, I have been working on  behalf of America's 500,000 independent restaurants. There are 11  million employees and their trillion-dollar supply chain.                                time  0030    Already it is too late for one in six who have closed permanently  this last year. Without direct assistance, we could lose 80 percent.  The good news is that the American Rescue Plan contains $25 billion to  fund the restaurants bill. Without the direct relief they need, those  restaurants won't survive. This is why it has broad, bipartisan support  from Republican mayors, Governors, local officials, and business  leaders.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge the passage of the American Rescue Plan  and the $25 billion lifeline to our independent restaurants that are so  important to our communities.
