 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Walden for his  sobering words, for his actions. He has a bill that will protect  preexisting conditions. The difference about that to today: It is  actually a bill; this is a resolution.   I always thought, when you ran for Congress, you would want to do  more than a press release. Apparently, it is different with the new  election, Madam Speaker.   ``Show me your budget, show me your values.'' It has been said so  many times on this floor. Those were the words that have been recited  by Speaker Pelosi quite frequently. You could have a whole ring of  videos of her just saying those exact words.   But, of course, that was before the newly minted Democratic majority  quickly decided they won't be introducing a budget.   Madam Speaker, I wonder if America will question the values. It  appears they won't be sharing their values with the American people.  But if we had questions as to what those values were, this week removes  all doubt.   Madam Speaker, we are celebrating 40 years of C-SPAN, but I wonder if  those who are watching today understand what is happening. You see, on  this floor, they learned early on, even from a childhood of  ``Schoolhouse Rock,'' I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill.   This is not a bill we are talking about. This isn't even a resolution  that goes to the Senate. This will never end up with the President.  This will do nothing for your healthcare. What will it do? It will make  a great press release.   The difference, Madam Speaker, in one election is what happens on  this floor. The difference is: Do you really want to protect people  with preexisting conditions? Because, Madam Speaker, there is an  individual who has a bill that is filed, that has cosponsorship, that  is sitting in committee, that the Democrats control. They didn't mark  it up. They didn't talk about it. They wrote a resolution.   To those who are watching on C-SPAN, I know what they have watched on  this floor before. I know what they watched in the last Congress, that  we sat and talked about not a resolution for children's health, for the  CHIP program, but we wrote a bill. We extended it longer than anyone  has ever dreamed possible, a full decade.   Yes, Madam Speaker, we had to do it with one side of the aisle,  because the majority on the other side of the aisle didn't even write a  press release supporting it. They voted ``no.''   To those who are watching on C-SPAN and questioning what has gone on  in this House, yes, they watched it the last Congress. When we had an  opioid epidemic, we wrote a bill. We didn't write a press release, and  we didn't write a resolution.                                time  1445    Or when the National Institutes of Health, where you could really  care about an individual with healthcare and solve a problem, we didn't  write a resolution about giving them more money. We actually voted for  it. We actually moved it through committee, and we had a bill and we  funded $3 billion more.   To those who are watching on C-SPAN, don't change the channel. Don't  wonder about the words that were used before, ``show me your budget,''  ``show me your values''; there is no budget, and you are probably going  to question their values.   Show me the bill and show me your values. I guess that is the new  line we should ask, because what does a resolution do?   Maybe we can all get together and go to the Rayburn Room today and  have a press release. What? Let's go further. Let's have a press  conference. Let's get really serious about a problem, and let's write a  resolution for the floor, because that problem will still exist.   A lot of people put a lot of effort into running for office. A lot of  people make a lot of promises, and Americans expect legislation to  solve them, not a resolution.   You know what is most ironic today? If they wanted to solve the  problem, there are options there.   If we are worried about a lawsuit, if we are worried about  preexisting conditions, go to Congressman Walden's bill. Let's bring  that to the floor. It is not a resolution. We will have to vote for  something different. We will have to actually vote for a bill.   It is interesting that, on the other side of the aisle, Madam  Speaker, I heard people were concerned the Republicans were concerned  about what ObamaCare has done, that premiums have risen, that the  promise we were given that, if you liked your healthcare, you could  keep it. For millions of Americans, that proved to be a lie and false.   We are not the only ones who believe that has been a failure. If that  were not true, why do half the Members on the other side of the aisle  cosponsor a bill that says Medicare for All? They must believe it is  not working either.   Or maybe they want to take more healthcare from individuals. I am not  quite sure. The way I look at Medicare for All, it has got a great  name. Anybody who is 65, they should get Medicare, and I will stand  with them. But they shouldn't take away 158 million Americans' private  health insurance, because that is exactly what they do.   Why don't they make another promise to the American public and deny  them their healthcare?   Or why don't they even go further? For everyone who is on Medicare  Advantage, that goes away as well. Or for everyone who is on Medicare  itself, you are going to bankrupt it.   You have got that in legislation. That is not a press release. Why  don't we bring that to the floor or committee? Why don't we debate  that?   And, Madam Speaker, when I sat on this floor and I heard the words  used from the other side of the aisle, from the leader of that side of  the aisle to say Republicans don't care about Medicare, that was a lie.  Medicare part D; you know, when you talk to seniors, you know what they  are most concerned about? The price of prescription drugs.   Or for those C-SPAN viewers who have more than 40 years to watch it,  Republicans were in the majority. Do you know what they did? They  didn't bring a press release down with a resolution. They brought a  bill. They created Medicare part D to lower prescription drug prices.  It has been one of the most effective programs around.   And do you know what we had to do? We had to do it alone because we  passed legislation. We didn't pass a press release.  [[Page H2963]]    Madam Speaker, shame, shame on an individual who would lie to the  American public about their own healthcare, lie about another side,  but, more importantly, say they care about Americans' health and bring  a resolution.   I want to see everybody go home this weekend, go back to their  constituents and tell them what they did about preexisting conditions.  They passed a resolution when they could have passed a bill.   I happen to be the leader of the Republicans, and I stand here in  this well, in this body, and tell you we support preexisting  conditions. I tell you to bring his bill up, Congressman Walden's, and  we will support this bill on this floor.   We won't support shams. We won't support press releases, because we  care about Americans' health. And we will not support kicking 158  million off their healthcare.   I know half the body on the other side has cosponsored that. That is  even further than I have seen before. They want to end Medicare  Advantage.   When are they going to say that to the seniors? And that is not a  press release. That is something they are really going after.   If they are serious about their words, if they believe they care and  are concerned about a court case because maybe they wrote a bill that  isn't constitutional, they could have solved it today.   You know what we could be talking about today? They own the majority.  They control the floor.   What is most interesting, the majority of bills that they brought to  the floor in this new majority--they have brought more bills and  resolutions to the floor than even passed the committee, but they sat  here and told us it is for the people.   They are about to have 100 days, but it is 100 days of  disappointment. I have never thought a majority would want to claim how  many press conferences or how many resolutions they could pass on the  floor, but they are setting a record. They are setting a record while  they are failing the American public.   Do you know what they could be doing right now? If they really cared  about fixing our healthcare system and protecting Americans with  preexisting conditions, they could do one of the three things in the  face of this lawsuit. And let's not lie to the American public. They  could repeal the individual mandate. Boom, the lawsuit is gone.    They could reimpose the penalty. They voted for it before, so why  don't they vote for it again?   Or they could put a bill on the floor that explicitly protects  preexisting conditions. The difference is that is a bill, not a  resolution.   Maybe if they had a lot of power, maybe if they really felt strongly  about this, make a resolution that even goes to the Senate so the  Senate can talk about it, too.   Or if they really care, make a bill. Write a bill. Don't write a  press release. Don't lie to the American public. They are smarter than  this.   You know, the words I have heard today, the line that will sit up to  speak, not one of them will use the term of a bill; not one of them can  look the American public in the eye and say they are protecting  preexisting conditions. But what they can say, Madam Speaker, is they  are denying a bill that would protect preexisting conditions to come to  the floor because the Republicans offered it.   This is an honorable floor. This is a floor that makes history. This  is a floor that has changed and shown the values of America to lead the  world, but it has not done that by doing resolutions. It is a shame  that we are trying to put a resolution on the floor.   Is this why you ran? Is this why you craved to become the majority?   I didn't hear any of my constituents say, ``I want you to go  there''--because I heard this language. I heard this language on the  other side, Madam Speaker, just from the last speaker: We will fight in  court. We will fight on the floor. We will fight in the public's  opinion.   Do you know what fighting means if you want to succeed? Put a bill. I  didn't know fighting was writing a press release. Don't take America's  time and don't waste it, because that is exactly what they are doing.   Do you want to tell stories? Go tell the stories to the individuals  who are concerned about this. Go tell those individuals you did nothing  to solve it. Go tell those individuals you denied a bill to come to the  floor that could solve the problem.   Be honest, but stop wasting our time. And if you don't want to lead,  get out of the way, because we will definitely solve it.
