 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Adams for her  incredible work on this legislation.   Yesterday, I reintroduced an updated version of the Faster Access to  Federal Student Aid Act, also known as the FAFSA Act.   My bill, through better integration with the Department of Education  and the IRS, would simplify the application, verification, and student  loan repayment process. My bill also provides a more secure way for  taxpayer data to be shared between the IRS and the Department of  Education for the purposes of verifying income for applicants  requesting or renewing eligibility for income-driven loan repayment  plans.   My home State of Washington ranged 48 in FAFSA application completion  among high school seniors last year, leaving millions of dollars in  grants to attend college on the table. With the ever-rising cost of  education, that is unacceptable. Each year, roughly 19 percent of  borrowers in income-driven repayment fail to recertify their income on  time, resulting in payment spikes and interest capitalization for  approximately 1.3 million borrowers.   This important legislation is the first step in reducing the  burdensome verification process for students and parents filing for  aid, addressing a difficult challenge many students face accessing and  affording higher education.   I am honored to be working with my colleagues in the Senate, Chairman  Alexander and Ranking Member Murray, to simplify and streamline the  FAFSA application process and increase access to higher education for  students across the country. This bipartisan approach to FAFSA  simplification has been a long time coming.   I am pleased we were able to get the entirety of my bill included in  the FUTURE Act, which I urge my colleagues to support today. In these  challenging times, this kind of bipartisan solution is something that  we can all support.    Mr. Speaker, I think this bill is all about making sure  that we support consumer privacy and that we do it in a streamlined  way. So the legislation in this bill would actually make this more  secure for consumers.   And, again, I reiterate, the underlying legislation, the FAFSA Act,  was passed out by the Republican majority and the Senate Finance  Committee almost a year ago, and then passed the Senate by unanimous  consent shortly after. So it is a truly bipartisan effort.   Currently, each year when verifying their income for an income-based  repayment plan, students have to manually go into their FAFSA account  and submit their IRS documents. They are submitting those documents.  The FAFSA Act would create a more secure way for folks to have their  IRS information be sent to the Department of Education for verification  by having their data go directly. That is a more secure and streamlined  process.   That streamlined process means that 8 to 9 million applicants who are  currently unable to access their IRS data for their FAFSA applications  for verification, that means this process will be automated and they  would be able to move forward with going to school and receiving the  support that they need.                                time  1315    So, I strongly disagree with the concerns the gentleman raised. This  is strengthening security, strengthening privacy.   Also, students and parent borrowers always have the opportunity to  opt out of that transfer. They consent to it originally. They can opt  out of that transfer, if they so wish, later on.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge folks to support this bill, which  strengthens privacy and supports streamlining for parents and students.
