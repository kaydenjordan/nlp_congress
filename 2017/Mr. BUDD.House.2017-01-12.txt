 Mr. Chairman, the debate over financial regulation is not  just about more versus less. It is also about the idea that financial  liberty and personal liberty are connected, and they have been for most  of history.   This goes back to the Middle Ages, when widespread use of a bill of  exchange--basically, a check--made it much more difficult for  government to wrongly take people's wealth. That development was one of  the first building blocks of limited government.   Now, today, we see a similar principle at work in global capital.  Like the bill of exchange placing gold or silver out of the reach of  government, the connected global economy allows capital to flow away  from harsh regulation. Countries that get it right are the ones that  win.   There are a number of statistics that suggest that we are getting the  short end of the stick in this arena. We are losing our financial  competitiveness. For example, nearly 10 percent of foreign companies  left the New York Stock Exchange this year, almost double the historic  average. Finally, from 2010 to 2016, the United States slipped from 6th  to 11th in the Index of Economic Freedom.   While this problem has a number of causes, the Securities and  Exchange Commission Regulatory Accountability Act will help improve our  economic competitiveness by requiring that the SEC put its regulations  through a strong cost-benefit analysis and review regulations that are  just plain outdated.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.
