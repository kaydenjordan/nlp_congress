 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for  granting me the time.   To my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  McCaul), let me say that this will be the most significant piece of  legislation that you can take great pride in having authored, as your  career continues in this august body. I can't begin to say how grateful  I am to be working with you, not just on this bill but on our Childhood  Cancer Caucus and the great work that you have done.    This particular bill, the Global Hope Act, will have a profound  impact on children around the world who have been diagnosed with  cancer, 80 percent of whom die because of that diagnosis, while here in  the United States, 80 percent of those children now live.   This is a remarkable effort that we must embrace wholeheartedly on  both sides of the aisle.   The Chinese effort, the Belt and Road Initiative, where they are  investing in concrete around the world, says something about their  values. This shows that we, in this country, are investing in people,  particularly in children around the world, to save their lives.   I join my colleague, again, in saying how important this legislation  is, how enthusiastically I support it, and how, as we move forward, we  can recognize that this is the kind of leadership that will bring peace  around the world.
