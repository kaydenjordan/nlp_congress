 Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today to wish a happy  25th birthday to Michael Brown, Jr.   The last birthday that Michael Brown celebrated was his 18th, a  celebration that was supposed to mark the beginning of his journey to  adulthood filled with years of joy making music, caring for animals,  and spending time with those he loved. But just 81 days after his 18th  birthday, he was shot and killed by a St. Louis police officer.   While I say that St. Louis and I rise today, we have never taken a  seat, we have never rested, and we have never stopped striving for a  just world, a world where Michael would have been celebrating his  birthday today.   To Michael Brown, Jr.: We love you, we miss you, we will never forget  you, and in your honor, we bring our struggle for justice from the  front lines of Ferguson, which is why I am standing here to the Halls  of Congress.   Stand up, don't stand down.   We do this for Mike Brown.   Happy birthday.                            ____________________
