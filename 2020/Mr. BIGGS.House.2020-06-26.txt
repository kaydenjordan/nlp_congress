 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Shimkus).                        In Memory of Mary Ellen Witter     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his words and  express condolences for his loss of his dear friend.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  my colleague and longtime friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, and I appreciate  her comments.   We do see an increase in the amount of lawlessness. We have moved  from peaceful protests, which I support, I understand. That is what the  guarantee of the First Amendment is for. We all get a right to assemble  with whom we want to assemble with. We get a right to speak. We get a  right to seek redress of grievances from the government. All of those  are important rights that we support, we stand for.   But we move into rioting, looting, mayhem. There has been murder.  There has been assaults. There has been brutal violence.   I have heard some of my colleagues in this body call those protests.  It is not protesting. That is lawless rioting, and it needs to be  curbed and checked.   I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  for his comments, and I echo his sentiment that what needs to happen to  restore order here is one must arrest malefactors who are committing  crimes. We must then charge them and prosecute them and give them due  process. But without a restoration of order, no one in this country has  freedom.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments,  particularly relating to history. I am reminded, as I was pondering  that, that each of us has a history. Each of us has a personal history.  None of us are perfect. Sometimes, we have flaws that seem almost  insurmountable in our own lives. But if we deny our history,  [[Page H2584]]  then we deny who we are and who we can become.   When I hear folks out there attacking our history and saying, let's  bring down this statue or let's do this or let's do that, some of it is  so acontextual. By that, I mean it is as if there was no history to  learn from. And I think, how in the world can we be so narcissistic  that we don't accept the flaws of our own past and build upon the  promise of the future?   We have problems, for sure, but it does not inure to lawlessness,  rioting, murder, and mayhem. It should, instead, inure to the better  angels within us.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  his passionate and heartfelt words.   It is my pleasure now to yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Posey).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his thoughts and  taking time to share those with us.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his passionate  comments about freedom.   Madam Speaker, those of us who have had the good fortune of studying  history, we know that it bumps and claws along. We do see progress  sometimes, and we also see devolution sometimes.   What we are seeing today, though, reminds me an awful lot of a  revolution that took place in the early part of the 20th century. It  was not a large revolution; it was a small revolution. It was the  Bolshevik Revolution. It was funded by some of the bourgeoisie who did  not like the form of government in then-Russia. It was not a massive  revolution. It wasn't widespread, but it changed that entire nation's  form of government.   I am reminded that it was Trotsky who prevented the military from  intervening against the lawless revolution. What I am seeing here today  reminds me an awful lot of that. This is a small revolution that is  violent in nature, is anti-American in nature.   And so when my colleagues mention the police and what they need to  do, what happens is there has been an emasculation of the police. They  don't really want to get involved because, should they get involved,  there is a legitimate concern that they will be sued, arrested, et  cetera. So when you get rid of the blue line of defense against  lawlessness, then you basically destroy the foundation of the  protection of your freedoms.   President Trump called certain groups antifa, domestic terrorists. In  our debate in the Judiciary Committee, some of my colleagues said  antifa is a fiction. So I said: Well, you know, is it a fiction?   So I went to CNN, because I knew that if I went to FOX and referred  to FOX, nobody was going to believe that that was not biased. So I went  to CNN because I wanted to find out what they said, and you can go  through and find extensive interviews where the conclusion is clear:  antifa is a real organization. It is a group. And the group sometimes  chooses to resort to violence.   So what do you have? They are definitely domestic. They are  committing terrorist activity in this country. Thus, they are domestic.   And what would terrorism be? Terrorism is the use of force,  intimidation, violence to change or alter behavior for a particular  purpose.   So you begin to see you have domestic terrorism going on.                                time  1815    18 U.S. Code, Section 2339A, I call on FBI Director Wray to begin  using that statute, make the arrests necessary to restore order. And I  call on Attorney General William Barr to use that same section to  charge and prosecute these individuals who are attempting to intimidate  Americans out of their freedom.   A lot of these Federal monuments and statues that are coming down,  these memorials that are being ripped to shreds, destroyed are on  Federal property.   And you know what? 18 U.S. Code 1369 is the statute that Director  Wray should be having his Federal agency make arrests under. And then I  call on Attorney General Barr to have his U.S. attorneys charge and  prosecute under 18 U.S. Code 1369 for destruction of veterans'  memorials. And we can go forward.   But why do I even bring that up? It is because I believe sincerely  that this country is built on the idea that each  [[Page H2587]]  of us should have agency, will, choice. It hasn't always worked out  really well or perfectly. There are those who have had their choices  and will taken away from them. That is inexcusable, of course.   But if we are going to have will and choice and freedom, then we are  part of this great social contract where I delegate my right to defend  myself because I can't do it all the time. There are people who are  stronger or more vicious or are more malevolent who want to compel me  to do something or take something from me.   We delegate police authority to police. It is not carte blanche. It  is reasonable.   We have got to restore respect for the law, for the police, for the  courts, and for process.   It is imperfect. I worked in that system for a lot of years on both  sides, prosecuting and defending. It is not a perfect process.   The reality is, though, it is as Winston Churchill said, Democracy is  the worst form of government except for all those others.   It is the best humankind has come up with.   To destroy our history seems so antithetical to making progress,  eradicating our history, erasing it.   College professors are now saying we have got to go through and  remove books from the library.   Remove them from the library, because why? They have unpopular ideas  in them. They may be unpopular ideas, but you know what is better than  taking them out and burning them or removing them and trashing them ala  Adolph Hitler and the Nazis? It is letting us read them, discuss them,  and point out their flaws, and rehabilitate us, our hearts.   Artwork being removed from museums, being removed from this House.  Why? Because some were not 2020 politically correct. What they did was,  to some, unconscionable and abominable. Let's have the discussion.   Removing your history allows you to repeat the mistakes of your  history. I simply don't understand it.   We have now moved beyond a motivational or some kind of philosophical  attempt to remove historical items. Now we are seeing indiscriminate  action.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a series of articles.                           [From Breitbart News]         A greater percentage of U.S. registered voters believe       Confederate statues, which have been targeted by protesters       in recent weeks, should remain standing despite activists'       demands to remove them, a Morning Consult poll released this       week revealed.        The survey, taken June 6-7, showed that a greater number of       Americans believe Confederate statues should remain standing,       44 percent, as opposed to the 32 percent who say they should       be removed. Twenty-three percent expressed no opinion on the       matter.        The fundings reflect a slight shift in opinion over the       last three years. In August 2017, 52 percent of voters       indicated that the statues should be left alone, with just       over a quarter, 26 percent, indicating otherwise.        However, Morning Consult reported that the purported       increase in support over the years is largely driven by       Democrats:        The rise in support for removing the statues was driven by       Democrats, a majority of whom now take that position, and       independents, who still favor keeping those statues standing       by a 10-point margin. Eleven percent of GOP voters say the       statues should be removed, virtually unchanged since 2017.        The vast majority of Republicans, 71 percent, believe the       Confederate statues should remain standing, whereas the       majority of Democrats, 53 percent, believe they should be       taken down. Forty percent of independents believe they should       remain standing, with 30 percent vying for their removal and       30 percent expressing no opinion.        The survey was taken among ``roughly'' 1,900 voters, with a       margin of error of +/- two percent.        The survey comes as protesters vandalize and, in some       cases, tear down Confederate statues and others they deem       offensive, including statues of Christopher Columbus.        House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has also embraced the       calls for change, requesting in a letter on Wednesday the       removal of Confederate statues occupying the U.S. Capitol, or       as she called them, ``monuments to men who advocated cruelty       and barbarism to achieve such a plainly racist end.''        ``Monuments to men who advocated cruelty and barbarism to       achieve such a plainly racist end are a grotesque affront to       these ideals,'' she said in a letter to Committee Chair Roy       Blunt (R-MO) and Vice Chair Zoe Lofgren (D-CA). ``Their       statues pay homage to hate, not heritage. They must be       removed.''        Interestingly, Pelosi has remained silent on her own       father's role in the dedication of a Confederate statue in       Baltimore's Wyman Park in 1948.        As Breitbart News detailed:        However, her father, Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., oversaw the       dedication of such a statue in Baltimore's Wyman Park--the       Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee Monument--as mayor of the       city in 1948. At the time, the Speaker's father said people       could look to Jackson's and Lee's lives as inspiration and       urged Americans to ``emulate Jackson's example and stand like       a stone wall against aggression in any form that would seek       to destroy the liberty of the world.''        World Wars I and II found the North and South fighting for       a common cause, and the generalship and military science       displayed by these two great men in the War between the       States lived on and were applied in the military plans of our       nation in Europe and the Pacific areas,'' D'Alesandro said at       the dedication ceremony, as detailed by the Baltimore Sun. He       continued:        Today with our nation beset by subversive groups and       propaganda which seeks to destroy our national unity, we can       look for inspiration to the lives of Lee and Jackson to       remind us to be resolute and determined in preserving our       sacred institutions . . . remain steadfast in our       determination to preserve freedom, not only for ourselves,       but for other liberty-loving nations who are striving to       preserve their national unity as free nations.        Pelosi's office did not return Breitbart News's request for       comment.                                   ____                        [From Fox News, Aug. 21, 2018]           Which Confederate statues were removed? A running list                          (By Christopher Carbone)         More than 30 cities across the United States have removed       or relocated Confederate statues and monuments amid an       intense nationwide debate about race and history.        After a ``Unite the Right'' rally in Virginia in August to       protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee       resulted in the death of a woman who was demonstrating       against white supremacy, other cities have decided to remove       Confederate statues.        Many of the controversial monuments were dedicated in the       early twentieth century or during the height of the Civil       Rights Movement. Discussions are under way about the removal       of monuments in Houston, Atlanta, Nashville, Pensacola,       Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, Richmond, Virginia,       Birmingham, Alabama, and Charlottesville, Virginia.        Here is a running list of all the monuments and statues       that have been removed and the cities that have taken them       down:                                Annapolis, Md.         Under cover of darkness, city workers removed a statue in       August 2017 of former Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney that       had been on the State House's front lawn for 145 years. Taney       authored the Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott decision, which       held that African-Americans could not be U.S. citizens. The       city's Republican mayor said through a spokesman that it was       removed ``as a matter of public safety.''                                Austin, Texas         The statues of four people with ties to the Confederacy--      Robert E. Lee, Albert Sidney Johnson, John H. Reagan and       former Texas Gov. James Stephen Hogg--were removed from       pedestals on the University of Texas campus on Aug. 17, 2017.       UT's president said in a written statement the deadly clashes       in Charlottesville made it clear ``Confederate monuments have       become symbols of modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism.''       Separately, a 1,200-pound bronze statue of Confederate       President Jefferson Davis that was removed from UT's campus       in 2015 has now returned to the campus, at the Briscoe Center       for American History.        The Austin school board voted to strip Confederate names       from five district schools, though they haven't been renamed       yet. The board had previously renamed Robert E. Lee       Elementary School in 2016.        The Austin City Council approved renaming Robert E. Lee       Road and Jeff Davis Avenue.                                Baltimore, Md.         Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh told reporters she wanted to       move ``quickly and quietly'' to take down four Confederate       statues or monuments--statues of Lee and Thomas, J.       ``Stonewall'' Jackson and monuments for Confederate Soldiers       and Sailors and Confederate Women--from the city's public       spaces. Although the plan had been in the works since June       2017, the Baltimore City Council approved it only two days       after the deadly events in Charlottesville. On March 10,       2018, the space where the Confederate statues had stood was       rededicated to abolitionist and civil rights pioneer Harriet       Tubman.                               Bradenton, Fla.         Mantee County removed a Confederate soldiers memorial       obelisk on Aug. 24 after the city commission voted 4-3 to       take it down and place it in storage. The monument, which had       stood there for more than 90 years, was accidentally broken       into two pieces when city workers removed it. The removal       came after days of protests from residents and activists,       most of whom were in favor of taking it down, and it cost       $12,700 to remove.                                Brooklyn, N.Y.         Plaques honoring Lee were removed from an episcopal       church's property on Aug. 16,  [[Page H2588]]       2017 and the governor called on the Army to remove the names       of Lee and another Confederate general from the streets       around a nearby fort. ``It was very easy for us to say, `OK,       we'll take the plaques down,' '' said Bishop Lawrence       Provenzano, of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, who       called them ``offensive to the community.'' New York City       Mayor Bill de Blasio has called for a review of all the       city's public art to identify ``symbols of hate'' for       possible removal.                                Dallas, Texas         A bronze statue of Robert E. Lee, formally called the       Robert Edward Lee Sculpture, was removed in mid-September       2017 from Robert E. Lee Park, which was also named in honor       of the Confederate general. The Dallas City Council voted 13-      1 to remove the statue, which has stood in Lee Park for 81       years.        The park was dedicated to Lee by President Franklin Delano       Roosevelt in 1936 during a renaming ceremony of the park.                             Daytona Beach, Fla.         Three Confederate monuments were removed from a city park       Friday morning. A city spokesperson said the plaques were       going to be cleaned up and taken to a nearby museum. The       decision to remove them did not require public input, the       spokes-person told FOX35, because they were donated and not       purchased with taxpayer funds.                              Chapel Hill, N.C.         Protesters toppled the ``Silent Sam'' statue that has stood       on the University of North Carolina's Chapel Hill campus       since 1913 on Aug. 20. More than 200 people had gathered and       were chanting ``hey, hey, ho, ho, this racist statue has got       to go.'' In a statement, UNC Chancellor Carol Folt called the       act ``unlawful and dangerous,'' adding that law enforcement       were investigating the incident. The statue had been a source       of controversy, with school officials claiming that state law       prevented them from removing it.                                 Durham, N.C.         A nearly-century old statue of a Confederate soldier was       toppled not long after Charlottesville by protesters       associated with the Workers World party. North Carolina       Central University student Takiyah Thompson, along with three       others, were arrested and charged with felonies in the days       following. As the bronze statue lay crumpled on the ground,       protesters could be seen kicking it on social media. A       Worthington assistant city manager said the community seeks       to be one that ``promotes tolerance, respect and inclusion.''        A statue of Lee was removed from the entrance to Duke       University Chapel on Aug. 19, 2017 and is set to be preserved       in some way to study the university's ``complex past.''        ``I took this course of action to protect Duke Chapel, to       ensure the vital safety of students and community members who       worship there, and above all to express the deep and abiding       values of our university,'' university President Vincent       Price wrote in statement to the school.                                Franklin, Ohio         A monument to Lee was removed in August 2017 by Franklin       workers. Gainesville, Fla.        A chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy paid       for the removal of a monument to Confederate soldiers known       locally as ``Old Joe'' that stood in front a building in       downtown Gainesville for 113 years. It was moved to a private       cemetery outside the city in August 2017.                                Helena, Mont.         The state's capital city on Aug. 18, 2017 removed a       memorial to Confederate soldiers that had been in a public       park since 1916. The granite fountain, which was dismantled,       had been donated by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.       City Parks and Recreation Director Amy Teegarden told the       Spokesman-Review that the fountain initially will be stored       in a city warehouse--but it could be reassembled at a future       date.                               Kansas City, Mo.         A Confederate monument was boxed up in summer 2017 and is       slated to be removed. The Missouri division of the United       Daughters of the Confederacy had asked Kansas City Parks and       Recreation to find a new home for it.                                Lexington, Ky.         Two 130-year-old Confederate statues were removed from       downtown Lexington on October 18 after the state's attorney       general issued an opinion giving the city permission to take       them down and move them to a private cemetery. Lexington used       private funds to take the statues, of Confederate General       John Hunt Morgan and John Breckinridge, a former U.S. Vice       President and the last Confederate Secretary of War. Private       funds will cover the cost of their upkeep in the cemetery.                             Los Angeles, Calif.         A large stone monument commemorating Confederate veterans       was taken down Aug. 16 from the Hollywood Forever Cemetery       after hundreds of people demanded its removal. The 6-foot       granite marker was loaded into a pickup truck and taken to a       storage facility. A petition calling for it to be taken down       had garnered 1,3000 signatures.                               Louisville, Ky.         A statue of a Confederate soldier was removed from the       University of Louisville campus after a legal battle between       the city residents, the mayor and the Sons of Confederate       Veterans. It was relocated to Brandenburg, Kentucky, which       hosts Civil War Reenactments.                                Madison, Wis.         A plaque honoring Confederate soldiers were removed Aug. 17       from a cemetery not long after residents and city leaders       began calling for it to be taken down. ``The Civil War was an       act of insurrection and treason and a defense of the       deplorable practice of slavery,'' said Mayor Paul Soglin in a       statement. ``The monuments in question were connected to that       action and we do not need them on city property.''                                Memphis, Tenn.         Crews removed two Confederate statues from Memphis parks on       Dec. 20 after the city sold them to a private entity. The       City Council voted unanimously earlier in the day to sell       both Health Sciences and fourth Bluff Parks where the       Confederate statues, of Confederate General Nathan Bedford       Forrest and Confederate President Jefferson Davis, were       located.                               Nashville, Tenn.         The Legendary Ryman Auditorium, where stars like Dolly       Parton, Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn made their Grand Ole       Opry debuts, quietly moved a sign on Sept 21 hanging the       venue's upper level that read ``1897 Confederate Gallery.''       Honoring an 1897 reunion of Confederate veterans at the       Ryman, the sign had been shrouded over the years but has now       been permanently removed from the main auditorium and added       to a museum exhibit that explains the history of the 125-      year-old music hall.                               New Orleans, La.         New Orleans city workers removed four monuments in April       dedicated to the Confederacy and opponents of Reconstruction.       The city council had declared the monuments a public       nuisance. The monuments removed were of Confederate General       P.G.T. Beauregard, Davis and Lee. Also removed was the       Liberty Place Monument, which commemorated a Reconstruction       Era white supremacist attack on the city's integrated police       force. The mayor plans to replace with new fountains and an       American flag.                                New York, N.Y.         Busts of Lee and Jackson were removed overnight on Aug. 17       from the Hall of Fame for Great Americans at Bronx Community       College. Prior to its removal, Bro x Borough president Ruben       Siaz Jr. had said ``there is nothing great about two men who       committed treason against the United States to fight to keep       the institution of slavery in tact.''                                Orlando, Fla.         A Confederate statue known as ``Johnny Reb'' was moved in       June 2017 by officials from Lake Eola Park to Greenwood       Cemetery in response to public outcry about it being symbolic       of hate and white supremacy. A spokesperson for Orlando's       mayor told Fox News that city officials are working with       historians on a new inscription to put the monument ``in       proper historical perspective.''                                Richmond, Va.         The Richmond school board voted 6-1 on June 18, 2018 to       rename J.E.B. Stuart Elementary School to Barack Obama       Elementary School. The process began several months prior and       involved input from students, teachers, administrators and       local stakeholders. Virginia is home to the largest number of       Confederate monuments and symbols in the country.                                Rockville, Md.         A 13-ton bronze Confederate statue that had stood for       decades next to Rockville's Red Brick Courthouse was       relocated in July next to a privately run Potomac River ferry       named for a Confederate general. The relocation cost about       $100,000, according to the Washington Post.                              San Diego, Calif.         A plaque honoring Davis was quietly removed Aug. 16, 2017       from a downtown park. ``This morning I ordered the immediate       removal of a plaque honoring the Confederacy at Horton Plaza       Park,'' Mayor Kevin        Faulconer told the Los Angeles Times. ``San Diegans stand       together against Confederate symbols of division.''                              San Antonio, Texas         A Confederate statue was removed from Travis Park overnight       Sept. 1, 2017 after the City Council voted 10-1 in favor of       taking it down the previous day. There were no protesters       during or after the removal, according to local media       reports. ``This is, without context, a monument that       glorifies the causes of the Confederacy, and that's not       something that a modern city needs to have in a public       square,'' said San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg following the       council vote.                              San Antonio, Texas         A Jefferson Davis highway marker was removed in 2016.                                St. Louis, Mo.         The Missouri Civil War Museum oversaw the removal in late       June 2017 of a 32-foot granite and bronze monument from       Forest Park, where it had stood for 103 years. It shouldered       the costs of removal and will hold the monument in storage       until a new home can be found for it. The agreement       stipulates the monument can be re-displayed at a Civil War       museum, battlefield or cemetery. In Boone County, a rock with       a plaque honoring Confederate soldiers that had been removed       from the University of Missouri campus was relocated a second       time after the Charleston AEM church massacre to a historic       site commemorating a nearby Civil War battle.

St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman ordered city workers to       remove a bronze Confederate marker at noon on Aug. 15, 2017       after determining that it was on city property. It's being       held in storage until a new home can be found for it. ``The       plaque recognizing a highway named after Stonewall Jackson       has been removed and we will attempt to locate its owner,''       Kriseman said in a statement to the Tampa Bay Times.                               Washington, D.C.         The stewards of the National Mall announced this week that       the exhibit alongside the Thomas Jefferson Memorial will be       updated to showcase his status as both one of the country's       founders and a slaveholder. ``We can reflect the momentous       contributions of someone like Thomas Jefferson, but also       consider carefully the complexity of who he was,'' an       official with the Trust told the Washington Examiner. ``And       that's not reflected right now in the exhibits.''        New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker introduced a bill in Sept. 2017       to remove Confederate statues from the U.S. Capitol Building.        The National Cathedral voted that same month to take down       two stained-glass windows of Confederate generals. The       removal could take a few days and workers seen putting up       scaffolding around the windows to start the process-        Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed a bill to       replace a statue of a Confederate general at the U.S. Capitol       with one of Mary McLeod Bethune, a black woman who founded a       school that became BethuneCookman University in Daytona       Beach, Florida. She'll become the first black female to be       honored in Statuary Hall.                              Worthington, Ohio         Worthington removed a historic marker Aug. 18 outside the       former home of a Confederate general.                 [From the Huffington Post, Aug. 23, 2017]   Polls Find Little Support for Confederate Statue Removal--But How You                                Ask Matters                          (By Ariel Edwards-Levy)         Americans are generally unsupportive of attempts to remove       memorials honoring Confederate leaders, new polling shows--      although the way the question is framed may make a       significant difference.        In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, a third of Americans favor       removing statues and memorials of Confederate leaders, with       49 percent opposed. Just 29 percent of Americans favor       changing the names of streets, schools and buildings       commemorating Confederate leaders, while half are opposed.        Those surveyed are effectively split on whether the       Confederate flag is more a symbol of Southern pride (36       percent) or racism (35 percent), with the rest unsure or       saying it represents neither. But even if Americans don't       overwhelmingly recognize the flag as a symbol of racism,       there's also little widespread enthusiasm for its use. Just       34 percent of Americans say they approve of displaying the       Confederate flag in public, while 47 percent disapprove.        Opinions on the Confederate memorials are divided along       racial lines, but to an even greater degree along political       ones. Black Americans are 18 percentage points likelier than       white Americans to favor removing statues of Confederate       leaders--but the gap between Democrats and Republicans on the       question is 46 points. And the difference between Hillary       Clinton voters and those who supported President Donald Trump       in last year's election is a full 58 points.        Within the Democratic Party, white and black people are       about equally likely to favor removing the statues: 64       percent and 63 percent, respectively, say they'd like to see       them taken down. There are differences, however, by ideology       among the party's members--77 percent of self-described       liberal Democrats, but just 40 percent of self-described       moderates or conservatives--want to see the statues removed.        Most other surveys released in the past few weeks find at       best modest support for removing Confederate memorials,       although two distinctively-worded questions stand out in       these results.        The strongest support for keeping memorials in place came       in the poll conducted by Marist for NPR and PBS NewsHour,       which gave respondents a choice between letting statues       ``remain as a historical symbol'' and removing them ``because       they are offensive to some people.'' (Arguably, the question       might have been better balanced had the first option been       written as ``because some people view them as a historical       symbol.'')        The only poll to find majority support for removing some       monuments, conducted by the Democratic firm Public Policy       Polling, adopted a framework far more sympathetic to the       monuments' opponents, asking about their ``relocation''       rather than their ``removal.''        PPP found voters split--39 percent to 34 percent--on       whether they ``support or oppose monuments honoring the       Confederacy.'' But those voters were largely willing to       relocate Confederate monuments if the issue was instead       presented as an attempt to move them ``to museums or other       historic sites where they can be viewed in proper historical       context.'' Unlike other questions, PPP also asked       specifically about memorials on government property, rather       than a broader question about public spaces.        Opinions surrounding Confederate symbols have also proved       to be fairly mutable in response to current events. After a       white supremacist killed nine members of a black church in       Charleston, South Carolina, two years ago, support for the       Confederate flag dropped quickly and significantly.        That doesn't appear to have happened yet following the       violence earlier this month in Charlottesville, Virginia,       sparked by a white nationalist rally opposing efforts to       remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. But if the       issue remains a flashpoint in the days to come, its       prominence could possibly polarize views even further than       they already are. (Charlottesville on Wednesday draped black       shrouds over the Lee statue and one for Confederate Gen.       Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson.)        Since Trump took office, Democrats have repeatedly rallied       around opinions that serve as anti-Trump shibboleths,       expressing sharply increased alarm about global warming,       mistrust of Russia and support for immigration. While       Democrats are already generally in favor of taking down the       Confederate statues, their level of support for doing so       ranges between 45 percent and 72 percent in recent surveys--      far lower than the party's almost unanimous dislike for the       president.                                   ____                     [From the Federalist, June 12, 2020]  Abolitionist Monuments Defaced by Anti-Racism' Rioters Is What Teaching                         Fake History Gets America                             (By Joy Pullmann)         The imagery couldn't be more direct. Across the nation,       rioting and unrest that has killed black Americans and       destroyed black neighborhoods has included the defacement of       historic monuments, including those to abolitionists.        The last wave of monument destruction, in 2017, largely       focused on Confederates and slave holders, erasing all the       accomplishments of figures such as George Washington and       Thomas Jefferson with a scarlet S, for slave-holder. This       time, the ignorance has descended even further.        The rioters are now tearing down and defacing memorials       wantonly, apparently assuming that if someone is being       celebrated that person is ``probably a racist,'' as the image       below says.        This prejudiced ignorance appears to be widespread, and       unchecked by local authorities. Several of the defaced       monuments are of abolitionists, including the Great       Emancipator Abraham Lincoln, as Tristan Justice reported       Thursday. For example:        ``[I]n Boston, demonstrators also vandalized a monument to       the 54th Massachusetts regiment, the second all-black       volunteer regiment of the Union Army,'' Justice writes.'' . .       . Add to the growing list of civil rights freedom fighters       defaced by social justice protestors a Minnesota memorial to       three black men who were lynched in 1920 following false rape       accusations from a white woman.''        These mob actions are not the result of accidental       ignorance, but of cultivated prejudice. One month ago, I       collected just a few pieces of evidence pointing in this       direction:         A 2019 poll found . . . that ``more than 80 percent of       Americans ages 39 and younger could not say what rights the       First Amendment protects, and three-quarters or more couldn't       name any authors of The Federalist Papers.'' Another 2019       poll found ``just 57 percent of millennials believe the       Declaration of Independence `better guarantees freedom and       equality' than the Communist Manifesto.'' A 2016 Federalist       article notes, ``40 percent of recent grads were unaware that       Congress has the right to declare war and 10 percent think       Judge Judy is on the Supreme Court.''         In February, I presented more such evidence:         Today, 4 in 10 Americans who are younger than 39 disagree       that the United States ``has a history we should be proud       of,'' according to a 2019 poll by FLAG/YouGov. The poll also       found that half of all Americans agree the United States is a       sexist and racist country, including two-thirds of       millennials. Millennials showed the lowest level of agreement       with the statement, ``I'm proud to be an American.'' Thirty-      eight percent of ``younger Americans do not agree that       `America has a history that we should be proud of,' ''       according to the poll. 2019's annual poll from the Victims of       Communism Memorial Foundation found that 37 percent of       millennials think the United States is ``among the most       unequal societies in the world.''         The anti-American group of recent graduates is not a fringe       element. It is a substantial and ominously growing group of       voting-age adults.        The recent riots have given us many more indications that       America's education institutions do not merely keep kids       ignorant, but actively teach them to hate their country. Just       refer to any of the emails and website banners you've been       subjected to from every company you've ever purchased from       online, detailing about how they're all ``fighting racism''       by frantically donating to people and organizations that make       a living off heightened racial tensions.        These messages reveal that the nation's leadership class       has all been re-educated extremely successfully to believe a       pack of things that just aren't true about American history       and ideals. They are well-catechized in what is billed as       antiracist attitudes and activities that are rooted in false       information and more likely to instead increase racial       tensions.        Hardly a one of them, or any other American, can tell you       much about George Washington besides he was a slave owner.       Hardly  [[Page H2590]]       one of them can identify Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano       Roosevelt as bona fide, deep-dyed racists. Not one of them       know one of the first acts of Congress--the Congress that       existed before today's Congress, the one that pre-dates the       Constitution--was to pass a massive document outlawing       slavery in territory newly acquired from Great Britain during       postwar negotiations.        But they all have heard of Audre Lorde, whose great       contribution to society is basically being black and gay.       They are all up on movies directed by black women like Ava       DuVernay and books by pathos-filled but fact-challenged black       writers like Ta-Nehisi Coates. They all know Michael Brown       put his hands up and said ``Don't shoot'' even though he       didn't. They're passing around discredited fake history like       The New York Times's 1619 Project as if it were accurate, and       using it to justify supporting totalitarian thought policing       because a black guy says this will solve racism.        These people's heads aren't empty. Their hate isn't blind.       It's very well-formed. And it's been deliberately aimed at       the very country that has paid for and overseen their       indoctrination into political violence.        I've now spent about a decade tracking information like       this, and have researched and written about it in more detail       than most, and therefore can assure you there is much more to       find. Entire books have and could be written to detail more.       Each generation of American children has learned less real       history than the generation before it. Each generation of       American children has instead been subject to greater levels       of indoctrination in place of genuine education. The alarms       have been sounded for decades, even a century, and nothing       effective has been done.        So now we have riots and unfettered monument smashing. This       is no accident. It is a logical consequence of convincing       ourselves, against all evidence, that America's public       education institutions are largely sound outside a few       crazies who never happen to be in one's own school district,       and even if they were, one's own children would of course be       impervious. Not like their stupid dupes of classmates, who in       just a few short years will go on to vote and tear down       monuments to American abolitionists in the name of anti-      racism.        This is what happens when conservatives spend 120 years       complaining about the left controlling academia while the       politicians conservatives vote for and cheerily profile in       our publications keep increasing funding for these       intellectual enemies of our country. Seventy years later, God       and man are still objects of scorn at Yale, and so is our       nation, but still we keep sending them our kids and money,       hiring their graduates to teach our children and rule us, and       funding their students.        The postwar convention of Minnesota niceness in politics       has been a disaster. That's because cowardice ultimately is       not nice. It leaves the innocent and the vulnerable       defenseless. And, as with Stockholm Syndrome, some of the       preyed upon ultimately turn predator themselves after       identifying too strongly with their captors.        How many more statues and American minds have to get       smashed before people who genuinely love their country gain       the courage to start fighting effectively for her restoration       before it's too late? Here's part of what that would look       like: Civil authorities first stopping vandalism and pursuing       the vandals to mete out their just, legally determined       penalties; second, politicians who claim to love America       fighting for her by refusing to send public funds to       institutions that fail to prove their graduates honor the       country that pays for their education. At this point, that's       just about all of them.        It's time for a new, non-racist boycott, divest, sanction       movement--for taxpayer-funded education. Liberate public       funds from these institutions with a century-long record of       failure. Return it to families. At least half of them will be       delighted to choose pro-America schools. That's a lot more       than pick proAmerica schools now. It would give this country       a chance to strive toward its ideals once more rather than       burn them in chaos.                                   ____                     [From the Federalist, Aug. 17, 2017]    Here's a List of All the Monuments Liberals Want To Tear Down So Far                              (By Bre Payton)         In the wake of the violence that took place in       Charlottesville over last weekend, numerous activists and       politicians have called for the destruction of more       historical monuments, although a significant majority of       Americans (62 percent) think the monuments should stay put.       Only 27 percent of Americans think these statues should be       removed for fear of offending some people. As usual, public       opinion's not stopping liberals from pursuing an unpopular       agenda.        Though by no means comprehensive, here's a list of the       monuments that are facing calls for removal or have already       been torn down.                  1. The Jefferson Memorial in Washington DC         In a PBS interview, Al Sharpton called for the Jefferson       Memorial in Washington DC to be abandoned because the third       president of the United States and author of the Declaration       of Independence was a slave owner.                          2. Statues In The Capitol         Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.)       have both called for statues commemorating Confederates to be       removed from the U.S. Capitol.                              3. Mount Rushmore         Vice News's Wilbert L. Cooper called for Mount Rushmore to       be destroyed because the U.S. presidents whose visages are       carved into the mountainside are problematic by today's       standards.                          4. Monuments In Baltimore         Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh had Civil War monuments       removed from the city in the cover of night, without any       public hearings or any public discussion process. Pugh told       The New York Times that she used her emergency powers as       mayor to take down statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall       Jackson from a public park--surprising even some members of       the city council.        Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan also called for a statue       memorializing Roger B. Taney, a Supreme Court justice who       penned the infamous Dred Scott decision. which determined       that anyone descended from a slave could not be an American       citizen, be removed from the pedestal where it had been       erected since 1887.                              5. Stone Mountain         Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams called for       a frieze depicting Confederate soldiers to be removed from       Stone Mountain in Georgia.                    6. Albert Pike Statue In Washington DC         In Washington DC, a group of protestors gathered on Sunday       to call for the statue of Albert Pike, a Confederate general,       to be torn down.             7. Chicago Parks Named After Washington And Jackson         A Chicago pastor has asked the mayor to remove the names of       two former presidents--George Washington and Andrew Jackson--      from city parks because both men owned slaves.          8. Confederate Soldiers Monument In Durham, North Carolina         The Confederate Soldiers Monument was torn down by       protesters from its spot in front of the old Durham County       Courthouse on Monday. Four have been arrested in connection       to this instance of vandalism. The Workers World Party       released a statement claiming that it should be their right       to tear the monuments down.             9. Monuments Throughout The State of North Carolina         North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has called for additional       monuments to be torn down and is asking the state legislature       to repeal a 2015 law that prevents the destruction of Civil       War monuments.                10. Monuments Throughout The State of Virginia         In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Virginia Gov.       Terry McAuliffe is asking state legislators and city       officials to tear down monuments throughout the Old Dominion.                 11. `Old Joe' Statue In Gainesville, Florida         In Gainesville, Florida, a statue of a Confederate soldier       was removed Monday from outside a county administrative       building.                      12. Statues In Lexington, Kentucky         The City Council of Lexington, Kentucky voted unanimously       on Tuesday to remove Confederate statues from the lawn in       front of an old county courthouse. In response, a white       nationalist group is reportedly planning a protest.                     13. Statues In Louisville, Kentucky         On Monday, protesters gathered in favor of removing a       statue of Civil War officer John B. Castleman from       Louisville, Kentucky.    14. Statues In Nashville Tennessee, Including One On Private Property         In Nashville, Tennessee, protestors gathered to call for       the removal of a monument depicting Nathan Bedford Forrest, a       lieutenant in the Confederate army, from the state capitol on       Monday. People have also called for a memorial of Forrest,       which sits on private property, to be hidden from view of the       nearby highway.           15. Two Statues Vandalized In Wilmington, North Carolina         ``A white flag was hung on the gun of the statue and its       head and feet were spray painted,'' WECT reports. ``Officers       were called back to the scene and found a rope tied to the       statue's neck. Upon examination, officers said they believe       it was likely tied to a vehicle in an attempt to pull the       statue over.'' Another statue was marked with graffiti.                     16. A Cemetery Marker In Los Angeles         A statue that stood in the Confederate section of Hollywood       Forever Cemetery for more than 90 years was toppled on       Wednesday, Los Angeles Times reports. A plaque commemorating       Jefferson Davis was also removed from a park this week.    Madam Speaker, I will say that as we go forward, if we  continue to denigrate all police officers because of a few police  officers, if we denigrate all of our society because of a few in our  society, we will see this Nation, the ideals of individual freedom,  erased from this Earth.   I used to do work at multilateral institutions and at the United  Nations, and I will tell you this: This country, to me, is special and  unique; imperfect, but the idea, the ideals, the people who have gone  before us, how can we erase what they have done? Some made magnificent  sacrifices that we might enjoy the freedoms we enjoy today, and yet  they were wrong on other issues in their lives.  [[Page H2591]]    How can we erase our history? We must face our history squarely and  openly and build upon that history to the great promise of the ideals  of this Nation if we are going to persist as a Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
