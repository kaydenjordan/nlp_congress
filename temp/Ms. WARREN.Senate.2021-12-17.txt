 Mr. President, I would like to offer my  congratulations to Janis Santos as she retires as CEO from Holyoke  Chicopee Springfield Head Start after 48 years of leadership in early  childhood education and care. She deserves recognition for her  steadfast commitment to ensuring that children of all backgrounds have  access to high-quality early education.   A graduate of Holyoke Community College and the University of  Massachusetts, Janis began her professional teaching career in western  Massachusetts. She soon became a trailblazer in her field. After  opening Parkside Early Learning Center in Ludlow in 1973, she went on  to join Holyoke Chicopee Head Start, Inc., as executive director in  1979. She continues to lead Holyoke Chicopee Springfield Head Start,  which has grown to be the second largest Head Start Agency in  Massachusetts and one of the largest providers of early education in  western Massachusetts. In her career with Head Start, she has held  several leadership positions, including chair of the Massachusetts Head  Start Directors Association, chair of the New England Head Start  Association, vice chair of the National Head Start Association, and  member of the national advisory panel for the Head Start 2010 Project.   In 2003, while serving on the board of directors of the National Head  Start Association, she testified before the Senate Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions in a hearing on the reauthorization of  funds for Head Start. Her advocacy on behalf of the children and  families in Head Start programs is powerfully important. I want to  offer my gratitude to Janis Santos for her lifelong commitment to  America's children and for all she has done to advance early childhood  education and care in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I congratulate  her on  [[Page S9303]]  her retirement and wish her the best of luck in her next  chapter.                            ____________________
