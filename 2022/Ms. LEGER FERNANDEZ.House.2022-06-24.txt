 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding  time.   Across this country, we shed tears for the children who are killed,  for the parents who are killed, for the girlfriends who are killed.   In this Chamber, we shed tears for the parents and the fathers who  are killed, for the children and the sons who are killed.   But we cannot only grieve. We cannot only give our tears. We must  act, and today we get to act. Today is the first step toward addressing  the pandemic of violence and suffering at the loss of life to guns, to  gun violence.   New Mexico already has passed similar laws. We believe in protecting  our children. We believe in protecting our women. Those who oppose this  law clearly do not.   The Congressional Hispanic Caucus understands that Latinos are too  often killed by guns, but today, today, we act. I stand up in support  of this action because not acting is an insult to the vast majority of  our constituents who want this.
