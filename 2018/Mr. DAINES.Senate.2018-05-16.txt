 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Amanda Bedford for her positive impact on the Chouteau  County community as the owner of the Wake Cup Cafe.   Amanda grew up on her parent's farm between Fort Benton and Highwood.  She always had a passion for the Fort Benton community, knowing 1 day  that was where she wanted to open a coffee shop. At 20 years old and  with the support of her parents, she made that dream a reality.  Fourteen years later, the business has seen tremendous success and  growth under Amanda's leadership.   What started as a tiny coffee shop, serving only coffee and a few  sandwiches, has since expanded greatly. The current building is the  restaurant's third location, with a much larger and more expansive  menu. By focusing on fresh, homemade ingredients, Amanda is proud of  the delicious food the Wake Cup Cafe brings to Fort Benton.   With the enormous growth the Wake Cup Cafe has seen, Amanda has  turned it into a family business. As of 4 years ago, Amanda's sister  and brother-in-law have become part owners in the business, allowing  them to continue to grow the coffee shop. While the business continues  to expand, Amanda remains focused on providing the community with a  place to gather with family and friends. As Amanda says, every small  town needs a coffee shop. She is proud to be that staple for the Fort  Benton community.   I congratulate Amanda Bedford on her wonderful impact to Fort Benton  and the greater Chouteau Community. With her passion, dedication, and  determination, her community is brought together over their favorite  local hangout: the Wake Cup Cafe.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
