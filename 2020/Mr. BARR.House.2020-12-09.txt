 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to once again sound the alarm  about an increasing danger to retail investors and retirement savers  across the country.   We have seen in recent years a trend of asset managers, banks, and  other financial institutions prioritizing political and social causes  over investment returns, potentially compromising the long-term  financial security of their customers.   We have seen companies cede the primacy of shareholders to so-called  stakeholders, endangering the longstanding corporate governance  principle of directors' and officers' fiduciary duty.   Corporate leaders continue to accede to the calls from the extreme  left to shun certain industries, deprioritize financial growth, and  comply with a radical corporate governance reform agenda out of fear of  being publicly shamed.   I fear that, if left unchecked, this trend will accelerate in the  coming years, as government continues to pressure financial  institutions to be agents of social change at the expense of savers,  customers, and shareholders. Without a strong defense of free and fair  market principles, we risk witnessing a decline in American economic  exceptionalism that will have long-term material impacts on our  constituents.   Earlier this month, former Vice President Biden announced that he  would appoint Brian Deese as the chairman of the National Economic  Council. Mr. Deese will join the administration from his current post  as the head of sustainable investing at BlackRock. In that capacity, he  serves as a leading proponent of BlackRock's environmental, social, and  governance, or ESG, investing strategy.   BlackRock has been perhaps the most vocal asset manager on  restricting access to capital for legally operating fossil energy  businesses and limiting choices for their investors based on misguided  public relations goals. This, in part, is attributable to the efforts  of Mr. Deese, who has orchestrated the curious investment strategy of  actively alienating an entire sector of the American economy, the U.S.  energy sector, and the millions of jobs it supports, while at the same  time enthusiastically providing access to capital to Chinese businesses  which threaten American competitiveness and national security.   The appointment of Mr. Deese is a harbinger of things to come. It  showcases that, unless we act, we will be on the path to socialism,  where the primary goal of a corporation is not long-term growth or  hiring more people or providing products and services to the American  people, but instead to satisfy the most vocal detractors of corporate  America.   So-called stakeholder capitalism, or the left's ideals for it, takes  for granted the laws of supply and demand and discounts the market  forces that govern businesses' success or failure.   Shareholder primacy is not about elevating the select few. It is  about establishing metric-based accountability for corporate leaders to  ensure that they are operating efficiently and effectively. That  efficacy and productivity then, in turn, benefits employees,  communities, and suppliers.   In today's market, a company cannot be successful without a focus on  these other constituencies. But it must, first and foremost, make a  profit to be viable.   Caring about broader social concerns, treating employees, suppliers,  and customers well and ethically, and engaging in philanthropy within  the community may all engender social support for a corporation, and in  that sense, it may advance long-term shareholder value maximization.  But that is not the paradigm those on the far left are urging the  business community to adopt. Instead, they want a new paradigm, a  paradigm that subordinates the interests of shareholders to the whims  of stakeholders who have no ownership interest in the corporation  whatsoever.                                time  1100    Replacing the focus on shareholder value with a focus on stakeholder  interests unrelated to the core business of the corporation would not  only authorize officers and directors to breach their fiduciary duties  to the owners of the corporation, it would, in the long-term, undermine  the corporation's ability to advance the interests of employees,  suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders.   The socialists think that shareholder value maximization is always  inconsistent with other stakeholder interests. The opposite is often  true.   I believe we are only scratching the surface of how the radical left  hopes to remake corporate America in its socialist image. We must act  diligently to preserve the spirit of free enterprise, promote healthy  economic growth, and protect the long-term interests of investors.   With Brian Deese departing from BlackRock, perhaps that firm can  reevaluate its obligation to the investors who entrust their assets to  them to prioritize returns over political errands, to focus on  maximizing shareholder value, instead of groveling before radical  environmentalists, socialists, and the extreme far left.                            ____________________
