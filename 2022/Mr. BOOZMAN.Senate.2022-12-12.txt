 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize CMSgt Lebaron  M. King for his dedicated service to the U.S. Air Force and the Senate  as a legislative defense fellow. Lebaron has served as a vital part of  my team since January 2022. He has been a trusted adviser on issues  relating to the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland  Security.   Lebaron enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in May 2001. His continued  service is a reminder of the dedication and sacrifice of every  servicemember to protect our Nation and defend our freedoms.   His effort and passion distinguished him as a valuable member of my  legislative team. His determination helped lead to passage of a  resolution commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Air Force as an  independent military branch. As the son of a retired USAF master  sergeant, I am proud to have someone like Lebaron on my staff who  understands the significance of maintaining America's air superiority.   He also spearheaded an initiative to better support military spouses  through the introduction of the Military Spouse Hiring Act. This  important legislation would address underemployment for military  spouses by amending the Tax Code to incentivize businesses to hire  military spouses.   When he was promoted to the rank of chief master sergeant in  September of 2022, Lebaron's character and consistent display of the  knowledge, leadership, and devotion were recognized and rewarded. I am  confident he will continue to serve our country honorably.   I am especially grateful for his support of the people of Arkansas.  Both in the Nation's Capital and while visiting the Natural State, he  spoke with and listened to the concerns of Arkansas' veterans and their  families, then worked tirelessly to ensure their concerns were heard  and issues were resolved.   We have been very fortunate to have Lebaron join our office this past  year. I also want to thank his mother, Mrs. Maxine King-Green, and his  beloved family, Mrs. Rosemary, Gloria, Cynthia, and Davetta for their  support of Lebaron's time in uniform. Having grown up in a military  family, I understand service in the Armed Forces is a family affair and  is impossible without their sacrifice and unconditional support.   Lebaron, thank you for your continued service to the U.S. Air Force  and for all your heartfelt, committed work as a member of my staff. It  was our privilege to have you as a part of our team, and our office  will always welcome you. I know that you will remain an asset to our  military and veterans  [[Page S7099]]  in addition to any other endeavors you pursue, and I wish you and your  family the best.                            ____________________
