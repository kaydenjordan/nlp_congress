 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I begin, I want to take a moment  to pause and remember an effective leader in the labor movement and a  real champion for working families, Richard Trumka.   Richard Trumka believed in the dignity of work, and he also believed  in the dignity of workers and that they should share in the prosperity  they provide for others.   His family is in my prayers as we remember and honor his legacy as a  vital leader in the labor movement and in the larger quest to make us a  more just society, providing opportunity for all of us.                                  Healthcare    Madam President, I am back on the floor of the Senate because I  believe that healthcare is a human right, and it is certainly something  that the richest Nation on the planet can afford to provide for all of  its citizens.   I have come to the Senate floor with the same message week after week  because I think it is vital and important. With all of the incentives  on the table for my home State of Georgia to expand Medicaid, it is  past time for Georgia and the other 11 nonexpansion States to finally  expand Medicaid.   My home State of Georgia has the opportunity to provide affordable  healthcare to 646,000 people who could qualify. Instead of allowing  Georgians to continue to suffer and be cut off from care while  politicians are playing games, I introduced the Medicaid Saves Lives  Act. This is legislation that would provide people in States like mine  that have not expanded Medicaid an alternative path to health coverage.   In the richest country in the world in 2021 and amid a once-in-a- century pandemic that has both illuminated and exacerbated the  consequences of longstanding disparities in healthcare, too many  Georgians are still struggling to get what they deserve and what is  already available if we would just expand Medicaid.   And for far too many, access to affordable, reliable, and continuous  healthcare is quite literally the difference between life and death.   We do policy here, but we can only do policy in an effective manner  when we keep in front of us the human faces behind the policy we would  create or the consequences for real people when we fail to do what we  were sent here to do.   So I want to share the story and remember the life of a Georgian who  fought to expand Medicaid. She and other Georgians live in the coverage  gap. She advocated for herself and others like her.   This is Lorie Davis and her husband Bob, both from Covington, GA.  Lorie was one of our heroes. She spent much of her life serving her  neighbors as a trauma nurse at the Grady Memorial Hospital. I have been  to that hospital time and time again as a pastor and now as a Senator.  I have seen firsthand the important work that they do.   She was a trauma nurse there at Grady, and while working as a  healthcare professional in Georgia, Lorie was diagnosed with pelvic  adhesive disease. The chronic pain associated with this condition  eventually pushed her to leave the nursing profession.   After that, while also working to manage her own chronic condition,  Lorie struggled to maintain steady employment in the restaurant  industry--a  [[Page S5912]]  healthcare professional no longer able to serve in her profession as a  trauma nurse, working as hard as she can, as hard as she could in the  restaurant industry.   She believed in working. She understood the dignity of work. But  while working, she could not afford health insurance. She made too much  to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford other insurance plans.  And while in this limbo, Lorie had to wait many years for her Social  Security disability claim to be adjudicated. She finally qualified for  benefits in 2017, but even then, she was unable to qualify for Medicaid  because of her and Bob's combined marital income. This left Lorie in  the coverage gap, unable to purchase coverage because it was  financially out of reach.   Lorie went without health insurance for years, relying on her own  medical training and free healthcare clinics to treat her chronic  condition--a trauma nurse who had cared for others, unable to receive  any care.   Then, in August of 2020, Lorie began feeling ill, and her condition  got noticeably worse. Fearful of costs, she delayed seeking healthcare.  Unable to follow the advice that she, no doubt, had provided to other  patients: Seek healthcare early. Many things are preventable if you can  get there earlier rather than later. She was not able to follow her own  advice. But I want us to think about that. She put off seeking the care  she needed because she was afraid she would not be able to afford it.   As Members of this body, we should be ashamed that in the richest  Nation in the world, a country with all of our resources, with all of  our medical technology, that some citizens would choose not to seek  treatment even when they know better because they fear they cannot  afford the pricetag of lifesaving care. That is Lorie's story.   The next month, in September of 2020, Lorie was admitted to the  hospital with pneumonia. And while there, she learned, sadly, that she  had lung cancer, a treatable condition had she received an earlier  diagnosis.   Put together, it was too much. On September 17, 2020, Lorie passed  away.   This is the human face of our public policy. These are the tragic  casualties of the games that politicians play.   As a pastor, I am praying for Lorie's family as they mourn her  unspeakable and, perhaps, unnecessary loss and the legacy she left  behind.   As a Senator who believes that healthcare is a human right, a sacred  obligation, I refuse to stop fighting until Georgians, like Lorie  Davis, have access to the care that they need when they need it.   Like Lorie, who advocated Members of this body for healthcare during  her lifetime, I am committed to gaining ground in this fight to improve  access to healthcare for Georgians in every corner of the State. She  can no longer speak. We must be her voice.   She is not the only one. There are millions of hard-working people  all across our country who went to school, played by the rules, and  they don't have access to lifesaving care, costing them their lives and  costing us more money.   So we need to pass the Medicaid Saves Lives Act. It is not just the  name of a bill; it is actually true, Medicaid saves lives.   Until we get this done, I am going to keep lifting up Lorie's story  and the stories of others who would benefit from this lifesaving  legislation.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
