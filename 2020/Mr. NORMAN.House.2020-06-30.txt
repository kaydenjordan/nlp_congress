 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the service and  accomplishments of Dale Watts, a resident of Tega Cay, South Carolina.   Dale and his wife, Barbara, and family have been a part of the  greater Fort Mill-Tega Cay community for over 40 years.   Dale began his career in medical sales, and after retiring after 30  years, he entered the field of real estate with his wife, Barbara,  where he successfully owns and manages commercial and residential  properties.   Dale's involvement in the community is legendary, as he has  volunteered for numerous groups and civic organizations, including  joining the Tega Cay Fire Department No. 56, where he became a  certified firefighter; joining the Tega Cay Lions Club, where he served  as president for three terms; his tireless work with the Lake Wylie  Lutheran Church Community Cafe; his activities as a member of Grace  Presbyterian Church, where he was active with the Meals on Wheels  program, the Senior Citizens Christmas Party, the International Student  Exchange, and the Tega Cay Community Service Committee; and the list  goes on and on.   As a result of his tireless efforts, he received numerous awards,  including Firefighter of the Year in 1990, Tega Cay Voluntary Fire  Department Officers Award in 2009, the Fire Chief's Award in 2010, and  the Melvin Jones Fellow Humanitarian Award in 1995. He was inducted  into the South Carolina Lions Hall of Fame in 2018 and was named the  Tega Cay Citizen of the Year in 2005-2006.   Dale has been married to his wife, Barbara, for 41 years and has five  children and five grandchildren.   In the words of many friends in the Tega Cay-Fort Mill community,  ``If you need something done, just call Dale.''   Dale Watts has dedicated his entire life in service to others and  exemplifies the slogan ``Service Above Self.'' As a result of his  tireless work, the community, the State, and the Nation are a better  place to live and raise a family.                            ____________________
