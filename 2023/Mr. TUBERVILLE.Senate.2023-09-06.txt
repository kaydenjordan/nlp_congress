 Mr. President, if you travel to Fort Payne,  you would be stretched to find someone who doesn't know U.S. Air Force  MSgt Scott Azbell. Scott joined the military just about as soon as he  could, right after high school. He quickly became a skilled aircraft  mechanic and training instructor.   He spent his entire 23-year enlistment during times of conflict,  serving multiple deployments around the globe. His efforts ensured our  aircraft were up to speed on the latest technology and on the  advancements necessary for a strong defense.   Scott continues to serve this country, even in his retirement. After  he retired, he retrained as a diesel mechanic for Fort Payne City  Schools and also is actively involved in its JROTC Program, inspiring a  spirit of service in the next generation.   He has used his skills as a mechanic to help countless folks in the  community with car repairs throughout the years--not for attention, but  because he wants to use his talents to be a blessing to others. Scott  is also an active member of Fort Payne Church of Christ and serves as  quartermaster for VFW Post 3128. He dedicates his time to supporting  other veterans and their families. He has served as a regional  spokesperson and coordinator for Wreaths Across America for the past 2  years. His work has helped ensure that we do not forget those who made  the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.   We are thankful for veterans like Scott who are committed to making  Alabama a better place. I am proud to recognize him as the September  Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________     Mr. President, our servicemembers put their  lives on the line to preserve this Nation for generations to come. Many  of them also hand down that ethic of service to their own children.  That is certainly true of CW4 Chuck Maglothin of Foley.   Chuck channeled his love of flying to serve in various aviation roles  during his 25 years in the U.S. Army. He specialized in Blackhawk and  Kiowa warrior helicopters, climbing the ranks to become an instructor  pilot and maintenance examiner.   Chuck's bravery and expertise provided critical war support in the  aftermath of 9/11. He was in one of the first groups to be deployed to  Iraq. He went on to do three more combat tours to Iraq and Afghanistan.  In 2016, Chuck finished his time in the Army with more than 3,200  flight hours, most of which were in combat.  [[Page S4226]]    Chuck says one of his greatest honors during his time in the military  was swearing his son Jarrod into the U.S. Army in 2013. Jarrod carries  on Chuck's love of flying as a UH-60 Blackhawk crew chief.   Chuck continues to use his aviation skills as a mechanical assembler  for Collins Aerospace. He works on Boeing 787 inlets to keep our  military and commercial planes safe and efficient. Chuck also gives  back to local agencies through his involvement in the Marshalls krewe.   We are thankful for Alabamians like Chuck who have put country ahead  of self to protect our freedom. I am proud to recognize him as the  August Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
