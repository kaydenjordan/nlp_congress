 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Duval  County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Diana Greene.   This week, she was named the Florida Superintendent of the Year by  the Florida Association of District School Superintendents, and we are  all incredibly proud of her well-deserved recognition.   Over these last 5 years, including during Dr. Greene's leadership,  the Duval graduation rate increased from 76 percent to 86 percent, an  amazing accomplishment.   She has also helped to improve safety and security within our schools  and fought to secure additional educational funding for Duval County  Public Schools. Dr. Greene is an excellent example and mentor to both  educators and students alike.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I thank  Dr. Greene for her commitment to education and for working hard every  day to make Duval County Public Schools a place where students can  learn, grow, and thrive.                            ____________________
