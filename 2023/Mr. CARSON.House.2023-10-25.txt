 Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear: I have condemned  Hamas for their heinous attacks on civilians and call for an immediate  release of the Israeli hostages. I continue to call for the safety of  all civilians in the Middle East.   Unfortunately, today's resolution H. Res. 771 is horribly one-sided.  By failing to acknowledge the growing loss of Palestinian lives or that  all Palestinians are not Hamas, this resolution creates further  division and spurs harmful rhetoric.   We must defend our Jewish brothers and sisters from Antisemitism.  Muslims must also be defended from Islamophobia, and not have their  patriotism questioned because they believe in justice for Palestinians.   As a senior Member of the Intelligence Committee and through my work  on the Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation  Subcommittee--and having spent many years working in law enforcement--I  am concerned that these kinds of one-sided resolutions have become and  will continue to be recruitment tools for extremists.   This is why I am co-leading H. Res. 786, the Ceasefire Now  Resolution, which I believe is the best way to prevent further tragic  loss of life to Palestinian civilians and simultaneously ensure the  safe return of hostages. Only then can we begin to move towards a long- term, two-state solution that includes both Palestinians and Israelis  living in peace and liberation, side by side.   This resolution rightly mourns the nearly 1,400 Israelis and  Americans killed and wounded. But it completely ignores the mounting  deaths of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza since October 7th,  which has reached an estimated 5,761--including over 2,360 children  killed and over 870 children missing under the rubble of destroyed  buildings. Provided below, for the Record, are updated assessments  about the destruction and deaths that civilians have suffered.   Pain and grief know no boundaries. The United States fails in our  duties as an international leader if we do not wholeheartedly condemn  all violations of international law, whether it is committed by Hamas  or the Israeli government.   The United States urgently needs a new approach to this decades-long  conflict. The roots of these problems existed long before October 7th.  The Israeli government's 16-year blockade on Gaza has been identified  by major human rights organizations as collective punishment and a war  crime--and it has resulted in poor health, social, educational,  physical, and political infrastructure throughout Palestine.   Although I will vote ``no'' on this resolution, I urge every  colleague who will vote today for H. Res. 771, to join me in bringing  H. Res. 786 to the floor for a Ceasefire Now.   UNRWA Situation Report #14 on the situation in the Gaza Strip and the                    West Bank (including East Jerusalem)  All information valid as of 24 October 2023 at 18:00 (local time)--Day                             17 of hostilities                               1. Key Points         More than 613,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) are       sheltering in 150 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza strip.        In the last 24 hours, another three UNRWA staff members       have been killed, bringing the total to 38 staff killed since       7 October. Two have been injured, one of whom is in a       critical condition.        One school in Rafah, sheltering 4,600 IDPs, sustained       severe collateral damage due to a close proximity strike. One       IDP was killed and 44 more were injured, including nine       children.        Fuel is urgently needed to continue the UNRWA lifesaving       humanitarian operations. If fuel is not received into Gaza,       UNRWA will be forced to significantly reduce and in some       cases bring its humanitarian operations across the Gaza Strip       to a halt. The coming 24 hours are very critical.                            2. Overall Situation                                The Gaza Strip         According to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, 5,791 people       have been killed since 7 October, including 2,360 children,       1,292 women, 295 elderly, and 16,298 were injured. This is in       addition to the 1,550 reported missing, presumably under the       rubble of destroyed buildings, including 870 children.        Overall, nearly 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals have       been killed in Israel, according to the Israel authorities,       the vast majority on 7 October (OCHA).        In the West Bank, 95 people have been killed and nearly       1,900 injured since 7 October.        Overcrowding conditions in UNRWA shelters remain a serious       concern, as the current facilities can no longer provide       dignified living conditions. Some shelters are currently       hosting 10 to 12 times more people than their designed       capacity.              3. Humanitarian Access & Protection of Civilians                                THE GAZA STRIP         Since 7 October, 38 UNRWA colleagues were killed and 20       have been injured, with one in critical condition.        At least 42 UNRWA installations have been impacted since 7       October.                             4. UNRWA Response                                THE GAZA STRIP         UNRWA Shelters:        The average number of IDPs per shelter has reached 2.7       times capacity, with some shelters reaching 12 times intended       occupancy. In the Middle Area, one school is hosting up to       13,300 IDPs, while another facility in Khan Younis is hosting       21,000 persons.        UNRWA continues to distribute assistance in shelters;       however current conditions severely constrain access to       essential services and represent a health and protection risk       for IDPs.        Health:        The eight UNRWA health centres that remain operational in       the South (out of 22) recorded 4,200 visits on 24 October for       refugees and non-refugees. In addition to essential primary       healthcare, post-natal and high-risk pregnancy care services       resumed on 24 October with 40 displaced women receiving this       service. Healthcare support for non-communicable diseases       (NCDs) patients continued.        Healthcare services were maintained within the UNRWA       shelters, with the support of 93 mobile medical units and       medical teams, serving around 10,000 cases at shelters.        According to initial health assessments from the mobile       medical teams there are over 37,500 persons with NCDs, over       4,660 pregnant women and around 390 post-natal cases       requiring medical attention among the IDPs. In addition,       medical teams are increasingly identifying cases of acute       respiratory and diarrhea among children under five years old.        UNRWA's stocks of medicines are critically decreasing with       availability for a few more days only.        UNRWA primary health centres are running out of fuel,       threatening the provision of essential healthcare services.        Psychosocial Support:        UNRWA has counsellors and social workers in the shelters,       who provide psychological first aid and other specialized       protection services. Since the beginning of the crisis, UNRWA       social workers provided 8,900 people with psychosocial       support and social work services. These include cases that       are referred for medication and other specialized mental       health and psychosocial support interventions.        Protection/Crisis Intervention Unit (CIU):        UNRWA conducted a Rapid Gender Analysis (RGA) to identify       the different impacts of the war on women, man, girls and       boys and better understand their different needs and coping       strategies. The RGA highlighted the following:        There is a shortage of feminine hygiene supplies and very       few toilets. This results in increased challenges for females       to maintain menstrual hygiene.        Overcrowding and limited privacy increase familial tensions       (which can increase the risk of GBV) and broader tensions       between males.        There are critical gaps in access to health services that       particularly affect women and adolescent girls, including       access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care, newborn       care and sexual and reproductive health services.        Water and Sanitation Services (WASH):        Some solid waste collection from the camps and from       emergency shelters and transfer to landfills continues in       Middle, Khan Younis and Rafah areas with difficulties due to       the scarcity of fuel and staff.        Water wells in Jabalia, Khan Younis and Rafah are       functional with about 11,000 m\3\ being pumped from nine       water wells.  [[Page H5062]]         Despite the limited availability of fuel, desalination       plants continue to operate in the shelters for the provision       of potable water. Water trucking operations in shelters in       Rafah and Khan Younis also continue; however, the potable       water provided is not enough to meet all needs.        Maintenance and rehabilitation work at shelters continue on       a daily basis. This includes essential repairs and upgrading       of shelters to accommodate additional IDPs when possible, as       well as the installation of mobile showers and toilet units.        This resolution, while mourning the devastating loss of       Israeli civilian life, fails to even acknowledge the killing       and targeting of Palestinian civilians by the Israeli       military. It uses incendiary language that encourages the       suffocating military siege of the Gaza Strip and that       escalates violence and war.        Furthermore, by stating Congressional support for possible       shipment of further US weapons to the Israeli military, this       resolution will significantly worsen and exacerbate violence       against Palestinian and Israeli civilians alike.        Since this resolution was introduced, the Israeli       government and military have continued to carry out shocking       and horrifying violence, including clear and documented war       crimes against Palestinians in Gaza. It does not even so much       as acknowledge the overwhelming loss of life of Palestinians.        The Israeli military has already targeted Palestinian       residential buildings, in some cases wiping out entire       generations of the same Palestinian family, killed over 2,000       children, attacked first responders, demolished mosques, and       bombed schools. The Meeks McCaul resolution fails to name or       address any of these war crimes, or to even acknowledge that       Palestinian civilians have been killed by the Israeli       military.        Several days ago, after this resolution was introduced, the       Israeli Air Force announced that it had dropped 6,000 bombs       on Gaza in six days. Experts have said that this means Israel       has dropped, in less than a week, the same amount of bombs       that the U.S. dropped in a year of war in Afghanistan--and in       a much smaller and more densely populated area. Those of us       who want to build a future toward peace must wake up and       speak out against this.        Israeli officials themselves have stated clearly that they       are carrying out collective punishment of Palestinians in       Gaza and use dehumanizing rhetoric that fuels the violence.       Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said: ``I have       ordered a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no       water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human       animals, and we act accordingly.'' As members of Congress, it       is our moral obligation not to support or echo these calls.        Last Friday, after this resolution was introduced, the       Israeli military called for all civilians of Gaza City--1.1       million people--to relocate south within 24 hours, as it       amassed tanks for an expected ground invasion. The UN       responded that evacuating everyone was impossible, with power       supplies cut and food and water running short after Israel       placed Gaza under total siege, and said this would have       ``devastating humanitarian consequences.'' The scale of       atrocities is enormous.        Doctors Without Borders staff say that painkillers and       anesthesia for operations have run out in Gaza, and sick       patients are screaming in pain while they also face the       looming threat of bombardment. They have called on Israel to       ``show humanity''--and we in Congress must do the same.        More quotes from Israeli government officials reflecting       dehumanizing and violent rhetoric, and intentions to carry       out collective punishment against Palestinians in Gaza:        ``I have ordered a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity,       no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are       fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.'' Israeli       Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant        ``This is a war between the children of light and the       children of darkness . . . It will be a deadly war.'' Israeli       Defense Minister Yoav Gallant        ``Humanitarian aid to Gaza? No electrical switch will be       turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck       will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home.''       Israeli Minister of Energy Israel Katz        ``Gaza will eventually turn into a city of tents. There       will be no buildings.'' Israeli security official        ``I say to the residents of Gaza: leave now because we will       operate forcefully everywhere.'' Israeli Prime Minister       Netanyahu. Palestinian civilians are literally unable to flee       or leave, because they are trapped under a 16-year Israeli       military siege.        ``Right now, one goal: Nakba! A Nakba that will overshadow       the Nakba of 48.'' Israeli Member of the Knesset Ariel       Kallner, referring to 1948 when hundreds of thousands of       Palestinians were forcibly displaced from their homes and       land.        ``It's time to be cruel.'' Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel       Smotrich        ``We need to deliver a blow that has not been seen for 50       years and take down Gaza.'' Israeli Member of the Knesset       Haim Katz        ``Hamas has opened the gates of hell into the Gaza strip.''       Head of the Israeli Coordination of Government Activities in       the Territories        Specifics notes on the resolution:        ``Whereas on October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a       massive, unprovoked war on Israel by air, land, and sea,       including firing thousands of rockets;''        This whereas clause decontextualizes this violence, which       did not begin on Saturday. Between January and September       2023, Israel killed 227 Palestinians, according to the UN.       Israeli settlers have rampaged throughout Palestinian       communities, torching houses and killing people. Entire       Palestinian communities have been driven from their homes by       Israeli settler violence. Israel has repeatedly attacked the       more than 2 million Palestinians living under its more than       16-year siege of Gaza, killing thousands of Palestinian       civilians, including hundreds of Palestinian children.       Palestinians have endured more than 75 years of brutal       Israeli rule, during which time tens of thousands of       Palestinians have been killed. They have suffered from the       systematic violation of their human rights by Israel since       1948 and have been denied their freedom and self-      determination.        Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists have killed       over 700 Israelis and injured more than 2,500 others;        The failure of this whereas clause to mention the fact that       Israel has killed more than 6,546 Palestinians since October       7, including over 2,000 children, is deeply problematic. All       human life is precious and sacred. This deliberate erasure of       Palestinians killed by Israel is deeply dehumanizing.        Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas is directly       responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians;        This whereas clause blames Palestinians for their own       deaths. War crimes go not justify more war crimes. Israel has       decided to attack Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by targeting       residential buildings, hospitals, ambulances, schools, and       mosques in one of the most densely populated places on earth,       knowing full well the grievous toll that such attacks will       inflict on Palestinian civilians. Israel, especially as the       occupying power of the Gaza Strip under international law, is       responsible for any violations of human rights and       international law it commits, just as Hamas is responsible       for any violations that it commits.        Whereas Hamas used rudimentary, civilian equipment such as       bulldozers, paragliders, and rubber boats in its assault on       Israel, demonstrating the importance of fully enforcing tight       controls on what materials go into the Gaza Strip, including       through thorough vetting of assistance;        This whereas clause advocates for the tightening of       Israel's more than 15 year illegal siege against 2 million       Palestinian civilians trapped in the Gaza Strip. Imposing       collective punishment against civilians by denying them       access to food, clean water, electricity, fuel, healthcare       and medicine, etc.--all prominent components of Israel's       illegal siege on Gaza--is a grave war crime.        Stands with Israel as it defends itself against the       barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists;        Congress should stand with all victims of violence, not       express selective concern for the lives of some but not       others. This resolved clause dehumanizes the Palestinian       people.        Mourns the over 700 Israelis killed and over 2,000 others       wounded in Hamas' unprovoked attack on Israel;        The failure to even mention Palestinian deaths in this       resolved clause is deeply problematic. Congress should mourn       the loss of all civilians killed, including the more than       6,546 Palestinians since October 7, including over 2,000       children. All human life is precious and sacred. This       deliberate erasure of Palestinians killed by Israel is deeply       dehumanizing.        Stands ready to assist Israel with emergency resupply and       other security, diplomatic, and intelligence support.        Congress should be taking steps to save lives and end the       violence, not exacerbate the violence by sending additiona1       weapons to Israel. Israel is already committing apparent war       crimes by targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure in       Gaza. Providing Israel with more weapons deepens U.S.       complicity in Israeli violence against Palestinian civilians       and reinforces the existing, untenable status quo of Israeli       oppression of Palestinians.
