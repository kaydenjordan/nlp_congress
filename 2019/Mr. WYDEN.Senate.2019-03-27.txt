 Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator  Cotton from Arkansas, am introducing the Senate Cybersecurity  Protection Act to defend the integrity of American democracy by  providing cybersecurity protection for the personal accounts and  electronic devices of Senators and and key members of their staff.   In 2016, hackers working for the Russian government broke into a  range of targets, including the network of the Democratic National  Committee and the email account of Senator Hillary Clinton's  presidential campaign manager, John Podesta. These widely publicized  breaches are only the tip of the iceberg. These hacks are widely known  today because the emails stolen from these accounts were subsequently  weaponized and used as part of a campaign to influence the outcome of  several elections--most publicly, the presidential race between Donald  Trump and Hillary Clinton, but also U.S. House of Representatives races  in Illinois, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, and  Pennsylvania. Senator Lindsey Graham also reported that his campaign's  email was successfully compromised.   While the Russian hacks in 2016 were a watershed moment, these are  merely the most visible and disruptive examples of foreign intelligence  services  [[Page S2046]]  using offensive cyber capabilities to target those involved in our  political process. Senior officials from the 2008 Obama and McCain  presidential campaigns have publicly confirmed that both organizations  were compromised by hackers. In 2017, the media reported that then- White House Chief of Staff John Kelly's personal cell phone had been  compromised, possibly for as long as ten months before the malware was  discovered. And in 2018, media reports revealed that the personal email  accounts of senior congressional staffers had been targeted by the  notorious Russian hacking group ``Fancy-Bear.'' These and other events  clearly demonstrate the unique threats faced by Senators and their  staff. Unfortunately, as I revealed in a letter to Senate leadership  last year, the Sergeant At Arms (SAA), which is responsible for the  Senate's cybersecurity, informed me that it currently lacks the  authority to use official Senate resources to protect the personal  devices and accounts of Senators and key Senate staff, even when those  staff are being targeted by foreign governments.   Senators Cotton and I are not alone in recognizing the seriousness of  this national security threat.   Last year, then-Director of the National Security Agency Admiral  Michael Rogers acknowledged in a letter to me that personal devices and  accounts of senior U.S. government officials ``remain prime targets for  exploitation.'' Likewise, in written responses to post-hearing  questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee last year, Director of  National Intelligence Dan Coats wrote that ``[t]he personal accounts  and devices of government officials can contain information that is  useful for our adversaries to target, either directly or indirectly,  these officials and the organizations with which they are affiliated.''  The Appropriations Committee also noted last year in its report  accompanying the 2019 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill that it  ``continues to be concerned that Senators are being targeted for  hacking and cyber attacks, especially via their personal devices and  accounts.''   Currently, Senators and staffers are expected to protect their own  devices and accounts from foreign government hackers. This is absurd.  Senators and the vast majority of their staff are not cybersecurity  experts, and certainly do not have the training our resources to defend  themselves from sophisticated foreign intelligence agencies. Eric  Rosenbach, who was formerly Chief of Staff to Secretary of Defense Ash  Carter, has endorsed the bill we are introducing today, observing that  ``Senators and their staff should not be expected to go toe to toe with  some of the most sophisticated adversaries in cyberspace; authorizing  protection of personal accounts is a critical component of our cyber  defense efforts.'' Likewise, Bruce Schreier, a noted cybersecurity  expert has also endorsed the bill, stating that ``[i]t is ludicrous to  expect individual senators and their staff to to defend themselves from  spies and hackers. Hostile foreign intelligence services do not respect  the arbitrary line between work and personal technology. As such, the  U.S. government must extend its defensive cyber perimeter to include  legislators' personal devices and accounts.''   Our bill would permit the SAA to provide voluntary, opt-in  cybersecurity assistance to Senators and key Senate staff to secure  their personal devices and accounts. Any Senate staffer would be  eligible to receive assistance, provided that the Senator employing  them determines that they are highly vulnerable to cyber attacks and  information collection because of their position in the Senate.   There is precedent for extending cybersecurity protection to the  personal devices of government officials. Section 1645 of the 2017  National Defense Authorization Act permits the Secretary of Defense to  provide personal device cybersecurity assistance to officials whom the  secretary ``determines to be highly vulnerable to cyber attacks and  hostile information collection activities because of the positions  occupied by such personnel in the Department.'' The Senate  Cybersecurity Protection Act is also similar to provisions included in  the intelligence authorization bill approved by the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence in 2018, which would permit the Director of  National Intelligence to protect the personal devices and accounts of  high-risk staff in the intelligence community.   Passage of this common sense, bipartisan legislation would provide  Senators and their staff with much-needed protection for their personal  accounts and devices, and with them, the integrity of American  democracy. I thank my colleague Senator Cotton for his efforts on this  bill, and hope the Senate will promptly pass this vital legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Mr.          Cardin, Mr. Coons, Ms. Duckworth, Ms. Harris, Mr. Kaine, Ms.          Klobuchar, Mr. Markey, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schatz,          and Mr. Reed):   S. 894. A bill to authorize dedicated domestic terrorism offices  within the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice,  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to analyze and monitor domestic  terrorist activity and require the Federal Government to take steps to  prevent domestic terrorism; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
