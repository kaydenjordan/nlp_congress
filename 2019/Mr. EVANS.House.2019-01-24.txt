 Madam Speaker, it is day 34 of the Trump shutdown.   Tomorrow will mark the second missed paycheck for 800,000 Federal  workers and for many Federal contractors, as well.   I have spent parts of 2 days at the Philadelphia airport meeting with  the workers and seeing the needs. These people in the groups are  stepping up.   Everyone is looking to the Republicans and the President to step up.  We must reopen this government.   Pay these workers now.   Pay these workers now.   Pay these workers now.   Pay these workers now.   Pay these workers now.   Pay these workers now.                            ____________________
