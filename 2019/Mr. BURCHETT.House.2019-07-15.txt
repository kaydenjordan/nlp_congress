 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Clayton Edward  Narveson, an American hero and World War II combat veteran.   Mr. Narveson joined the United States Marine Corps following the  attack on Pearl Harbor. He fought in the Battle of Tarawa in November  of 1943. And during February and March of 1945, he served as a gunner  on an 81 mm mortar during the Battle of Iwo Jima, one of the bloodiest  battles in Marine Corps history, and our country's history.   After the war, Mr. Narveson attended St. Paul College of Law and had  a successful career as an attorney.   For two decades, Mr. Narveson has made presentations to students  telling some of the stories of his times in service and the struggles  he and his family faced during the Great Depression. Through these  presentations, he reminds young folks of the importance of serving your  country and how blessed we are to live in the United States of America.   There are real heroes in this world, and they aren't music stars,  famous athletes, or Hollywood actors. Our country's heroes are the men  and women of our Armed Forces, like Mr. Narveson, who served and  sacrificed for our freedom.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to honor Clayton Narveson as the  Tennessee Second District's July 2019 Veteran of the Month and to thank  him for his service to our country, his dedication to his work and  family, and for his continued support of our community and our great  country.                            ____________________
