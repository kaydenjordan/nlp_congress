 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of  my opening statement at the Senate Health Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     Reauthorizing HEA: Addressing Campus Sexual Assault and Ensuring                         Student Safety and Rights          The Senate Committee on Health, Education,       Labor and Pensions will please come to order. Senator Murray       and I will each have an opening statement, and then we will       introduce the witnesses. After the witnesses' testimony,       senators will each have 5 minutes of questions.        Today's hearing will focus on how colleges and universities       should respond to accusations of sexual assault. This is an       important and difficult topic. For that reason, I am glad       that Senator Murray and I have been able to agree to a       bipartisan hearing and to agree on the witnesses.        On these issues, I have the perspective of a father of       daughters and sons, of a grandfather, a lawyer, a governor,       and also a former Chairman of the Board and president of a       large public university. As a university administrator, my       first priority always was the safety of students. My goal was       to quickly and compassionately respond to victims of alleged       assaults, offering counseling and other support, including       assisting the victim if he or she wished to report the       assault to law enforcement. And my goal also was to protect       the rights of both the accused and the victim to ensure that       campus disciplinary processes were fair.        If you are an administrator at one of 6,000 American       colleges and universities and you ask your legal counsel what       laws the institution must follow when it comes to allegations       of sexual assault, your counsel would reply that there are       several places to look.        First, you would look to federal statutes. Two federal laws       govern allegations of sexual assault. All colleges and       universities that receive federal funds, including federal       financial aid, must follow them. First, Title IX of the       Education Amendments Act of 1972, which states ``no person in       the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded       from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be       subjected to discrimination under any education program or       activity.'' In 1999, the Supreme Court ruled in Davis v.       Monroe County Board of Education that student-on-student       sexual harassment is covered by Title IX.        And second, the Clery Act, as amended in 2013 by the       Violence Against Women Act, which requires colleges to have       ``procedures for institutional disciplinary action in cases       of alleged domestic violence, dating violence, sexual       assault, or stalking.''        The law mandates ``such proceedings shall provide a prompt,       fair, and impartial investigation and resolution'' and ``the       accuser and the accused are entitled to the same       opportunities to have others present during an institutional       disciplinary proceeding, including the opportunity to be       accompanied to any related meeting or proceeding by an       advisor of their choice.'' That advisor may be a lawyer. The       law also requires institutions to state in their procedures       ``the standard of evidence that will be used during any       institutional conduct proceeding,'' but it did not say what       that standard had to be.        Next your counsel would refer you to regulations based upon       these two federal laws. These regulations also have the force       of law. First, the relevant regulation under Title IX       requires schools to have a disciplinary process which is       defined in the regulation as ``a grievance procedure       providing for [a] prompt and equitable resolution.''        Regulations under the Clery Act define a ``prompt, fair,       and impartial proceeding.'' Under these regulations, the       institution ``may establish restrictions regarding the extent       to which the advisor of choice may participate in the       proceedings.'' Your counsel will also tell you that sometimes       the U.S. Department of Education will send out a letter or       guidance to institutions, giving its interpretation of what a       law or regulation might mean. Such letters or guidance do not       have the force of law; they are only advisory.  [[Page S2603]]       But campuses sometimes consider them binding as a law and       unfortunately Department officials have, in the past, made       the same mistake.        For example, in 2011 and 2014, during the Obama       Administration, officials at the U.S. Department of Education       wrote two guidance letters interpreting Title IX, saying, in       deciding whether an accused student is guilty of sexual       assault, the decider ``must use a preponderance of the       evidence standard.''        It was no surprise that many campuses thought this       interpretation was the law because the Department acted as if       it were the law, when it was only advisory. On June 26, 2014,       at a hearing before this Committee, I asked the former       Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the Department of       Education, Catherine Lhamon,''do you expect institutions to       comply with your Title IX guidance documents?'' She       responded, ``We do.''        In September 2017, Secretary DeVos withdrew both of these       letters of guidance and a year later, in November of last       year, proposed to replace them with a new rule under Title       IX, a process which allows extensive comment and discussion       and would have the force of law when it is final.        That is not all your legal counsel would tell you. If       you're the president of a public institution--where 80       percent of undergraduates attend college--your counsel would       remind you that your disciplinary process must meet the       standards of the 14th Amendment to the United States       Constitution which says ``nor shall any state deprive any       person or life, liberty, or property without due process of       law.''        And then finally you'd have to look at any applicable state       laws. For example, if you are an administrator at one of       Tennessee's public colleges, the state's Uniform       Administrative Procedures Act mandates that at public       colleges and universities a student facing suspension or       expulsion must be given the option to have a full       administrative hearing with the right to counsel and ``the       opportunity to . . . conduct cross-examination.''        This array of laws and regulations creates a challenge for       college administrators, for students who allege an assault,       and for those who are accused to know what the law requires,       so the purpose of today's hearing is to hear how we can       create more certainty in how colleges and universities should       appropriately and fairly respond to allegations of sexual       assault. During this hearing, I would like to focus on three       issues raised by the Department's proposed rule: The       requirements of due process, including cross examination; the       effect of the location of the alleged assault; and The       definition of sexual harassment.        According to an article published by the Cornell Law       Review, more than 100 lawsuits have been filed by students       accused of sexual assault who claim schools denied them due       process. In one lawsuit, an accused student sued Brandeis       University. The opinion of the judge of the U.S. District       Court for the District of Massachusetts criticized the       Department of Education's earlier 2011 guidance for causing       schools to adopt unfair procedures saying:        ``In recent years, universities across the United States       have adopted procedural and substantive policies intended to       make it easier for victims of sexual assault to make and       prove their claims and for the schools to adopt punitive       measures in response. That process has been substantially       spurred by the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of       Education, which issued a `Dear Colleague' letter in 2011       demanding that universities do so or face a loss of federal       funding. The goal of reducing sexual assault, and providing       appropriate discipline for offenders, is certainly laudable.       Whether the elimination of basic procedural protections--and       the substantially increased risk that innocent students will       be punished--is a fair price to achieve that goal is another       question altogether.''        In February of this year, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader       Ginsburg told the Atlantic, ``There's been criticism of some       college codes of conduct for not giving the accused person a       fair opportunity to be heard, and that's one of the basic       tenets of our system, as you know, everyone deserves a fair       hearing.''        In an attempt to meet that requirement, the Department's       proposed rule would require institutions to hold a ``live       hearing,'' which is defined as a hearing in which ``the       decision-maker must permit each party to ask the other party       and any witnesses all relevant questions and follow-up       questions, including those challenging credibility. Such       cross-examination at the hearing must be conducted by the       party's advisor of choice.''        The proposed rule would allow parties who do not feel       comfortable being in the same room with each other to request       to be in separate rooms, visible by a video feed, for       example. This definition of a live hearing aligns with recent       decisions by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and a       California State Court of Appeals.        In the Sixth Circuit case, a student accused of sexual       assault sued the University of Michigan, alleging the school       violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment       when it did not hold a hearing with the opportunity for the       accused to cross-examine his accuser and other witnesses. The       Sixth Circuit ruled in favor of the accused student stating:       ``if a public university has to choose between competing       narratives to resolve a case, the university must give the       accused student or his agent an opportunity to cross-examine       the accuser and adverse witnesses in the presence of a       neutral fact-finder.''        And in California, the State Court of Appeals for the       Second District made a similar finding, stating: ``when a       student accused of sexual misconduct faces severe       disciplinary sanctions, and the credibility of witnesses . .       . is central to the adjudication of the allegation,       fundamental fairness requires, at a minimum, that the       university provide a mechanism by which the accused may       cross--examine those witnesses, directly or indirectly, at a       hearing in which the witnesses appear in person or by other       means.''        Some college administrators have said to me, I do not want       to turn our campus into a courtroom. Others point out that       the requirements of fairness and due process often require       inconvenient administrative burdens. It seems to me that the       question before us is, how can the law satisfy the       Constitutional requirements of Due Process without imposing       unnecessary administrative burdens and expense on higher       education institutions.        A second issue is the location of the alleged assault. The       proposed rule requires schools to respond to an allegation of       sexual assault even if it is off-campus if the ``conduct       occurs within [an institution's] education program or       activity.'' For example, the proposed rule cites a federal       district court in Kansas that held that Kansas State       University was required to respond to an allegation of sexual       assault that occurred at an off-campus fraternity house       because the house was university-recognized and the school       exercised oversight over the fraternity. There is some       question about the definition of university program or       activity. And a second question is if a university can choose       to go beyond university programs or activities to protect       their students.        The third issue is how federal law or regulation should       define sexual harassment. The proposed rule uses a definition       established by the United States Supreme Court in 1999 in the       case Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, which       requires the conduct to be ``so severe, pervasive, and       objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person       equal access to the [institution's] education program or       activity.'' Some have suggested we look at other definitions       in federal law or Supreme Court precedent.        In the future, regulations with the force of law and       guidance letters that are merely advisory will continue to       interpret federal laws and constitutional requirements       governing allegations of sexual assault on campus. But as       Congress seeks to reauthorize the Higher Education Act this       year, we should do our best to agree on ways to clarify these       three issues. The more we do that the more certainty and       stability we will give to the law governing how institutions       of higher education should respond to accusations of sexual       assault.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of  my opening statement at the Senate Health Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                        FAFSA Simplification Hearing          There are not many things that United States       senators can do to cause 20 million American families to say,       ``thank you.''        After five years of work, we are ready to do just that by       reducing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid--the       FAFSA--from 108 questions to two dozen, and eliminate the       need for families to give their financial information to the       federal government twice.        This will help 400,000 families in Tennessee, 350,000       families in Senator Murray's Washington State, and millions       more for each of us who have it in our hands to finish our       work on simplifying the FAFSA.        A volunteer mentor with Tennessee Promise, which is our       state's program that provides two years of free community       college, told me that the FAFSA--the form that 20 million       families fill out each year to apply for federal student       aid--has a ``chilling effect'' on students and on parents.        The former president of Southwest Tennessee Community       College in Memphis told me he believes that he loses 1,500       students each semester because the FAFSA is too complicated.        East Tennessee State University said a third of their       applicants--approximately 10,000--are selected each year for       verification--a complicated process that stops Pell Grant       payments while a student and their family scrambles to submit       their federal tax information or prove they did not have to       file taxes.        Former Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam told me that       Tennessee has the highest rate of filling out the FAFSA, but       it is still the single biggest impediment to more students       enrolling in Tennessee Promise.        And one of the questions I hear most from students is, can       you please make it simpler to apply for federal aid?        Five years ago at a hearing before this Committee we heard       that the vast majority of questions on the FAFSA are       unnecessary.        I asked if the four witnesses could each write a letter to       the Committee recommending how they would simplify the FAFSA.  [[Page S2604]]         The witnesses looked at each other and said, we don't have       to write you four letters--we can write you one letter       because we agree.        And Senator Bennet, who was on the Committee at the time,       said, if that's true, and if there's that much agreement, why       don't we do what you recommend?        So we started talking with other Senators, students,       college administrators, and other experts about how to       simplify the FAFSA.        Simplifying the FAFSA started gaining traction.        First, the Obama Administration allowed families to fill       out the FAFSA using their tax information from the previous       year so they could apply to school in the fall, rather than       having to wait until spring.        Second, the Trump Administration has put the FAFSA       application on a phone app. I was at Sevier County High       School in November and saw students zipping through the FAFSA       on their iPhones.        Third, last year the Senate passed legislation Senator       Murray and I introduced that allows students to answer up to       22 questions on the FAFSA with just one click and will stop       requiring students to give the same information to the       federal government twice. We are working with the House to       see if we can make that a law this year.        The final step should be our bipartisan solution that will       reduce the number of questions on the FAFSA from 108 to 15-25       questions.        In 2015, Senator Bennet and I, along with Senators Booker,       Burr, King, Enzi, Warner, and Isakson, introduced bipartisan       legislation that would have reduced the number of FAFSA       questions to two. But after discussions with college       administrators and states, we realized we needed to keep some       questions or states and schools would have to create their       own additional forms that students would need to fill out.        Over the last four years, we have improved that legislation       and now believe we can move forward with bipartisan       legislation that would reduce the FAFSA to 15-25 questions.        Here is what all of these improvements mean to the 20       million families that fill out the FAFSA every year:        One: Reduce the 108 questions to 15-25.        Two: Dramatically decrease the number of students selected       for verification, because students' tax data would       automatically transfer to the Department of Education which       would greatly reduce the need for verification.        Three: Simplifying the form and the verification process       should encourage more students to apply for federal aid,       which will ensure that eligible students receive the Pell       they deserve.        Four: Students can now complete the FAFSA on their iPhone.        Five: Families can now apply for federal student aid sooner       because they can use information from their last year's tax       return; and        Six: Students can find out as early as eighth grade how       much Pell grant funding they may be eligible for.        And seven: there is a $6 billion advantage to taxpayers--      that is the amount the Department of Education estimates is       issued in improper payments every year        These are seven huge advantages and are the result of five       years of hearings and work by senators, and work by both the       Obama and Trump Administrations. Bipartisan discussions have       produced a lot of agreement on simplifying the number of       questions, so the purpose of this hearing is to learn what we       need to know before taking the final step.        I also hear from students--can you make repaying student       loans simpler?        A large number of Republican and Democrat senators have       suggested streamlining the nine ways to repay student loans,       including Senators Warner, King, Rubio, Merkley, Burr and       Baldwin.        I have proposed having just two ways to repay student       loans:        One, a plan based on a borrower's income, which would never       require the borrower to make payments of more than ten       percent of his or her discretionary income. If a borrower       wanted to pay off their loan, the other option would be a 10-      year payment plan, with equal monthly payments, similar to a       10-year mortgage. And under both options, a borrower's       payment would come directly from their paycheck.        This proposal would make it easier for more than 9 million       borrowers annually, and any of the current 42 million       borrowers with outstanding federal loan debt, to take       advantage of a simpler and more affordable way to repay their       loans.        And from administrators I hear--can't you do something       about the administrative burden that wastes time and money       that could instead be spent on students?        To help administrators overwhelmed by what the Kirwan-      Zeppos report called ``a jungle of red tape,'' I am proposing       we simplify federal regulations that take time and money away       from educating students.        There are other steps this Committee is considering to make       college worth students' time and money, but we also have the       opportunity to greatly simplify the ``chilling effect''       applying for federal aid has on students today.                            ____________________
