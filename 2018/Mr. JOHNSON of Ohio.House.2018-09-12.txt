 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an American  hero, Sergeant Gerald Timmann.   Sergeant Timmann is a Vietnam combat veteran from Leetonia, Ohio, who  served in the 101st Airborne from 1967 to 1969. He spent 13 grueling  months in Vietnam's jungles and was exposed to some of the worst  battles in the conflict.   Ten days prior to the end of his tour, Sergeant Timmann was hit by a  grenade during combat, causing him to lose both legs. Sergeant Timmann  says he is forever grateful to the brave medevac helicopter crews that,  under heavy fire, rescued him.   In honor of his profound bravery, Sergeant Timmann has deservedly  received a number of awards, including the Purple Heart, Infantry  Combat Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.   Sergeant Timmann exemplifies the selfless courage of our military,  and I am honored to share his story with the Nation today.                            ____________________
