 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the legacy of Dr.  Joan Phillips for her many years of service dedicated to child well- being and to all people of West Virginia.   I have often said there is no greater accomplishment than to find  yourself in a position to give back to the community you love. Dr.  Phillips embodies giving, always willing to lend support and knowledge  to those in need throughout her career.   Protecting and serving vulnerable people was her passion, one that  motivated her throughout four decades of professional work. Dr.  Phillips is viewed by her colleagues, and rightfully so, as an advocate  for vulnerable children of West Virginia. Most recently serving as the  co-medical director of Child Advocacy Center of Charleston Area Medical  Center, her list of accomplishments is staggering, continuously  pioneering child advocacy standards across the region.   As West Virginia's first ever board-certified child abuse  pediatrician, Dr. Phillips has always been pivotable in ensuring that  the children of our State receive the correct level of care. Over the  course of her admirable career, Dr. Phillips has changed countless  lives, both internally through the Child Advocacy Network and  externally consulting through private practice. As a result of her  efforts, she was in the first round of child abuse subspeciality  recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics.   Dr. Phillips always made time to consult on cases and never turned  down the opportunity to assist regardless of location. Other  physicians, law enforcement officers and child protective services  workers regularly sought her expertise and advice.   Over the years, Dr. Phillips held many leadership roles, including  president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, numerous boards of  local and statewide organizations, community health agencies, family  service agencies, as well as State and national committees related to  issues regarding child well-being.   Not only did Dr. Philips fiercely dedicate her time to advancing  child healthcare, but she also found time to pass her knowledge along  to others. She regularly presented at conferences, mentored other child  abuse medical providers and taught within medical and residency  programs at West Virginia University and Marshall University. I know  she has inspired many young leaders throughout her illustrious career,  and I am confident they will carry the torch to ensure a brighter  tomorrow. Truly, her legacy of dedication to health and childcare  services is one we should all instill in ourselves.   With an unrivaled, strong spirit of optimism and innovation, her  commitment to preventing and treating child abuse in our communities is  something to admire. Her work has undoubtedly changed the quality of  healthcare in the State of West Virginia. I will always be grateful to  Dr. Phillips for her lifetime of influential work.   While she is retiring and everyone is sure to miss her strong  leadership, Dr. Phillips' unwavering dedication will leave a lasting  legacy on the countless lives she has touched. Again, I congratulate  Dr. Phillips for her remarkable years of service and her outstanding  dedication to improving our great Nation, and I am honored to wish good  health and much happiness to her and her family in the days and years  ahead.                            ____________________
