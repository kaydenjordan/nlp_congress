 Madam Speaker, as a proud member of the Congressional  Armenian Caucus, I rise in recognition of yesterday's historic passage  of H. Res. 296 to affirm the United States' recognition of the Armenian  genocide.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent many people of Armenian  descent who live in northern New Jersey. In Bergen County, we hold an  annual ceremony on April 24 to remember the day in 1915 when hundreds  of Armenian intellectuals were rounded up and ultimately murdered at  the beginning of the Armenian genocide.   The massacre of 1.5 million Armenians, as well as Greeks, Assyrians,  Chaldeans, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronities, and other Christians, by the  Ottoman Empire constituted the 20th century's first genocide.   As a Jewish American, the need to recognize genocide is deeply  personal for me. My relatives lost their entire family during the Nazi  attempt to exterminate European Jewry.  [[Page H8609]]    I know that it is never the wrong time to bear witness and tell the  truth. The United States should never be complicit in denying genocide.   As a proud member of the bipartisan Armenian Caucus, co-chaired by my  friend, Chairman Frank Pallone, I will continue working hard in  Congress for justice on behalf of New Jersey and the Fifth  Congressional District's great Armenian American community.                            ____________________
