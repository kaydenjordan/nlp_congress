The Senator from Maryland  has been working on this issue for a long time.  [[Page S1372]]    Ben, thank you for your leadership,   I thank Lisa Murkowski for making it a bipartisan effort.   I have a good speech here, but I want to tell you a story. The story  goes back to my graduation from law school and the first job I ever  had.   I was working for the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Illinois--a  man named Paul Simon, who went on to be elected to Congress and to the  U.S. Senate. Simon, as the Lieutenant Governor of Illinois, presided  over the Illinois State Senate. We had met one another. He said he was  going to offer me a job when I graduated from law school, and lo and  behold, I became parliamentarian of the Illinois State Senate. I was  fresh out of law school. I skipped my graduation ceremony because I  desperately needed some money to pay off some bills. I started working  in Springfield, IL, as the parliamentarian of the State senate.   Simon mistakenly believed that there was a course in law school  called parliamentary law. There wasn't. I had to learn it by just  reading the rule book over and over again until it became familiar, but  eventually I was pretty good at it. I needed to be because we had a big  debate going on in Springfield, IL, in the early 1970s about something  called the Equal Rights Amendment. It was different than the debate in  many State capitols because there was a real confrontation. There was  no party identity behind or for the Equal Rights Amendment. Some  Republicans supported it, and many Democrats supported it, but there  was opposition in both parties too.   What fired up the troops in that particular debate was the presence  of a woman from Alton, IL, named Phyllis Schlafly, who was leading the  national effort to stop the Equal Rights Amendment. I reflect on that  this evening because I remember what she used to say: If you pass the  Equal Rights Amendment, men and women are going to use the same  bathrooms. Not only that, women are going to be forced to fight in  combat in the military. They will be drafted, and they will all be  fighting in the military.   I look back on those arguments now and say: Was that it? Was it  really that the debate on the equality of women in America came down to  those two issues?   I thought of it the other day when I went to a school that I was  visiting that had a same-gender restroom. It was a single restroom, but  either gender could use it. I thought, Phyllis Schlafly's dream came  true in that we are sharing the same restrooms in some places. When it  comes to combat in the military, many women across the United States  fought for that right to do so and have served our country honorably.   But those were the arguments and the differences of the day which led  to the debate and led to Illinois's not ratifying the Equal Rights  Amendment in the 1970s. That didn't happen until very recently.   We had a hearing on this, as the Presiding Officer knows, in the  Senate's Judiciary Committee, and I listened to the critics of the  Equal Rights Amendment today. I didn't hear anything about same-sex  restrooms and nothing about combat in the military, but one lady raised  the prospect that if we pass the Equal Rights Amendment, it would ruin  her daughter's field hockey team in high school because there may be  some transgender individuals wanting to play on her daughter's team.   I thought to myself, so now it has come to that. It is no longer  restrooms or combat pay; it is a question of field hockey for young  ladies.   Well, I know that is an important part of their lives, and she told  us as much, but when I reflect on what the reality of this amendment  does, it seems that those things pale in comparison. The language of it  is so expressed and so clear that most people in the United States  really would be surprised to know it is not already in the  Constitution: no discrimination against people on the basis of sex.  Most people assume that is a fact, but it is not. We have to do  something about it.   Tonight, we are seeing the Senate at its best--a bipartisan effort on  the floor of the U.S. Senate to finally make this right by America. The  Equal Rights Amendment is literally a century in the making, and over  the years, generations of Americans have done their part to push it  forward. They have marched on Washington, and they have met with  Congressmen and Senators. As of 2020, they crossed a crucial threshold:  the ratification of the ERA in 38 States. That is the exact number of  States needed to certify it as the 28th Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution.   So now it is time for lawmakers in Congress to do our part in  supporting the ERA. We need to clear a path for equality, and this  proposal--this bipartisan proposal from Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland  and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska--is our chance to do it. It will  remove the arbitrary deadline Congress imposed on the ERA ratification  more than 50 years ago, and removing that deadline has never been more  important.   As we learned over the past year, there is no room for uncertainty  when it comes to protecting equal rights. Right now, women all across  America are living with the reality that their fundamental freedoms are  under attack. In the months since the disastrous Dobbs decision,  millions of Americans have been robbed of their reproductive rights.  Activist judges and far-right politicians have replaced the will of the  people and the expertise of medical professionals with their own  radical beliefs. Women living in States like Texas, Oklahoma, and most  recently Florida and North Dakota have fewer rights today than their  parents and grandparents did decades ago.   All of this chaos and confusion is jeopardizing the lives of women  and upending our healthcare system. We had another hearing today. There  was testimony in that hearing by a young lady from Texas who went  through an awful ordeal at the end of a pregnancy--a pregnancy which  she wanted desperately. It was her first child. It would have been her  first daughter, and Willow was the name she had given her. Then, late  in the pregnancy, complications arose. Willow, unfortunately, couldn't  be born, and the mother almost died while waiting to comply with the  new Texas law on abortion.    I am going to remember that testimony for a long time.   Without ERA protections, even basic rights like reproduction are on  the chopping block. We need protection against discrimination in the  workplace, in the classroom, even in the courtroom. Unless women's  rights are explicitly protected under the Constitution, there is  nothing stopping the rightwing majority on the Court from ripping them  away. That is why Congress must restore and protect women's rights in  all facets of life. We can do it this week by clearing the way and  finally enshrining gender equality in the Constitution.   I had the honor of presiding over a hearing on this very proposal in  the Senate Judiciary Committee several weeks ago. During that hearing,  we heard from a young woman whose name was Thursday Williams--a first- generation American, a board member of the ERA Coalition, and a senior  at Trinity College in Hartford, CT. Ms. Williams is planning on  attending law school after she graduates from college. She says she  developed a passion for the law when she ``fell in love with the U.S.  Constitution in high school.''   In her words:         What I love the most about the Constitution is how       brilliantly it was designed to adapt to the changing needs of       its people, and, today, we deserve a Constitution that       guarantees equality regardless of sex, a Constitution that we       can use as a tool to fight discrimination.    That was her testimony.   Ms. Williams concluded by asking members of the committee a question.  It is a question I would like to now ask every Member of the Senate:  How can we be the beacon of freedom and democracy we claim to be if we  do not declare that sex discrimination contradicts the American dream?   That was Thursday Williams' question to the Senate Judiciary  Committee. It is my question to the Senate on her behalf.   If we want to live up to the promise of America, we need to protect  the rights of every American. Let's start with the ERA.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1310         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
