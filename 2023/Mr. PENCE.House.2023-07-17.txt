 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to champion the fifth  reauthorization of the Animal Drug User Fee Act with Congresswoman  Schrier.   This important legislation is critical to ensuring safe and effective  drugs for our Nation's livestock industry and farm animals for the next  5 years. It provides resources for the review of new and generic animal  drugs, accelerates the development of animal therapeutics, and promotes  a more predictable and streamlined review process.   It is important we hold the FDA accountable to performance goals that  will enhance inspection times and provide regulatory certainty for both  innovators and pet owners alike.   Farmers, ranchers, and rural communities across southern Indiana rely  on veterinary medicines and therapeutics produced by animal drug  manufacturers. Innovators in the Hoosier State, like Elanco Animal  Health, are leading the charge to keep American farm animals safe and  healthy. We need innovation in veterinary medicine to secure the best  care for our Nation's veterinary patients.   This legislation would preserve the security of America's food supply  by making certain the medications administered to food-producing  animals are safe for animal and human health.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for final passage of this legislation.  [[Page H3624]]         Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me  in supporting my legislation, H.R. 813, the Global Investment in  American Jobs Act.   This bill seeks to improve the attractiveness of foreign investment  from allied nations and identify barriers that are holding back  American competitiveness.   Over 200,000 Hoosiers are directly employed by international  companies, 56 percent of which are in the manufacturing sector. Because  of our long, storied history as a leader in manufacturing, companies  across the world have keyed in to Indiana.   Before companies started outsourcing operations to China and other  countries, company towns had lifted small and rural communities across  the Hoosier State. Take Cummins Engine Company, for example. I have  lived in Columbus, Indiana, my entire life, and nearly every family, my  own included, has some connection to the company that has helped build  and grow Columbus.   Beyond Indiana, communities across the country share similar stories  where foreign investment has lifted up communities with stable, good- paying jobs. International companies in the U.S. employ 8 million  workers and, over the past 5 years, have created 400,000 new  manufacturing jobs.   As countries across the world rethink partnerships with the Chinese  Communist Party and other bad actors, we have an opportunity to  leverage investments from allied nations.   Importantly, this legislation would seek to uncover actions from the  CCP to gain access to U.S. markets and circumvent national security  laws. For decades, China has built a calculated strategy to corner  global supply chains through IP theft and free-market manipulation.  H.R. 813 addresses anticompetitive practices of the CCP to undermine  innovation and gain footholds in next-generation technologies.    I am encouraged that the Global Investment in American Jobs Act has  long had broad, bipartisan support, like from my colleague from  California, Congresswoman Eshoo. I look forward to working across the  aisle to pass this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill.
