 Mr. Speaker, Dreamers are American citizens in every  sense of the word. For most, America is the only home they have ever  known.   Despite what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue,  Dreamers are not a drain on the country.   Dreamers contribute to our economy by adding an estimated $42 billion  to the GDP every year. That is six times more than the cost of DACA.   They participate in our workforce, own small businesses, create jobs,  pay taxes, and spend billions of dollars every year on goods and  services. Most importantly, they enrich our lives and are valued  members of our communities.   When the pandemic hit, over 62,000 Dreamers stepped up and provided  lifesaving healthcare to all of us. Now, it is our turn to look out for  our neighbors, our coworkers, and our friends. They have earned the  right to call America home.   H.R. 6 provides a path to citizenship for Dreamers as well as  temporary protected status and deferred enforced departure recipients.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' There is nothing more American  than the Dream Act.
