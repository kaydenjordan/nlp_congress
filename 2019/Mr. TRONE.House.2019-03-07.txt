 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 1, the For the People Act.   I ran for Congress to be a voice for those without a powerful PAC or  a special interest group to represent them.   The wealthy and connected, they will be fine.   For the people is who we are here to fight for: for the people who  are suffering from the addiction epidemic, for the people who are  living with diseases with no cure, and for the people who are targeted  by a broken criminal justice system that is anything but just. These  people don't have a PAC. These people, they don't have a lobbyist.   We won't be able to help those people until we end the corruption and  fix our democracy. That is why I am supporting the For the People Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to send this bill to the  President's desk so we can get to work on behalf of those without a  lobbyist, without a PAC.                            ____________________
