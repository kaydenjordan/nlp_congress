 For all who are looking for encouragement about the  future of our country, I want to call attention to the Fall 2021 issue  of ``Public Service Review,'' produced by the Stennis Center for Public  Service and available at www.stennis.gov. ``Public Service Review''  features rising young leaders across the country sharing their own  experiences, insights, and aspirations as they engage in public  service, both in their communities and around the world. The commitment  of these future leaders to keeping our Nation strong and free is truly  inspiring.   The eight authors featured in the fall 2021 issue are Alexis Eberlein  of Ohio University, Sarah Glaser of the University of South Florida,  Hannah Krawczyk of Auburn University, Mia Robertson of Mississippi  State University, Alanna Cronk of Georgetown University, Katie Medford  of Harvard University, Preeti Chemiti of Princeton University, and  Amitoj Kaur of Miami University.   ``Public Service Review'' provides young leaders a platform to share  stories of both challenge and hope as they focus on causes that draw  their unique passions. Their stories are hopegiving to those of us  currently engaged in public service and offer valuable perspectives for  younger students looking to become involved.   On behalf of my colleagues and fellow members of the Stennis Center  Board of Trustees, U.S. Senator Chris Coons, Tom Daffron, U.S.  Representative Terri Sewell, and former U.S. Representatives Martha  Roby and Gregg Harper, I commend the Stennis Center for this excellent  publication and encourage its wide distribution to audiences of all  ages.                            ____________________
