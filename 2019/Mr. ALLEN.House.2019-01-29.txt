 Madam Speaker, I rise today to tell you how honored I am  to have been recently selected to serve as the senior Republican on the  Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education Subcommittee under  the House Education and Labor Committee for the 116th Congress.   As the son of two educators and grandfather of 13, many of whom are  currently in school, I couldn't be happier to serve as the leading  Republican on the subcommittee that addresses a variety of issues  affecting K-12 education.   I have visited numerous schools throughout the 12th Congressional  District, and during every visit, I stress to young scholars how  important for their future it is to get an education.   With nearly 7 million available jobs throughout our country, it is  critical that we cultivate a qualified workforce to fill all of these  positions, and this mission starts in the classroom.   As the leading Republican, I look forward to working with my  colleagues to ensure that K-12 education remains local, while also  providing appropriate Federal support so that our Nation's students can  sufficiently be prepared to enter the workforce and everyone can  achieve the American Dream.                            ____________________
