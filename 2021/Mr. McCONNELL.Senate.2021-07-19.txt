 Madam President, runaway costs and surging inflation  are a huge worry for middle-class families. Every survey confirms it.  Every conversation confirms it.   Over the last 12 months, during this economic recovery, the average  American worker earned a 3.6-percent raise, but inflation has risen so  steeply that it has turned that into a nearly 2-percent pay cut.   Remember, at the beginning of the year, the Biden administration  inherited a historically strong economic trajectory. Thanks to the  smart, targeted, bipartisan policies we passed last year, our economy  was primed to get millions of Americans back to work with competitive  pay while consumers unleashed pent-up demand. But, alas, that was  before Democrats decided to pour $2 trillion into a long list of  liberal pet projects and insisted on making it less appealing for  workers to actually go back to work.   Today, essentials like gas and groceries have gotten more and more  expensive. Bigger purchases consumers had put off during the pandemic  are getting even further out of reach. Across the country, working  families and employers alike are feeling the pinch, an effective tax  increase on both the wages and the savings of the middle class.   Now, our colleagues weren't flying blind. They weren't naive. They  knew they were passing what the White House Chief of Staff said was  designed to be ``the most progressive domestic legislation in a  generation.'' And they knew the risks, which one liberal economist  described as ``inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a  generation.''   Sure enough, inflation just clocked the fastest year-on-year increase  since 2008, but, apparently, according to President Biden himself, the  solution is--listen to this--even more of the same. Today, instead of  deflecting attention from the fact that his administration's springtime  approach was flat wrong, the President actually doubled down. He  suggested the right way to shake this inflation was--listen to this-- another $3.5 trillion in spending.   This is the same reckless taxing and spending spree the Democrats  dreamt up when they assumed our economy would be having the opposite  problem. But now all that same borrowing, printing, and spending is  supposed to be what the doctor ordered to fight inflation?   Inflate our way out of inflation. Let's hope the American people  don't have to learn firsthand how that strategy would work out. Another  multitrillion-dollar reckless taxing and spending spree, believe me, is  the last thing American families need.  [[Page S4938]]                                ____________________     Madam President, now on an entirely different matter,  a few months ago, a group of Democrats and leftwing activists brought  the State of Georgia into the national spotlight. Tremendous outrage,  an air of total crisis, was cooked up, cooked up out of nowhere.   The State of Georgia was passing a mainstream, commonsense election  law. It combined widely popular integrity protections, protections like  voter ID, with a great deal of flexibility and availability to make  voting easy. It codified more flexible early voting and more flexible  mail-in voting than many Democratic-run States offer--for example, New  York.   Americans want to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. Voter  ID, for example, is popular with majorities of Black, White, and  Hispanic Americans. But in their ongoing bid to mount a Washington DC  takeover of our Nation's elections, Democrats seized on this mainstream  law and decided to start shouting that the sky was falling down in  Georgia--the sky is falling down in Georgia.   Unfortunately, for the people of Georgia, many people in the press  and corporate America bought it. They got Major League Baseball to move  its all-star game out of Georgia. Actual work opportunities, actual  prosperity for working people, were sacrificed to serve this faked  hysteria.   Well, today, Georgians got what you might call a very weak  consolation prize. Today, a week after the all-star game was supposed  to happen in Atlanta, Democrats themselves descended on the State to  stage a bit of partisan theater. Last week, the traveling road show was  Texas Democrats coming here to Washington to beg Senate Democrats to  seize power away from their own citizens and local governments.   This week, it was our own colleagues' turn to get on the jets, but  the rhetoric was just as hysterical and the conclusion all the same:  Washington Democrats need to grab unprecedented power and rewrite all  50 States' election laws. It is the same shtick we have been hearing  here in this Chamber for multiple years now.   Remember, their sweeping takeover bill was written long, long before  any of the State laws which they now claim are prompting it. This phony  outrage is wearing thin on the American people. Citizens know it isn't  attacking democracy to have things like commonsense voter ID and  commonsense voter list maintenance alongside lots of early voting, lots  of mail-in voting, and lots of election-day voting.   That kind of combination isn't an attack on democracy; it is the  definition of democracy. It is exactly what Americans want.    Madam President, for the past 3 years Bill Brasch has  led our shared fraternity, Phi Kappa Tau, as national president,  helping the organization navigate the tumultuous COVID-19 pandemic.  Through his work, he helped maintain a vast network of philanthropy and  brotherhood that has raised more than $1.6 million for charity in the  past 25 years and developed more than 100,000 men of character into men  of distinction since 1906. Bill has contributed immensely to the  continuity and growth of Phi Kappa Tau and helped it develop into a  formidable nationwide organization.   Bill attended my alma mater, the University of Louisville, and built  a prestigious reputation in student government and Greek life. He  remained at the school after graduation, spending 32 years coordinating  the construction and renovation of campus buildings, including the Phi  Kappa Tau fraternity house in 2007. He continued his involvement in Phi  Kappa Tau at both the local and national level, eventually rising to  his current role in 2018.   Bill saw our fraternity through one of its most challenging periods  when, in the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced colleges and  universities across the country to shutter. Thousands of brothers were  sent home from campus, threatening the very core of fraternity life.  Bill's tenure as national president, originally intended to be a 2-year  term, was extended into 2021 as the crisis forced Phi Kappa Tau to  cancel its national convention. However, through Bill's hard work, the  fraternity didn't just survive the pandemic but thrived. Phi Kappa Tau  is now well-prepared to return to campuses across the country and bring  young men back together in brotherhood, just as it has for more than a  century.   Bill Brasch has devoted his life to Phi Kappa Tau's mission ``to  champion a lifelong commitment to brotherhood, learning, ethical  leadership and exemplary character.'' In recognition of his  [[Page S4947]]  dedicated work, he has been named the University of Louisville Alumni  Fellow for 2021 and will be honored during the halftime celebration at  this year's homecoming football game. His mentorship and leadership  have been invaluable to our fraternity's success, both in Kentucky and  across America. On behalf of the Senate, I would like to thank Bill for  his leadership in times of crisis and congratulate him on a successful  presidency.                            ____________________     Madam President, for the past 15 years, Mark and Lori  Wilson have been key organizers of Kentucky's legendary Fancy Farm  Picnic, held annually at St. Jerome Catholic Church. This event brings  together elected officials and spectators from all over the  Commonwealth for good-natured debate and celebration. For decades, the  impassioned speeches and zingers delivered at the Fancy Farm Picnic  have riveted Kentuckians and brought nationwide fame to the event's  namesake hometown. The picnic also serves as a significant fundraiser  for St. Jerome, providing resources for the church's elementary school  and charitable efforts serving the community. All this success would  never have been possible without the dedicated leadership of local  volunteers like Mark and Lori.   Every year, Mark and Lori welcome upwards of 15,000 attendees to  Fancy Farm, KY, but that is merely the most widely known aspect of  their work. They are also deeply involved in St. Jerome, helping the  church year-round with its public service efforts. Mark is a longtime  member of the western Kentucky agriculture industry, often humorously  comparing his role at the Fancy Farm Picnic to farming: ``like growing  a crop of tobacco, it's a thirteen-month job.'' The couple are classic  Kentuckians, dedicated to community and tradition.   Though the Fancy Farm Picnic was canceled last year due to the  coronavirus pandemic, Mark and Lori built a strong foundation for the  event to continue full-speed ahead this year. Under the leadership of  their successor Steven Elder, Fancy Farm will continue to captivate the  Commonwealth with its annual festival of bingo, barbecue, and amicable  banter.   Mark and Lori have dedicated countless hours to their church,  community, and State. On behalf of the Senate, I would like to express  our gratitude for their committed work in support of the Commonwealth.                            ____________________
