 Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues from  both sides of the aisle to support this veterans COVID-19 relief  package, to do right by the millions of veterans across our country  struggling with this pandemic.   For months, I have been hearing from folks back home in Montana on  the need for Congress to put together a smart, targeted package that  will quickly provide communities across the country with the resources  they need to weather this storm. This includes delivering assistance  and vaccines to those who have worn the uniform and sacrificed for our  liberties.   If this year has taught us anything, it is that we need to secure  additional resources to expand medical services, mental healthcare, and  telehealth capabilities to protect and support our most vulnerable  populations.   And we need a distribution plan that will provide more predictability  when it comes to administering vaccines. That way, we could get more  vaccines into the veterans' arms as quickly as possible.   Today, we are putting a bicameral proposal on the table that delivers  tangible relief to veterans and families and all Americans who need  them. As we all know, proposals are rarely ever perfect, and this  package is no different.   But the truth is, we have good provisions in this bill that allow us  to provide serious relief to those who swore an oath to protect our  country. It will slow the spread of the virus, and it will help save  lives.   A previous package that was put forth by my Republican colleagues--I  [[Page S427]]  would say, thank you for doing that, but unfortunately, that package  didn't put as much as a dime to support our veterans and families.   Now, there are a lot of things we disagree upon in this body, but  delivering for our Nation's veterans should never be one of them. That  is why my colleagues and I worked with the Biden administration on this  new relief package that allocates $17 billion in critical resources and  assistance to the men and women who have served this country.   The truth is that out of almost 7 million veterans that the VA serves  nationwide, only 638,000 veterans have been vaccinated so far. Serious  efforts need to be made to reach more veterans, especially those  veterans who live in rural or country areas.   Additional funding under our proposal allows the VA to increase  vaccine distribution and outreach efforts to remote areas, ensuring all  veterans who want a vaccine can receive one.   It even goes a step further in accelerating the deployment of VA's  supply chain modernization initiative to improve the Department's  preparedness and response to public health emergencies. It takes an  aggressive approach in assisting vulnerable veterans by providing  mental health care options, medical equipment, and additional services  to women vets, those at risk of homelessness, and those who face  unemployment.   Make no mistake, this pandemic is taking a dangerous toll on our  veterans. Veterans are experiencing job losses at unprecedented rates.  The veteran unemployment rate for December was roughly double what it  was this time last year, up from 2.8 percent to 5.3 percent. And with  older veterans continuing to face more difficulty in the job market, it  makes this package even more necessary today.   Our proposal helps tackle veteran unemployment by establishing a VA  Rapid Retraining Assistance Program that will strengthen existing job  opportunities and establish new resources to get veterans employed and  back on their feet.   And for folks burdened by healthcare costs, our provisions waive  copayment billing and debt collection, as well as costs for COVID-19  testing, treatment, and vaccine services, because no veteran should  have to worry about choosing between accessing essential healthcare and  providing for their family during a global pandemic and an economic  crisis.   When veterans elect officials to Congress, they do so with the  expectation that they will get the job done. So while this proposal is  not a silver bullet, it is our best shot, however, at getting more  folks vaccinated and our economy back on track.   There should be no excuses. Veterans and all Americans are looking at  us to do the right thing. We do need bipartisan support in this Chamber  if we are going to put this pandemic behind us, and we do need it  today.
