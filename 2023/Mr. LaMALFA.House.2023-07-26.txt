 Mr. Speaker, as we know, the Chinese Communist Party  poses one of the greatest existential challenges of our time.   Under President Xi Jinping, the CCP has made its intentions perfectly  clear:  [[Page H4016]]  supplant the post-World War II international order created by the U.S.  and forge a new world order led by China.   Clearly, the Biden administration is distracted from that. Time and  again, this administration has projected weakness on the world stage  and gotten bogged down by policies that only serve to divide our people  and other silliness.   We can't afford to drop the ball on this critical matter. We must get  tough on China and restore American greatness on the world stage by  projecting strength, not weakness.   The CCP is only becoming more and more aggressive. Here are a few  examples.   First is the issue of exit bans placed by the CCP on American  citizens, including some of my own constituents. This behavior by the  CCP needs to stop. We must find solutions for this dire issue facing  American citizens.   Second, I was pleased to support prohibiting the CCP from acquiring  American farmland, frequently near important military installations.   Third, we must deter any threat to Taiwan as well as Japan.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Johnson, and I  appreciate his leading this, once again, as we communicate with the  American folks about the good things we are getting done around here.  That is important. The communication and the openness of the House to  the people is a critical element and something we were missing for  about 2\1/2\ years around here. The COVID disaster that hit this  country was exacerbated by government action.   Indeed, overreaction has cost us so much economically and so much to  the goodwill and the mental state of many of our people. Look at the  damage that was done to our schoolchildren as they lost basically 2  years out of their lives. I think that will be damage that was done to  a generation, and I don't know how quickly they are going to recover.   Nevertheless, we here, the Republicans in the majority of the U.S.  House, have worked toward restoring peoples' faith in the government by  allowing them to participate and opening the House gallery once again.  I can have people from my district here tonight. That right would not  have been seen just not that many months ago.   Our committee process is open to the people instead of being done by  Zoom or some other effect. Indeed, that is very important because there  is nothing like being in the room with people to have our witnesses  there and have Members be able to look at each other and have a  dialogue across the way instead of on the internet with the  distractions there.   So we opened the House and are bringing it back to the people and  open to the people. Through tours people are able to see their Capitol  and just be amazed by what the Founders had in mind when we feel the  history here and what it is about.   We have worked on important policy this year, the Lower Energy Costs  Act. Now, I can't even describe how important energy is to our economy,  our way of life, and for our culture. All of our forms of energy have  made us competitive and strong around the world.   It has helped us win World War II, and it has helped us become the  most competitive and strongest economy ever until we see the damage  being done currently by the Biden administration stopping pipelines and  stopping traditional forms of energy driven by oil and gas.   Yes, there is always going to be a place for oil and gas.  [[Page H4019]]    When we look at energy projections around the world, it is only going  to go up in all the other countries except for the ones that are  hamstringing themselves with this Paris accord business.   So energy is the cornerstone of a strong economy, our way of life,  and our culture. Oil and gas are part of that. We need to continue  cultivating nuclear energy and the new technologies coming with that.  It doesn't have to be a scary thing: Oh, nuclear waste, oh, it is going  to have a meltdown. No. Nonsense. These are things that can continue to  be improved on if we have the will to do it.    Congress needs to move in helping to fund this type of research, and  also the permitting process needs to be streamlined so that these  projects can move forward.   As we know, windmills and the solar panels don't work all the time.  We have to wait for the wind to blow, the sun to come up, or the clouds  to go away in order to have those forms of energy.   As far as nuclear power and hydroelectric, right now they are trying  to tear down dams because of dubious environmental regulations in my  district.   Oil and natural gas are cornerstones that we can rely on 24/7 as  base-load power. So what we are seeing is forced conversion to electric  vehicles and electric stoves. They are taking away our gas stove. Look  how mad people are going to be at home when they have to cook in ways  that don't fit how they like or what they are used to or what is  efficient.   The latest crazy thing is banning gas generators. It seems the Biden  administration is just copying the craziest in my home State of  California.   Now, Mr. Speaker, what is a generator for?   It is for making electricity and generating electricity.   Mr. Speaker, how do you generate electricity?   Mr. Speaker, you don't use other electricity to generate electricity.  It has to come from a different source, whether it is going to be  hydropower--again, what I listed--or a personal generator. It is going  to be either gas, diesel, or hooked up to your propane tank.   It is absurd what is going on. We need to continue to have an energy  policy that helps Americans and helps us thrive. House Republicans are  going to keep fighting for that because it makes sense and makes us  stronger.   I appreciate the time to help remind people this is where things  really come from, where our economy comes from, our freedom, and our  basic lifestyle.
