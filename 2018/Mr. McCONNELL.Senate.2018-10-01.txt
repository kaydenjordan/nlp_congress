 Mr. President, the confirmation process for Judge  Brett Kavanaugh, one of the most qualified and most impressive Supreme  Court nominees in our Nation's history, is moving forward.   On Friday, the Judiciary Committee reported this nomination  favorably.  [[Page S6403]]  Then, here on the floor, we officially moved to take up the nomination.  Every Republican member of the committee agreed that Judge Kavanaugh  should be reported out with a favorable recommendation, and every  Democrat voted in opposition--in some cases, before he or anyone had  even been nominated.   That last part shouldn't really surprise anyone. Democrats have made  no real attempt to disguise that this was a pure partisan calculation  for them from the beginning.   Several of them had announced their opposition to Judge Kavanaugh's  nomination long before his original hearings even began, before they  had questioned him on his judicial record they deem so problematic and,  in some cases, more than 2 months before Dr. Ford's allegations of  misconduct were made public.   The Democrats didn't mince any words. The way one Democratic member  of the Judiciary Committee put it: Supporters of Judge Kavanaugh are-- listen to this--``complicit in the evil.'' That is a Democratic member  of the Judiciary Committee.   Another Democrat on the committee, before Judge Kavanaugh was even  named, described in almost apocalyptic terms the consequences of  whomever the President might nominate. Here was the quote: ``We are  looking at the destruction of the Constitution of the United States as  far as I can tell.''   And here was the Democratic leader, just hours after Judge Kavanaugh  was nominated: ``I will oppose him with everything I've got.'' Well,  they have certainly done just that. They have done just that.   The ranking Democrat on the committee first heard from Dr. Ford on  July 30. Did our colleague alert the chairman so the committee could do  due diligence in a confidential way, consistent with Dr. Ford's wishes?  No, she did not. Did she discretely raise the issue with Judge  Kavanaugh during her private meeting with him on August 20? She didn't  do that, either. As best we can tell, the Democrats chose to keep this  allegation secret, rather than investigating in a bipartisan and timely  way; in fact, they held it in reserve. Meanwhile, the senior Senator  from California, or her office, were already in communication with Dr.  Ford. In fact, her office had already recommended--recommended--that  Dr. Ford retain a particular Washington, DC, law firm.   The firm in question is not exactly foreign to Democratic politics.  Two of its founding partners, including one of the attorneys who  personally appeared at the hearing to represent Dr. Ford, had until  recently been scheduled to hold a fundraiser for one of our Senate  Democratic colleagues tonight. Oh, and by the way, the firm had also  represented in another matter the person who has made the most  salacious and disgusting accusations against Judge Kavanaugh as a high  school student. This is the firm the Judiciary Committee Democrats  recommended to Dr. Ford.   Not long thereafter, of course, Dr. Ford's letter to the senior  Senator from California wound up in the hands of the press. The same  letter in which she asked for confidentiality was leaked. By whom? As  best I can tell, nobody had possession of this letter, except for Dr.  Ford's Democratic Congresswoman, the Democratic side of the Judiciary  Committee, and presumably the politically connected lawyers they  recommended to Dr. Ford. And somehow--somehow--it ended up in the  press. Dr. Ford's plea for privacy was brushed aside. A predictable  media circus was launched.   Of course, the questionable and concerning handling of this matter  didn't stop there. In her testimony, Dr. Ford seemed surprised that  Chairman Grassley had offered her legal team a number of more discrete  and less burdensome ways to share her story if she preferred. The  chairman had offered to fly investigators out to California, or  anywhere else, for a private interview at a time and a place of Dr.  Ford's choosing. But, apparently, neither our Democratic colleagues nor  the lawyers they recommended felt it was necessary to make these  options clear to Dr. Ford.   She told the committee: ``I wasn't clear on what the offer was. . . .  [I would have] been happy to speak with you out there''--referring to  California. ``It wasn't clear to me that was the case.''   So let's take stock of all of this. The ranking member withheld  serious allegations from committee colleagues, precluding any chance  that they would be handled with sensitivity and discretion. Meanwhile,  her staff made recommendations that the accuser retain specific,  politically connected counsel. Then, her confidential account reached  the media faster than it reached either the chairman of the committee  or the FBI, which our colleagues have been insisting must now look into  it. Finally, we had reason to believe that Dr. Ford was not even  apprised of the chairman's offers to collect her testimony in ways that  might have been less likely to create a media circus and less  burdensome on her. It is almost as if Dr. Ford didn't want a  Washington, DC-based media circus, but others with whom she was in  contact and on whom she was relying wanted exactly that.   So we have learned that if you confide in Senate Democrats on highly  sensitive personal matters, no request for confidentiality will keep  you from becoming a household name. And even if you are a nominee whose  judicial philosophy Senate Democrats deem to be objectionable, no  centuries-old standard of presumed innocence will protect your name,  your family, or your reputation from irreparable damage.   Now, fortunately, Chairman Grassley has taken action to clean up this  mess.   Last Thursday, he supervised a professional and respectful hearing.  He retained an experienced sex crimes prosecutor to methodically  collect the details of Dr. Ford's recollections. This is a professional  who is recognized as ``Outstanding Arizona Sexual Assault Prosecutor of  the Year'' by former Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano--a former  Cabinet Secretary of President Obama's and herself a member of Anita  Hill's legal team back in 1991.   Here is what she wrote in her memo to Members following the hearing:         A he said, she said case is incredibly difficult to prove.       But this case is even weaker than that.        Dr. Ford identified other witnesses to the event, and those       witnesses either refuted her allegation or failed to       corroborate them. I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor       would bring this case based on the evidence before the       Committee. Nor do I think that this evidence is sufficient       to satisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.    That is a lower standard.   Will our Democratic colleagues listen to this expert opinion,  although it conflicts with their political mission? Don't hold your  breath. Nor am I optimistic that they will stay consistent and accept  the conclusions of the supplemental background investigation the FBI is  now conducting on top of its six prior investigations of Judge  Kavanaugh.   Democrats demanded a supplemental investigation. They proclaimed it  would be a game-changer. The Democratic leader and the ranking Democrat  on the committee both said recently that an FBI investigation can be  completed in less than a week, but I would bet almost anything that  after it runs its course in the next few days, we will then be treated  to a lecture--a lecture--that anything short of a totally unbounded  fishing expedition of indefinite duration is too limited or too  arbitrary or somehow insufficient. We all know that is coming.   If you listen carefully, you can practically hear the sounds of the  Democrats moving the goalposts. Remember, back in the summer, Democrats  said there weren't enough documents to get a good sense of Judge  Kavanaugh's career. Then we heard there were too many documents. Then  once Dr. Ford's private allegation was mysteriously made public, we  couldn't possibly move forward until we heard from them both. Then,  after neither the hearing nor the statements of supposed witnesses  yielded any corroborating evidence and, in fact, produced evidence that  supported Judge Kavanaugh, we were told that only an FBI investigation  would resolve this and that it could be done promptly. So let me go out  on a limb. Let me make a small prediction. Soon enough, the goalposts  will be on the move once again.   I would respectfully say to my colleagues: Do these actions suggest  this has ever been about finding the truth? Does anybody believe that?  Do these actions suggest this has ever been  [[Page S6404]]  about giving Judge Kavanaugh a fair hearing?   This institution has seen before episodes somewhat like what we are  now seeing from some of our colleagues across the aisle. Back during  the McCarthy era--in fact, in 1950--character assassination and  uncorroborated allegations were being utilized in a very different  debate. That is when a distinguished Senator from Maine named Margaret  Chase Smith--an icon from the great State of our colleague Senator  Collins--went to the Senate floor to say enough was enough. She gave a  speech that guaranteed she would be in the history of the Senate. She  titled it ``Declaration of Conscience.'' Here is what she said:         I do not like the way in which the Senate has been made a       rendezvous for vilification, for selfish political gain at       the sacrifice of individual reputations and national unity.    Margaret Chase Smith went on:         Whether it be a criminal prosecution in court or a       character prosecution in the Senate, there is little       practical distinction when the life of a person has been       ruined.    We should listen to these words. They speak as loudly today as they  did 68 years ago.   In my judgment, the pattern of behavior we have seen confirms what  Democrats' own public statements have told us: They are committed to  delaying, obstructing, and resisting this nomination with everything  they have. They just want to delay this matter past the election. That  is not my supposition; that is their plan. According to another  Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, the junior Senator from  Hawaii, that is their plan.   Soon I expect we will hear that the conclusions of the expert  prosecutor who questioned both witnesses at last week's hearing aren't  reliable or that the FBI's investigation was not infinite or endless  enough for their liking. Maybe we will hear that the real issue is not  these uncorroborated allegations of misconduct after all but, rather,  the fact that Judge Kavanaugh--now, listen to this--drank beer in high  school and in college or the fact that he was, rightfully, angry--who  wouldn't be?--that his good name and his family have been dragged  through the mud with a campaign of character assassination based on  allegations that lack any corroboration. Who wouldn't be angry about  that?   Their goalposts keep shifting, but their goal hasn't moved an inch-- not an inch. The goal has been the same all along. So let me make it  very clear. The time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a  close. Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is out of committee. We are  considering it here on the floor, and we will be voting this week.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  engage in its routine legislative wrapup as in morning business during  today's session of the Senate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Commerce be discharged from further consideration of H.R.  4921 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 664, submitted  earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  [[Page S6416]]  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  October 2; that following the prayer and pledge, the Executive Journal  of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate recess tomorrow  from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly conference  meetings; further, that notwithstanding rule XXII, all time during  leader time and recess count postcloture on the House message to  accompany H.R. 302.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand in recess under the previous  order.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 6:39 p.m. recessed until Tuesday, October  2, 2018, at 10 a.m.
