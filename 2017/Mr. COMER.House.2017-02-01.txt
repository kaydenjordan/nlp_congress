 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of repealing the  stream protection rule.   I represent a coal-producing district whose economy has been  devastated by the former President's and his renegade of unelected  bureaucrats' war on coal.   Last year, a Presidential candidate boasted among a liberal political  crowd that she would put a bunch of coal miners out of work. She went  on to say that the government would then essentially come in and put  those hardworking, out-of-work coal miners on welfare.   Well, Mr. Speaker, my coal miners don't want to be on government  welfare. They want the government to get out of their way and let them  work.   Because of senseless, onerous regulations like the stream protection  rule, the liberals in Washington have succeeded in putting most coal  miners out of work. I believe that with the passage of H.J. Res. 38 and  a sensible energy policy created and implemented by businesspeople  instead of bureaucrats, we can begin to bring coal jobs back to  Kentucky and help provide the struggling economies in Kentucky's coal  counties.
