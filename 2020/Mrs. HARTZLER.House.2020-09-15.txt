 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Arrington for  yielding and for hosting this event and focusing on our need to protect  America's communities. With what is happening right now this topic is  foremost in everyone's minds, and the need could not be greater.  [[Page H4423]]    Daily we are shown footage of yet another riot in one of America's  great cities. Mobs are destroying property, defacing buildings,  breaking out windows of family-owned businesses, and looting the  merchandise. Cars are being set on fire, and people are getting hurt.   We need safe and secure neighborhoods again. We need law and order to  be restored. We need peace to prevail in our hearts, in our families,  and in our communities.   That is where our peace officers come in. They are the ones who keep  the peace. They are the ones who allow our families to live in safety,  security, peace and quiet. We need that now. We need them now.   They sometimes are called law enforcement officers. That is accurate,  but I like another term, peace officers. Because that is what they are.   Every year during Police Week, May 15 is designated as Peace Officers  Memorial Day to pay tribute to the local, State, and Federal peace  officers who have died or who have been disabled in the line of duty.   Sadly, I have had a police officer from my district, whose name was  added to this memorial. And sadly, many more names are going to be  added to the memorial next year, including a selfless peace officer  from Missouri named David Dorn.   David had served his fellow man preserving the peace for over 38  years. He was a loyal friend, a devoted husband, and a beloved member  of the St. Louis community. And on the night of June 2nd he volunteered  to help a friend in need who owned a small business, which was in  danger of being destroyed by looters and rioters. He didn't want his  friend's life's work to be turned into rubble, so he went down to help  by sitting in front of the business and, hopefully, discouraging any  harm from being done to his friend's business.   Tragically, David was fatally shot by violent protestors, and left to  die on the sidewalk. His execution was broadcast live on Facebook while  his son watched at home. No arrests were made. His killer got away in  the thicket of violence and riots.   Nothing about this protest was peaceful. There are peaceful protests,  and I commend them. There is a national conversation that is worth  having to ensure everyone feels safe in our communities, but what we  are seeing night after night in many of our cities is not a peaceful  protest. It is thugs hijacking a legitimate cause to advance their  agenda of personal gain, anarchy, and destruction. And it must end.   We must work to bring peace back into our communities by restoring  law and order, by valuing our selfless peace officers, and by  establishing clear punitive consequences for those who incite violence.                                time  1845    We must deter and stop those who incite riots in any capacity, from  organizing and promoting a riot to participating or assisting those who  do. Those who loot and destroy must be held to account.   That is why I am proud to support H.R. 8031, the David Dorn Act of  2020. This bill increases the maximum imprisonment penalty for rioting  to 10 years and sets the minimum fine to $1,000.   It sends a clear message to rioters that their reckless actions are  reprehensible and that we are committed to making sure not a single  peace officer faces the same fate as David Dorn.   The answer to this mayhem is not to defund our peace officers; it is  to defend them and to give them the tools that they need to keep the  peace.   In the Commitment to America House Republicans announced today, we  propose to increase funding by $1.75 billion for better police  training, community policing, and more equipment, including 500,000  more body cameras.   This is the right way to secure the peace, not by destroying our  neighborhoods.   Mr. Speaker, I call on all Americans to work together to be  peacemakers and restore peace and quiet and security to our  neighborhoods and to embrace and defend the values that made America  great.   Now is our time of decision; now is when we will choose which road we  will go on; and now is the time to stand up and to defend what we know  is best and true and right and will truly bring security and peace to  our neighborhoods.
