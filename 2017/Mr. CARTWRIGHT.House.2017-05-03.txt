 Mr. Speaker, I rise because evidently, in the House  of Representatives, we will be taking up the possible passage of a  revised but, as yet, unseen American Health Care Act.   I rise to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote  against this. The CBO has not scored it, so we don't know how much it  will cost. We don't know how many Americans will be thrown off their  health care.   I want to quote Dr. Andrew Gurman, who is the president of the  American Medical Association, who said this today:   ``Not only would the AHCA eliminate health insurance coverage for  millions of Americans, the legislation would, in many cases, eliminate  the ban against charging those with underlying medical conditions  vastly more for their coverage.''   This is a bad bill that has gotten worse with time. We haven't seen  it. It hasn't been scored for money or how many patients will be thrown  off their health care. It will hurt patients, it will hurt medical  providers, it will hurt hospitals, and it will hurt this country.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.                            ____________________
