 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak  about the unsung heroes in many rural communities throughout America:  our volunteer firefighters.   These dedicated volunteers answer the call 24 hours a day, 7 days a  week. They spend time away from their families and homes. The training  that is required can be costly and very time consuming.   Our volunteer firefighters make these sacrifices because they care  deeply about their friends and neighbors. They care about their  communities.   But rural America is facing a real problem with dwindling numbers of  those who are willing to volunteer. A National Fire Protection  Association report published last year shows the number of volunteer  firefighters per 1,000 people has been decreasing since 1986.   Gone are the days when those seeking to volunteer had to add their  names to a waiting list to join their local fire department. Sometimes  volunteers could wait for years to be added to the roster, but that is  not how it is anymore as fewer individuals are interested in signing  up.   This is not unique to Pennsylvania, but it is happening in  communities across the country. Small communities reap the benefits of  having volunteer forces. According to a 2016 National Fire Prevention  Association study, the time donated by volunteer firefighters saves  localities across the country an estimated $139.8 billion a year.   The savings are clear, and the service could not be more important.  That is why last year I hosted two fire summits in my district to speak  directly with local firefighters and try to identify not only the  challenges that they face, but also some solutions to those problems.   Funding is always a problem that plagues volunteer departments and  can truly decline quickly when we think of what it costs to purchase  new equipment and be compliant with the latest regulations. Small  communities are often already stressed economically and do not have a  tax base that can assume another increase; but equipment replacement is  paramount, and it can sometimes mean the life or death of a  firefighter.   Volunteer fire departments also face training challenges.  Firefighters in rural communities regularly need to travel long  distances for instructional courses, and paying for the necessary  training can be difficult. Training sessions might not focus enough on  firefighting in rural communities, which is different from that in  urban communities in a number of ways.   Personnel challenges remain a constant issue with declining  populations, aging firefighters who are not being replaced with those  of a younger generation, and a lack of tangible retention incentives.                                time  1015    Yet, with all of these challenges, fire departments are faced with  higher call volumes than ever before, according to a study from the  National Volunteer Fire Council. Most fire departments across the  country have experienced a steady increase in calls over the past two  decades. This is a major source of the increased time demands on  volunteer firefighters.   The number of calls, coupled with the decline in the number of  volunteer firefighters, means that fire departments are continuously  spread too thin. Most of the increase is attributed to a sharp rise in  the number of emergency medical calls, false alarms, and the use of  mutual aid as the number of firefighters has decreased.   Mr. Speaker, the dangerous work that these men and women do in order  to protect the homes and livelihoods of Americans is not something that  should be taken for granted. These first responders put their lives on  the line and make great sacrifices in order to protect their neighbors  and communities from harm. As a volunteer firefighter and EMT rescue  technician myself and as a member of the Congressional Fire Caucus, I  am grateful for the services that our first responders--brothers and  sisters who serve the communities--provide and the constant state of  readiness that they operate under.   While we must not forget those who have made the ultimate sacrifice  through their service, we must also ensure that their colleagues and  all of  [[Page H751]]  our Nation's first responders are respected and have the resources they  need to safely perform their jobs.   That is why I am working with the volunteer fire departments in  Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District to develop solutions-- ideas--to not only recruit more firefighters but to retain them. It is  my hope that, by increasing awareness and examining incentives, we  might be able to strengthen and grow the rosters of our volunteer fire  departments. We know that this service is critical, and we must respect  those who are willing to show up, day or night, to protect their  neighbors.   Thank you to all of our volunteers who answer when the alarm sounds.  We value you; we respect you; and I hope we can find more of you to  serve.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on Thursday, Members of  Congress and leaders from across the globe will gather in Washington,  D.C., to mark one of our finest traditions: the National Prayer  Breakfast.   This event is hosted annually on the first Thursday in February. More  than 3,000 people typically gather for this international forum that  allows individuals from various sectors--including political, business,  and social--to build relationships and come together in faith,  fellowship, and prayer.   Personally, I look forward to the National Prayer Breakfast each year  as a time when thousands around the world and right here at home can  reflect on their faith, focus on the year ahead, and walk away from  this remarkable  [[Page H760]]  event with a renewed sense of hope and faith.   This nonpartisan event brings together so many unique individuals who  will hear the stories of inspiration from faith-filled speakers.   From the Book of First Chronicles, Scripture tells us to, ``Look to  the Lord and His strength; seek His face always.'' This is what we will  be seeking at the National Prayer Breakfast.   It is my hope that I will see many of my colleagues there this  Thursday.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Washington State, whom I have been proud to serve with. I had an  opportunity to visit his district, and I know natural resources are  extremely important to him. I appreciate his yielding on what is  germane to this discussion, which is basically trying to claw back  regulations that had no basis in science that essentially were causing  harm and taking away good-paying jobs for Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the underlying  legislation, which disapproves of a midnight regulation that the Obama  administration made with just 1 month left in his Presidency.   The stream protection rule negatively targets coal country and will  devastate communities that have already been hit hard by job losses and  reduced mining activity making sure that America has affordable and  reliable energy and electricity.   Pennsylvania is the fifth largest coal producing State and generates  roughly 25 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants.  Coal-fired electricity provides roughly 30,000 jobs in my State,  equaling nearly $8 billion in economic impact.   Although coal continues to be an essential component of our energy  mix, this rule duplicates many existing laws while providing very  little environmental gain. What the rule does is expands the Office of  Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement's regulatory authority. In  effect, this Federal agency would overtake the regulatory authorities  of individual States.                                time  1300    This makes no sense. States should be able to continue their own  regulation of coal production. This is the epitome of a midnight rule  that has more to do with empowering the Federal Government at the  expense of coal miners' jobs than it has to do with protecting streams.   The Office of Surface Mining's own reports show that virtually all  coal mines have no offsite impacts. The reports year over year show  that coal mines are being safely operated and the lands are being  successfully restored thanks to the watchful eyes of the States that  regulate 97 percent of the mines in the United States.   This rule does nothing to protect our streams that State and Federal  regulators are not already doing. We do not need a one-size-fits-all  approach from Washington, which rarely works.   In order to bring real-world thinking back into the regulatory  process, we must act quickly to stop this rule. I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting the joint resolution of disapproval under the  Congressional Review Act.
