 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, I had  the opportunity to visit a true gem in Centre County, Pennsylvania:  Rhoneymeade.   Rhoneymeade is a sculpture garden and arboretum farm, a historical  site located between the Nittany and Tussey Mountains. The Rhone family  owned this property for four generations, from 1794 to 1937. The land  was settled in 1794 when Michael Rhone purchased the farmland from the  Straub family, who received a grant of the land from the Penn family.   Third-generation Leonard Rhone was an important leader in the Grange  movement in Pennsylvania. Many of the ideas for the movement were  developed in the historic 1853 farmhouse that still sits on the  property today.   Leonard Rhone founded the Grange Fair in 1874, the annual fair and  camping event that remains a staple in the region. The fair is a proud  Centre County tradition, much like Rhoneymeade. Rhoneymeade's slogan  is: ``Where art and nature meet.''   That rings true, thanks to the works of Dr. Richard Morgan, a retired  Penn State professor who purchased the property in 1984. Over several  years, he transformed the grounds into an arboretum and sculpture  garden. Dr. Morgan fell in love with Rhoneymeade: its historic home,  views of Penns Valley, some of the oldest trees in central  Pennsylvania. He restored the house on the property and landscaped the  six surrounding acres. In 1985, the house was placed on the National  Register of Historic Places.   In 1989, Dr. Morgan established Rhoneymeade as a private foundation  with a mission to ``preserve our farm, fields, and forest; to create an  oasis of beauty, both natural and man-made; and to share this with all  who wish to come.''   Rhoneymeade has shared with the community and was shared with the  community. In 1992, Dr. Morgan opened the property to visitors on  select weekends. Since Dr. Morgan's death in 2015, Rhoneymeade is  working towards becoming a public nonprofit organization.   Mr. Speaker, the property has thoroughly been cared for for more than  200 years, the 150 acres of breathtaking  [[Page H9526]]  land and its history that has been kept alive by the families who have  owned it and, now, by all those who visit it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Grand Canyon FFA for bringing home the gold at a  recent national competition.   The Wellsboro High School team of 10th graders recently traveled to  the National FFA Convention in Indianapolis. The team competed in the  Conduct of Meeting event that is focused on parliamentary procedure.   As part of the competition, the team performs a meeting demonstration  that includes an opening ceremony and a surprise issue to debate. They  make motions and resolve the issue within 13 minutes. Each team member  has to answer oral questions and take a knowledge exam.   Mr. Speaker, I am incredibly proud of the Grand Canyon FFA team for  advancing to the Gold Level Round and placing sixth overall in the  Nation.   It is clear that the FFA is making a positive difference in the lives  of students by developing their leadership skills, personal growth, and  career success through agricultural education.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the members of the Grand Canyon FFA team  on a job well done: Kylie Butler, Nina Coolidge, Rayann Pierce, Austin  Richards, McKenzie Sweigart, Katarina Swendrowski, and Taylor  Wetherbee.                            ____________________
