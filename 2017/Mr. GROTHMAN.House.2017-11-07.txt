 Mr. Speaker, before launching into specific comments on  this bill, I would like to correct some misconceptions that we heard  earlier today.   We just heard a lady from Illinois mention that she felt this bill  would put employers who respect workers at a competitive disadvantage.  All good employers know that respecting workers puts you at a  competitive advantage, and I think it is very wrong that anybody would  imply that you are advantaged by not respecting your workers. So I want  to clarify that.   The second thing I want to clarify is, earlier we had somebody talk  about temporary workers. Now, temporary workers make less money. It is  true with temporary workers, you have a middleman who takes the money  off the top, and that is unfortunate. But you have to realize that the  reason we have more temporary workers is we make it harder and harder  to be an employer in the first place. Whenever you make it harder and  harder to be an employer, you force more employers to hire temporary  employees so they don't have to be employers in the first place.    Mr. Speaker, now, on with this bill. One of the  tragedies we have had in America is the disappearance of small  businesses in America. We had more and more big businesses, you know,  big conglomerates. One of the ways you can still be a small business is  being a franchisee in which you control your own destiny and are able  to respect your workers in your own way.   We have to pass this bill to prevent the end--or the practical end of  the ability to be your own businessowner by controlling or setting your  own contract terms with your own employees. And more than any other  reason, that is why I back this bill. I like that we have so many  small-business men out there on their own on the franchisor-franchisee  model.
