 Mr. Speaker, the internet without net neutrality isn't  really the internet. Net neutrality is the way the internet should  always work.   Net neutrality is essential to everything we need in our society and  in our democracy, from educational and economic opportunities to  political organizing and dissent. Keeping the internet free and open  for all Americans is essential to the success of our Nation.   Earlier this year, we passed the Save the Internet Act, which I voted  for. I strongly believe in working in a bipartisan way to achieve and  secure net neutrality to ensure Americans can thrive in the 21st  century's information economy.   We must continue to work together to ensure that every American has  unencumbered access to the internet in a free way, in an open way, in  an honest way, and in an American way.                            ____________________
