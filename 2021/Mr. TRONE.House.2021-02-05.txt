 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support for my  amendment, which addresses the barriers to finding a job that justice- impacted individuals face when they leave prison.   Stable employment is one of the single biggest factors for  determining whether Americans who have been incarcerated will return to  prison or jail. Returning citizens face significant barriers to  employment, with an unemployment rate five times higher than the  national average.   My amendment will help support the establishment and expansion of the  apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship workforce training programs in  all Federal correctional facilities. It will reduce recidivism and help  formerly incarcerated individuals lead productive lives and build  strong communities.   The criminal justice system in the United States is anything but  just. We can fix it. It is time to lead with compassion. It is time to  focus on rehabilitation, not retribution. It is time to give those who  serve their time, and are trying to start a new life, a second chance.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a communication from the  Signatory Wall and Ceiling Contractors Alliance, and I urge bipartisan  support.                                                         SWACCA,                                                   January 29, 2021.      Hon. Robert C. Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: I write to you today on behalf of the       Signatory Wall and Ceiling Contractors Alliance (SWACCA) to       advise you of our strong support for H.R. 447, the ``National       Apprenticeship Act of 2021.''        SWACCA is a national association representing construction       company owners employing tens of thousands of laborers,       drywall finishers, plasterers, and carpenters who perform       billions of dollars of framing, drywall, ceiling, and other       interior systems work annually throughout the United States.       SWACCA prides itself on serving as a voice for responsible       employers. Our member companies pay their workers for every       hour worked, as well as overtime when their work exceeds       forty hours in a week. They also provide middle-class wages,       sponsor training programs, and offer retirement and health       benefits.        As signatory employers, we have a long history of working       with our union partners to create and sustain rigorous, high-      quality registered apprenticeship programs. Our members       understand that registered apprenticeship programs are one of       the key factors in ensuring they can continue to provide the       high quality, efficient construction services that enable       them to be profitable while providing jobs with family-      sustaining wages and benefits. As such, we appreciate you and       your Committee's efforts to maintain and strengthen the       nation's registered apprenticeship system.        Your legislation would inject much needed funding with the       aim of expanding access to registered apprenticeships, pre-      apprenticeships, and youth apprenticeships across the       country. This new funding will serve as a critical supplement       to the investment our members make to support these important       programs. H.R. 447 would also codify and streamline existing       standards for registered apprenticeship programs and expand       those standards to cover preapprenticeship and youth       apprenticeship programs. Importantly, H.R. 447 also includes       provisions to codify the role of the Office of Apprenticeship       at the Department of Labor. It also strengthens the standing       of the National Advisory Committee on Apprenticeships within       the Department of Labor so that it can provide seasoned,       expert recommendations to the Secretary of Labor on how to       improve the nation's apprenticeship programs.        Thank you again for your efforts to expand and strengthen       the nation's registered apprenticeship programs. We look       forward to working with you to swiftly enact this critically       important legislation into law. If I can be of assistance in       the future, please do not hesitate to reach out.            Sincerely,                                                    Scott Casabona,                                                         President.
