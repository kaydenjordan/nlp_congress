 Madam President, I rise today to honor Mark  Ghilarducci, director of the California Office of Emergency Services-- CalOES--as he retires following years of committed and extraordinarily  capable public service.   Director Ghilarducci's laudable career spans 30 years of service in  public safety and government management at the local, State, and  Federal levels, as well as more than 12 years in the private sector,  working in security and crisis management globally. I, myself, have had  the pleasure of working with Mr. Ghilarducci and have witnessed  firsthand his dedication to the safety of all Californians.   Early in his career, Director Ghilarducci served as the deputy State  fire chief at CalOES. In this role, he oversaw special operations such  as the State Urban Search and Rescue Response System. Director  Ghilarducci helped develop this search and rescue system in the wake of  the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, and this system has since served as  the model for the Nation. In fact, Ghilarducci relied on this system as  he led the Federal search and rescue operations in the wake of the 1995  terrorist bombings in Oklahoma City, demonstrating the system's  effectiveness, as well as his own courage in the face of disaster.  Twenty years later, he served as an adviser to the State of Louisiana  and Governor Kathleen Blanco in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and  provided on the ground assistance.   In 2000, he was appointed deputy director of CalOES, where he oversaw  statewide emergency operations, planning, and training. Drawing from  his experience in State and national emergency response, Director  Ghilarducci utilized his position to advocate for preventative disaster  management and clearer communication between local, State, and Federal  agencies with disaster-relief organizations. During his  [[Page S6940]]  tenure, CalOES expanded its mission to encompass more than natural  disasters, adding programs that focused on terrorism prevention and  cybersecurity attacks and developed faster and broader disaster  response to public health emergencies like COVID-19.   In February 2012, Governor Jerry Brown appointed Ghilarducci to  secretary of the California Emergency Management Agency, a great fit  for someone so well-qualified. The following year, the Governor  appointed him to director of CalOES and he has held this position ever  since. While in this role, Ghilarducci briefed President Obama in 2014  on California's historic drought, as well as President Trump and  President Biden during their respective visits to California after  natural disaster events, including the Camp and Caldor fires. Under his  direction, CalOES improved and modernized the State's emergency  management. Earlier this year, CalOES announced a first in the Nation  grant program focused on building community resilience to prevent long- term disaster impacts.   As one of California's Senators, I extend my deepest gratitude to  Director Ghilarducci for his tireless commitment to the safety of  Californians and Americans nationwide. Please join me in wishing him a  safe, prosperous, and well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
