 Mr. Speaker, I will now address the Cuban crisis just  south of our border.   Cuba is, of course, a very progressive Marxist state. The government  runs the economy with all the restrictions of freedom; that means there  is no freedom of press.   The State Department International Religious Freedom Report shows  numerous violations of freedom of religion as believers in God are  harassed. There is no freedom of movement. And now with protests,  people are disappearing.   How does the United States respond? There was a Free Cuba mural put  up in Washington, D.C., and the mayor of our Nation's capital responded  by saying that it was said in the past that Cuba has an education  system we should learn from, and the mural disappeared.   I beg President Biden to do what he can to restore internet service  so the people in Cuba can communicate with each other. Please don't  lift the embargo. And above all, provide a little bit of moral  leadership and show that you are opposed to the Marxist cabal to the  rest of the world.                            ____________________
