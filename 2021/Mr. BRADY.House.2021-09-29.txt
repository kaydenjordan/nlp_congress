 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today's debt ceiling issue is a political and economic  crisis of the Democrats' own making. They have known for 2 years this  day was coming. They never even bothered to draft a budget for the  government, much less pass it, and never lifted a finger to start the  bipartisan discussions on how to raise the debt ceiling while  addressing America's exploding national debt.   They have insisted on one-party rule all year, from an unnecessary,  wasteful $2 trillion COVID stimulus that didn't stimulate the economy  or defeat the virus to a national takeover of State and local  elections, bailouts of failing State and local governments, ignoring  the humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border, and the  disastrous surrender to the Taliban in Afghanistan.   House Democrats have made it clear: We are running the place. Just  sit down and shut up.   The bottom line on the debt ceiling today: Democrats alone have set  fire to America's house and are now demanding Republicans put it out  for them.   I urged Treasury Secretary Yellen, who I respect and who has  bipartisan credibility, to do what the congressional Democrats have  not: engage with Republicans on a reasonable framework of financial  stability for our Nation.   There is precedent. Secretary Mnuchin certainly set that, reaching  out repeatedly to Democrat leadership on these issues.   Although it should be noted, given the strident blame game now by  Speaker Pelosi on the debt ceiling, I remember February 2018 when she,  Leader Hoyer, Whip Clyburn, and 116 other House Democrats voted to  default on America's debt, shut down the government, and refuse  disaster relief to devastated communities across America.   One of the Democrat leaders even said: ``Republicans control the  House, the Senate, and the White House. The responsibility to govern  rests squarely on their shoulders.''   Well, right now, the Democrats control the House, the Senate, and the  White House. The responsibility to govern rests squarely on their  shoulders.   I agree that Congress should not play political games with the debt  ceiling or  [[Page H5527]]  ignore the danger of making permanent the temporary COVID relief with  spending that will bankrupt our Nation in the future.   Democrats control everything--the House, the Senate, and the  Presidency--and they can easily pass the debt ceiling by including it  in their $3\1/2\ trillion tax hikes and welfare state expansion, which  requires no Republican votes.   But rather than work together, what did Democrats do? As I noted,  they rammed through a partisan, nearly $2 trillion so-called stimulus  bill. This was unaccountable, partisan Washington spending that only  made matters worse, especially rising inflation for working families.   For example, in that bill, Democrats undid a bipartisan agreement to  protect taxpayers against the greatest theft of American tax dollars in  our lifetime, which by now has lost up to $400 billion to fraud.   They even opened the door to greater fraud by replacing the  Republican child tax credit that rewarded work with the cash-for-kids  welfare check program with few safeguards.    Stopping fraud and taking care of tax dollars should be a bipartisan  goal that would stretch the spending in the Federal Government.  Instead, Democrats are demanding this tax and spending binge that will  kill 3 million U.S. jobs, drive prices even higher, and impose the  largest expansion to the welfare state in our lifetime.   I urge my Democrat colleagues: End the brinkmanship. We can achieve a  bipartisan framework. Just look at the Republicans' repeated efforts.   In 2016, the House passed a Ways and Means bill called the Debt  Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act, creating a system that would  have allowed Congress to make informed decisions about the debt ceiling  and consider changes before it became a crisis. Yet, the Obama  administration opposed the bill.   Today, Democrats are hardly worried about new burdens as they put the  IRS in charge of workers' paid family and medical leave, or hire 80,000  new IRS agents, or impose IRS bank surveillance on the personal and  business accounts of Main Street and working families.   And Democrats won't take up a similar bill, the Debt Solution and  Accountability Act, offered by Ways and Means Republican Representative  Lloyd Smucker from Pennsylvania.   Democrats' alternatives these days to a bipartisan framework range  from ridiculous to irresponsible.   One Democrat Congressman has proposed U.S. Treasury mint a trillion- dollar coin--a trillion-dollar coin. Why not a quadrillion-dollar coin?   This farfetched idea sounds about as brilliant as many Democrats' own  calls to end the debt limit entirely, as the Speaker has sought.   I think Democrats' best answer to Washington's out-of-control  spending is to spend more and to tear out the brakes.   Let's be honest. This is an economic and political crisis of the  Democrats' own making. There isn't enough money in America to cover  what Democrats want to spend, and Americans know it.   That is why President Biden has gone out of his way to sell his $3.5  trillion bill as not adding to the debt, saying the ``Build Back Better  agenda costs zero dollars,'' a claim that ranks right up with: ``If you  like your healthcare plan, you can keep it.''   Unfortunately for him and for the taxpayers that will have to foot  the bill, The Washington Post fact-checker found this claim misleading.                                time  1430    They said that it ``would take dubious gimmicks that will help  disguise the true cost of President Biden's agenda.''   Again, considering Democrats have not had a single conversation about  spending, stimulus, or the debt with us to date, I think they, by their  behavior, have taken responsibility to pass this by themselves.   It is irresponsible to keep raising the debt limit, keep on spending  without any framework, or any discussion about this explosion of  America's debt.   We need to grow the economy, constrain our spending, work together,  both parties together, to get our financial house back in order for our  children and grandchildren.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record this fact-check  from The Washington Post about this claim we just heard, that 83  percent of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went to the top 1 percent. They  gave that false statement ``3 Pinocchios,'' calling it a ``zombie  claim'' and ``galling.'' PolitiFact agreed, calling it ``misleading.''                         [From the Washington Post]        The Pinocchio Six: Myths, Lies & Debunked Claims About Taxes         1. False: Biden: ``All of [GOP Tax Cuts] went to folks at       the top and corporations that pay no taxes.''        The Washington Post fact check gave this ``4 Pinocchios,''       saying this is ``simply wrong'' and ``clearly false.''        Three of every four dollars in the 2017 tax cuts went to       individuals, cutting taxes for the lowest-income Americans by       10% while cutting taxes for the top 1% by less than one-half       of 1%.        In the 2017 GOP tax reform, corporations effectively paid       for 85% of their tax cuts thanks to eliminating special tax       provisions and broadening the U.S. tax base.        2. Myth: ``The wealthy don't pay their `fair share.' ''        America has long had one of the most progressive tax codes       among developed nations, with higher-income people paying       higher tax rates, say the Organization for Economic       Cooperation & Development (OECD).        The top 1% pay 40% of all income taxes, and the top 10%       pays 70% of all income taxes, according to the Tax       Foundation.        After the GOP Tax Cuts, the rich pay a larger, not smaller,       share of income taxes.        3. False: ``83% of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax cuts       went to top 1%.''        The Washington Post gave this false statement ``3       Pinocchios,'' calling it a ``zombie claim'' and ``galling.''       Politifact agreed, calling it ``misleading.''        4. False: ``Corporate tax receipts declined by 40% after       GOP Tax Cuts.''        Like government revenue that reached record levels in the       two years after GOP tax reform, corporate tax receipts are       higher and growing after TCJA, despite Democrats' claims.        Corporate tax revenues this year are $285 billion, 22%       higher than the Obama-Biden Admin's last year.        The Congressional Budget Office projects corporate tax       revenues under TCJA will increase to $379 billion in 2023--a       record high.        Biden's own budget scorers project U.S. corporate tax       revenues under TCJA will reach 1.63% of GDP by 2025, higher       than the 1.55% average in the decade before the GOP tax cuts.        5 Myth: ``55 profitable U.S. corporations paid no taxes       last year.''        This is an unverifiable claim by a far-left group (ITEP)       using flawed methodology. It is not based on actual tax       data--taxpayer data is private and most 2020 tax corporate       returns have yet to be filed.        This group confuses the difference between taxable income       and financial statement reports.        Similar reports that U.S. multinational corporations only       pay very low tax rates on their earnings overseas are flawed       either by double-counting, faulty methodology, or cherry-      picked data.        6. Myth: ``The Death Tax only impacts two of every 1,000       taxpayers who die.''        Relatively few estates pay the Death Tax, but many more       file estate tax returns, and millions of farms and other       family businesses are forced to waste precious time and money       to avoid a mistake that will result in a confiscatory tax       bill from the IRS.        The Death Tax crushes investment in workers & expanded       operations, harms growth & opportunity.        The Death Tax ranks as a devastatingly inefficient tax       since it raises a very small amount of revenue while placing       a very large burden on farms and other family businesses. In       fact, the Cato Institute says the Death Tax ``is anti-saving       and anti-investment,'' encourages ``wealthy folks to consume       their wealth before death,'' and does nothing for U.S. long-      term growth.        A growing number of women- and minority-owned businesses       are finding themselves subject to the Death Tax as they try       to build wealth for the first time and pass it on to the next       generation.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds, and I can't help  but remember that, in February 2018, my colleague from Houston, Texas,  voted to default on America's debt, to shut down the government, and to  withhold disaster funding for Hurricane Harvey in our region.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   What a bunch of nonsense that we just heard. I respect the majority  leader. I love his talk about courage and principle and language and  all of that.   But what he didn't tell you was that in February of 2018, Speaker  Pelosi, he, Whip Clyburn, 119 House Democrats, voted to shut down this  government, to default on America's debt, and deny hurricane assistance  to communities not just in Texas, but across the country. He played  politics with America's debt. So did many Democrats that day.   While they lecture us about irresponsibility, here is what we do  know. This is a dangerous, irresponsible charade. Democrats are  desperate to blame the GOP for this when, in fact, they created this  economic crisis.   For 2 years, our Democrat colleagues have known this day was coming  and never even passed a budget. They didn't even try to pass a budget  to deal with this. They never sat down with Republicans. They have  rammed everything through this House this year.   Now, even though they have all of the votes they need, they are just  playing political games, willing to shut down this government, willing  to deny disaster aid, willing to harm our economy and working families  so they don't have to raise this debt ceiling.   The truth is, they don't want to. They can. They don't want to. They  are manufacturing this crisis. They have all the votes they need. They  are willing to bring this economy to the brink. They have got all the  votes they need. All they have to do is include it in reconciliation.  They just don't want to. They just don't want to.   We could fact-check so much of what we heard today. We could spend  the next 2 hours on this, and we could talk about all of the tax breaks  for the billionaires and the wealthy in the new spending bill that is  being brought to the floor. Trust me, this isn't just about past debts.  This is about a green light to spend America deeper and deeper and  deeper into debt.   To quote our Democrat leaders in 2018: ``Republicans control the  House, the Senate, and the White House. The responsibility to govern  rests squarely on their shoulders.''   Democrats control the House, the Senate, and the White House. This  responsibility rests on their shoulders.   I will tell you, Madam Speaker, at the end of this debate, I intend  to offer a motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Ways and Means  and include a provision that would prohibit the IRS from implementing a  bank surveillance scheme.   The reason I am doing this is because Democrats are leading a  campaign to impose bank surveillance on your personal bank account and  your business bank account. They are targeting families and farmers and  America's small businesses.   They want to give the IRS unfettered access to individual and  business bank accounts. It is an outrageous intrusion into the private  lives of all Americans. And they want to do that because they think  they can raise money to lift the SALT cap, to give tax breaks to  millionaires, to create tax havens for billionaires against the very  tax hikes that they are proposing. Penthouse occupants are cheering.  The building janitor gets nothing.   This is why they don't want to take responsibility for lifting the  debt ceiling, because they have huge plans to really harm middle-class  Americans while giving huge tax breaks to their friends.   When Democrats want to sit down with Republicans and have a serious  conversation about how we raise the debt ceiling, how we address the  financial stability of this country, let me tell you, I am in, a lot of  us are in. I am hopeful someday we can get to that because that is what  our country deserves. I will oppose this debt ceiling.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of my  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  commit.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to commit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
