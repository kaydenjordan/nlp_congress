 Madam Speaker, it is once again disappointing to  witness my Democratic colleagues pull political stunts rather than make  serious efforts to find a compromise to reopen the government.   This legislation that we have before us today has only seen the light  of day for less than 24 hours. Democratic leadership is abusing the  suspension list--something usually reserved for bipartisan,  noncontroversial legislation--to  [[Page H558]]  play politics with this government shutdown.   Let me be clear: This legislation will not reopen the government.  This has, once again, as we have seen for 3 weeks in a row now, House  Democrats using valuable time on the floor of the House of  Representatives to play partisan politics rather than to do our job to  find a real solution to reopen shuttered agencies.   It is being reported that President Trump has invited several House  Democrats to the White House today to discuss the government shutdown  and potentially find solutions for compromise. Unfortunately, it is  also being reported that several of my fellow House Members have  rejected that invitation. If that is true, it demonstrates a serious  neglect of our duties as representatives of the people.   As my friend from California, Jackie Speier, rightly said just this  morning on cable news: ``I think when the President calls, it is  incumbent upon us to respect the office and to attend the meeting. And  if they have been asked, I would suggest that they go.''   Madam Speaker, I could not agree more. Every single Member of this  body should be working on behalf of the American people to reopen this  government.   The President is demonstrating his willingness to compromise. I  sincerely hope my Democratic colleagues will heed the invitation and  come to the table with a real offer. Any rejection of this invitation  is a shameful disregard of the seriousness of the situation before us.
