 Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Patrick Casey Pitts to the U.S. District Court for the Northern  District of California. After receiving his B.A. and J.D. from Yale  University, Mr. Pitts clerked on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Ninth Circuit. Following his clerkship, Mr. Pitts joined Altshuler  Berzon LLP, where he has spent his entire legal career. His practice  focuses on advocating on behalf of employees--often from low-income,  minority, and underserved communities--and unions in labor disputes.  Mr. Pitts has extensive litigation experience, trying one case to  judgment and litigating more than 100 matters that were resolved  through a decision on the merits. And if confirmed, Mr. Pitts will  bring vital demographic diversity to the Northern District of  California as the only openly LGBTQ article III judge actively serving  in that district. He will also bring professional diversity to the  Federal bench as a lawyer who has defended the rights of employees and  labor organizations.   The American Bar Association rated Mr. Pitts ``qualified,'' and he  has the strong support of his home State Senators: Mrs. Feinstein and  Mr. Padilla. Mr. Pitts is a seasoned litigator whose credentials and  experience make him an outstanding addition to the Northern District of  California.   I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Pitts's nomination.    Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Dale Ho to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New  York. A graduate of Princeton University and Yale Law School, Mr. Ho  began his legal career as a clerk for Judge Barbara S. Jones on the  Southern District of New York and Judge Robert S. Smith on the New York  Court of Appeals. After working in private practice for 2 years, Mr. Ho  pursued a career as a civil rights lawyer, focusing primarily on  protecting Americans' right to vote.   Mr. Ho has more than a decade of experience litigating long-running,  complex civil matters, giving him great insight into the real-world  impact of judicial decision-making and an understanding of the  importance of fairly applying the law to the facts. Mr. Ho will be a  valuable addition to the bench, given his underrepresented perspective  as a civil rights lawyer.   The American Bar Association rated Mr. Ho ``well qualified,'' and he  has the strong support of his home State Senators: Mr. Schumer and Mrs.  Gillibrand. As a highly skilled litigator who has experience in complex  civil litigation and has a significant appellate practice, including  arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court, Mr. Ho is well-positioned to  serve on the Southern District of New York with distinction.   I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Ho's nomination.    Mr. President, on another topic, last week, President  Biden did something he has done only five times: He vetoed a resolution  passed by Congress.   And let me say: Thank goodness. The proposal he vetoed would have  blocked the administration's student loan forgiveness program. This  program will be a financial lifeline for millions of student borrowers  across the country so that working Americans can start a business, buy  a first home, or, simply, keep a roof over their heads. And there is  one group of student borrowers in particular who are in desperate need  of this financial relief: That is the hundreds of thousands of students  who have been ripped off by for-profit colleges. Just listen to this:  Even though for-profit colleges enroll only 8 percent of college  students, they account for 30 percent of all Federal loan defaults.   Thankfully, just a few weeks ago, the Biden administration took  another crucial step to support these student borrowers. The Department  of Education announced that it will reinstate what is known as the  gainful employment rule--or the GE rule. This rule would create  accountability standards for for-profit colleges to qualify for Federal  student aid. If they want to receive taxpayer dollars--in the form of  Federal student aid--then they need to meet their statutory obligation  to prepare students for gainful employment.   I don't think that is too much to ask. This GE rule is years in the  making, first introduced by the Obama administration, after years of  deliberation, but it was rescinded under former Secretary Betsy DeVos.  As a result, executives of for-profit colleges have lined their pockets  with taxpayer dollars, while students were left to fend for themselves.   Let me tell you about one of these predatory for-profit schools: the  American Intercontinental University. Five of its programs failed the  GE rule--five--at one school, including a bachelor's degree in fashion  and apparel design. The company claims it is one of their ``career- focused degree programs . . . designed to provide students with the  foundational skills required to apply their creative vision in the real  world.''   Sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Wrong. Because here is the reality:  The total cost over 4 years is nearly $55,000. Seventy-four percent of  students who attend this school borrow Federal student loans. And the  median total debt is $31,000.   Here is the biggest problem: The graduation rate is only 19 percent.  And the students who do graduate are hardly any better off. According  to the 2015 GE earnings data, the median annual earnings of a fashion  and apparel design graduate were $18,896. So even if you earn your  degree from this fraudulent program, you do not even have a chance to  earn enough to pay off your loans. That is why it is so important that  the Biden administration has proposed to reinstate the GE rule. And  this new version will provide the strongest accountability and  transparency framework to date.   Under the proposed rule, for-profit colleges would have to prove that  graduates make enough to pay back their loans. So what would happen to  a school like American Intercontinental University if it does not  improve its failing programs? Well, under the new GE rule, the company  would lose access to Federal student aid for its failing programs. I am  glad the Department of Education is holding the for-profit industry  accountable for its lies and protecting students and taxpayers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this coming Monday is Juneteenth, our  newest national holiday, a day set aside to celebrate the triumph of  freedom over slavery in America.  [[Page S2095]]    The name ``Juneteenth'' is a combination of two words, ``June  nineteenth.'' That was the day, in 1865, that the U.S. Army's ``General  Order No. 3'' was issued, finally informing the people of Texas of the  Emancipation Proclamation--and that all of the remaining enslaved  people in that State were free.   Sadly, on this Juneteenth--even as our Nation celebrates--we are  witnessing the most concerted effort in decades to erase from our  history America's long and still unfinished struggle to fully end  racism, the odious lie on which slavery was built. Last year, according  to the American Library Association, there were 1,269 demands to ban  books in school libraries in various States. That is more than double  the number of book bans sought in 2021. And it is the greatest number  of book bans demanded in the 20 years that PEN America, an organization  dedicated to the freedom of expression, has kept records on this  troubling trend.   What is the most frequent target of these new bans? Books involving,  or even just mentioning, issues of race. And what are the books that  these censors are demanding be pulled from the shelves of school  libraries?   Here are some examples: ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' is one. Another is  a biography of Jesse Owens, the great American runner who won four gold  medals at the Olympic Games in Munich in 1936, shattering the Nazi myth  of racial supremacy. In Florida, the book banners demanded that school  textbooks containing the story of Rosa Parks remove race and racism as  reasons she refused to move to the back of the bus. Such efforts to  erase history are an attack on the freedom to read and learn.   This week, my State of Illinois became the first State in the Nation  to ban this form of censorship by public libraries. I hope more States  will stand up for history--and that on the eve of this Juneteenth,  Americans will commit ourselves firmly to truth.                            ____________________
