 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank the York County  Economic Alliance for their work to promote opportunity zones in York  County.   Madam Speaker, we know that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is  working for the American people, allowing families to keep more of  their hard-earned dollars in their paychecks.   Businesses are expanding and creating jobs across York and Lancaster  Counties, creating an economy with more opportunity for everyone.   One of the strongest tools created by the TCJA is opportunity zones,  a way to spur development and job creation in economically distressed  communities.   In fact, I look forward to hosting the Small Business Administration  for an opportunity zone roundtable in the near future to share with our  community the potential advantages of investments in their  neighborhoods.   The YCEA, led by President and CEO Kevin Schreiber and Silas  Chamberlin, the Vice President of Economic and Community Development,  has done an incredible job through its website,  ``opportunityyork.org,'' sharing how opportunity zones can positively  transform our communities. This is a great example of a local chamber  helping businesses build and invest for the benefit of our shared  community.   Madam Speaker, York County is open for business with the help of the  YCEA. I thank them for being a reliable and hardworking partner for  York County's economic growth and prosperity.                            ____________________
