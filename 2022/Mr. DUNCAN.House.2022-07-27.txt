 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota for  yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous question so that we  can amend the rule to immediately consider the Protecting America's  Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act.   H.R. 8488 is a bill introduced by Ranking Member Rodgers and me, and  it is simple. It would prohibit the Department of Energy from sending  America's emergency oil reserves, known as the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve, to China.   Now the Democrats are in denial about why their constituents are  paying so much at the pump for gas and diesel fuel. It is directly a  result of the Biden administration and Democrat policies that began the  day that Joe Biden was sworn in as the President of the United States.  Because of his war on the oil and gas industry, our domestic production  and our refining capacity has declined by more than 1 million barrels  per day since President Trump was in office.   Americans know what they were paying for gas in January of 2021. They  know what they are paying for gas today. They know they had more money  in their pocket to spend on things for their family. They know they are  having to make decisions now about their travel. It is affecting their  cost to go to work, to take their kids to school, or to go to their  place of worship.   Energy prices have surged past historic records. People have been  forced to pay more than $6 per gallon in some regions of the country.  Now President Biden and the Democrats are looking for cover. He is  looking to distract the American voters from the painful realities of  his anti-fossil fuel agenda by releasing an unprecedented 260 million  barrels of oil from the SPR, or the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Releasing this oil is going to be no more than a blip for gasoline  prices.   It seems as if the White House and Democrats are taking victory laps  over a temporary decrease in the price of gasoline. It is because  Americans are on vacation, they are not driving as much, they are  staying home--staycations--and they are not using as much. It is a  supply and demand issue.   But it is also a cause and effect issue. The cause is the Biden  administration's Democrat policies against fossil fuels because they  have some sort of utopian ideal that Americans are just going to--let's  see, in the words of Secretary Granholm: transition to electric  vehicles.   Let me be clear: I like electric vehicles. I think they ought to be a  part of the mix. In fact, more electric vehicles on the road means less  emissions and better air quality.   But instead of forcing it, why not let the free market work?   Why not let the free market come up with alternatives and more cost- effective modes of transportation for Americans versus government  policies trying to push this utopian ideal?   It is not the solution to the energy crisis Americans are facing  today. Releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not the  answer either. In fact, the Biden administration is releasing more than  1 million barrels per day, but it really has nowhere to go because our  refineries are at capacity and our pipelines are full. As a result,  America's emergency reserves are being sent to China which is using it  to build up its own strategic reserves.   The irony is that when prices plummeted at the onset of COVID,  President Trump's Department of Energy wanted to buy oil and fill up  the SPR. Democrats opposed that. Let's see, buy low, sell high. Oil was  really cheap. President Trump wanted to fill up the SPR. Now that oil  is really high, this President wants to release it and give it to  China.   We are going to have to replace it.   Are we going to replace it at a high price?   The other irony is that this isn't about fossil fuels because  President Biden traveled 11,000 miles roundtrip to Saudi Arabia to beg  the Saudis for oil. He didn't beg them for batteries for electric cars.  He begged them for oil which is going to be refined into the  transportation fuels that we use.   I have got an idea for President Biden and for Democrats: How about  embrace American energy production?   How about President Biden travel down to Port Fourchon, Louisiana, or  to Midland, Texas, and talk to American energy producers and ask them  the question: How can we meet the domestic demand that we have here in  this country?   How can we, with American energy production, lower the costs for moms  and dads, American families, here at home by American production,  providing American jobs, and producing American resources?   We have been blessed in this country with abundant resources in oil  and gas. Unfortunately, we have been cursed by liberal politicians.    We have been cursed by liberal politicians who want to  take those abundant resources off the table and continue to hurt  American families who are trying to fill up their car just to travel to  work, to school, and to church.   Mr. Speaker, we need to defeat the previous question, we need to stop  selling or giving, or whatever, oil to China--an adversary--and we need  to focus on domestic energy production.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question so  that the House can immediately consider this important bill. I urge my  colleagues to vote against this previous question and for the  replacement.  [[Page H7180]]         Mr. Speaker, you know, there are some bipartisan issues  in this bill. There is no doubt about that, if the Democrats were to  reach across the aisle and actually work with us. Issues like  telehealth are important.   But we are getting ready to break for the August recess, and American  families are hurting because of what they are paying at the pump for  the price of gas. We have the opportunity to stop the sale of oil to  China and help Americans maintain their strategic national resource and  not give it to China. That is what we are asking for.   Unless we are focused on energy policies before we go home for  recess, there are a lot of other things we could do to address the pain  that Americans are feeling right now, this week, before we break for  the August recess.   Instead, we are going to have some feel-good legislation that won't  even pass the Senate.   We could help American families today, yet the Democrats continue  wanting to try to hoodwink the American people; place blame on Putin  and others for energy prices, when we know what is causing the price at  the pump; and that is the Biden administration's policies on energy.   Let's quit giving oil to China, let's hold that strategic asset, and  let's lessen the price at the pump by passing good energy policy in  this country.
