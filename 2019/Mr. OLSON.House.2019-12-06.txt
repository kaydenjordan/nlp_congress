 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life of Jo Marie  Bankston, the first woman police officer to serve the people of  Houston, Texas.   The year was 1955, 7 years before I was born, when Jo Marie--or Fena,  as she was called by her friends and family--graduated in the first  Houston Police Department class to include women. At that time, the  mere idea of a woman police officer was something very few could  imagine, much less pursue.   Fena paved the way for new female recruits through the 1950s and  1960s, ushering in a new era of strength and passion.   Fena passed away, sadly, last week, on Thanksgiving Day. She leaves  behind a pioneering legacy of protecting and serving the Houston  community. She also left behind a loving family, including her son,  Jimmy, who carries out her spirit as a veteran of the HPD and as a  current U.S. marshal.   Jo Marie inspired so many--some she knew and many more that she never  knew. She made history in her own humble way.   May she enjoy fair winds and following seas in Heaven.                            ____________________
