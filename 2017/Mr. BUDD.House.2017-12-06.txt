 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Mr. Hudson's  Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act.   As things stand, each State currently determines its own concealed  carry reciprocity laws. Some States don't recognize concealed carry  permits from other States. This forces lawful gun owners to sometimes  surrender their Second Amendment rights when they are traveling.   The current system has created accidental criminals, ruined lives,  and punished gun owners simply because they fell victim to complexity  and uncertainty in the law.   My colleague's bill addresses this problem by bringing much-needed  clarity to the system. H.R. 38 is a simple proposal, but a necessary  one. If enacted, it will allow lawful gun owners to carry their firearm  into other States that allow concealed carry. This interstate  recognition of concealed carry would be very similar to a driver's  license.   H.R. 38 would not create national standards for concealed carry or  take away a State's right to govern their own concealed carry laws,  like some might claim. No. This bill simply uses Congress' 14th  Amendment power to protect people's constitutional rights from State  abuse.   Samuel Adams said: ``The Constitution shall never be construed . . .  to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens  from keeping their own arms.''   This powerful line from Mr. Adams sums up my feelings on this bill  much better than I can.   I thank Mr. Hudson for his steadfast leadership on this issue.
