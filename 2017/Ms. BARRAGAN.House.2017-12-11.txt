 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3359, the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3359 would make long-overdue organizational changes  within the Department of Homeland Security's National Protection and  Programs Directorate, otherwise known as NPPD.   I am a strong supporter of this measure that seeks to empower the DHS  to carry out one of its most important and difficult missions: helping  Federal agencies and critical infrastructure owners and operators  secure themselves against physical and cyber attacks.   Importantly, it would rename NPPD the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, to better communicate its  mission to stakeholders, agency partners, and the cyber talent the DHS  needs to come work in the Federal Government.   Now, make no mistake, these are not mere administrative or  bureaucratic changes. H.R. 3359 would transform NPPD into an  operational agency on par with the TSA or Customs and Border  Protection.   It seems that, with each passing day, we learn of new ways  adversaries and cyber criminals are looking to exploit the cyber  weaknesses of Federal agencies and our Nation's critical  infrastructure. Last year, we found ourselves in uncharted territory  when we learned that our electoral system was under attack by one of  the world's most sophisticated cyber actors: the Russian Government.   Now, to respond to these evolving cyber threats, Congress has put its  faith in the DHS; and, in turn, the DHS looks to NPPD, a small, under- resourced headquarters component established a decade ago to carry out  a far more limited mission than the one it has today.   Over the past few years, Congress has expanded NPPD's cyber  authorities and responsibilities without elevating NPPD's standing  commensurate with its growing mission.   Further, as NPPD has gotten better at delivering cybersecurity  assistance and other services to public and private sector partners, it  has seen a surge in demand for its services. For example, in the wake  of the Russian efforts to hack the 2016 Presidential election, State  and local elected officials are now requesting DHS cybersecurity  services.   Secretaries of Homeland Security came to us during the Obama  administration, and now under the Trump administration, to ask for our  help in organizing the Directorate into an operational cybersecurity  agency. It is time we grant this request.  [[Page H9767]]    Reorganizing and rebranding NPPD should enhance the DHS' standing  with respect to its Federal and international peers, clarify its  organizational mission, and boost workforce morale. Our expectation is  that, with higher moral and mission clarity, the DHS will be able to  better compete with the private sector and Federal agencies, like the  NSA and the CIA, for a short supply of talented cyber professionals.   Finally, CISA will be in a better position to carry out its core  cybersecurity and infrastructure protection activities, like risk and  vulnerability assessments for hospitals, banks, the electrical grid,  and now election systems. We need NPPD to carry out these activities  swiftly, effectively, and in a way that respects privacy and civil  liberties; and we cannot expect it to work with one hand tied behind  its back.   This bill is the result of bipartisan negotiations, and I want to  thank Chairman McCaul and Chairman Ratcliffe for their commitment to  see this through and working collaboratively to get this done.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe), the chairman of the Subcommittee  on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection.

For example, in the wake  of the Russian efforts to hack the 2016 Presidential election, State  and local elected officials are now requesting DHS cybersecurity  services.   Secretaries of Homeland Security came to us during the Obama  administration, and now under the Trump administration, to ask for our  help in organizing the Directorate into an operational cybersecurity  agency. It is time we grant this request.  [[Page H9767]]    Reorganizing and rebranding NPPD should enhance the DHS' standing  with respect to its Federal and international peers, clarify its  organizational mission, and boost workforce morale. Our expectation is  that, with higher moral and mission clarity, the DHS will be able to  better compete with the private sector and Federal agencies, like the  NSA and the CIA, for a short supply of talented cyber professionals.   Finally, CISA will be in a better position to carry out its core  cybersecurity and infrastructure protection activities, like risk and  vulnerability assessments for hospitals, banks, the electrical grid,  and now election systems. We need NPPD to carry out these activities  swiftly, effectively, and in a way that respects privacy and civil  liberties; and we cannot expect it to work with one hand tied behind  its back.   This bill is the result of bipartisan negotiations, and I want to  thank Chairman McCaul and Chairman Ratcliffe for their commitment to  see this through and working collaboratively to get this done.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe), the chairman of the Subcommittee  on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3359, the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3359 would make long-overdue organizational changes  within the Department of Homeland Security's National Protection and  Programs Directorate, otherwise known as NPPD.   I am a strong supporter of this measure that seeks to empower the DHS  to carry out one of its most important and difficult missions: helping  Federal agencies and critical infrastructure owners and operators  secure themselves against physical and cyber attacks.   Importantly, it would rename NPPD the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, to better communicate its  mission to stakeholders, agency partners, and the cyber talent the DHS  needs to come work in the Federal Government.   Now, make no mistake, these are not mere administrative or  bureaucratic changes. H.R. 3359 would transform NPPD into an  operational agency on par with the TSA or Customs and Border  Protection.   It seems that, with each passing day, we learn of new ways  adversaries and cyber criminals are looking to exploit the cyber  weaknesses of Federal agencies and our Nation's critical  infrastructure. Last year, we found ourselves in uncharted territory  when we learned that our electoral system was under attack by one of  the world's most sophisticated cyber actors: the Russian Government.   Now, to respond to these evolving cyber threats, Congress has put its  faith in the DHS; and, in turn, the DHS looks to NPPD, a small, under- resourced headquarters component established a decade ago to carry out  a far more limited mission than the one it has today.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3359 has broad support on both sides of the aisle.   We talk a lot about the need to harden our cyber defenses against an  evolving array of virtual threats. Reorganizing and rebranding NPPD as  the  [[Page H9768]]  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has the potential of  enhancing DHS' cybersecurity capacity, boosting morale, and bringing  its critical infrastructure protection workforce together in an  unprecedented way.   As an operational agency, CISA will be positioned to foster better  collaboration between the cyber and physical sides of the house,  bringing its cybersecurity analysts together with chemical inspectors,  protective security advisers, emergency communication specialists, and  Federal Protective Service officers for a more holistic approach to  critical infrastructure protection.   Mr. Speaker, mapping out a new agency is a complicated task, but this  measure is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot go into the classified space in this setting,  but I can tell you that our foreign adversaries are looking to hurt us  and hit us every day, whether it be from Russia, from China, from Iran,  from North Korea. The attacks have targeted Home Depot, Sony, Equifax,  20 million security clearances stolen, to other reports that I can't  even get into. But it is a serious threat.   When people ask me what keeps me up at night, of course ISIS does and  of course al Qaida does. What happened today in New York, I was just  there this morning when the bomb went off. But a cyber attack could  bring down our power grid, could bring down our stock market, our  financial institutions, our energy sector. A major cyber attack on this  Nation could cripple this Nation and its economy and the lives of the  people in the United States. Mr. Speaker, that is why this bill is so  important, to elevate the civilian agency within the Department, to  form a single agency that deals with cybersecurity.   I am very proud of the work my colleagues have done to get to this  point. I have been, as Mr. Ratcliffe said, very dogged in my  determination, and I would urge that the Senate take up this measure  because we cannot afford to delay because the threat is that great.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3669, the  Securing General Aviation and Commercial Charter Air Carrier Service  Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, general aviation flights, such as those that fly out of  Compton/Woodley Airport in my district, are integral to our Nation's  aviation system.   The Securing General Aviation and Commercial Charter Air Carrier  Service Act of 2017 seeks to improve and streamline security measures  for general aviation and commercial charter air carriers. Importantly,  H.R. 3669 incorporates two key Democratic amendments that were adopted  with bipartisan support.                                time  1700    First, an amendment from the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson  Coleman) ensures that the Aviation Security Advisory Committee can  continue to operate independently and clarifies that the TSA  Administrator retains the authority to make security decisions.   As amended, the bill would drive TSA to move swiftly to act upon  recommendations, with which it concurs, that the TSA's advisory  committee issued regarding general aviation security.   Secondly, the bill incorporates an amendment by Representative Bennie  Thompson, our ranking member, to require TSA to conduct a feasibility  study of requiring security threat assessments for all candidates  seeking flight school training to operate large aircraft. Such a study  would help inform our efforts in Congress to push TSA towards more  effective and comprehensive vetting of flight students.   Under current TSA procedures, a student seeking flight training on  aircraft weighing more than 12,500 pounds is not always vetted against  the terrorist watch list prior to the commencement of such training.  Sixteen years after 9/11 attacks, more must be done to block security  loopholes that were exploited by the 9/11 hijackers. Making sure that  anyone who wishes to pilot a large plane is subject to the same level  of vetting that a passenger who boards the plane would receive is  common sense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3669, is a sensible piece of legislation that seeks  to ensure general aviation transportation in our country is secure.  H.R. 3669 includes language which passed the House in a bipartisan  fashion as part of the Department of Homeland Security Authorization  Act to ensure available TSA resources can be used to assist in securing  commercial charter flights.   The bill also incorporates Democratic amendments to ensure the  independence of the ASAC and to push TSA to study flight school student  vetting. While large commercial aircraft operations receive the  majority of TSA's attention and resources, we must not ignore the  damage that could be inflicted by a terrorist attack on a general  aviation flight.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3669, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
