 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Ranking Member for yielding and  allowing me to reinforce my colleague from the State of Maine and say:  if you haven't made your plans, it is not too late. Lobster season is  just picking up. I highly recommend a visit to the Maine coast or  anywhere in the State of Maine.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to provide the VA Choice  Program with additional funds and to authorize several provisions to  improve care for our Nation's veterans.   Specifically, I want to recognize the authorization of a lease  included in this bill for a community-based outpatient clinic in  Portland, Maine, that will provide much-improved services to the  veterans in that area. The new facility will be a huge step in  improving the care for veterans in my district.   The proposed facility will go a long way toward a more efficient,  patient-centered approach to care and will provide a wide range of  services, including audiology, dental, physical therapy, prosthetics,  and women's health.   Most of the veterans served by this new CBOC will be coming from the  surrounding areas, and this new clinic will result in a much shorter  commute for those veterans living in the most densely populated area of  Maine.   The entire Maine congressional delegation has worked for the  authorization of this lease, including my colleague, Mr. Poliquin from  Maine's Second District.   I thank Congresswoman Brownley for introducing legislation earlier  this year to authorize these leases and for her work on this issue.   I am proud to support S. 114, and I thank Ranking Member Walz and  Chairman Roe for their work on this legislation. The authorization of  this lease represents a tremendous step for our State in providing  veterans the proper care they have earned.
