 Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, we  can amend the rule to save the right of every American to be heard on  the floor of Congress.   Madam Speaker, a tenet of socialism is to silence all opposition. The  right to speak your mind and question your leaders are often the first  casualties of socialist governments throughout history; not far behind  are other important freedoms, including the right to defend yourself  and the right to earn a living, which are impossible to protect without  the freedom of speech.   Our Constitution lists the freedom of speech as its very first  freedom, and for our Founding Fathers, the reason was self-evident, as  Benjamin Franklin once said: ``Without freedom of thought, there can be  no such thing as wisdom; and no such thing as public liberty, without  freedom of speech.''   The very first action of this majority is to take it away.   From the very beginning of this institution, we had the motion to  recommit to protect the minority. If you listen to Benjamin Franklin,  tell me how the 117th Congress can have any wisdom or any public  liberty or any freedom, because you deny us speech.                                time  1315    Benjamin Franklin was right then, and he is right now. But I have  noticed the dangerous trend against free speech in recent years, a  trend that betrays everything our Founding Fathers lived, fought, and  died for.   It began in our schools on college campuses where our students are  taught the absurd notion that free speech is about privilege and power,  not open debate and rational deliberation.   Then it jumped to the mainstream media and social media giants who  used their power to protect their liberal friends and censor  conservatives, including during the last election and throughout the  pandemic.   Now, with today's vote, the same socialist ideas have found their way  onto the floor and into the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives,  which will shape every law this Chamber tries to make in the next 2  years, taking the same idea that the socialist governments have taken  before, the fear that you might lose based on an idea, so take their  voice away.   Whose voices are those? The constituents of millions of Americans.  These changes will stop American voices from being heard, primarily by  revoking the motion to recommit, the minority's longtime right to offer  the last amendment to legislation.   I see my good friend, the majority leader, across the aisle. He and I  have switched jobs before. I was the majority leader. For 8 years,  never once was it ever debated that we would deny the minority the  right to an amendment on a bill. Never once. I know the majority leader  will stand up later and say: Well, this has been changed time and time  again. Only by Democrats.   I know my friend is an institutionalist. I know he believes in this  body, but he cannot believe about taking this away.   Why would you want to? You cannot pass a motion to recommit on the  floor unless you have a majority of the people in the body to vote for  it. Are you so afraid that you can't hold people that you want to take  it away? Are your constituents better than somebody else's?   To again quote Ben Franklin, free speech is a necessary tool for  exposing and keeping in check narrow thoughts and narrow men. That is  what the MTR is all about. For our constituents, taking it away means  freedom of speech is silenced and good ideas are stifled.   While House Democrats have slowly chipped away at this right in the  past, today's vote truly represents the nuclear option. It will prove  once and for all who is truly an institutionalist in this body.   Is it no wonder that your majority is so thin that you try to take  away the MTR? Was the Speaker vote too close?   I can't imagine casting that vote as your very first action.  Additionally, these rules mirror the misplaced priorities of the last  Congress. Democrats' 45-page resolution strips all mention of the words  father, mother, son, daughter, brother, mother-in-law, daughter-in-law.  I am a proud father. I am an extremely proud son. But we are going to  strike them from the rules. First, we take your speech away. Then, we  take away what you can say.   Already, in their race to wokeness--I listened to your opening prayer  yesterday. They changed the word ``amen,'' which has nothing to do with  gender.   Today's vote is about more than organizing Congress. It is about the  American people's right to be heard by their government. This vote is  important. It might be the most important vote we take after the vote  for Speaker. It signals our priorities, our vision for the entire 2  years.   The fact that this is the Democrats' first course of action as a  majority in the new Congress speaks volumes to the lengths they will go  to silence the people's voice.   I almost thought it would be the opposite. I know what you thought  the day, the weeks, the months before the election. You wondered if you  would have enough seats in here for how big your majority would be. I  listened to the Speaker say she wasn't going to  [[Page H30]]  only win the majority; she was winning it for the next two or three  elections because they were going to gain so many seats. My dear friend  predicted a 15-seat gain by the Democrats. But that is not what the  American people told you.   I probably would have reversed and said: Oh, my gosh, if we are doing  everything that the American people do not want, maybe we should change  course. But you actually took the opposite approach.   Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Let's deny people to even say  more because they don't like what we are doing.   I have watched this happen in other parts of the world, but I never  thought, in the fundamental belief of the very first amendment of  America, of the very belief of this body where we debate, where the  voices of America are supposed to be heard, where an MTR has been  around from the very beginning of this Nation, of this body--but you  will be the individuals, you will be the slim majority, that took it  away. You will cast that vote. You will have the history written about  you.   The fact that this is your very first course of action, you are  setting the tone for the next 2 years. The political and moral stakes  are high, and the American people know it.   If censorship replaces open debate on this floor, serious  deliberation of the most important issues confronting our country will  become impossible. More importantly, Congress will continue to waste  time on unnecessary distractions that have nothing to do with the needs  of the American people. This damage will be immediate and long-lasting.   But Republicans will never give up our right to fully represent our  constituents' voices here in Washington. Democrats' small thinking may  limit how we can do what is right for our constituents, but it won't  stop us from doing what is needed. Maybe we need a little history in  modern history.   You had the ability to control this body for 40 years before  Republicans ever won in 1994. You had tried to shut it off now and then  based upon certain bills. The very first thing that Republicans did  when they had the chance to write the rules and be in the majority,  they guaranteed it for the minority--for you, when you were in the  minority. They were not afraid.    When we narrowed the majority, much to the same numbers we have  today, was it removed then because Republicans were in power? It was  not. It was guaranteed. My good friend was here during that time. The  Speaker served during that time.   When we, the Republicans, took the majority again and had it for 8  years, not only did we never touch it, we guaranteed it again. You have  been in power for 2 years. You lost seats based upon what you did on  this floor. Instead of changing course, you now deny people their  voice.   That is the history that will be written today. That is the legacy  you will live with. I will promise you this: Two years from today, when  you are no longer in the majority, we will correct the course of  history because we are not afraid of ideas. We believe it makes us  stronger. We know it makes this country stronger.   This choice will shape everything we do in the next 2 years and  beyond. We have big challenges. We are going to have to work together.  But if you deny us, you are going to have a hard time working with us.   Madam Speaker, you and I travel a lot back to our districts. We often  fly on the same planes. We see our constituents, and I see you listen  to them. I see you talk to them about issues. I have watched you work  across the aisle on some of the biggest issues, even when you were not  in the majority.   I want you to think one moment, Madam Speaker: What if those  constituents you talk to--and you say you will bring their voice to the  floor--what if you were going to be denied that? You never were denied  that when you were in the minority.   But I just ask every Member of this body, before you cast this vote,  you may think a tough vote goes away. Oh, no, it won't. I will make you  this promise: You have given me the passion to fight harder for my  constituents. You have given me the passion to find a better  opportunity for more of their voices to be heard. And you have given me  the passion to win back the majority so I can win back the voices on  this floor that they won't be denied. And they might not be my  constituents. They may be the voices of your constituents because it is  the right thing to do that has been here the entire time this body has  been here.   Madam Speaker, there are times we will disagree, but there are very  few times I have ever been this embarrassed of this body, the hypocrisy  of what I am about to see, the hypocrisy of what you think you will  defend, everybody in this body knows it is wrong. But you feel you can  grip power a little harder. You feel you can hold onto it a little  stronger.   I will tell you this: The power of free speech is so much stronger  than the power of somebody trying to grip and hold onto the majority.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge defeat of the previous question.
