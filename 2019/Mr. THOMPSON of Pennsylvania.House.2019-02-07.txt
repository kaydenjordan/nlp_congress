 Mr. Speaker, one of the finest American  traditions took place this morning, the National Prayer Breakfast.   Penny and I were honored and inspired to join Members of Congress and  leaders from across the globe gathered here in Washington, D.C., for  what has become an international forum.   Since 1953, the National Prayer Breakfast has united people, nations,  religions, and even politicians who come together to celebrate faith,  fellowship, and prayer. It is a time where we reflect on faith and  focus on the year ahead. It is a time where we put aside differences  and unite to pray for our leaders, our friends, and our families.   Every President since President Eisenhower has attended the National  Prayer Breakfast, and President Trump delivered excellent remarks this  morning, urging the Nation to build a culture that cherishes the  dignity and sanctity of life.   President Trump said: ``Let us always give thanks for the miracle of  life, creation, and the grace of God.''   Mr. Speaker, I agree. It is my hope the unity and fellowship we felt  this morning stays with us always in our work and in our lives.                            ____________________
