 Mr. President, I came to the floor today to oppose the  nomination of Scott Pruitt to serve as Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency. I thank my colleague from Delaware,  whom I had the honor to serve with when we were both Governors, for his  good work to point out why Scott Pruitt is the wrong person to head the  Environmental Protection Agency.   The EPA was created by a Republican President in 1970, Richard Nixon.  I remember very clearly when he did that. Across subsequent decades,  support for this Agency and for its important mission has been a  strongly bipartisan endeavor. Our Nation has benefited from the service  of dedicated, highly effective EPA Administrators from both parties,  but I am deeply concerned that Scott Pruitt is a radical break from  this bipartisan tradition.   After reviewing Mr. Pruitt's environmental record, I have to ask: Why  was he nominated for this critically important position? He rejects the  core missions of the Environmental Protection Agency at every turn. He  has sued the EPA to block protections for clean air and clean water; he  is an outspoken climate change denier; he seeks to dismantle the EPA's  Clean Power Plan, which was put in place to address climate change; and  he opposes other efforts to slow the warming of this planet. Time and  again, he has put private interests and their profits ahead of public  interests and public health.  [[Page S1245]]    As attorney general of Oklahoma, he has sided with oil and gas  companies, and he has failed to protect the people of his State from  some of the worst impacts of hydraulic fracturing. He has taken  hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from fossil  fuel industries, and he zealously advocated for their freedom to  pollute our air and water.   So again I ask: Why was Scott Pruitt nominated to serve as  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency? Well, I think it  is clear Mr. Pruitt was nominated not to lead the EPA forward but to  prevent it from carrying out its mission. Make no mistake, Mr. Pruitt  and his extreme agenda are a threat to the environment, to the planet,  and to our public health.   Christine Todd Whitman, a former Republican Governor of New Jersey  and whom I also had the honor of serving with when I was Governor-- Senator Carper, Christie Whitman, and I all served as Governors  together. She also was EPA Administrator during George W. Bush's  administration. What she said about Pruitt I think is worth listening  to. This is a Republican talking about Scott Pruitt: ``I don't recall  ever having seen an appointment of someone who is so disdainful of the  agency and the science behind what the agency does.''   People in the State of New Hampshire have no doubt about the reality  of climate change. In the Granite State we see it. We experience it all  the time. The steady increase in yearly temperatures and the rise in  annual precipitation are already affecting New Hampshire's tourism and  our outdoor recreation economy, which accounts for more than $4 billion  a year and employs over 50,000 people. Each year, hundreds of thousands  of sportsmen and wildlife watchers come to New Hampshire to enjoy our  beautiful mountains, our lakes, our other natural resources, and our 18  miles of coastline, which we are very proud of. As I said, hunting,  fishing, and outdoor recreation contribute more than $4 billion to New  Hampshire's economy each year, but much of this is now threatened by  the warming of our planet. Rising temperatures are shortening our fall  foliage season, they are negatively affecting our snow- and ice-related  winter recreation activities, including skiing, snowboarding, and  snowmobiling. An estimated 17,000 Granite Staters are directly employed  by the ski industry in New Hampshire, and the New Hampshire Department  of Environmental Services warns that those jobs are threatened by  climate change.   Likewise, New Hampshire's and indeed all of New England's brilliant  fall foliage is at risk. I wish to quote from a report by New Hampshire  Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions. They say: ``Current modeling  forecasts predict that maple sugar trees eventually will be completely  eliminated as a regionally important species in the northeastern United  States.''   Climate modeling by the Union of Concerned Scientists projects that  by the end of this century, New Hampshire summers will feel like  present-day summers in North Carolina, 700 miles to our south. We have  a map that shows what is going to happen to our red maples and the  maple sugaring industry. We can see everything here that is in red,  these are all those sugar maples. It is projected that by 2070 or 2100,  they are gone. They are gone from New England, from the Northeast, and  from most of the Eastern part of this country. If we fail to act on  climate change, this could mean a steep loss of jobs. It could mean a  loss of revenue. It will destroy our maple sugaring industry and will  damage our outdoor recreation industry.   Maple sugar production is entirely dependent on weather conditions,  and changes--no matter how modest--can throw off production and  endanger this industry. Maple trees require warm days and freezing  nights to create the optimal sugar content in sap production. The  changing climate is putting more and more stress on sugar maples. As  this map shows so well, it is already significantly affecting syrup  production. If we fail to act on climate change, this could destroy our  maple syrup industry. If you haven't done maple sugaring in the  springtime, there is nothing like maple syrup over snow. There is  nothing else like it. To lose that and to lose the jobs that are there  is a real change to one of the recreational activities we love in New  Hampshire.   Climate change is also threatening our wildlife species and their  habitats. The moose is an iconic feature of New Hampshire's culture and  identity, but as the results of climate change, we have seen a 40- percent decline in New Hampshire's moose population. We can see clearly  from these pictures why we are losing our moose: Because of milder  winters, ticks don't die off. It is really very tragic. The ticks  multiply on a moose, they ravage it, and they eventually kill it. I  don't know if people can see, but what look like little balls on the  end of that moose's tail are ticks. This moose probably has brain worm,  which is another problem the moose have because of winters that aren't  cold enough to kill off those parasites. Ticks multiply on a moose,  they ravage it, and they eventually kill it.   We have seen modeling from the University of New Hampshire which  suggests that by 2030, moose will be gone--not only from northern New  Hampshire but from much of the northern part of this country.   Other newly invasive insects are harming wildlife species as well as  trees. Of course, people are also suffering from the impacts of climate  change. Rising temperatures increase the number of air pollution action  days. They increase pollen and mold levels, outdoors as well as  allergen levels inside, and all of these things are dangerous to  sensitive populations with asthma, allergies, and chronic respiratory  conditions. In fact, New Hampshire has one of the highest rates of  childhood asthma in the country because we are the tailpipe. All of New  England is the tailpipe for the rest of the country. Pollution blows  across this country from the Midwest and exits through New Hampshire  and New England.   Rising temperatures facilitate the spread of insect-borne illnesses  such as Lyme disease. We could see on that moose what the impact is.  Those ticks aren't just multiplying on the moose, they are multiplying  in a way that affects people as well.   Fortunately, because we have seen the impact of climate change, New  Hampshire and the other New England States are taking the lead in  reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to a more energy-efficient,  clean energy economy. We are one of nine Northeastern States  participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative called RGGI. It  is essentially a cap-and-trade system in the Northeast. New Hampshire  has already reduced its power sector carbon pollution by 49 percent  since 2008. That is a 49-percent reduction in less than a decade.  Thanks to efforts by State and local communities, New Hampshire is on  track to meet the Clean Power Plan's carbon reduction goals 10 years  early. In addition, we are using proceeds from emissions permits sold  at RGGI auctions to finance clean energy and energy efficiency  investments.   Unfortunately, Scott Pruitt seems to believe that reducing pollution  and investing in a clean environment are somehow bad for the economy.  He is just wrong about that. Our efforts in New Hampshire and across  New England to fight climate change and promote clean energy have been  a major boost to economic growth. We have seen jobs added as a result.  During its first 3 years, RGGI produced $1.6 billion in net economic  value and created more than 16,000 jobs in our region. Nationwide,  employment in the fossil fuel sector is falling dramatically, but job  creation in the clean energy and energy efficiency sectors is  exploding. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 2  million jobs have been created in the energy efficiency sector alone  and--if we can ever get Congress to move the energy efficiency  legislation Senator Portman and I have introduced--would create, by  2030, another 200,000 jobs, just on energy efficiency. Across New  England, we are demonstrating that smart energy choices can benefit the  environment and strengthen job creation and the economy overall.   So, again, we have to ask: Why does Scott Pruitt deny the science of  climate change? Why has he urged States to refuse to comply with the  Clean Power Plan? Why has he filed lawsuit after lawsuit to block  enforcement of the Clean Air Act? Why does he deny  [[Page S1246]]  something as nearly universally recognized as the dangers of mercury  pollution?    The bottom line, I believe, is that Scott Pruitt is first and  foremost a fierce defender of the oil and gas industry. If scientists  point to carbon emissions as the main cause of climate change, then he  has to deny that science. If science and common sense point to  hydraulic fracking as the cause of thousands of earthquakes in the  State of Oklahoma, then he must deny that too. If the EPA's mission is  to protect clean air and clean water from pollution caused by fossil  fuels, then he has to sue the EPA and try to cripple it.   Scott Pruitt's nomination is not about shaking things up in  Washington. It is about turning over control of the EPA to the fossil  fuel industry and turning back the clock on half a century of  bipartisan efforts--in Democratic and Republican administrations  alike--to protect clean air and clean water and to pass on to our  children a livable environment and an Earth that they can inhabit from  future generations.   My office has been flooded with calls, emails, and letters from  Granite Staters. They not only oppose Mr. Pruitt's nomination, they are  genuinely afraid of the consequences of putting him in charge of the  EPA.   I heard from Deb Smith from Hampton, NH. That is a small community on  our coastline. She wrote:         I am a birder, love to walk on the beach and in the       mountains, and rely on time spent in nature to cope with a       [stage four] lung cancer diagnosis. Clean air is especially       important to me! Pruitt's long history of suing the EPA and       reversing decades of progress in improving the environment       disqualifies him for this post. It is essential to continue       to preserve and improve our natural environment for people,       birds, and other wildlife!    Elizabeth Garlo of Concord writes:         New Hampshire, due to quirks in its geology and the Earth's       rotation, is the ``tailpipe'' of the Nation with much of the       air pollutants from the Midwest exiting to the ocean from       here. The people of New Hampshire cannot sit back and watch       our children suffer from asthma and be restricted from       outside activities due to ``bad air quality days.'' Mr.       Pruitt will be a very significant detriment to the quality of       life in New Hampshire.    Eugene Harrington of Nashua writes:         I am AGAINST the appointment of Scott Pruitt to head the       EPA. He does not seem to support the purpose of the EPA. Now       I hear that even scientific papers are being reviewed to be       sure they support the current administration's view of       ``facts.'' Please do what you can to support a functioning       EPA.    Christopher Morgan of Amherst, NH, writes:         This is my first message I have ever sent to my senator in       my 32 years as a voting American. . . . As a registered       Republican . . . I am vehemently opposed to Mr. Pruitt       leading the EPA. He has consistently shown he does not       believe in the threat posed by climate change. Climate change       affects every citizen in this country and has a detrimental       effect on the New Hampshire climate specifically. President       Trump's willful disregard for the safety and protection of       all Americans cannot go unchecked.    Let me emphasize that I have heard from many Republican constituents  who oppose Scott Pruitt's confirmation. My Republican friends point  with pride to the fact that the EPA was created by a Republican  President. After all, what could be more conservative than conserving  our environment and preserving a livable Earth for future generations?  For nearly half a century, protecting the environment has been a  bipartisan priority and endeavor. That is especially true in the State  of New Hampshire, where folks understand that clean air and water and  fighting climate change are not and should not be partisan issues. We  all have a profound stake in protecting the environment.   Unfortunately, with the nomination of Scott Pruitt to head the EPA,  the Trump administration is willing to shatter this bipartisan  tradition and consensus, and we must not allow this to happen. I appeal  to all of my colleagues but especially to all of those on the other  side of the aisle: Don't allow this nominee to destroy your party's  hard-earned, commonsense efforts to protect clean air, clean water, and  a sustainable Earth.   I urge us to come together--Senators on both sides of the aisle--to  reject this effort to undo nearly five decades of bipartisan efforts to  protect our environment and our planet.   The stakes are incredibly high for all of us. By rejecting this  unsuitable nominee, we can reconsider our approach to the EPA. We can  embrace this Nation's bipartisan commitment to protecting the  environment for future generations. This is what the great majority of  Americans want us to do. Let's listen to their voices, and let's say no  to this nominee, Scott Pruitt, who is not only not qualified for this  position, he is not committed to the EPA and its mission.   Mr. President, at this time I yield 30 minutes of my postcloture  debate time to Senator Schumer.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.   The Senator from New Hampshire.
