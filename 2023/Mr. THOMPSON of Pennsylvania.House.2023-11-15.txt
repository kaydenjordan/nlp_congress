 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  November as National Career Development Month.   Along with my colleague and co-chair of the Bipartisan Career and  Technical Education Caucus, Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, today we  introduced a resolution recognizing November as National Career  Development Month.   National Career Development Month marks an important time for our  students and workers of all ages to consider and explore future career  opportunities. It is also a time to recognize the professionals who  guide learners to become the leaders of tomorrow.   Throughout the month, schools and businesses will have the chance to  showcase different career paths that align with various interests and  skills. These opportunities will better prepare students as they begin  to enter the workforce.   National Career Development Month raises awareness of future career  opportunities and development programs for all individuals.  [[Page H5882]]    A highly skilled workforce is a business' number one asset and  provides a competitive edge. This month, I encourage individuals of all  ages to take advantage of career development and put themselves in the  driver's seat of their futures.   Career practitioners and educators are a vital resource for the  livelihood of our Nation's workforce and economic health and well-being  of U.S. workers. We look forward to advancing career development for  all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  resolution.                            ____________________
