 Mr. Speaker, this is the cruelest and most immoral  thing I have seen the Republican Party do to the American people. Tens  of thousands of Americans will die if this bill passes. That is a fact.  Republicans have been deceiving the American people for the last 8  years. They don't care about working people, and this bill proves it.  They care about insurance companies and drug companies that fund their  campaigns. They care about the millionaires and billionaires who get  huge tax cuts in this bill. Don't try to tell me that they care about  factory and construction workers who will be hurt by this bill. Don't  try to tell me that they care about single moms who won't be able to  put food on the table after you pass this bill. Don't try to tell me  that they care about cancer survivors who are going to pay $140,000  more for health insurance.   I don't know how anyone can look their constituents in the eye if  they vote for this bill. Shame on you if you do. If you vote for this  bill, there will come a day when you will have to answer for your vote,  when you will have to look a friend, a family member in the eye,  someone who is sick or dying, and say: I did this to you.   Don't do it. Vote ``no.''   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded once again to direct  their remarks to the Chair.
