 Mr. Speaker, there is always time to celebrate  extraordinary Americans, which is why I rise today to recognize  American tennis star and proud son of Maryland's Fifth District,  Frances Tiafoe.   Last week, he became the first American man to reach the U.S. Open  semifinals since 2006 and the first African-American man to do so since  Arthur Ashe in 1972.   Indeed, Tiafoe is one of the only three African-American men in the  history of tennis to advance out of the rounds and into the finals of  the U.S. Open.   Of course, we have been very proud to cheer Serena Williams and  Sloane Stephens, who together won 4 out of the last 10 women's titles  in the U.S. Open, not to mention an extraordinary young woman, Coco  Gauff, who made it to the U.S. Open quarterfinals.   Tiafoe's accomplishments in the men's tournament are especially  impressive, Mr. Speaker, considering his extraordinary story. Born in  Maryland's Fifth District--mine--to immigrant parents who fled civil  war in Sierra Leone, Frances grew up living in a spare office at the  Junior Tennis Champions Center in College Park, Maryland, where his  father worked as a custodian. Indeed, earlier, his father had been part  of the construction crew that built that tennis center.   Noticing young Frances' upbeat attitude and love of the game, the  coaches and staff of the center took him under their wing and helped  him train to become one of the most promising American tennis players  in recent memory. How proud they must be.   We saw that training bear fruit last week when he made it to the  semifinals by defeating one of the greatest tennis players in history,  Rafael Nadal, from Spain. Although Frances ultimately didn't win the  title, he showed the world that the future of American tennis is bright  indeed.   I had the opportunity of talking to Frances just a few minutes ago. I  am inviting him down to the Capitol, and I want all the Maryland  Members to meet him. But I am going to invite all of you to meet him,  as well, Mr. Speaker.   He is an extraordinary young man. I congratulate him, I congratulate  his family, and I congratulate those coaches who saw a promising young  man and took him under their wing not because he was paying them but  because they saw great promise in Frances Tiafoe.   Boy, were they right.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of this and the other two bills that we will  vote on, the Oversight and Reform Committee bills that we are  considering this week. Not only will they make government more  accountable to the people it serves, they are also a testament to the  extraordinary work and dedication to service of the committee's  chairwoman, my friend, Carolyn Maloney.   She leaves Congress at the end of this year after an accomplishment  of three decades in office. During that time, she has been a champion,  not only for New York, but for all those across the country who cherish  good government and the causes of justice, opportunity, and equality  for which she has worked so very, very hard.   Few in the history of the Congress have worked on behalf of the  consumers in a more dedicated and effective fashion than Chairwoman  Carolyn Maloney.   Today, she continues that service by offering, on behalf of her  committee, these three bills. I make particular mention of the bill  authored by Chairman Gerry Connolly of the Government Operations  Subcommittee, which has been strongly supported by Chairwoman Maloney  and their colleagues and the committee's majority.   I, too, strongly support this effort, which would protect the  nonpartisan  [[Page H7852]]  nature of our civil service by ensuring that Presidents cannot simply  fire Federal workers by reclassifying them as ``schedule F'' employees.  That is what the previous President suggested. That is what his  supporters are suggesting now.   And they are suggesting, not only that, but they are going to put  people in place who want to follow their political edicts, legal or  not. They made it quite clear they want to eliminate what they call the  deep state.   The deep state is a cadre of professionals dedicated to honoring the  Constitution, the laws of this country, and carrying out the policies  of the Congress and the President.   By the way, it is the Congress that makes policy, under the  Constitution, under Article I. It is the executive that carries out  policies. Now, Presidents of both parties want to be policymakers also.  I get that. It is a nonpartisan desire of Presidents.   But our Founders but, more importantly, those who adopted the Civil  Service Reform Act and have made amendments subsequent to that, and a  majority of the Congress of the United States, both parties, thought  that it was in the interest of citizens to have a professional cadre of  employees, not subject to political pressure, or whim, or edict, but  subject to following the law and carrying out the policies of this  country.   We must guard against a future President taking that dangerous step  of making them employees at will. Frankly, we have had a very stark  example of a President whose will was inconsistent with American  principles.   We must not return to the kind of patronage system that fueled  corruption and partisanship before the civil service reforms of the  late 19th century.   The other two bills authored by Chairwoman Maloney are equally  necessary and beneficial to the American people. The first would  further protect whistleblowers against retaliation; and the second  would protect the nonpartisan nature of the U.S. Census, prescribed by  our Constitution, and so vital to equal representation.   When we passed whistleblower legislation and protections, we did so  because we wanted people to be able to come forward and say the emperor  has no clothes. The policies being pursued are being done  inefficiently. The policies being pursued are wasting money. The  policies being pursued are illegal.   That is why we protect whistleblowers, because it is in the interest  of our citizens, of our country, and our laws and, by the way, in the  interest of Congress, so that people can come forward to those of us  who make policy, who appropriate money, to be told the policies that  you passed are not being followed, or the money you dedicated is not  being spent in the way you purposed it. So these bills are critically  important.   And by the way, the Constitution says, count everybody. That is what  the Constitution says. The Supreme Court said that is what it said. Not  just my friends; not just the people who like me; count everybody.   And by the way, if you are going to change the rules, tell the  Congress, and tell us before it is too late for us to do anything about  it. That is all this bill says. This bill ought to be overwhelmingly  supported by both sides of the aisle.   Very frankly, if you have a deep state, you would think you would  want to make sure that the Congress is the one that sets the policies  of who is counted and not counted and how it is counted.   President Lincoln famously described ours as a ``government of the  people, by the people, and for the people.''   These bills, like the work of Chairwoman Maloney, throughout her  career in public service, will help us keep it that way.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support these  bills.   And in closing, once again, I congratulate Carolyn Maloney of New  York for her dedicated, extraordinarily effective service to the people  of New York, people of her city, the people of this country. She has  been an extraordinary Member of this institution and has made us  better.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning  hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business, and votes will be postponed  until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   Next week, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider S. 1098, the Joint  Consolidation Loan Separation Act, bipartisan legislation sponsored by  Representative   David Price and Senator Mark Warner to provide relief  to borrowers who need to separate their joint consolidation student  loans. This legislation would greatly benefit the individual borrowers  who are most in need of relief, including victims of abuse.   The House may also consider a continuing resolution. As all of us  know, on September 30, at midnight, the government's ability to fund  and operate goes out of authorization; therefore, it is necessary for  us to take action before September 30, and we may do that next week.   The House may also consider legislation to reform the Electoral Count  Act from Representatives Zoe Lofgren and Liz Cheney.   The House will consider bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business tomorrow.   As is usual, as we come very close to ending and then have a  substantial period of time, October and the first and second week in  November for the election, it is common that we may have other pieces  of legislation, Mr. Speaker, available and necessary to pass. We will  notify Members as soon as we have that information.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Obviously, that is a good question and a good thing to  have.   The appropriators are working through the administration's list of  anomalies, which I know there are three or four items dealing with  health and also dealing with Ukraine and a couple of other matters. I  don't have that list in front of me, but the answer to my friend's  question is that they are trying to get that together.   I think they are pretty close. I will talk to Chair DeLauro. I  presume she is in conversation with and discussions with the ranking  member, as well, but I am sure that that is the case.   There is also, I believe, money also being asked for for disaster  relief that may well be in the CR.   The gentleman referred to the discussions that occurred in the Senate  between Senator Manchin and Majority Leader Schumer. Obviously, we are  going to see what the Senate does. I don't know what the Senate is  going to do. It is one of the reasons there has been a discussion about  the Senate moving first on that and discussions with the Senator about  when they were going to move. I think that is under discussion.    If I might add, I want to make the gentleman aware--and I  know he is--but I want to make the Members aware that we will need to  be here for such time as it takes us to pass the continuing resolution  so that government will continue to operate. It is essential for the  economy, essential for our national security, and essential for the  employees, but it is also essential for all those whom they serve on a  daily basis.   I have told my Members in some discussions about what we are going to  do the last week in September. I have told my Members, and we also  would make clear to all of our Members, including the Members on my  friend's side of the aisle, that they ought to be making sure that the  last 3 weekdays of November and that Saturday they ought to keep clear  so that if, in fact, we need to work during those periods of times--and  my expectation is we are going to have to--that they not be canceling  events that they scheduled. So, being on notice, I think, will be fair  to them and fair to anybody that we are scheduling with.    I could not agree with the gentleman more. I think I am  probably just as frustrated.   I know the members of the Appropriations Committee are as frustrated  as anybody in this institution. As someone who served on the  Appropriations Committee for 23 years, we ought to be passing bills in  a timely fashion. We ought to be passing them one at a time. We ought  not to have these gigantic omnibuses that nobody knows about.   Both sides have had to prepare two omnibuses at the end of the year  to fund government because we haven't passed individual appropriation  bills in a timely fashion either through the House or the Senate or  through the House and the Senate to the President. So, I agree with the  gentleman entirely.   I agree also that we ought to give everybody as much notice as we  possibly can. I will tell the gentleman, frankly, I was hopeful that we  would have passed the CR this week. For reasons that are, I think,  obvious to everybody, we haven't done that. But I am hopeful that we  can do it sooner rather than later and don't have some September 30  crisis that we seem to always create.   I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I, obviously, anticipated that question. I thought about it, and I  want to say to the Members my thoughts that I, frankly, talk about all  over the country.   We passed a number of bills. Inflation is hurting our people.  Inflation was not caused by President Biden or this Congress. Inflation  was caused by the pandemic.   Inflation hurt businesses severely and hurt employees severely. In a  bipartisan way, we voted as that pandemic started. As we saw the broad  impacts of that, we, in a bipartisan fashion, stepped in to help. It  made a very big difference.   I start that way because the representation of some is that somehow  we, by passing legislation, have caused this inflation. The OECD  nations, the economically developed countries of the world, have all  had inflation. As a matter of fact, the average OECD nation has a 10.2  percent inflation rate. As the gentleman knows, ours is 8.3 percent.   Mexico didn't have any of the bills that we passed and had an 8.7  inflation rate. The Netherlands that didn't have an American Rescue  Plan has a 13.6 percent rate of inflation. Sweden, a small and very  successful country, didn't have an American Rescue Plan and has an  inflation rate of 9.8 percent; Austria, another strong economic  country, 9.3 percent; Denmark, the country of my father's birth, 8.9  percent.   And you say: So what? The ``so what'' is that we have seen a global  inflation. I haven't mentioned some of the other countries in Asia who  have inflation rates, as well. I simply say that so both parties and  all Members understand the consequences and pain of inflation at the  pump.   The gentleman in some of the discussions we have had has pointed out  that prices have gone up. I have not heard him say that the President  has taken certain action, and it has come down about 35-plus percent  over the last 6, 7 weeks from $5.02 as an average down to somewhere  around $3.60.   Is that low enough? It is not. It has been much higher. It was higher  in 2008 under George Bush. But it needs to come down further. We will  continue to work on that.   We passed a number of pieces of legislation. I mentioned the American  Rescue Plan took 48 percent of America's children out of poverty who  were in poverty; not 48 percent of America's children, but 48 percent  of America's children who were in poverty were taken out by the  American Rescue Plan.  [[Page H7864]]    None of us are wearing masks on this floor or around the country when  we gather together and get in rooms close to one another. Why? Because  we got 250 million shots in arms.   We also have people struggling for a variety of economic reasons  primarily brought upon them by the pandemic, so we put money in their  pockets.   We have one of the fastest growing economies. We have one of the  lowest unemployment rates in the world. We have a country that is doing  well.   The gentleman mentions the stock market declining. It did. Why did it  decline? Because we had the pandemic. Inflation resulted from that, and  the Federal Reserve--as was true under Ronald Reagan when unemployment  went to 10.5, 6, 7, 8 percent because Paul Volcker was slowing down the  economy to defeat inflation.   Inflation is harmful, particularly to people who are elderly and on  fixed incomes. So, I want the gentleman to know that we empathize with  that, and, therefore, we are distressed.   When we passed a bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, not a single  Republican voted for it.                                time  1600    And there is absolutely no denial on the reality that is going to  bring Americans' costs down. Not only that, it kept 13 million people  who were going to fall off insurance on the Affordable Care Act--which  I know the gentleman's party does not support--but 13 million Americans  who had healthcare insurance as a result of the American Rescue Plan,  it was going to stop on December 31, and we continued that.   We put on legislation that would bring down prescription drug costs  and allow companies to sell drugs to Medicare in a negotiated way. We  negotiate, as the gentleman knows, and I don't know whether the  gentleman thinks that policy ought to be stopped, but we negotiated for  prices with veterans' healthcare. Now we are going to do it with  Medicare. We wanted to do it for everybody, but the Senate Republicans  would not agree to that.   We believe that the infrastructure bill is going to really help bring  down inflation, create jobs, and expand our economy. We believe the  CHIPS and Science bill is going to do the same. Only 13 on the  Republican side voted for the infrastructure bill, which was, I think,  a bill that would have helped inflation by making supplies better. The  energy portion of the Inflation Reduction Act is going to bring down  the cost of energy. It is going to create competition on energy, and  fight climate change. I lament the fact that not a single Republican  voted for the Inflation Reduction Act.   Even if you reject the fact that it is going to reduce inflation--as  I think you probably do, I don't want to anticipate what you do, but  that is my guess. There are literally scores of economists who believe  it is going to bring down inflation.   As importantly, the committee who looks closely at this--scores of  economists say it is going to bring it down. The Committee for a  Responsible Federal Budget say they believe it is going to bring down  inflation. I don't want to project that it is going to bring it down a  half a point, a point, 2 points, 3 points, 4 points--I hope it does. I  think it was certainly worth a try.   None of your colleagues either in this House or in the Senate--down  the aisle--gave it a chance. We passed it anyway under a process,  obviously, that allows just Democrats in the Senate to pass something  under a process called reconciliation.   I want to tell the gentleman that I have apprised the committee  chairmen of the bills that you have talked to me about. I have asked  them to look at them. Frankly, I cannot tell you I have gotten a  response from each one of them, but we are giving them attention.   Obviously, we want to know what our committees think about not only  your legislation, our legislation--our legislation, that is, bipartisan  legislation. We lament the fact, I will tell you, very frankly, Mr.  Speaker--we lament the fact that our Republican colleagues in all four  of the bills I have just mentioned, which are designed to grow the  economy--the CHIPS bill, the bipartisan infrastructure--19 Senators  voted for the infrastructure bill and helped put it together with  President Biden and Senate Democrats. Lamentably, only 13 of your  colleagues chose to vote for it. I am glad they did, but it was over  the advice and counsel of their leadership. That bill clearly was  embraced by the American people and incorporated policies, essentially,  that President Trump said in 2016 he was going to recommend and have  the Congress adopt. It didn't happen in 2017. It didn't happen in 2018.  It didn't happen in 2019, and it didn't happen in 2020.   I say to my friend, we think all four of those bills are going to  have a very positive impact on our economy, on growing our economy,  ensuring supplies of basic goods, and bringing down inflation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I can't see the chart. Could you tell me what  it says so I know what the gentleman is talking about?    Here?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   First, let me say, the gentleman dismisses what other countries are  doing or he says they are doing bad things and therefore they have  inflation.   Every country has inflation. Why? Because the pandemic shut down the  world. It shut down the markets. It shut down the production of  supplies. That is why. People had to stay home and they weren't out  producing and making things.   We kept a lot of people employed. We spent trillions of dollars doing  it, which were bipartisan bills signed by Donald Trump. Trillions. As  soon as Donald Trump left, all of a sudden the other party--his party,  the Trump party, decided it is over. It wasn't over for the American  people.   Kids were not in schools. People hadn't been given shots in arms yet.  People were really hurting. Those 48 percent of the children in poverty  were still in poverty, but it was over. No more bipartisanship. It is  another President, so we are going to blame him.   That is politics over people. What we did is people over politics  because we knew people were hurting. We passed legislation to give them  help. Every Republican, Mr. Speaker, voted no.    We voted to help them gets shots in arms. Every Republican voted no.   We voted to get their kids back in school to make their schools safe  and healthy. Every Republican voted no because they wanted to bleat  about inflation.   The reason they don't like these figures is because these are the  economically successful nations of the world, many of whom have  inflation higher than we.   The gentleman is absolutely right. We need to get inflation down.  There are 126 economists that say that the Inflation Reduction Act will  reduce inflation, reduce healthcare costs, and reduce energy costs.   Now, the gentleman and I have had this discussion about his energy  bills, which they think will be the salvation. They always think: Drill  more, life will be better. I get it. Louisiana is a State that wants to  drill. I get that. We use that product. It is an important product, and  we are going to continue to use it. That is why I have no criticism of  that.   In the last bill that we passed, which is really going to fight the  climate challenge that we face--there were four 1,000-year floods in  four different communities in America within 30 days of one another.                                time  1615    The West is on fire, literally and figuratively. Climate challenge is  real. Every Republican voted ``no'' to invest in meeting that challenge  head-on; every Republican, House and Senate, Mr. Speaker.   I can't read the chart, but 13 percent inflation is too high. I go to  the grocery store almost every weekend. I live alone. I don't buy a lot  of food at any one time because I am traveling a lot and here a lot;  don't want it to go bad.   So I get it on the prices. I get it on gasoline prices. They are  tough. That is why we passed a food and fuel bill. The gentleman from  Louisiana voted ``no.'' The leader of the Republican Party, Mr.  McCarthy, in the House, voted ``no'', and the overwhelming majority of  Republicans voted ``no.''   They wanted to make sure that we had competition. That is the free  market system. That is what brings prices down. If you have a monopoly,  you can charge anything you want if people need the product.   Now, I won't go through the statistics because the statistics are we  are producing more energy today than we produced 2 years ago. I read  those statistics. I am not going to bore the gentleman, Mr. Speaker,  with them again.   They don't bore me because it shows that--when the argument is the  reason we have inflation is because we are not producing energy, the  reason we don't have as much energy is because companies made a  rational decision. What was that rational decision?   In March and April of 2020, people started staying in their homes.  They stopped buying gas and other products, petroleum products, and, as  a result, corporations made a reasonable judgment. We are not going to  produce more capacity.   So, when we got out of the inflation, we are still not doing that.  But we are doing more than we did some years ago, as those statistics  that I read to the gentleman three or four times, so I won't read them  again.   But the industry, as I have also told the gentleman, owns 9,000  unused permits to drill onshore; 37 million acres offshore; which can  be permitted, ready to go.   So when you simply ignore and pretend that somehow Joe Biden, the  President of the United States, is responsible for worldwide inflation,  and dismiss the pandemic--I don't think I have heard one time, Mr.  Speaker, the Republican whip mention the pandemic as a cause of the  inflation. It is all about energy.   I beg to differ with the gentleman, Mr. Speaker. I think, honestly,  the American people need to know that.  [[Page H7866]]    Yes, the stock market had a rough tumble. Why did it have a rough  tumble? Because the Federal Reserve, the chairman of which was  appointed by President Trump, responsibly, along with his board of  governors, responded to try to get this inflation under control and  bring it down.   I don't know whether the gentleman supports that action or not.  Ronald Reagan supported that action; although he did not appoint the  chairman of the Federal Reserve that did it.   So, Mr. Speaker, we are going to continue to fight for the people and  put them above our politics, or even our own personal economic  interests, by passing the American Rescue Plan; by passing the  bipartisan infrastructure bill; by making sure that America can be seen  as a country that makes it in America; chips, investing in science for  the future, for the people and, yes, the Inflation Reduction Act, which  the gentleman and his party has misrepresented over and over and over  again with something they know is not the truth.   They project 80,000 new people going after average Americans. They  know that is not true, Mr. Speaker.   After years of trying to defund the people who collect the revenues  from our people so everybody pays their fair share, and those of us-- and I say of us--who are doing well, pay our fair share, and the people  who make billions, who pay less of a percentage, in many respects, as  Warren Buffett said, than those who work for them.   Yes, we want taxes fairly enforced, Mr. Speaker. We don't want  anybody paying an unfair share because somebody is not paying at all.   The IRS will, after those 10 years of accretion of employees, have as  many employees as it had back in the 1990s; trying to make sure it can,  in fact, enforce a fair system that provides the revenues that the  Federal Government needs to protect, preserve our people's welfare,  economy, and national security.    I don't think I made that comment.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   First of all, to your last statement, the unions. What were the  unions trying to do? They were trying to keep teachers healthy. They  were trying to keep kids healthy. Because we were telling people, don't  congregate. Don't get all together.   They were trying to keep kids out of school whose HVAC systems,  heating, ventilating systems were not up to date and couldn't transfer  the air in a clean, healthy way.   So we gave them billions of dollars. Yes, we spent a lot of money to  make our people safe, to get people back to work, to get kids back in  school, and it worked. They are back in school.   None of us are wearing a mask. We congregate now. We all get  together. Hardly anybody, if anybody, some people who have particular  vulnerabilities are wearing masks. God bless them. It worked, and the  Republicans voted ``no.''                                time  1630    Now, I want to go to this energy issue because they are Johnny-one- note. Inflation is caused by administration policy on inflation, gas  prices, and energy production. But the fact of the matter is he ignores  that inflation is happening in a lot of places.   Mr. Speaker, in Denmark, they are pretty energy independent with  renewable energies and not relying on supply chains per se. Their  inflation is higher than ours because it was a global phenomenon. Their  economies were assaulted. Ours came back faster and better.   Why? Because we invested in our people.   Now, let me go to a simple fact. According to the U.S. Energy  Information Administration, average production--that means over 4 years  for Trump--for Donald Trump was 10,968,000 barrels per day; for Joe  Biden it was 11,185,000 barrels a day. That is more, not less, than the  average under Donald Trump. But it serves their political interest, Mr.  Speaker, to somehow project to the American people that Biden has shut  down the energy industry which is why you are paying more.   I explained that the energy companies did, in fact, cut production.  It was a rational business judgment. People were driving less and  buying less petroleum.   There is still concern. Most of them are seeing that there is going  to be an alternative energy that is going to be required if we are  going to make sure that this globe does not burn up with the people  with it.   He also says--I don't have the report in front of me, so I am going  to wing it--that no one earning under $400,000 per year got a tax  increase as a result of the bill the gentleman alludes to.   If CBO says--and I will read the report--that $20 billion is going to  be received from that category, it will be because somebody, whether  they are making $100,000, $200,000, $300,000, or $400,000, is not  paying their fair share pursuant to laws that we adopt--not because we  put new taxes on them but because they are not paying the taxes that  are due.   I don't have the CBO report in front of me, so I am opining because  it certainly wasn't because we have new enforcement officers, unless  those enforcement officers find that the people to which the gentleman  refers are not paying their fair share.   By the way, it will also apply to the people who are making billions  and not paying any taxes, much less their fair share.   Let me repeat that energy figure again because I think he will  probably go back to energy because that is what we do almost every  colloquy. More energy is being produced under Joe Biden than was  produced under Donald Trump.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I think  we are probably pretty close to closing.   I would say this, Mr. Speaker. I think the American people are in the  process of making a judgment. On our side, we see things as pretty  positive in terms of the response to the policies that we have been  adopting without any significant help from our Republican colleagues,  but they will have a chance to vote and decide.   We have passed legislation, as we said we would do, for the people-- not for the sake of politics but for the sake of children, families,  the young and old, and, yes, even the rich and poor.   I want to comment because I urge my Republican friends to be precise  in their conversations with the American public. There are not 80,000  revenue auditors or agents included in this bill that we talked about  on bringing inflation down and which economists say will bring  inflation down.   Our Republican friends say they want to do that, but they vote  against bills that will bring down demonstrably, and without  possibility of denial, costs for people, health costs for people,  prescription drug costs for people, insulin, which costs about--it  is single figures, and we capped it at $35. That is about 400 percent  profit, but they are now paying $300 or $400 or $500.    Now, luckily, because we could pass it with Democrats, seniors won't  be paying that. They will be capped at $35. But millions of other  Americans, because the Republicans would not support it in the United  States Senate--we passed it here--will not get the benefit of that cap.  They will be paying far above justifiable prices for insulin.  [[Page H7868]]    We are producing energy. The argument is specious that somehow this  inflation is caused by our cutting back on energy supply when I just  read a figure, subject to dispute. Maybe next week I will hear, no,  that figure is wrong. Maybe. We are producing more energy than Trump  did--not Trump himself, but the country--during Trump's Presidency.   I urge, Mr. Speaker, my Republican friends to tell the American  people the truth. Yes, there are some more agents because there are  people not paying their fair share. If you have an audit, and they say  you are not paying your fair share, and you pay more, isn't that what  we expect when we pass tax bills, that people will pay pursuant to what  the law says, whether they make $100,000 or $100 million or $100  billion? I don't guess anybody makes $100 billion in a year.   We ought to be honest with the American people. Give them the facts,  and then they will make a decision, but tell them the truth.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, there are 80,000-plus additional, which will  get back to the 20 years ago level of employment in the IRS. The IRS  has been reduced in personnel in all categories, not just enforcement  agents, but in all categories, which will undermine their ability to  serve the public and collect taxes so that we all pay our fair share  and so people who don't have accountants and who don't have ways and  means to avoid taxes are treated fairly themselves.   Everybody ought to be treated fairly. If we don't think they are  being treated fairly because of the law then we ought to change the  law, but we ought to tell the American people the truth.   There are not that many enforcement agents. They are in so many  different categories in the IRS to make sure that the IRS can  successfully do its job and answer people's questions about what, when,  where, and why they have to do things pursuant to law. That is what I  meant, not that the 80,000 people are enforcement agents. They are not.  They are not. It is a far lower number than that.   But we know that there is over $100 billion--I think it is a much  larger figure than that--in taxes that are owed under the law that are  not being paid, which means that the tax rates need to be higher on  others than they ought to be.   That is what this bill gets at. In other words, this bill, the  inflation reduction bill, is more than reducing inflation. I am sorry  that my Republican friends made a determination it was not a bill they  could support to help bring down inflation, but that was the judgment  they made.   I think they want to bring down inflation. We want to bring down  inflation, but when we present a bill to the floor which does it, we  would hope we would get support on a bipartisan basis.
