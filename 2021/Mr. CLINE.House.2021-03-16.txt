 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California, my  friend, for his work on this issue, and I thank the chairman for his  work on this issue and their great leadership on this important  initiative.   Madam Speaker, in 2010, the National Bankruptcy Conference Small  Business Working Group released and presented to Congress a report that  identified a problem regarding small businesses and the bankruptcy law,  and recommended amendments to the code to add a new chapter for small  business reorganizations.   As a result of this recommendation, I introduced the Small Business  Reorganization Act, which was signed into law in August of 2019, and I  am pleased to say it has been a great success for small businesses.   It is my understanding that 80 percent of small business debtors have  chosen to proceed under subchapter V, and preliminary data indicates  that these cases are achieving confirmation far more often than small  businesses who filed prior to SBRA.   However, the Small Business Reorganization Act implemented only a  month before the COVID-19 pandemic caused the State-mandated temporary  closure of thousands of businesses.                                time  1615    Seeing the need to ensure that this new lifeline would be even more  impactful, the CARES Act passed in March 2020 increased the amount of  debt a business can have to be eligible for small business bankruptcy  procedures from $2.7 million to $7.5 million and allowed debtors  experiencing hardship because of COVID-19 to modify bankruptcy  reorganization plans entered into before the law was enacted.   I have heard from bankruptcy judges and lawyers in the Western  District of Virginia who have said that their experience with the Small  Business Reorganization Act has been extremely positive. According to  the American Bankruptcy Institute, as of last Sunday, 1,651 cases have  been filed.   In addition, according to the Federal Judicial Center's Integrated  Database, as of September 30, 2020, there were 759 subchapter V cases  filed in the 6 months from the time the debt limit was raised to the  end of fiscal year 2020, with information on liabilities available for  548 of these cases. Of those, 28 percent involved debtors whose  liabilities exceeded the original limit of $2.7 million. These debtors  would not have been eligible for subchapter V without the temporary  increase provided by the CARES Act.   Without this bill to keep the debt limit at $7.5 million for another  year while we continue to navigate this pandemic, about 30 percent of  businesses that would choose to use it would no longer be eligible.   Preservation of the business benefits both the creditor, which should  receive a higher recovery because of the debtor's restructuring than  they would if the business liquidated, and the debtor, who will now be  able to remain in business rather than liquidating.   Our districts depend on their small businesses. They are hotels,  convenience stores, restaurants, and pharmacies. Those who endeavor to  open and run a small business are proud of their work and their  standing in our communities.   Unfortunately, they also take on a sometimes-insurmountable financial  burden. As we have seen over the last year, when they are forced to  close, it has a great impact on the rest of us. That is why the year- end spending and relief package omitted recovery rebate payments from  bankruptcy estates and blocked utilities from stopping or denying  service to some individuals in bankruptcy. This bill would extend those  provisions by 3 months but wouldn't affect other provisions in that law  that are already scheduled to expire later in 2022.   I am proud to have introduced this legislation along with Chairman  Nadler to support our small businesses and our families, and I urge its  passage.
