 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the  majority of the minors who become pregnant tell their parents about the  pregnancy even when they plan to seek an abortion. But it is not always  possible or even advisable that a parent be informed. For some minors,  telling their parents that they were sexually active, let alone  pregnant, can lead to physical abuse. It can lead to those minors being  thrown out of their homes. One study found that 45 percent of young  people who did not seek advice from their parents about a pregnancy  experienced significant negative consequences--such as punishment,  abuse, being forced out of their home--when their parents found out.   By requiring that parents of minors seeking an abortion be notified  and setting the bar for an exception to this rule at a nearly  insurmountable level, this bill ignores this reality of what might  happen to these young people. In doing so, it turns an already  difficult decision for a young person into an almost impossible one. It  puts minors' health and safety at risk while doing nothing to  strengthen families.   This is made clear by the fact that all of the major medical  organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American  Academy of Pediatrics, the Society for Adolescent Medicine, the  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American  Public Health Association--all of these groups oppose laws like this  one that mandate parental involvement in minors' abortion decisions.   Let's be clear. This is yet another partisan attack on a woman's  constitutionally-protected right to choose. It is completely  unnecessary and distracts from the important work the Senate is doing  right now to deliver urgently needed COVID relief.   For these reasons, I object.
