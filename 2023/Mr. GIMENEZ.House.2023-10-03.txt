 Mr. Speaker, I stand before my colleagues and the Nation  as a proud Representative of the great State of Florida. I truly am  beyond blessed to represent the paradise that is Miami-Dade County and  the Florida Keys. I am beyond proud to represent my community before  this Congress, to stand with a leader who has consistently demonstrated  an unwavering commitment to our country and to the principles that  define us as Americans, Kevin McCarthy.   Today is historic for a lot of reasons. For one thing, this is the  first time in over 100 years that this has been attempted, but it is  also because we are part of a Congress with historically tight  majorities for the Republicans in the House and the Democrats in the  Senate, and we have a Democratic White House. Divided government is  what we have.   The need to negotiate to find solutions to the issues facing this  country, that is a reflection of the principles that are uniquely  American, principles that make this country exceptional. They are  principles that allowed me, an exile who came here from Cuba, fleeing  Communist Cuba, to serve in this very institution.   I wasn't born here, but everything that I am, everything that I ever  will be, is thanks to America. The best part about it is that my story,  the story of the community I am so proud to represent, and the story of  many in this body is that we are not the exception in America. We are  the rule. That is the America that Kevin McCarthy has fought for his  entire career. Kevin McCarthy is a champion for the American Dream, and  he has proved it as our Speaker.   Thomas Jefferson once said: I predict future happiness for Americans  if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the  people under the guise of taking care of them.   Let's keep Kevin McCarthy as our Speaker. He is a great man, a great  leader, and a great Speaker.
