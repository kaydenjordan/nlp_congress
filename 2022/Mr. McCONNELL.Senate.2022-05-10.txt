 Mr. President, this all-Democratic government has  managed a unique kind of economic turnaround. They took an economy that  was ready to soar, turned it around, and drove it into the ground.  American families are being crushed by 8.5 percent inflation.  Democrats' policies have unleashed the worst inflation in more than 40  years.   Last March, the Senate Democratic leader said:         I do not think the dangers of inflation . . . are very       real.    At that time, the most recent inflation figure was 1.7 percent.  Inflation has more than quadrupled since Leader Schumer said he wasn't  worried.   Now, remember, the same Democrats predicted the Republicans' 2017 tax  reform bill would harm the economy and hurt working people. Instead,  what it produced is the best economic moment for American workers in  modern history. Falling unemployment, low inflation, and wages grew  faster for the bottom 25 percent of earners than for the top.   So Democrats' worldview has been proven absolutely wrong. But, of  course, last year, they put it into action anyway. Democrats dumped $2  trillion on a recovering economy and paid people a bonus to stay home  from work, even after vaccines were available, and the American people  are hurting as a result.   American workers' real average weekly earnings declined 3.6 percent  over the last year. Inflation has more than wiped out the average  worker's wage gains. President Biden has handed the average American a  big pay cut--a pay cut.   The cost of the essentials that families need have been skyrocketing.  Gas prices are now the highest they have ever been in American  history--ever. Americans are now paying roughly $4.40 per gallon. That  is up about 2 whole dollars from when President Biden put his hand on  the Bible. Grocery prices have shot up 10 percent  [[Page S2387]]  over the past year. Housing costs are up more than 6 percent. Clothing  is up nearly 7 percent. Each category is the worst it has been since at  least the early 1980s.   Remember, if and when the inflation rate begins to gradually slow,  that does not mean all of these sky-high prices for goods and services  will actually fall back down. In many cases, this painful and  preventable inflation will be baked into prices going forward. These  Democratic price hikes will likely be American families' new normal at  the checkout counter, a permanent--permanent--direct result of their  failed policies.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a different matter, this week,  our colleagues want a second run on some controversial nominees who  stalled out last month.   Today, Senate Democrats will try again to confirm Professor Lisa Cook  to the Federal Reserve Board. Professor Cook has no proven expertise in  monetary economics at all, much less fighting inflation. One of her  main supposed qualifications for this position is that she sits on the  regional Fed Board in Chicago. The problem is, she was literally  appointed to that position a few days before she was nominated for this  one.    Professor Cook is a proven partisan who has promoted leftwing  conspiracy theories and called for a fellow academic to be fired  because that person did not support defunding the police. The American  people deserve an independent, nonpartisan inflation fighter for this  important post.   Likewise, the Federal Trade Commission is an important Agency that  gets wide latitude to oversee our private sector. The American people  need its Commissioners to be levelheaded experts who will put aside  ideological ax-grinding.   The two current Commissioners who were appointed by a Republican  President were so qualified and uncontroversial, the Senate approved  each of them on a voice vote. But to serve as their newest colleague,  President Biden has picked a radical partisan named Alvaro Bedoya.   Mr. Bedoya is such a poor fit that the first time Leader Schumer  tried to shut down debate on his nomination, he lacked the votes and  had to call it off. But Democrats want this hardcore partisan confirmed  very badly, so here we are once again.   Mr. Bedoya has publicly attacked police and law enforcement and  demanded that our country not enforce--not enforce--our immigration  laws. He has called for States to essentially nullify Federal  immigration law, saying:         Maryland police have no business working with ICE [and] I       think it's high time that state legislators understand that       they can do something about this.    He has volunteered statements that align with ``defund the police,''  demanding that none of the Democrats' trillions in stimulus waste  should go to provide for law enforcement.   Mr. Bedoya's social media feeds have read like the rantings of a far- left activist with no aspiration to ever receive Senate confirmation.   He has embraced socialized medicine, critical race theory, and  cracking down on citizens' Second Amendment rights. He has launched  political attacks on current Senators and called the National  Republican Party Convention a--listen to this--``White supremacist  rally''--a ``White supremacist rally,'' the Republican National  Convention.   The rabid partisanship is not just an extracurricular activity. We  know Mr. Bedoya would apply it specifically to the work of the FTC. He  is already on the record calling for the elimination of longstanding  bipartisan FTC policy statements. He supports excluding minority party  Commissioners from investigations.   This nominee would not be fit to neutrally oversee major economic  decisions, no matter what the makeup of the Senate was. But he is an  essentially foolish choice--foolish--when the American people handed  this administration a 50-50 Senate.   I would urge my colleagues on both sides to stop this awful  nomination so the President can reconsider and send us somebody  suitable.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
