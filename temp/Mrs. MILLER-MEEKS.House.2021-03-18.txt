 Mr. Speaker, I was going to ask for 1 minute  yesterday, given that it was St. Patrick's Day and Pella High School  Dutch's  [[Page H1507]]  color is green, but they are the Pella Dutch, not the Pella Irish.   Last Friday, the Pella High School Dutch of Marion County, Iowa,  successfully completed their playoff run by winning the 3A Iowa boys  basketball championship.   Capping off a terrific 26-2 season with a 15-1 conference record, the  Dutch brought home the State championship for the first time in 18  years.   The achievement of winning a State title itself is something of which  the Dutch team and the Pella community should be proud, but these  players and their families should be even more proud of their  commitment to the game, perseverance, sportsmanship and teamwork that  guided them through this incredible season.   For the seniors, I hope you continue to follow your passions, in  basketball and elsewhere beyond high school. For the juniors and  underclassmen, I wish you the best of luck in the coming years, both on  and off the court.   Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled for this team, the coaching staff, fans,  and the entire Pella community, and I am honored to represent them in  Congress, and speak about them on the House floor.                            ____________________
