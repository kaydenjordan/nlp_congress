 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the  horrific anti-Asian American sentiment that has been brewing in our  country.   Like all of you, I was heartbroken by this week's shooting in  Georgia. This violent act of hate has no place in our country. While  this tragedy deserves all our outrage and attention, it is important to  remember that this was not an isolated incident.   COVID-19 has worsened the racism and xenophobia our AAPI brothers and  sisters face. Many elected officials have used the pandemic to fan the  flames of hate, and now they refuse to accept the consequences of their  actions.   My district is home to over 10,000 Asian Americans. They make our  community whole, and they do not deserve to live in fear because of  hateful rhetoric that has spread across America.   As President Biden has said, violence against Asian Americans is un- American, and it must stop.                            ____________________
