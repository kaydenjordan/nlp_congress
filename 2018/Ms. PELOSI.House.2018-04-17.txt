 Mr. Speaker, I think this may have happened to me at the  funeral as well when I followed  John Lewis at the podium. What a task.  I thank the gentleman for being such an inspiration and thank him for  loving Louise so much as we know she loved Brother John as well.   Aren't we proud of Paul Tonko and his relationship with Louise, a  friendship that goes back to the State legislature many years ago in  New York.   Louise came 31 years ago to the Congress. He came more recently, but  his  [[Page H3387]]  friendship goes back longer. So dear was he to her.   So here we have Louise--and I don't have a magic minute, so this is  not an 8-hour proposition in high heels, although I would love to do  that for Louise any time--but let me just make some wishes. I wish you  could have all been in Rochester for Louise's memorial service to hear  her grandchildren talk about her.   As a grandmother myself, and any time I go to a service now, I think:  What do the grandchildren think? What do they know about their  grandmother? Do they know how much their grandmother loved them?  Louise's grandchildren do and did. Hopefully we will be hearing more  from them.                                time  1815    They spoke magnificently about her personally--not so great about her  cooking, not that day anyway. But, anyway, they just loved her so much.   She was about the future, but she had a tremendous respect for the  past as well. So when many of us, Brother John, visited her in  Rochester, we would go to Susan B. Anthony's home to see where so much  of women's rights began. She would take us across the borderline of the  district to see where it all began at Seneca Falls. She took such  ownership of our suffragettes and her responsibility to carry forth  their courage and their possibilities for the future.   She was a Southern belle with a Southern charm and a Northern  timetable. So you never wanted to waste too much time not giving in to  Louise because eventually she would have her way. Save yourself some  time: Whatever you say, Louise.   She was a beautiful person to serve with. Many of our colleagues want  to speak about her. I will have another opportunity tomorrow, but I did  want to add my voice, once again, to our colleagues', as we speak about  her with great respect, admiration, and affection that is about Louise  Slaughter.
