 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding; and I  thank him, and the Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee,  for being committed to the truth: to the facts.   To hear the distinguished chairman of the committee say what he said  about the budget is almost ludicrous, almost laughable, if it weren't  so serious, in terms of the impact that it has on America's future. He  knows that, in the last 4, and maybe even 5, years of the Clinton  administration, the budget was in balance or in surplus--the  operational budget--and it was on a path to reducing the national debt,  until President Bush came in, gave tax cuts to the high end, a giveaway  to the pharmaceutical industry with the Medicare part D legislation,  and three unpaid for wars.   That is what the experts will tell you increased the deficit that was  on a path of the national debt going down. It was a swing, Mr. Speaker,  of $11 trillion: to date, the biggest swing in history.   When President Obama came into office, he was inheriting a deficit--I  am not talking about the national debt; I am just talking about the  annual deficit--of $1.4 billion. When he left office, it was about a  third of that.   So don't try to mislead the American people. We owe them the truth.  We owe them facts. That is why what is happening tonight in this body  is so important: the violence that the Republicans are doing with their  legislation on the economy of our country, robbing from our children's  future to reward the wealthiest people and biggest corporations in  America.   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to ask my colleagues a simple question:  Who do we represent when we come to this floor?   The American people, overwhelmingly, oppose the GOP tax scam--they  see it as that--and they are making their voices heard.   The American people are calling the Republican Congress to abandon  the House and Senate bills, which pillage the middle class and pad the  pockets of big CEOs and GOP donors.   The American people want us to start over and, actually, put the  middle class first.   We should be working in a bipartisan way in order to do that, so that  it will not only be right, but that it will be sustainable, and that  there will be some certainty in our economy that this is a path forward  that has bipartisan support.   But have the Republicans in the people's House listened to the  American people? No.  [[Page H9610]]    Last month, House Republicans voted to raise taxes. In this House,  House Republicans voted to raise taxes on 36 million middle class  American families: stripping deductions from students and teachers,  children and seniors, and homeowners and workers. They kept saying they  were going to work it out with the Senate.   Last week, in the dead of night, Senate Republicans voted to raise  taxes on 78 million middle class families, while also spiking health  premiums, and exploding the ranks of the health uninsured.   Tonight, heading into this conference on the House and Senate bills,  Republicans have sent an unmistakable message to middle class America:  Pick your poison. Because, with either bill, middle class families  lose; the American people lose.   According to an analysis by The Washington Post, the GOP tax scam is  ``probably the most regressive tax cut in the past 50 years. . . . It  is hard to find a tax plan that has done less for the middle class.''   That is what we talked about. Who are we here to represent? Why are  they doing this?   Well, they are doing this to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent.  Sixty-two percent of the benefits of the Senate bill go to the top 1  percent in our country.   Is that fair, to give nearly $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to corporate  America, while heaping other benefits on them to make it easier for  them to send jobs overseas. Why? Well, some of their people have told  us why.   Congressman Chris Collins said: My donors are basically saying, ``Get  it done or don't ever call me again.''   Senator Lindsey Graham has said the ``financial contributions will  stop,'' if the tax scam fails. ``Scam'' is my added word.   The Director of National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, has said: ``The  most excited group out there are the big CEOs, about our tax plan.''   This is interesting to see the Freedom Caucus, which I thought was a  values-based caucus, committed to reducing the national debt: a debt  that is being added to here that we may never recover from.   What happened to the Freedom Caucus? Weren't they supposed to be  deficit hawks? Has that become an endangered species? No. It has become  extinct. It does not exist on the Republican side, but it does exist on  the Democratic side.                                time  2015    We intend to fight this robbing of the future of increasing the  deficit into the trillions of dollars by fighting this bill to the end.   Where are all the Republicans who promised to reduce the deficit?   Where are our Republican colleagues who insist that we have no funds  to spare for the healthcare of our children, the education of our young  people, the job-creating infrastructure of the 21st century unless we  find offsets?   Yet $1.5 trillion to corporate America, un-offset; tax cuts to the  wealthiest people in our country, un-offset.   That means children have to pay for their healthcare with their  immunizations. It is absolutely appalling. It isn't a statement of  values in any way.   Today, quietly, the Republicans--and some of them are admitting it  with glee--are sharpening their knives for Medicare, Medicaid, and  Social Security. Recognizing how they are increasing, they are soaring  the national debt, now they have to find some ways to pay for it, so  they are coming after Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The  understanding of some is that it is only a question of whether they do  it this year or a following year after the election.   Well, I think you are in a lose-lose situation. I think you lose with  your donors if you don't pass this bill, but you are going to lose with  the American people if you do.   Democrats believe that people deserve better. We deserve  bipartisanship in how we put this together so it is sustainable. We are  offering a better deal, better jobs, better wages, and a better future.   The American people deserve real, bipartisan, permanent tax reform  that puts the middle class first.   The truth is that our colleagues either choose to ignore or do not  understand the gravity of the situation. As they say in ``The Music  Man,'' this is a terrible assault on the middle class. So tonight, with  the Democrats' motion to instruct conferees, we want the Republicans to  show where they stand.   Will Republicans vote ``yes'' to protect the vital State and local  tax deduction that enables people to live in a safe place? Or will they  vote to double-tax middle class families, drive down home values, and  endangering key funding for firefighters, law enforcement, and schools?   Will Republicans vote to protect the healthcare of those with  preexisting conditions?   No, no, no, no, no.   Or will they vote to spike families' premiums and add 13 million more  Americans to the ranks of the uninsured if this bill goes through?   I have said that this, with stiff competition by some of the other  things they have put forth, is the worst bill in the history of the  United States Congress.   Now, how can I make that claim?   Well, because it involves more money, hurts more people, increases  the deficit by so much more. And just because everything is bigger in  our country, the consequences of this bill, a multitrillion-dollar  economy being addressed by a bill that had no hearings, no expert  testimony, just with the speed of light, as Jamie Raskin says, the  speed of light, in the dark of night, here we are.   Who else thinks this is not a good idea?   This is what the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has  said: `` . . . this proposal appears to be the first Federal income tax  modification in American history that will raise income taxes on the  working poor while simultaneously providing a large tax cut to the  wealthy. This is simply unconscionable.''   I believe them.   Let us remember the words of St. Augustine: ``A State which is not  governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves.'' He  said that 17 centuries ago.   When His Holiness Pope Benedict wrote about this in his first  encyclical, God is Love, he went on to say: Sometimes you have to work  hard to determine what justice is. But in doing so, you must beware of  the dazzling blindness of money and power.   Apparently, you did not heed that.   Let us look honestly at the GOP tax scam before us. No justice.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on  the motion to instruct conferees, to at least inject some element of  fairness and common sense into this destruction, and then to reject  this terrible bill.
