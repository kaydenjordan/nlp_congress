 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.   David Scott) for  introducing this bill, which has been bipartisan for several  Congresses.   According to data from the FDIC's survey of unbanked and underbanked  households, 5.4 percent of U.S. households were unbanked in 2019. This  means no one in the household had a checking or savings account. This  translates, Madam Speaker, into 7.1 million American households that  don't have that simple, straightforward needed access to a checking or  savings account.   While this is the lowest percentage rate since the FDIC began  conducting that survey back in 2009, the number of  [[Page H2451]]  unbanked and underbanked families is still disturbing.   These statistics point to a staggering number of Americans who have  limited or no access to traditional banking services. When I was in  community banking before coming to Congress, there was nothing more  empowering than having connection to and access to that financial  system so that you can save for college, buy a home, acquire that first  car that you have dreamed of, or just conduct your household's  financing.   So, over the years in Congress, I have supported efforts to improve  financial literacy, particularly with my friend, Dr. Foster. As a  banker, I certainly worked with volunteers, helping families understand  the financial system and how they could have banking access. This is a  key issue that both the private sector and the public sector work on,  on a regular basis.   Mr. Scott has suggested that the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau's Office of Community Affairs continue to engage in these  efforts and examine how to improve this situation.   The Office of Community Affairs also partnered with the CFPB's Office  of Research and the Office of Fair Lending to examine credit deserts,  where we don't even have access to financial services, and better equip  communities with the tools for financial education.   Additionally, the Bureau's Your Money, Your Goals program offers a  variety of materials to help consumers pursue financial empowerment and  resources for organizations aimed at helping financially vulnerable  individuals and families.   This is a key issue and, particularly in my rural State, a bigger  challenge for rural counties, as we have some counties without a single  financial services office.   Despite the progress that has been made, credit invisibility remains  an important issue, especially given the pandemic's impact on American  consumers.   By further directing the CFPB's Office of Community Affairs to focus  its work on the underserved, we are working to ensure those consumers  are not overlooked.   This bill reaffirms our goal in understanding credit invisibility and  identifying better solutions to deliver resources.   All Americans deserve access to basic financial tools that will help  them achieve their financial independence, their pursuit of happiness.  This bill takes an important step in promoting financial inclusion and  providing access to all Americans.   I thank my good friend from Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), who is  approaching the microphone, for his work on this bill, and I thank my  friend, Mr. Cleaver, for leading today. I urge my colleagues to support  the Financial Inclusion in Banking Act, and I reserve the balance of my  time.     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a distinguished member of the House  Financial Services Committee and, as of today, the ranking member on  our Fintech Task Force.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson). He spoke to this issue of fintech, which I think is very  important and has the ability to actually open up doors for underbanked  families and unbanked families at a lower cost and a more accessible  way through smart technology. I think that is going to be important.   I thank, again, my friend from Georgia for his work on financial  literacy. As a great Wharton graduate, he knows a lot about financial  literacy, and I am proud that he shares it with all of our citizens and  families across the country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 707, the Ghost Army  Congressional Gold Medal Act.   I thank my friend from New Hampshire, Congresswoman Kuster, for  proposing it. I appreciate my good friend from Utah, Mr. Stewart, for  cosponsoring and helping bring this to the floor today on a bipartisan  basis.   Sun Tzu, in ``The Art of War,'' stated: ``All warfare is based on  deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when  using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must  make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him  believe we are near.''   That was the philosophy that led to the formation of the 23d  Headquarters, Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company,  known as the Ghost Army.   H.R. 707 will award a Congressional Gold Medal to the U.S. Army's 23d  Headquarters, Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company to  honor their bravery displayed during World War II.   The Ghost Army, unlike many other units, was comprised, as my friend  from Missouri said, of civilian soldiers who had a proclivity for art,  architecture, acting, set design, and engineering. During World War II,  the 23d Headquarters Special Troops successfully tricked German forces  into believing that 1,000 soldiers were a massive force of over 30,000,  and they were able to put on 22 large-scale deceptions in Europe during  World War II.   Madam Speaker, now, this is an example where both sides of the aisle  can agree that fake news can be good.   They did this by using inflatable tanks, aircraft, and speakers  broadcasting the sounds of men and military that were not there. The  unit was able to pull German attention on these areas and away from the  Allied force operations. This army, these men and women, are credited  for saving thousands of lives.   Madam Speaker, one of those might have been my father-in-law, who was  in Patton's 8th Army as an engineering officer, trudging across from D- day to Germany. So we are all grateful, all of the descendants of those  who served on the beaches and on the continent of Europe at the end of  the war.   Madam Speaker, I am a history buff as well, and anybody who has  watched The History Channel's World War II documentary has undoubtedly  seen the Ghost Army in action. The historic videos and Herculean photo  of four men holding a tank over their heads is testimony to the Ghost  Army's ingenuity and bravery in the World War.   Madam Speaker, the Ghost Army of World War II deserves to be  commended in this way, and I thank my friends from New Hampshire and  Utah for their work.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Stewart), the cosponsor of this important legislation to recognize  the Ghost Army.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Utah for his important closing  words to support this important bill, H.R. 707.   What better tribute to those families of the 1,000 who served in the  Ghost Army, and those 11 who we still celebrate as being alive with us  today than the recognition they deserve, because those 1,000 saved the  lives of thousands more in the Allied force as we completed our task of  ridding Europe of fascism.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends from Utah and New Hampshire for their  leadership on this bill. I thank Chairman Cleaver today for guiding our  debate, and I encourage everyone in the House to support H.R. 707.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3146, the Securing  America's Vaccines for Emergencies Act, the SAVE Act. I want to thank  my friend from California, Juan Vargas, a colleague on the House  Financial Services Committee, for our collaboration on looking at the  Defense Production Act--we are going to talk about it today--and how we  could improve it for better preparing the United States for a global  pandemic.   The SAVE Act amends that Defense Production Act to protect medical  supplies for Americans by bolstering our supply chain during times of  crisis. The Defense Production Act, as my friend, Mr. Cleaver, noted,  was first signed into law by President Truman in 1950 in response to a  shortage of materials during the Korean conflict.   Designed to incentivize production, avoid inflation, and, as I say,  boost goods critical for the national defense, the DPA successfully  brought American manufacturing to the forefront at the battle at hand  at that time.   Initially, the Defense Production Act, as you can tell by its name,  was used in response for military needs, but over time the United  States Congress has expanded it to other areas considered essential to  national defense, and those include critical responses to national  emergencies.   When President Truman signed the DPA, he shared: It is your fight,  the fight of all of us, and it can be won only if all of us in the  fight can fight it together. At that time, he was saying that in  response to the Korean conflict, but this quote still resonates with us  now the same way as it did so long ago.   A little over a year ago, our country faced another nationwide crisis  that called on the need for the Defense Production Act to be placed in  the American spotlight. In response to a global health crisis, America  experienced shortages of necessary medical supplies, basically  overnight.   Supply chains were tested like never before, and it became  increasingly clear that America needed to do something different in  order to respond to the alarming increase in demand for medical gloves,  N95 masks, and ventilators.   In my home State of Arkansas, our hospitals had medical materials  stacked from floor to ceiling stamped ``Made in China.'' And much of  those supplies, Mr. Speaker, in the PPE category ended up rejected and  put in a dumpster because they did not meet the quality standards; they  were out of compliance.   Our national and State emergency stockpiles were prepared for a  localized outbreak, not a national 50-State pandemic. Fortunately,  President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act, which allowed for  greater domestic manufacturing of these necessary medical supplies. And  while that was taking effect, the hospitals and our great Arkansas  business, academic, and medical community banded together to be able to  coordinate critical supply purchases, and even locally, manufacture  badly needed face shields to protect patients and health professionals  alike.   Even more alarming than the lack of supplies might be our reliance on  countries, particularly China, for basic pharmaceutical components. Our  Nation must develop a strategy to diversify our supply chain to ensure  that we are not in that same short supply situation in the future. In  my view, last spring, Mr. Speaker, we were caught without such critical  planning.   That is why I introduced the SAVE Act in April of last year when we  were first responding to these challenges, and I am pleased to have  reintroduced it this year with my friend and colleague, Congressman  Vargas. This bill amends the DPA to ensure that medical materials are  within that Defense Production Act scope.    While all of us hope that we are nearing the finish line of COVID-19,  we cannot forget about the shortages that we once faced, because the  reality is, unfortunately, perhaps likely, this country will face the  same situation again.   This bill allows us to be better prepared for that future, whether it  be in the short, medium, or long run. It will allow us to diversify  supply chains that are required for our national defense. It will  permit the United States to be less reliant on foreign countries like  China for critical PPE or, most importantly, pharmaceutical ingredients  or other medical products.   The SAVE Act requires a national strategy and progress reports on the  diversification of that essential medical supply chain. At the same  time, it makes explicit that our strategy needs to take into account  cooperation with our allies. We must maintain a strong trading  environment that fosters continued innovation. Making critical supply  chains more resilient doesn't mean closing ourselves off from our  friends around the world in partnership on these important items.   Just to cite one example, Mr. Speaker, the Pfizer vaccine against  COVID-19 consists of 280 components sourced from 86 sites across 19  countries. International cooperation makes treatments like this  possible. But we must ensure these items don't fall under the exclusive  control of an adversary. My legislation will help prevent that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support the SAVE Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California, Mr. Vargas. We will  be talking about this when we discuss his bill in a few minutes. We  have collaborated on this, and it is about planning, it is about a  strategy, it is about not being caught at low tide with no bathing  suit, and that is what this country needs is a better strategy.   President Bush warned us of that after he studied this issue when he  was President. The stockpiles are important. Our FEMA planning is  important. But our medical supply chain and those critical components  are critical to the health and safety of our country. It is critical to  our ability to defend ourselves, and hence, an appropriate amendment to  the Defense Production Act.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on  both sides of the aisle, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3125, sponsored by my friend  from California (Mr. Vargas).   His legislation would help strengthen the oversight over this issue  that we are discussing today of using the Defense Production Act's  authorities during this COVID-19 pandemic. It also would help  streamline the use of those authorities so that we ensure that the  Federal Government's response is coordinated effectively with State-led  efforts.   I was proud to cosponsor this bill with my friend from California. I  think every Member of this House recognized that coordination challenge  during the emergency, and it was challenging in some of our States to  see surplus of supply in some States and not in others.   So Mr. Vargas has attempted to focus in during the pandemic on  enhancing that coordination when we are  [[Page H2458]]  using the DPA. That coordination effort would work with private  suppliers of medical items for more efficient and essential  consideration when the U.S. is facing this kind of a public health  emergency.   Although the U.S. appears to be exiting the pandemic now, DPA  authorities are still in use to address our critical medical needs. We  must be especially vigilant as the coronavirus continues to wreak havoc  abroad, giving rise to potential new variants that the medical  community will have to monitor closely.   Of course, we are all now far more sensitized to the pandemic risks  that may arise with little notice in the future. Mr. Vargas'  legislation provides a blueprint for deploying the DPA more rapidly  should we face a public health emergency in the years ahead, all while  allowing for appropriate, active congressional oversight.   I am happy to cosponsor my friend's legislation. I appreciate the  bipartisan work that we have shared undertaking this item in the House  Financial Services Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank my friend from California  for his attention to this effort, particularly with the Federal  oversight of how the DPA is used; what we can learn in this  extraordinary past year that we have experienced; and how we can be  better prepared not only now as we assess those contracts and the use  of the Defense Production Act in this pandemic, but how we, as I said,  can have a blueprint for the future. I congratulate him for his work  and I appreciate his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3008, the Homebuyer Assistance  Act of 2021, sponsored by my friend from California (Mr. Sherman) and  cosponsored by my colleague from Texas (Mr. Taylor), who are both  superb active members of the Committee on Financial Services here in  the House.   The committee reviewed many of the issues faced by the appraisal  industry. There were two concerns heard loud and clear from the  witnesses: the prolonged backlog for appraisals and the decreased  quality in appraisals used in transactions involving loans insured by  the Federal Housing Administration, the FHA.   H.R. 3008 addresses these concerns in two ways. First, the bill  amends current law to expand the pool of appraisers eligible to  participate in FHA-insured transactions from being just certified  appraisers to include both certified and licensed appraisers.   Additionally, the bill addresses the different training requirements  that each must meet. Currently, certified appraisers must have 1,500  hours of supervised experience without any property value or complexity  restrictions. Licensed appraisers need only 1,000 hours of supervised  experience, and there are some property value or complexity  restrictions on licensed appraisers.   So H.R. 3008 sets minimum trending requirements for both types of  appraisers in FHA transactions. Certified and licensed appraisers must  have at least 7 hours of approved training by The Appraisal Foundation  or their State licensing agency. These changes will help break that  logjam and bring FHA's appraisal rules in line with the current  appraisal rules used by our government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac, in the secondary market and in the conventional  mortgage market.   Moreover, the changes that Mr. Sherman and Mr. Taylor proposed will  help alleviate the appraisal backlog at the FHA and increase the  quality of work being performed. That would benefit both homeowners and  taxpayers alike.   As a former community banker in Arkansas, I understand firsthand how  the appraiser shortage has been a problem in my home State. For  example, in Arkansas, there has been a consistent delay in home  purchases in rural areas because of the increased burdens that this  shortage has brought about. This has created a ripple effect that has  had a negative impact on the economies or in those neighborhoods.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends, Mr. Sherman and Mr. Taylor. I urge  all Members to support this bill; and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), for his hard work on this bill.   I hope that we are able to get it over the finish line and to the  President's desk. I appreciate Senator Thune working on this in the  Senate.   It is an important piece of legislation that will aid, as Mr. Sherman  outlined, first-time home buyers. A majority of this benefit speeds up  that process for the family who is trying to buy their  [[Page H2460]]  first home or a home that is low enough in mortgage size to be insured  by the FHA. This is something we want to do to speed access to the  American Dream for low- to moderate-income families.   I thank Mr. Sherman for his work, and I encourage all of my friends  on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 3008, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, stopping and punishing bad actors for illegal insider  trading is a top priority for House Republicans. This illegal activity  hurts everyday Main Street investors as well as the integrity and  efficiency of our markets. Trading on material insider information in  breach of fiduciary duty is currently prohibited by court-made law  under the antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, and the Department  of Justice have the power to bring insider trading cases, and both  agencies regularly exercise this power.   One body of insider trading law that has been developed is through  the courts. Decades of judicial precedent are in place to protect  investors and markets by punishing bad actors who illegally trade on  insider information.   Codifying nuanced case law and regulations that have been developed  over the decades into a single statute prohibiting insider trading is a  serious undertaking, and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes) has  tackled this challenging task.   To be explicitly clear, this legislation's intent is to codify, and  neither expand nor contract, insider trading law as it is currently  understood and interpreted by the Federal courts.   Again, there should not be a single cause of action available under  this law that would not otherwise be available to Federal prosecutors  or SEC enforcement attorneys under the already existing securities  laws. I underscore this point because both Republican and Democratic  SEC Commissioners have expressed concerns about Congress drafting a  statute that accurately captures this expansive body of law without  expanding it.   I agree with them. I think it would be tough to draft a perfect  insider trading law. But with that said, I appreciate the gentleman  from Connecticut's intentions not to expand the scope of current  insider trading enforcement and his willingness to work with us in a  bipartisan manner last Congress and again in this Congress.   Specifically, Ranking Member Patrick McHenry's amendment last  Congress, included in the base text of this year's provision, provides  the needed changes to align the explicit personal benefit test more  closely with Supreme Court precedent. It also clarifies ambiguous  wording to ensure that judges and prosecutors know that this bill is  not intended to expand or create new insider trading liability.   Republicans will continue to speak out and support efforts to combat  illegal insider trading. We look forward to working with our colleagues  on the House Financial Services Committee and in the Senate, and  I reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Connecticut for his  vigorous defense, always welcome on the House floor, of Article I power  here in the Congress. Both sides of the aisle are grateful for that, as  we defend it on a regular basis. We thank him for his work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Huizenga), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Investor  Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets of the House  Financial Services Committee to speak on the topic of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good debate. Again, I thank my friend  from Michigan and my friend from Connecticut for the quality of that  debate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2655, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Iowa for reintroducing  this bill. There is no doubt that fraudsters and other bad actors have  been out taking advantage of consumers during the pandemic because they  are out taking advantage of consumers every day anyway. Moreover, many  of them are disproportionately targeting seniors.   The Federal Trade Commission, looking over the pandemic, has some  436,000 reports of fraud amounting to some almost $400 million. The  Securities and Exchange Commission has stopped 49 companies from  trading, suspended for concerns over misleading information. The  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB, has gotten almost half  a million complaints.   So this effort among the regulators that Mrs. Axne is proposing in  H.R. 2959 establishes the Consumer and Investor Fraud Working Group.  This working group includes representatives from the CFPB, the SEC, and  is established to help coordinate and share information across the  Federal Government.   The working group will focus on providing resources to consumers and  investors and help them avoid falling victim to the fraudulent schemes  and scams that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic and after.   In addition, the working group will produce a quarterly report to the  House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee.  This will allow Congress to monitor its actions and resources as it is  made public.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Missouri for his  leadership today on these House Financial Services Committee bills. I  appreciate the hard work on a bipartisan basis on these measures. I  have no additional speakers on the Republican side. I urge a ``yes''  vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
