 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nomination: Executive Calendar No. 438, C.B.  Sullenberger III, for the rank of Ambassador during his tenure of  service as Representative of the United States of America on the  Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nomination without intervening action or debate and that if confirmed,  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table,  all without intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in  order to the nomination; that any statements related to the nomination  be printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action.    I yield the floor.
