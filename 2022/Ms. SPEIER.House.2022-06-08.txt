 Madam Speaker, I believe I am the only Member of this  House that is a victim of gun violence. My body is riddled with  bullets. I have a divot in my leg that is the size of a football. I  have skin grafts on all parts of my body. I live with that every single  day.   A victim of gun violence is traumatized over and over again. I  implore my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if we had a 737  that crashed every month for 12 months in this country, we would do  something about it. And that is what is happening to children in this  country.   Madam Speaker, 1,500 kids die of gun violence every single year. We  have to do something about it. All we are saying is don't let them  purchase an assault weapon until they are 21. We already say you can't  purchase a handgun until you are 21. Dr. Guerrero this morning talked  about decapitated heads.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues--I am leaving this institution-- to please do something.
