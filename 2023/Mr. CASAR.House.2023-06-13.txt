 Mr. Speaker, I was here alongside all of you during the  State of the Union when my Republican colleagues stood up and started  jeering, booing, yelling, and complaining saying that indeed, they  weren't interested in cutting Social Security or Medicare. However, in  the weeks since, it has become clear to me that was all talk and no  votes, or as we say in Texas, all hat and no cattle.   In fact, this week the Republican head of appropriations just said  that she wants to see even deeper cuts to critical Federal programs.  That means bigger classroom sizes for our students and our struggling  teachers and longer wait times for our veterans seeking healthcare, all  to finance bigger tax cuts for billionaires and multinational  corporations.   Social Security and Medicare are not safe until we step up and vote  to make sure they are safe. That is why I urge my colleagues to defeat  the previous question so that we can vote for H.R. 178, which would put  our money where our mouth is.   I urge my Republican colleagues to prove me wrong because what we are  planning on voting on this week are things like a ludicrous gas stove  bill of rights.   Are they kidding me?   What we are talking about voting on this week is deregulating gun  accessories that have been used in mass shootings across the country.   Really?   It is disrespectful, it is dangerous, and it is a distortion of our  oath and our job that we have committed to doing here today.   So instead of bowing to the gun lobby, we are passing these ludicrous  messaging bills. Let's work on solving real problems, or, at a minimum,  let's stop these attacks on Social Security and Medicare.
