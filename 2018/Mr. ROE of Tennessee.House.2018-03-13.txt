 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 324) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  improve the provision of adult day health care services for veterans.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                   S. 324         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``State Veterans Home Adult       Day Health Care Improvement Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. PROVISION OF CERTAIN ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE SERVICES                     FOR VETERANS.         (a) In General.--Section 1745 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(d)(1) The Secretary shall enter into an agreement with       each State home for payment by the Secretary for medical       supervision model adult day health care provided to a veteran       described in subsection (a)(1) on whose behalf the State home       is not in receipt of payment for nursing home care from the       Secretary.        ``(2)(A) Payment under each agreement between the Secretary       and a State home under paragraph (1) for each veteran who       receives medical supervision model adult day health care       under such agreement shall be made at a rate established       through regulations prescribed by the Secretary to adequately       reimburse the State home for the care provided by the State       home, including necessary transportation expenses.        ``(B) The Secretary shall consult with the State homes in       prescribing regulations under subparagraph (A).        ``(C) The rate established through regulations under       subparagraph (A) shall not take effect until the date that is       30 days after the date on which those regulations are       published in the Federal Register.        ``(3) Payment by the Secretary under paragraph (1) to a       State home for medical supervision model adult day health       care provided to a veteran described in that paragraph       constitutes payment in full to the State home for such care       furnished to that veteran.        ``(4) In this subsection, the term `medical supervision       model adult day health care' means adult day health care that       includes the coordination of physician services, dental       services, nursing services, the administration of drugs, and       such other requirements as determined appropriate by the       Secretary.''; and        (2) in the section heading, by inserting ``, adult day       health care,'' after ``home care''.        (b) Initial Rate.--Before the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       establishes a payment rate under subsection (d)(2)(A) of       section 1745 of such title, as added by subsection (a), the       Secretary shall pay to a State home that has entered into an       agreement with the Secretary for medical supervision model       adult day health care (as defined in subsection (d)(4) of       such section) an amount equal to 65 percent of the rate the       Secretary would pay under subsection (a)(2) of such section       to the State home for nursing home care provided to the       veteran.        (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 17 of such title is amended by striking       the item relating to section 1745 and inserting the following       new item:  ``1745. Nursing home care, adult day health care, and medications for                veterans with service-connected disabilities.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin today, I would like to take a moment to  express my deepest sympathies to those affected by last week's tragedy  in Yountville, California. I closely followed the situation. I am truly  saddened by what has occurred.   All three employees who lost their lives--Christine Loeber and  Jennifer Golick from the Pathway Home and Jennifer Gonzales from the  Department of Veterans Affairs--were committed to helping veterans  struggling with difficulties like post-traumatic stress disorder and  other mental problems.   As Secretary Shulkin said: ``Caring for veterans and our employees  serving them is always important. It is even more critical that we  reach out to one another and provide support during painful times like  these.''   I think I can speak for myself and the rest of the members on the  House Committee on Veterans' Affairs when I offer prayers and support  during this incredibly difficult and challenging time for these  families.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 324, the State Veterans  Home Adult Day Health Care Improvement Act of 2017. It is imperative  that we ensure that VA is equipped with a variety of geriatric and  long-term care programs to best meet the individual needs and goals of  the increasing number of veterans who are reaching retirement age.   Current law requires VA to cover the cost of nursing home care in a  State Veterans Home for any veteran in need of such care due to a  service-connected disability or with a service-connected disability  rating of 70 percent or more. However, veterans are increasingly  seeking opportunities to get additional care they need as they age  while remaining at home rather than in a nursing care facility or other  institutional setting. S. 324 would help those veterans by requiring VA  to enter into an agreement or a contract with the State Veterans Home  to pay for adult day healthcare for veterans who are eligible but not  receiving nursing home care.   Adult day healthcare programs provide companionship, peer support,  recreation, certain healthcare services, case management assistance  with activities of daily living, and more to veterans, and needed  respite and relief to caregivers. What is more, adult day healthcare  programs are a much less costly alternative to nursing home care,  meaning that, with the enactment of this bill, we could grant veterans  who desire to age at home the opportunity to do so without sacrificing  the care and support services they may need and save taxpayer dollars.   S. 324, which is sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, is  companion legislation to H.R. 1005, which is sponsored by the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin) and passed the House with unanimous support  earlier this year. I am grateful to both of them for their leadership  on this issue, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  S. 324.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), from the Upper Peninsula, chairman of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin), the author of the bill on the House side  and also an Iraq war veteran.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from New York.     Mr. Speaker, unless Mr. Zeldin has talked to my  doctor and knows something I don't know, I hope to be here next year.  That is my plan.   I appreciate the opportunity to work on this bill with him. He has  been a great advocate, as the ranking member has been. This is a bill  that is long overdue, much needed, and I give my strong support along  with--I think I can speak for them--the entire Veterans' Affairs  Committee. We voiced this. I encourage Members to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
