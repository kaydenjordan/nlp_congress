The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito) and the Senator from North Dakota (Mr.  Cramer).    Madam President, last week, Leader McConnell called up a  bill to the floor of the U.S. Senate. It was a coronavirus relief bill,  which included a number of components that both sides had agreed needed  to be in any coronavirus relief bill. It was a targeted bill. It was a  fiscally responsible bill, and it was a bill that was rooted in  reality. In other words, there was a belief that it could be signed  into law if, in fact, it was passed by the Congress.   So, when it was called up, obviously, we talked about the features in  the bill, many of which are things, as I said, enjoyed bipartisan  support. When I said it was fiscally responsible, it actually  repurposed funds from the previous coronavirus relief bill, from the  CARES Act, that had not yet been spent. So it took some of those  dollars, repurposed them, used them in another way, which I think would  be a fiscally responsible way in which to approach the whole issue of  how we spend taxpayer dollars on any issue, including a crisis. So  there was a repurposing that I think, again, represents a fiscally  responsible approach to doing this.   It also addressed the issue of people who were unemployed. It had a  provision in there that allowed people to continue to receive  unemployment insurance above and beyond what their States offered in  terms of the benefits--$300 above that on a per-week basis, which, on  average, represents about an 85-percent wage replacement. So it was  about an 85-percent wage replacement in terms of an unemployment  benefit. It also included bipartisan improvements and bipartisan  amendments and modifications to the PPP program, things which both  sides had agreed upon. That program has been very successful but needed  to be expanded and reauthorized, so it included those changes--again,  bipartisan changes.   It included significant funding for both elementary and secondary  education--about $70 billion there to help our schools open safely and  another $30 billion to $35 billion for colleges and universities for  the same purpose: to help them be able to open safely--again, a  bipartisan priority.   Those are just a few of the things that were included. It also  included, of course, additional funding for vaccines, therapies,  testing, all things that we think are vitally important if we are going  to defeat the virus.   Those were all components that were included in the bill last week  that was brought up to the floor by the majority  [[Page S5581]]  leader, Senator McConnell, and it was blocked. It was filibustered by  the Democrats. Now, when I say blocked, I am not talking about blocking  the end bill. I am talking about blocking even getting on the bill. It  was a motion to proceed under the Senate rules, something that is  necessary to get on a bill.   It is important, I think, to point out that there are several ways in  which a bill can be stopped, and they require a supermajority--60 votes  in the Senate. Once you are on a bill and it is subject to an amendment  process, you can, at the end of that, if you don't like the bill, you  can still block it with 41 votes. In other words, it takes 60 votes to  get on a bill, to proceed to a bill, and 60 votes to get off the bill,  to report it out. So there are several places where if you are opposed  to something and you think that you haven't been treated fairly, you  can block it.   But blocking the motion to proceed means you are blocking a bill-- even just the idea of getting on the bill and opening it up to an  amendment process and debating it on the floor of the Senate. That is  not, obviously, the first time that has happened. It happened in the  police reform bill. It happened earlier this year in the original CARES  package.   But on the police reform bill, you had, again, a bill that had many  bipartisan provisions in it. In fact, about 75 to 80 percent of the  bill were things that both sides agreed upon, and, there again, the  motion to proceed just to get on the bill was blocked. It was by the  use of the filibuster. It was by the use of the 60-vote threshold in  the Senate to prevent the Senate from even proceeding to the bill--even  after, I would add, the manager of that bill and the author of that  bill, Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina, had indicated through the  leadership that they would be willing to accept up to 10 amendments or  up to 20 amendments. They were offered unanimous consent to get 10 or  20 amendments offered in the police reform bill, but it was still  blocked even on the motion to proceed by the Democrats in the Senate.   So, when they blocked the bill last week, it was pointed out, I  think, accurately by the media reporting on the bill. These were a few  of the headlines to give you a sense of the reaction.   The Hill: ``Senate Democrats block GOP relief bill.'' The Washington  Post said: ``Democrats block slimmed-down GOP coronavirus relief bill.  . . .'' ABC News said: ``Democrats block Senate GOP COVID 19 relief  proposal.'' National Public Radio said: ``Senate Democrats Block GOP's  $300 Billion Pandemic Relief Bill.''   So those were some of the headlines. Maybe this doesn't mean anything  to anybody but Congress watchers, but I am sure the irony is not lost  on anybody who follows this process. The Democrats used the legislative  filibuster. When I say blocking a motion to proceed, it was the use of  a legislative filibuster to block a bill last week--as I mentioned,  several times earlier this year--at the same time that they are calling  for an end to the legislative filibuster.   Imagine that. Think about the irony of that. On Friday, NBC News  reported: ``Democratic insiders are assembling a coalition behind the  scenes to wage an all-out war on the Senate filibuster in bullish  anticipation of sweeping the 2020 election. . . .''   So the very mechanism that they used repeatedly here just in the last  year--but, frankly, for the last 6 years that they have been in the  minority--to block or, in some cases, even to improve a bill that comes  to the floor of the U.S. Senate, they are now talking about getting rid  of that very rule. I mean, think about that. The irony of that is  pretty rich.   It was a disturbing confirmation that the campaign by some Democrats  to eliminate the Senate's nearly 200-year-old practice for considering  legislation has become official. It used to be sort of whispered around  here and talked about, but now they are talking openly about getting  rid of the filibuster. It puts into stark contrast the choice the  voters are going to face in November.   So what is the legislative filibuster? Well, it is the product of the  Senate's tradition of unlimited debate. The legislative filibuster is  essentially the requirement that 60 Senators agree before the Senate  can end debate and vote on a contentious bill. In other words, you need  60 percent of the Senate to agree before you can pass a bill   Now, what this means in practice is that unlike the House of  Representatives, where legislation can easily pass with the support of  just one party, in the Senate, you generally need the support of at  least some Members of the other party before you can pass legislation.  Nowadays, the Senate's filibuster rule could be said to be the primary  thing that distinguishes the Senate from the House of Representatives.   That matters because the Senate is supposed to be different from the  House of Representatives. The Framers of the Constitution designed the  Senate to be, as the minority leader once said--alluding to the  legendary exchange between Washington and Jefferson--the cooling saucer  of democracy.   Wary of--to quote Federalist 62--``the propensity of all single and  numerous assemblies, to yield to the impulse of sudden and violent  passions,'' the Founders created the Senate as a check on the House of  Representatives. They made the Senate smaller and Senators' terms of  office longer with the intention of creating a more stable, more  thoughtful, and more deliberative legislative body to check ill- considered or intemperate legislation.   As time has gone on, the legislative filibuster is the Senate rule  that has had perhaps the greatest impact in preserving the Founders'  vision of the Senate. Thanks to the filibuster, it is often harder to  get legislation through the Senate than through the House. It requires  more thought, more debate, and greater consensus.   Those are good things. Historically, Senators of both parties have  recognized this. They have seen beyond the narrow partisan advantage of  the moment and fought for the preservation of the filibuster.   In 2005, when there was talk of abolishing the judicial filibuster,  Democratic Senators, some of whom still serve in this body today,  fought fiercely to safeguard it. At a rally in March of that year, the  current Democratic leader said:         They believe if you get 51% of the vote, there should be       one party rule. We will stand in their way! Because an       America of checks and balances is the America we love. It's       the America the Founding Fathers created. It's been the       America that has kept us successful for 200 years and we're       not going to let them change it! . . . We will fight, and we       will preserve the Constitution.    That is from the current Democratic leader back in 2005, speaking  about proposals to eliminate the filibuster. Well, unfortunately, the  Democrats changed their tune a few years later when they thought  abolishing the judicial filibuster would serve their advantage. But  even then, Democrats--and later Republicans--sought to distinguish  between confirming nominees and the importance of preserving debate on  legislation. Now they are talking about abolishing the fundamental  practice of the Senate, the legislative filibuster, for the same  prospect of temporary partisan gaming.   ``Nothing's off the table,'' the minority leader said when asked  about Democrats' intentions for the legislative filibuster if they win  back the Senate. It is a far cry from what he said just a few years  ago.   Eliminating the legislative filibuster would permanently change the  nature of the Senate. The cooling saucer that the Founders envisioned  would essentially be gone, and the one-party rule the Democratic leader  decried back in 2005 would become a reality.   Some might ask why one-party rule is a problem. After all, sometimes  one party wins the Senate, the House, and the Presidency. Shouldn't  that party be able to pass whatever legislation it wants? Well, the  answer is no. Our country is relatively evenly split down the middle,  with the advantage sometimes moving to the Republicans and sometimes to  the Democrats, but even if one party were a permanent minority in this  country, one-party rule still wouldn't be acceptable.   Let me go back to the Federalist papers for just a minute. Federalist  10 and 51 discuss two issues that the Founders were concerned about:  minority rights and the tyranny of the majority. While we tend to think  of tyrants as single individuals, the Founders recognized that a  majority could be tyrannical as well. So the Founders created a system  of government designed to prevent tyrannical majority from running  roughshod over the rights of the minority, and one of those checks was  the Senate.  [[Page S5582]]    Today, the legislative filibuster may be the single most important  thing preserving the Senate's constitutional role as a check on  majority tyranny. By requiring 60 votes, the filibuster ensures that  any legislation has to take into account the views of a broad group of  Senators. With a 60-vote threshold, you are unlikely to get your  legislation passed unless you bring some Senators of the opposite party  on board, and that means the minority party has a real role in shaping  legislation in the Senate, something the minority party in the House  lacks.   Democrats have repeatedly, as I pointed out earlier, used the  legislative filibuster to their advantage during this Congress. In  March, Democrats filibustered our largest coronavirus relief bill, the  CARES Act, until Republicans agreed to add some Democratic priorities,  and Democrats quickly took credit for making the bill better. You would  think that Democrats would want to preserve this influence,  especially--especially--now that Democrats have experienced the  consequences of their decision to abolish the judicial filibuster.    Of course, when they say they want to abolish the legislative  filibuster, Democrats mean that they want to abolish the legislative  filibuster if they win a majority in November. They have a lot of  legislation they want to pass, and they don't want to have to moderate  that legislation to address Republicans' or Americans' concerns.   But I would remind my colleagues that no one is in power forever. If  Democrats do win in November and abolish the legislative filibuster,  they may quickly come to regret that decision once they are in the  minority again, because no matter how permanent a majority thinks it  will be, sooner or later every majority party returns to minority  status.   In addition to doing away with the bipartisan nature of the Senate,  ending the legislative filibuster would also erode the stability of  government. Legislation would become more partisan because the majority  would not have to take into account the opinions of the minority party.  That would make legislation likely to be reversed as soon as the  opposite party gains the majority in a future Congress.   Without the legislative filibuster, it is not hard to see a future in  which national policy on a host of issues could fluctuate wildly every  few years. Taxes could go up and down on a regular basis. Government  programs could be stopped and started every few years. The consequences  for individuals, businesses, and our economy would not just be  unpleasant but potentially devastating.   I understand the frustration of my Democratic colleagues. I have been  in the minority of the Senate. I was in the minority my first 8 years  here.   I also know what it is like when you get into the majority and can't  pass everything you want because the minority party will filibuster  your bills. I have certainly had moments when I wished we could just  pass legislation with a simple majority, especially coming from the  House of Representatives.   Democrats have stood in the way of a lot of legislation I would like  to have passed this year, from Senator Scott's police reform bill,  which I mentioned earlier, to additional coronavirus relief, to pro- life legislation.   It is also important to note that not every filibuster has been  undertaken for noble purposes. Like every tool, it can be misused. But  I know that no matter how frustrating the filibuster may be in the  moment, preserving it is essential to preserving the institution of the  Senate and the purpose for which it was created. It is essential to  protecting minority rights, and it is an essential check on tyrannical  majorities that would seek to curtail our freedoms.   Legend has it that when Benjamin Franklin was leaving the  Constitutional Convention, someone asked him what form of government  the convention had instituted. ``A republic,'' Franklin said, ``if you  can keep it''--``if you can keep it.''   Today, the legislative filibuster is the key rule preserving the  Senate's constitutional role as a check on partisan passion. I pray  that no future Senate will destroy the Senate's essential role in our  system of government for temporary partisan gain.   I yield the floor.    I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Alaska    Mr. President, I would say, through the Chair, to my  colleague from Alaska that that is absolutely the case. I don't think  there is any question but that, if the legislative filibuster is done  away with in a future Senate--and, again, Members on the Democratic  side are talking openly about doing that if they gain the majority  after the election in November--it will transform the institution of  the Senate and, by extension, transform our country.   The institution that was designed to protect minority rights and to  put a check on a majority will no longer be a functioning institution  in the way the Founders intended. In fact, it will essentially become,  as the Senator from Alaska pointed out, the House of Representatives  with longer terms.   I think that would be unfortunate for a country that was based upon a  system of checks and balances and that recognized very early on how  critical it was that minority rights be a part of our public debate and  discussion and that those voices not be muffled or that those voices  not be completely put out of the public debate.   I would simply say to my colleague from Alaska that I think this is a  monumental issue in terms of what this institution has meant to this  country and what it will continue to mean in the future if these rules  are changed and this constitutional protection, as we have pointed out,  is done away with. It will transform the Senate, and it will transform  the country in ways that would be very detrimental to what the Founders  intended.    Would the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, would the Senator from Illinois agree,  however--because I think it is important to point out that this is not  something that happened in the last few years. The Senator from Alaska  had a colleague elected in 2008 who, when he ran again for election in  2014, the argument could be made against him that he had never gotten a  vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate on a single amendment in a 6-year  term in the Senate.   I came here in 2005. In the first 8 years that I was here as a  Senator, I witnessed time and again the very thing you are talking  about, where amendments were shut down, the tree was filled, in the  parliamentary language that we use here in the Senate.   So I would ask the Senator: Is this not a--this is not an issue that  has cropped up in the last few years. Is this not a problem that  originated some time ago and, as the Senator is suggesting, that we  need to do away with the supermajority requirement that requires us  here as Senators to work together in a bipartisan way to find common  ground to fix what ails the Senate?   I would argue and a lot would argue that what ails the Senate right  now requires nothing more than behavioral change. We have to agree that  when somebody offers an amendment on one side, that it is not going to  be blocked immediately and we get into this lockdown. That is what  happened in recent years and in the last couple of examples we have  had, as recently as last week, blocking the motion to proceed to the  bill.   I mean, if you want to have an amendment process, you have to get on  the bill in the first place. That has been, now, the routine that has  been executed by the minority, is to prevent even a motion to proceed,  which would enable us to get to an amendment process.   So this is not something that happened when Senator McConnell came;  this was happening well before that. As I pointed out, the Senator from  Alaska's colleague went through an entire 6-year term without getting a  vote--a Democratic colleague--when he was in the majority here in the  Senate.    Mr. President, I have one last question for the Senator  from Illinois.   I don't disagree that, again, we can do a better job--both sides--of  making the Senate a more open place where we have an opportunity to  debate, which I think is the history and tradition of the Senate, but I  don't think blowing up the Senate rules accomplishes that.   I just want to read for you from this morning--I was on the floor  here, but in an interview on NPR, the junior Senator from Massachusetts  was asked if there are parts of the Green New Deal that might attract  bipartisan support. How did he reply? He replied that we need to enact  the whole thing, and if Republicans disagree, Democrats should  eliminate the filibuster.   Now, wanting to preserve the filibuster doesn't mean we can't reform  the Senate, but it does mean that we shouldn't allow a majority to  steamroll a minority. That is what the filibuster and the rules of the  Senate were designed to protect.   What your Members are talking openly about doing--including your  leader--is nuking the filibuster, blowing up the Senate, and changing  and transforming it in a way that will transform not only the Senate  and the way the government, I think, was designed to work by our  Founders but also transform the country.
