 Mr. President, today, June 13, 2023, Klyce True  Value Hardware in Sardis, MS, will celebrate its 100th year of  business. It is my pleasure to congratulate William ``Bill'' Klyce, the  current owner, on this milestone.   This family-owned local store is a picture of the American dream. In  1923, Fred Walthall Klyce, Sr., opened for  [[Page S2066]]  business in downtown Sardis. He never dreamed his shop would become an  anchor of the town for the next century. Fred passed the business down  to his son John Klyce, Sr., who would then hand it down to his own son  Bill Klyce. Through the years, Klyce Hardware has become a repository  for the history of Sardis. Visitors will be surprised at the artifacts  they find when they walk through the store.   Klyce Hardware has always been characterized by community service.  Today, Bill Klyce stocks the nuts, bolts, paints, and brushes his  customers expect. But he does even more than that. Occasionally,  someone needs an item he does not carry. When they do, he goes out of  his way to find it. And sometimes, emergencies happen on a Sunday. When  they do, Bill has been known to open the store so his fellow  townspeople can repair their homes in a pinch.   Many who hear the story of Klyce Hardware will find it familiar, even  if they have never heard of this particular store. They will recognize  it because they know and love similar shops in their own towns. They  have their own Klyce Hardware and their own Bill Klyce.   Across our Nation stretches a constellation of small businesses that  quietly support the American way of life. The entrepreneurs who start  them perform a kind of magic. Their enterprises create most American  jobs, inject energy into local economies, and meet the practical needs  of their neighbors. Without them, the American economy would lack its  characteristic strength and optimism.   I want to thank Bill personally for carrying the legacy of his  family's dream, and I want to congratulate Klyce Hardware on 100 years  of outstanding service to the people of Sardis. The Klyce family  represents the best of American enterprise, and I am glad to honor them  today.                            ____________________
