 Mr. President, I have a motion at the  desk.    Mr. President, in this underlying bill,  there is $87 billion for the IRS. The Democrats want to make the IRS-- the three  [[Page S4187]]  letters you never want to see in your mailbox--bigger than the  Pentagon, the State Department, the FBI, and the Border Patrol  combined.   Instead, what my motion does is that it would take $45 billion from  enforcement and give it to parents so that they can help their kids  make up for the learning loss that occurred during the pandemic.   And oh, by the way, when you think about the size of the IRS and when  you think about the enforcement, realize that according to the CBO, 90  percent of the targeting would be on household incomes under $200,000.   I urge my colleagues to support my motion.    Mr. President, how much time do I have  left?    Two seconds or 22 seconds?    Mr. President, what we know already is  that 9.1 percent of inflation is already ravaging middle-income  Americans. I cannot believe that we will not take the time and do what  is best for the American people, and especially those making under  $200,000.                           Vote on Motion to Commit     I ask for the yeas and nays.
