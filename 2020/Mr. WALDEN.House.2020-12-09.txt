 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 549. This is a  resolution introduced by my colleague, Mrs. Demings, that reaffirms the  commitment by Congress to work with media entities and diverse  stakeholders to find common ground solutions to eliminate barriers to  diversity in our media.   As a former radio broadcaster myself, I understand the efforts that  the broadcast industry, and the media industry as a whole, takes to  ensure diversity of ownership, viewpoint, and employment. My wife and I  had to make those hiring decisions for our five radio stations. I know  firsthand the business imperative to serve your community with local  news and local programming that reflects the makeup of your community.   While today's resolution focuses specifically on broadcast stations,  this problem is not unique to one segment of the media industry; it is  also an issue for their cable and digital streaming competitors in the  marketplace.   I appreciate the many steps that the industry has taken, not only to  recognize and take responsibility for this, but also to put in place  the many programs and initiatives to promote opportunities for women,  minorities, and veterans. But as the data show, we still have room for  improvement.   While the House is considering this resolution today, it is my hope  that we  [[Page H7067]]  can work together in a bipartisan manner to address the inequality  identified in this resolution.   Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee have put forward  solutions to help uplift minority voices and promote media diversity,  solutions that can actually become law, unlike this resolution before  us today.   Mr. Speaker, in September, the House passed H. Res. 5567, the MEDIA  Diversity Act sponsored by Mr. Long, which would help us better  understand the market and regulatory barriers for socially  disadvantaged individuals to enter and compete in the marketplace. This  bill would help us make informed policy decisions.   I have also worked with advocates and industry alike to try to find  consensus on legislation to establish the long-sought broadcaster  incubator program. Now, this would help increase the number of  minority-owned broadcast stations.   The Broadcast Diversity in Leadership Act, H.R. 8154, would encourage  large, established broadcasters to work with aspiring broadcasters to  break down barriers to capital and provide mentorship and experience to  new, minority entrants. That is how we can ensure their long-term  success in serving their local communities. We must better understand  the problem before us and how best to incentivize all media entities to  create opportunities for and lift the voices of underrepresented  individuals.   Today, we can affirm our commitment to working toward common ground  solutions, as this solution states; but Republicans stand ready to work  across the aisle to turn these common ground solutions into law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Latta), the top Republican on the Communications and Technology  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta)  an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I believe we had two other speakers planning  to come down and speak, but it does not appear they have been able to  free themselves from their other business.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage us all to support this very strong  resolution that our colleague has offered up, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3361. This is the Reliable  Investment in Vital Energy Reauthorization Act.   This legislation was introduced by my colleagues on the Energy and  Commerce Committee, Mr. McKinley and Mr. Tonko, to reauthorize the  Hydroelectric Production Incentive and hydropower efficiency  improvement programs at the Department of Energy.   This legislation went through regular order, and it passed the full  committee, Energy and Commerce, by a voice vote.   H.R. 3361 would authorize payments to support the development of  hydropower production at existing dams and conduits. Literally, Mr.  Speaker, there are thousands of existing dams in the United States that  can support hydropower production while avoiding the costs and  environmental effects associated with building new dams.   In addition to affordable and renewable energy, hydropower also  provides ancillary services to stabilize the electric grid, to provide  storage, to maintain emergency black-start capability.   I am proud to support H.R. 3361, which would reauthorize these really  important Department of Energy programs and will ensure access to  renewable, carbon-free, affordable hydropower for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on  H.R. 3361, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from West  Virginia (Mr. McKinley), an engineer by trade, a terrific legislator,  an important member of our committee, and the sponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to my friend from West Virginia, it has been a great  honor. It has been an honor and great privilege to serve with you, and  I have always appreciated your leadership, your great insights, your  keen intellect as we have addressed these issues, especially on this  issue of opioids. I don't think there was a more passionate player on  the committee, a more engaged and informed member of the committee on  this matter than you.   And the citizens of West Virginia and, indeed, the citizens of all  America, Mr. Speaker, have a lot to say thank you to Mr. McKinley for  and others in this body certainly, for the legislation we passed into  law.   We know there is more work to do, and while I may be leaving, I know  Mr. McKinley is only going to double down on that effort going forward.   Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation that Mr. McKinley and Mr. Tonko  have brought before us. I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 5541, the Tribal Power Act.   This legislation was introduced by my colleagues on the Energy and  Commerce Committee, Representatives O'Halleran and Mullin, and it does  strengthen the Department of Energy's Tribal Energy Program, which is  really important to do. This bill went through regular order in the  committee and passed out of the full committee by a voice vote.  [[Page H7070]]    H.R. 5541 updates and reauthorizes programs at the Department of  Energy to provide funding and technical assistance to Tribal  Governments and organizations so that they can carry out projects that  would expand access to energy and provide jobs and economic development  on Indian lands.                                time  1315    American Indian and Alaska Native communities continue to struggle  with energy affordability and access in many cases. Households on some  Tribal lands also have higher rates of unemployment and lower incomes,  meaning it may not be feasible to increase electricity rates to  energize homes that are not currently connected to the electric grid.  As a result, communities often rely on relatively expensive diesel  microgrids and generators to power homes and businesses.   H.R. 5541 would help improve energy security and affordability on  Indian lands by reauthorizing important government programs, and it  would remove some barriers to providing access to electric service and  recommends ways to improve energy education, planning, and management.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5541,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin). It is a great honor and privilege to recognize  Mr. Mullin, a Tribal member, an incredibly important member of our  committee who has given great voice to people who need help, and a  cosponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Mullin), my friend, for his very generous, over-the-top words. We have  had a great working relationship. He is a fierce fighter for the causes  he believes in and has been a terrific legislator and will continue to  blossom and grow on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I have no doubt.  The country will be better served. Indian Country has few stronger  voices than his, and none stronger on the Energy and Commerce  Committee, I would say.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), my good friend, the distinguished  Republican whip of the House and an incredibly important member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee who always came prepared, always did  great work, and always presented us with his brick phone.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and colleague from the Energy and  Commerce Committee and the whip, the Republican whip of the House, for  his overly generous comments, his fine leadership, and the fun we have  had on the Energy and Commerce Committee. We do have a lot of fun there  on both sides of the aisle, and then we do wrestle and tumble and we  work things out, too.   But Mr. Scalise has always been a real warrior on the committee, an  incredible fighter for what he believes in, an effective legislator, a  terrific spokesperson. He has fallen down a little bit, though, I must  stipulate, in that he has failed to get me coffee in recent years. He  has been otherwise consumed with other duties, and that will be noted  in the historical record, I am sure.   Mr. Speaker, I inquire how much time I have remaining.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), whom we are glad to have back on  the floor and looking well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, the good doctor  from Indiana. We are so blessed in this institution to have people with  such incredible backgrounds, intellect, capability, and just the  overall human experience that they can bring to help us be better  legislators and develop better policy.   I think when we listen to each other, when we are challenged in our  views and our ideas by each other, we end up with a better product for  the American people, Mr. Speaker.   Certainly, Dr. Bucshon has been a forceful figure in trying to get to  better healthcare policy outcomes. I have greatly valued his counsel  and his leadership, and I know incredible things await him in the next  Congress and in the years thereafter, where I hope he will continue to  serve with great distinction, honor, and ability.   Mr. Speaker, I don't think I have anybody else on our side at this  time, so I encourage passage of the legislation, the Tribal Power Act,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1426, the Timely Review of  Infrastructure Act. This legislation was introduced by my colleagues on  the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative Pete Olson and  Representative  Mike Doyle, to help the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission recruit and retain highly specialized personnel in the STEM  fields.   This legislation went through regular order, and it passed by vote  voice in the committee. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,  otherwise known as FERC, is an independent agency. Mr. Speaker, it  regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and  oil.   FERC's responsibilities also include reviewing and approving the  siting of large-scale infrastructure projects such as LNG export  terminals, electric transmission lines, interstate pipelines, and all  the associated environmental and safety requirements.   While FERC receives annual appropriations from Congress, FERC  recovers 100 percent of its appropriations through the collection of  annual charges and filing fees. This unique structure, where the  industry essentially covers FERC's costs, has resulted in a lean and  efficient agency, and it helps keep costs down for consumers.   In testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee, FERC explained  that it faces a growing challenge to recruit and retain a highly  skilled workforce to keep up with the demands of  [[Page H7073]]  our rapidly growing energy infrastructure.   FERC has especially had difficulty hiring engineers throughout the  agency, with many candidates citing compensation rates as, frankly, the  main issue.   H.R. 1426 would improve FERC's workforce by granting the Chairman  authority to adjust compensation for a certain category of STEM  workers. This fix would help FERC carry out its mission in a timely,  efficient, and effective manner without any additional cost to our  taxpayers.   I want to thank Mr. Olson and Mr. Doyle for working together in a  bipartisan way, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the author of the bill,  the gentleman from Texas, I can tell you, Texas has few stronger  advocates, if any, than Mr. Olson. And Texas 22, his congressional  district, has had an incredibly effective voice in the United States  Congress.   He, like I, will be leaving at the end of this session, but he has  left his mark on all kinds of positive policy improvements in the  Federal Government.   Now, I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker, but there probably aren't  many of us who could cite our friend's district by number, but somehow  Mr. Olson, when you look at him, you know it is Texas 22, and you know  about the Houston Astros. Now why, I don't know. But that is a subject  for another day.   What I do know is, he has been an able and effective legislator on  the Energy and Commerce Committee in this House. He has served his  country in many capacities, including in the military. He will be  missed in this assembly, but his work will go on. His work today is  noticed, once again, in a bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Olson), although I do have another speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  thank my dear friend and colleague, Mr. Olson, who we all know, it  turns out, is from Texas 22; and his wife, Nancy. I wish them the very  best in their lives ahead.   Mr. Speaker, since he is talking about a little history, I want to  talk about a little history, too, before I turn to my friend from  Georgia to speak on this bill, and that is that something really,  really, really important happened not too far from my home State of  Oregon.   In Fort Lewis, Washington, on this date 58 years ago, this gentleman  from Texas 22 arrived on this planet. Today is his birthday, and I hope  the House will join me in acknowledging Mr. Olson's birthday. He was  born in the great State of Washington, as it turns out, but he is Texas  through and through. So happy birthday to Mr. Olson.   Mr. Speaker, I would turn now to the only pharmacist in the United  States Congress, which has really been important in our legislative  efforts on the Energy and Commerce Committee. He knows so much about  how to take care of people when they are at the counter, how to make  sure they get what they need, and what they face when they come there  in terms of costs of medicines and everything else.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is a terrific member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I don't believe I have any other speakers on  my side of the aisle on this measure. I urge its passage, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5758, the Ceiling Fan  Improvement Act. This legislation was introduced by my colleagues on  the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representatives Guthrie and  Schakowsky, to make technical corrections to the Department of Energy's  energy conservation standard for large-diameter ceiling fans. This  legislation did go through regular order and it did pass the full  committee on a voice vote.   H.R. 5758 would amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to  adjust compliance requirements, and that will resolve a discrepancy in  the regulations that may have the unintended consequence of allowing  some large-diameter fans with low airflows to meet the minimum  standards. The Department of Energy confirmed the need for a statutory  revision and submitted technical assistance to aid in the drafting of  this legislation, which we are appreciative of.   This is a good bipartisan bill, like the others before it today, and  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege now to recognize the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), who is the top Republican on the  Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee and has really done  incredible work as we put together our package on Operation Warp Speed  and the second wave issues involving COVID, which I recommend to my  colleagues to take a look at. He is also a great legislator in working  out bipartisan issues like this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself a minute or so here to thank  my friend, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) who, as you all  know, is a terrific legislator, a bright mind. And he, too, has served  his country with distinction in uniform and here in the Congress, and  he will have a great future going forward in this institution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on my side of the  aisle. It is good legislation, bipartisan. It should become law. I urge  its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support of H.R. 3797, the  Medical Marijuana Research Act introduced by my colleague and friend  from Oregon, Representative Blumenauer, my friend from Maryland,  Representative   Andy Harris, among others.   I am sort of surprised we aren't taking this up at 4:20 in the  afternoon rather than 2:10, but we will let history deal with that.   Mr. Speaker, Federally sanctioned research on marijuana is incredibly  challenging. It is a schedule I controlled substance under the  Controlled Substances Act, meaning that researchers seeking to  investigate a drug have to work with the Department of Health and Human  Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration to meet certain  Federal requirements in order to conduct that research.   In addition, international obligations outlined in the United Nations  drug control treaties impose requirements that impact the supply of  research-grade cannabis. Currently, those conducting federally- sanctioned research can only study marijuana that is sourced through  the National Institute on Drug Abuse's single DEA licensee: the  University of Mississippi.   Unfortunately, that marijuana is chemically distinct from what is  commercially available from State-legal dispensaries, such as in my  home State of Oregon.   What does that mean?   Well, it means that we have little to no data on the actual health  impacts of products in States that have legalized cannabis for medical  or recreational use.   States that have pursued marijuana legalization have largely done so  in an information vacuum, with less understanding of what it does than  virtually any nutritional supplement currently on the market, and with  far less information than they have on legal substances that are easily  abused, such as alcohol or tobacco. We don't even know at what point it  is unsafe for marijuana users to drive. The THC levels that States have  set for driving legal limits or for purposes of food consumption are  simply arbitrary.   Mr. Speaker, in Oregon, for example, cookies infused with THC are  limited to 5 milligrams of THC per serving, or 50 milligrams per  package. Now, you go across the Columbia River to the great State of  Washington, and their limit is 10 milligrams or 100 milligrams. So  there is little to no scientific evidence to support either of these  levels. We simply don't know.   Mr. Speaker, here is what we do know: There have been increases in  cannabis-related poison control center calls, emergency room visits,  and impaired driving incidents. Nationwide exposure in youth is  increasing, with record numbers of 8th through 12th graders regularly  vaping marijuana products.   So we need research that reflects the reality of what is on the  market. Products containing CBD derived from the hemp plant have become  commonplace across the country in pharmacies and health food stores,  and even in fast food chains since hemp was removed from the CSA in the  2018 farm bill.   Now, these products often contain claims that they can effectively  treat everything from depression and inflammation to cancer or  Alzheimer's. However, none of these claims have been evaluated or  approved by the FDA, meaning patients may be relying on the  unsubstantiated claims of CBD products and foregoing other proven  medical treatments.   Mr. Speaker, like cannabis, while there is potential for CBD to  provide patient benefits, the research and science lag far behind the  market and the agencies are simply struggling to catch up. Last week,  the majority forced this Chamber to vote on the MORE Act, which  completely removed marijuana from the list of scheduled substances  under the Controlled Substances Act--among many other things in that  bill--and they didn't have the data to justify this policy decision.   Not only was this legislation incredibly premature, it could also  potentially put the U.S. in violation of international treaty  obligations. Any discussion of de-scheduling must be preceded by a  fuller understanding of the potential risks associated with cannabis  use, which we currently do not have. And the current research  restrictions on fully studying cannabis have effectively created a  catch-22 in the rescheduling debate.   So evaluations by the FDA and the National Academies have both  concluded that the lack of research is a significant factor in denying  previous administrative rescheduling petitions. More research, better  data, remain the critical first steps to any future policy discussions.  Making it easier to research cannabis is common ground that I think we  can all agree upon and pursue together.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, and especially Representatives  Harris and Blumenauer, for working tirelessly to bring us this  bipartisan, commonsense legislation. This bill will help improve the  marijuana research landscape and give consumers the information they  need.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Harris), who has been a real leader on this and so many  other healthcare-related issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for her kind comments and her  leadership on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, can I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith), an extraordinary leader on the  Energy and Commerce Committee, a gentleman I refer to as our counsel on  the committee. He is an extraordinary lawyer and incredible public  policy initiator.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague from Virginia  for not only his very kind comments but also his incredible work ethic.   I will tell one quick story about Morgan Griffith. I had a little  bill, a suspension bill, that Mr. Blumenauer and I had to do a land  exchange up on Mount Hood. It flew through here one night, first night  of votes, and got two dissenting votes. One of them I understood, but  his dissenting vote I didn't understand.   I went up to him, and I said: I am going to win this. There are only  two noes. But why did you vote no?   He said: Well, I read the bill, and it referenced this memorandum of  understanding between the Forest Service and Mount Hood Meadows about  this land exchange. I tried to get a copy of that MOU, and I couldn't  get it before I voted on the bill, so I voted no.                                time  1430    Well, the bill didn't get through that Congress. It got through the  House, but not, of course, the other body.   So the next Congress, we did it again, and I made sure that Mr.  Griffith had that memorandum of understanding related to this little  land transfer bill in an area that Mr. Blumenauer and I share, and he  voted with us on that measure.   I thought: He is a pretty darn good, thorough legislator if he is  reading every suspension bill and every land transfer bill and diving  into the weeds. Americans need to know what a great man he is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my dear friend and colleague  from Georgia (Mr. Carter) for his leadership on so many issues before  the committee and for his very kind and generous words. I will miss  serving with Mr. Carter. He has been a terrific member of the  committee, and he, too, will have a great future ahead.   Mr. Speaker, our next Member, I should call him the deputy mayor of  Washington, D.C., because that is kind of what you are when you are the  ranking member of the House Administration Committee. He has been a  passionate advocate on the next bill, but because of a meeting he has  coming up, I am going to yield to him now, so he can make that  scheduled appointment, to talk about this bill and the next bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Illinois for his generous  comments and his great leadership, and I wish him well in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the underlying bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1570, the Removing Barriers to  Colorectal Cancer Screening Act of 2020.   This is really important legislation, as you have heard, and it has  received strong bipartisan support from literally hundreds of our  colleagues, including myself. It was a key provision of a bill I  actually introduced last year, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act  of 2019, which had a lot of bipartisan solutions to lower drug prices  without hindering the development of new therapeutics or cures.   So I am happy to see the House take this action on this critical  component of that other legislation.   This bill would address an oversight in Medicare that requires  beneficiaries to cover the cost of an unexpected polyp removal when  provided a free screening colonoscopy.   These surprise medical bills, as I would call them, create financial  barriers for patient access to these lifesaving screenings, which can  save thousands of lives a year.   In the United States, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause  of cancer-related deaths, Mr. Speaker. Screenings are the most  effective way to detect and treat this devastating disease early on,  and efforts must be made to ensure individuals have access to these  important services.   By removing these financial barriers for patients, this bill would  enhance screening efforts and ultimately save lives. The bill is offset  with another policy from H.R. 19 that would require pharmaceutical  companies to report their average sales price, ASP.   Right now, certain companies are exploiting a little loophole in the  current law where they are not reporting their  [[Page H7085]]  ASP and drawing down higher reimbursement rates from Medicare as a  result. This creates an unfair advantage with competitors who are doing  the right thing, as the statute intended, and reporting their data.   I am glad this package includes these two provisions of H.R. 19,  further adding to the number of provisions from this bill that I hope  are enacted into law during the remainder of this Congress.   While I urge support of this bill that would end surprise billing for  this select group of Americans, I am disappointed Congress has yet to  pass a bill that would end surprise billing for all Americans. Mr.  Pallone and I have worked closely on this legislation. We have a  bipartisan bill. It is ready to go, and we could pass it into law  before the end of the year and put an end to surprise billing for all  Americans, not just those with an unexpected polyp removal.   I urge Congress to take further swift action to do what the American  people want us to do. Let's end surprise billing once and for all for  everyone.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) and I ask unanimous consent that he  be allowed to control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Mfume) for  bringing us this legislation and for his very kind comments about my  service and the future that lies ahead of me, perhaps. I appreciate his  leadership and his kind words.   I, too, rise today to speak on H.R. 1966, the Henrietta Lacks  Enhancing Cancer Research Act of 2019, which was sponsored by the late,  great Representative Elijah Cummings originally.   This bill is named after Henrietta Lacks, a woman of color who  donated her cells, without her knowledge and consent, to Johns Hopkins  in 1951, beginning what was the first human cell line able to reproduce  indefinitely.   Her cells have been used in biomedical research around the world.   H.R. 1966 requires the Government Accountability Office, or the GAO,  to study how Federal agencies have addressed barriers to participation  in cancer clinical trials by individuals from underrepresented  populations and to provide recommendations for addressing such  barriers.   The intent of the bill is laudable, as racial and ethnic minorities  are currently underrepresented in clinical trials.   I know that has been an issue even in the COVID trials. I have talked  to the people who have developed these vaccines, and this is a real  issue they face, trying to get the right mix to reflect the community  and make sure that everyone who takes the various drugs and vaccines  are represented in these trials.   It is a concern, because people of different ages, different races,  different ethnicities, they simply may react differently to medical  treatments. So we have to get this right.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friends from Maryland for bringing this  legislation to the floor, and I, of course, pay homage to  Representative Cummings for his initial leadership on this as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin Hern).    Mr. Speaker, I don't have any other speakers on my side.  I encourage Members to support this really important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7898, a technical  corrections bill introduced by Dr. Burgess.   The 21st Century Cures Act had a major provision, led by Dr. Burgess,  regarding information blocking. This is a process where a healthcare  provider or an electronic healthcare record vendor will not move a  patient's data between care settings or erects significant  technological or financial barriers to do so.   The 21st Century Cures Act was significant in that it banned the  practice of information blocking, which is a key patient protection and  an effort to transform our healthcare delivery system. Patient access  and control over personal health information should be at the center of  our efforts in securing high-quality and patient-driven care.   The Energy and Commerce Committee delivered this win for patients,  and today, we need to make a minor but very important technical  correction to ensure our policy is enforced.   H.R. 7898 would clarify the authority of the Department of Health and  Human Services inspector general regarding information blocking, to  make crystal clear that the IG has the authority to enforce this ban,  to go after bad actors, and to protect patient access to personal  health data.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), the author of this provision and our ranking member, the top  member on the Republican side, on the Health Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   To my friends in this assembly, thank you for your friendship.   To the chairman of the committee, we have developed a wonderful  relationship. Sometimes your staff and our staff spar, but we are a  family, and families do disagree from time to time. But generally  speaking, we are headed in the same direction, and that direction is  making America a better place for everyone and solving problems. So I  am very thankful for your very generous and kind comments, Mr.  Chairman.   Mr. Speaker, I will say it has been a real delight and joy to work  with the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I would have to  admit it was a more delight and joy to work with the ranking member of  the Energy and Commerce Committee when I was chairman, but that is the  way of the world, and that is democracy. We switched roles and handed  off the gavel in peace, and we began to approach issues from a  different angle but with the same mission.   Mr. Speaker, as 2020 comes to a thankful close--I think we are all  ready to get it behind us--so does my 22 years of public service in  this incredible crucible of democracy, the United States House of  Representatives.   I want to start by thanking my wife of 38 years, and our son, who is  30, Mylene and Anthony. They have always supported me during my three  decades of State and Federal service, all the campaigns, all the  meetings, and all the times away. I know my colleagues will understand  this when I say I will never fully understand all that they sacrificed  so that I could fulfill my duty in office, but I do know it was a lot.   I also want to thank my terrific staff over the years, and especially  those who helped me build and lead such successful organizations,  including my two personal office chiefs of staff of over 22 years,  Brian MacDonald and Lorissa Bounds, terrific leaders both; my executive  directors at the NRCC when I ran the Republican campaign organization,  Liesl Hickey and Rob Simms; and my staff directors at the Energy and  Commerce Committee.   You have heard of the late great Ray Baum, my colleague dating clear  back to the late eighties in the Oregon Legislature and then all the  way through  [[Page H7091]]  just a couple years ago when he passed away of cancer. Mike Bloomquist  and Ryan Long also did such terrific work heading up the best committee  in Congress.   I want to thank the professional staff, many of whom have been on the  floor today, my personal staff in Oregon and Washington, D.C. We rely  so much on these very smart and talented people, and the country is  well-served by their work.   I want to thank the thousands of volunteers and supporters of my  campaigns over the years. We did it together, and I would like to  believe we did it for the right reasons: to leave our State and to  leave our country better places than we found them.   I also want to thank some important mentors in my life.   Of course, I would have to start with my parents, who grew up with  nothing during the Great Depression. They taught me the importance of  giving back to the community, of working hard, and of always being  honest and seldom being judgmental.   I want to thank those along the way who gave me some interesting  career opportunities.   My freshman year in college was spent at the University of Alaska  Fairbanks. I want to thank the folks at KTVF and the old KFRB Mighty  Ninety in Fairbanks who put a 17-year-old kid in charge of producing  and directing the 11 o'clock TV news. I had never been in a TV studio  before, and suddenly, as a freshman in college, I was working every  night doing that.   To Roger Martin, Vic Atiyeh, Gary Wilhelms, and Denny Smith, I  learned so much from working for each of you.   To former Oregon Speaker Larry Campbell, time and again you showed  Oregon how principled leadership produces good results. So it was great  sport serving alongside you in the Oregon House.   Of course, I want to thank the church, school, and scout leaders who  influenced my life in such a positive way. I would give a shout-out to  the late Earl Fowler. He was my high school vice principal and student  body officer adviser whose counsel, when I was student body president  at Hood River Valley High School, was as valuable then as it is now.   I remember one of the things he told us as student leaders was:  ``When there is a leadership vacuum, fill it.'' He expected us to step  up, to lead, and to take on challenges.   I am indeed thankful for the opportunity the people of Oregon have  given me to represent them in the United States House of  Representatives. It is a responsibility I have always taken seriously  as I faithfully tried to do my best to represent them. After all, this  is their office, not mine. I was simply entrusted to use the powers       bestowed upon it for their benefit, something I never       forgot. It is part of why I have returned home nearly       every weekend and will soon--whenever we wrap up business       here--complete my 644th round trip back home.   My team and I put special emphasis on taking care of the men and  women who wear or have worn our Nation's uniform and defended America's  freedom:   We helped thousands of Oregon veterans and families receive the  benefits they earned and deserved.   We worked to strengthen the mission at Kingsley Air Field and open  veterans clinics throughout the community and the district.   We helped save the veterans facility in White City.   America is blessed to have those brave men and women who risk their  lives so that we can enjoy ours in peace. America owes them a debt we  can never fully repay.   Having grown up on a cherry orchard outside of The Dalles, Oregon, I  always had great admiration for those who farm and ranch and feed us. I  worked hard to protect their way of life, defending farmers and  ranchers from bad policy proposals. I stood up for their water rights.  I protected their land and ranching way of life.   I am especially proud of the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management  and Protection Act and the collaborative approach that it envisioned.   Moreover, I supported ag research and water conservation efforts  throughout the district. And while we made much progress on both  fronts, my one regret is that we could never find the key to unlocking  a durable and fair solution to the water crisis in the Klamath Basin  that could also pass in the Congress.   We did make progress to improve forest management, even though I am  disappointed Congress has dragged its feet in enacting much-needed  reforms to make our Federal forests healthier and more resilient to  climate change.   It was 17 years ago last week that President Bush signed the Healthy  Forest Restoration Act into law. Hopefully, in the next Congress, you  all will heed the guidance of our Yale forestry graduate and colleague,  Bruce Westerman, to modernize how we manage this great American  resource before the rest of it goes up in smoke.   Having spent 6 years as chair of the Telecommunications Subcommittee,  I am really proud of the bipartisan work we did together to open up  spectrum for advanced communications; enact FirstNet, our first  responders' new interoperable broadband network; and to expand access  to high-speed internet, although much work still remains to fully  connect all Americans to high-speed broadband.   With the RAY BAUM'S Act, we even reauthorized and modernized the FCC,  and, as you heard, that hadn't been done in a couple of decades.   When I had the great privilege and honor to chair the Energy and  Commerce Committee, we took on the deadly epidemic of drug overdose and  combined more than 60 bipartisan pieces of legislation into the SUPPORT  Act, which, while focused on the opioid crisis, actually was much  bigger than that and provided support for our communities to help all  with addiction.   We modernized our mental health laws, stepped up medical research,  and fully funded the Children's Health Insurance Program for a decade-- something that had never been done before.   We modernized the FDA and its approval processes for medicines and  medical devices, and thank goodness we did. Some of these changes have  already proven their value during this pandemic.   I am proud to have done my part to help enact Medicare part D, which  finally brought more affordable medicines to America's seniors. While  we need to update this law, it is a fact that Medicare part D has been  a godsend to seniors who no longer have to board buses to foreign  countries to get lifesaving medicines.   We also unleashed a cleaner energy revolution in America that created  thousands of new jobs and reduces America's carbon emissions, too.  Energy innovation holds the opportunity for a strong economy and a  healthier environment.   Mr. Speaker, as you can tell, I am pretty passionate about good  public policy, and I have really enjoyed this opportunity in serving  with all of you. I think we can use our resources we have among  ourselves in Congress to get good things done for the American people.   It wasn't easy to decide to voluntarily leave this wonderful  institution, but I had long ago decided I didn't want to get voted  out--and I don't think that was going to happen--or carried out. I was  confident I would win reelection, and my health is good, so I leave on  my own terms, feeling good about that which I have helped improve in  the lives of those who entrusted me election after election.   I leave feeling positive about the ability to get good policy done  right here in the U.S. House of Representatives. In fact, we just  worked through a slate of bipartisan bills again today.   I will miss this process, and I will miss you, my colleagues. Always  remember how important the work you do here is and how much the fate of  the American way of life rests in your hands every time you put that  voting card in one of these machines.   I am a big fan of Theodore Roosevelt. His writings have also had an  impact on my life. Just as my high school adviser encouraged us to fill  leadership vacuums, so did Roosevelt laud those who climbed into the  arena. So I close with President Roosevelt's words:   ``It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the  strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them  better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,  whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives  valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is  no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive  to  [[Page H7092]]  do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who  spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the  triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at  least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with  those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.''   God bless you, my colleagues, family, and friends, and may God bless  the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
