 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to display my  Clemson flag.    Madam President, I think it is important for us to realize  and note that while Senator Graham did in fact grow up just a few miles  from Clemson--which means his affinity for the university is natural-- it is consistent with his upbringing. For me, it is very different.  When you are born in South Carolina, and you are born on the coast near  the Atlantic Ocean, the likelihood of your being a Gamecocks fan and  wearing garnet and black is about 75 percent. So I must concede that I  still pull for the Gamecocks. That is a controversial position to be in  when you are talking about the new national champions.    I would also like to say to Senator Shelby--a man of integrity,  character, and long service--thank you for making the bet. I am so glad  you lost.   I would also say to the Clemson Tigers--the ``Tigers Nation''--we are  so incredibly proud of what you have accomplished. It is amazing, not  only the successful season that you have had on the field but the  character that has been the focus of so much of the conversation off  the field.   We have talked specifically about No. 4, Deshaun Watson, and the  amazing story about his relationship with his mother. I have a special  relationship with my mom. So I appreciate his focus and determination  to honor her when he is on the field and to continue to honor her when  he is off the field. That story is a remarkable story that deserves  more attention. It really does.   As to Coach Dabo Swinney, is an amazing coach, without any question,  but he is also an Alabama alum. Having won the national championship as  a part of the Alabama football team--I believe it was 1992--you have a  champion come into Clemson University and making champions by loving  compassionately, by challenging on the field, and by embracing these  men and the entire apparatus around the university and college  athletics. He has done a fabulous job.   I think of the walk-on receiver that Senator Graham mentioned. In  every facet of the team--whether you are the so-called water boy,  whether you are the athletic trainer, whether you are a physical  therapist--people win because of the team that they are on. There are  no self-made success stories.   We should remember that as we focus on these young athletes. I know  their lives will be meaningful because of the team they played on and  not simply the victories they celebrated.   I do want to take a few seconds and mention the president, Jim  Clements, who is a fantastic guy and one of my dearest friends. Jim and  I were having a conversation through text before the game, and I  decided, since we can't use our phones on the floor of Senate--I know  they frown on that kind of stuff, technology; it is an interesting  concept here--I decided to print the text. This was a Wednesday evening  around 10 p.m. I had just predicted that Clemson would win, 27 to 24.  Jim Clements said:         Seriously if we play like we did last week then we win! I       believe it will happen!! 35-31. Go Tigers.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
