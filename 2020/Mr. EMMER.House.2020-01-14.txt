 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Christine  Kustelski, the Southside unit director of the Boys & Girls Club of  Central Minnesota, for her recent induction into the Youth Intervention  Hall of Fame. This prestigious honor, one that only 86 individuals have  received over the last 21 years, is given to members of our community  who go above and beyond just working with our Nation's youth.   Since 1997, Christine has worked in youth development at the Boys &  Girls Club of Central Minnesota, serving nearly 1,200 K-12 youth.  Christine assists a range of students, working with children living in  foster care or with incarcerated parents or those who have experienced  abuse, neglect, and severe poverty.  [[Page H212]]    I thank Christine for meeting the needs of the youth in our community  and for her service to others in need. I congratulate her on earning  her place in the Youth Intervention Hall of Fame.              Recognizing the Anoka County Human Services Staff     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Human Services  staff in Anoka County, Minnesota, for receiving the Local Government  Innovation Award. These Innovation Awards highlight counties, cities,  townships, and schools that have found ways to make a bigger impact in  their communities.    Anoka County developed a new apprenticeship program called the  Empowers Program. This volunteer initiative provides employment and  training opportunities to the workforce of tomorrow.   In a nation struggling with workforce shortages and a growing skills  gap, this program helps young people identify what they want to do with  their career. The program assists the participants with job searches,  individual career planning, paid training, and achieving technical and  occupational certificates. The program can even assist with basic needs  like a bus pass, clothing for work, or books for school.   Anoka County deserves to be recognized for its efforts to prepare our  young people to join the workforce. With 7 million open jobs in this  country, our young people need to be equipped to join our growing  economy.   I congratulate Anoka County.         Recognizing Elk River Area School District's Excellence in                          Technological Education     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Elk River Area  School District. As we closed out 2019, Elk River received an award for  the district's efforts to lead in educational approaches involving  technology. Sourcewell Technology's annual Impact Education Conference  named technology specialists and leaders from the Elk River Area School  District as the 2019 Technology Team of the Year.   Elk River earned this prestigious award because of the work the  district's technology team undertook to expand the services they  provide to their students. Elk River now provides on-demand courses for  teachers as well as online resources and training for students and  families. In total, the Elk River Area School District has implemented  e-learning options that are now available for nearly 14,000 students.   We are fortunate for such incredible educators dedicated to  innovating for their learners. I congratulate all the educators and  administrators at Elk River Area School District for winning this well- deserved award.     Recognizing Rivers of Hope, Neighborhood Heroes Helping Victims of                             Domestic Violence     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rivers of Hope, a  community-coordinated response to domestic violence.   In the summer of 1989, a group of neighbors concerned about an  increase in domestic violence banded together to create Rivers of Hope  to provide victims with care and support from their community.   Today, Rivers of Hope has expanded its scope of service, offering  legal advocacy, education, support groups, referrals, and a 24/7 free  and confidential crisis line for victims of domestic violence. The  organization also operates a youth program and a criminal justice  intervention program.   In addition, Rivers of Hope has grown beyond the neighbors who  founded the organization to now include corporate professionals,  business leaders, public servants, public servants from Wright and  Sherburne Counties, and other community leaders.   I thank everyone who offers their time and effort to Rivers of Hope,  making it the vital resource for victims in our communities. We are  grateful for their dedication to making the Sixth Congressional  District a better place to live and a safe place for everyone.                            ____________________
