 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about  something that is so important.   We always talk about the different things we can do in Congress to  help our constituents. Something I spend a lot of time on is water. It  is very important to help my local community survive, it is obviously  important for agriculture, but it is very important for those who live  and breathe in the Central Valley. Delivering water to their homes is  something that some of us outside of the area might not see threatened,  but in the Central Valley, it is something we do see.                                time  1945    But tax reform is something that has a real impact on people every  single day. The Central Valley happens to be what I would say, and I  think a lot of people would agree, some of the hardest working people  in the United States.   When you drive throughout the Central Valley and you see people out  in the fields working really hard in some of the warmest weather, some  of the hottest weather, it has a real impact on people; and giving  these people an opportunity to be able to keep more of their money is  something I think is very important.   While I don't know if this coming week people will see a simplified  system, because it hasn't taken effect yet, I know that people who work  really hard throughout the Central Valley are already starting to see  an increase in their paychecks. I have heard it myself as I have gone  around the district talking to constituents; people stopping me in the  grocery store bringing up the fact that they are already seeing things  in their paychecks. I have even had employers tell me that their  employees walked up to them and talked a little bit about the  difference they are seeing.   The Central Valley is an area that needs this more than a lot of  other areas. When you look at the median income, Central Valley, or at  least the 21st Congressional District, is about $40,000. So when you  talk about doubling the standard deduction--before this tax plan went  into place, about 83 percent of the people filed the standard  deduction. Now, with doubling that standard deduction, you are going to  see upwards of 90 to 95 percent of people filing the standard  deduction.   What does that mean? That means, in the past, people only keep about  $12,000 of their first income tax-free. Now they are going to go  forward and have the opportunity to earn $24,000 without being taxed.  So the first $24,000 isn't going to be touched, and that is impressive.  [[Page H3087]]    Then, throughout the Central Valley, a lot of folks, with their  children, having families, something that, myself, with three kids,  something I am very proud of, we are doubling the child tax credit. We  are going from $1,000 to $2,000. That is going to have an impact on  about 64,000 people in the 21st Congressional District.   Twenty-five thousand constituents own small businesses. This new law  will help them grow their businesses and help them be more successful.  In fact, some economists say that this new law will help create about  111,000 jobs in the State of California.   This tax bill is going to have a positive impact throughout the 21st  Congressional District. We are already starting to see it now, and we  are going to see it going forward.   As this new bill takes effect, people throughout the 21st  Congressional District will see an annual tax savings of about $1,300,  almost $1,400. This is real relief for people; and no matter what  anyone else goes out and says, this is not peanuts. This is not a small  amount.   $1,400 has a real impact on people being able to buy groceries; being  able to save for their kids' education; being able to keep their  families comfortable, if it is running the air conditioner or keeping  the house comfortable. These are all things that have a real impact on  people's everyday lives, so I am thrilled to be able to come here and  talk a little bit about the positive impact that we are having  throughout the 21st, and I am looking forward to seeing how much more  we do.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, my friend from southern  California, for the opportunity to be here and play a role in this.
