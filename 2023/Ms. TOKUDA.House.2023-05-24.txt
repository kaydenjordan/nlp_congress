 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the Keep  Kupuna Fed Act.   According to the most current data from the USDA, 1 in 10 kupuna, or  senior citizens, are experiencing hunger and food insecurity.   SNAP has played a critical role in preventing millions of Americans,  including our kupuna, from going hungry in the face of a public health  crisis, supply chain disruptions, and rising inflation.   While the historic 8.7 percent cost-of-living adjustment was welcome  news to more than 65 million Social Security beneficiaries, for many  kupuna, this has resulted in a net loss.   Seniors in every one of our districts across the country have lost or  will lose access to SNAP entirely, while others will see a significant  decrease in benefits because of this bump in Social Security.   That is why I introduced the Keep Kupuna Fed Act, which would exempt  title II Social Security benefits from the SNAP program's income  eligibility requirements. This ensures more kupuna stay on SNAP and  don't go hungry.   I invite my colleagues to join me in helping end senior hunger and  keep our kupuna fed by supporting this important measure.                            ____________________
