 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. In its current form,  H.R. 1181 would endanger veterans in crisis and serve as another  obstacle to addressing the crisis of veteran suicide.   We had hoped to introduce amendments which would protect veterans'  rights while ensuring their safety. By bringing this bill to the floor  under a closed rule, the majority has prevented us from doing so, from  considering other possibilities to come together in a bipartisan  fashion.   There are changes that could be made to this legislation to ensure  that it is good public policy. For instance, we could consider a  streamlined appeals process that would allow veterans erroneously  flagged by the background check system to have their status changed.   I do acknowledge the concern of the gentleman from Florida that  people with PTSD on this list may have been inappropriately flagged to  be on this list, and we could have discussed a streamlined process. We  could conduct a study of the VA's existing practices for submitting  records of veterans to the background check system.   But rather than subject that whole list to being dismantled and  freeing people that should not be free to have weapons--crazy people  from having weapons--at the very least, we should understand the impact  this change would have on veteran suicide, as Ms. Esty suggested when  she tried to offer an amendment to the Rules Committee last night to  require a study into the number of veterans who have committed suicide  by firearm, who should have been prevented from accessing a firearm  under current policies.   I do wish, Mr. Speaker, to dispute the gentleman from Colorado's  contention that this is only about going forward, that it affects going  forward. I maintain there is considerable concern that this will affect  those that exist on the list currently.  [[Page H2098]]    These are sensible ideas that I offered, that we could have  considered instead of being forced to vote on the legislation we have  now. We could come together under unanimity to solve this issue.   But under this rule, we are forced to vote only on legislation that  would make veterans and their communities less safe. Accordingly, I  call on my colleagues to oppose this rule.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1181.   The epidemic--actually, rather the tragedy--of veterans' suicide has  affected families across the country, including my own. I recall  walking home after school at the age of 10 or 11 in the month of  November--as you know, Veterans Day is in the month of November--and  hearing the news that my uncle, who lived across the street from us,  had taken his own life with a firearm. He was a Vietnam veteran, and  his memory serves as a personal reminder about the tragedy of veterans'  suicide. To this day, it continues to plague our communities with our  recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.   Of the 20 veterans who die from suicide every day, two-thirds of  those occur by firearm. Part of stopping this crisis is keeping guns  out of the hands of our most vulnerable veterans. Removing all  individuals determined by the VA to be mentally incompetent from the  National Instant Criminal Background Check System will make it easier  for a veteran in crisis to obtain a firearm.   To be clear, there are veterans currently flagged in the background  check system who should not be there, and we need to create a fair and  streamlined process for veterans to appeal their status.   But there is a balance between protecting veterans' Second Amendment  rights and protecting veterans who are a danger to themselves or  others. Immediately removing restrictions on every individual does not  strike the right balance. Instead, it rolls back the bipartisan work we  have done through the 21st Century Cures Act, and it endangers the  lives of veterans who need our help the most.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, Sergeant Major Walz  from the State of Minnesota, for yielding me time.   I also would like to say to the chairman, we had a wonderful time  traveling to Afghanistan to pay respect to our troops during  Thanksgiving. I don't have to travel across the country with him, but I  did travel halfway around the world with him.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1259.   Every Member of Congress supports accountability for employees at the  Department of Veterans Affairs--everybody. Building a culture of  excellence at the VA is critical to providing veterans the care and  support they deserve.   However, H.R. 1259 does not further this goal, or improve outcomes at  the VA. We are not going to be able to fire our way to better outcomes  at the VA.   The question posed by the VA Accountability First Act is whether  accountability or workers' rights are mutually exclusive. I, along with  many of my colleagues, believe we can respect VA employees--a third of  whom are veterans themselves--while also ensuring that poor-performing  employees are held accountable.   This legislation violates workers' rights in two very specific ways:   First, it would erode due process protections by giving employees too  little time--just 10 days--to prepare for a disciplinary hearing, and  then just 7 days to file an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection  Board.   Second, it goes much further than past accountability bills by  eliminating the use of collectively bargained grievance procedures for  frontline VA employees. Not only do collectively bargained procedures  often lead to quicker and simpler solutions, but they also give added  protection to potential whistleblowers by acting as a check against  managers who may retaliate against an employee who raises an issue.   Mr. Chairman, there is no question that we have workforce challenges  at the VA, but this bill does not solve them. Instead, it eschews the  Senate's bipartisan accountability legislation in favor of a much more  one-sided bill.   To my colleagues who voted on VA accountability legislation in the  past: This is not the same bill. It goes much further. And I ask you to  join me in opposing it.   This is the first time the majority has targeted collective  bargaining at the VA in this way. Your vote against this bill today  will show that you oppose this very tactic.   If we are serious about providing veterans the best care possible, we  should focus on removing the Federal hiring freeze, advancing the  appeals modernization bill, and other bipartisan efforts that will  immediately improve veterans' access to high-quality care and support.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in opposition to  this bill, a letter from the American Federation of Government  Employees, as well as a letter from the American Federation of Labor  and Congress of Industrial Organizations.                                                          AFSCME,                                                     March 15, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I'm writing to urge you to oppose H.R.       1259, which would eliminate collective bargaining rights and       fundamental due process rights of employees at the Department       of Veterans Affairs (VA).        The bill makes it easier to fire people for a good reason       or a bad reason. By eliminating merit-based principles for       workers facing a removal, demotion or suspension, the bill       makes it easier for management or political appointees to       scapegoat employees that advocate strongly for the veteran       patients they serve. Basic civil service due process rights       are necessary to block corruption, patronage, discrimination,       and political pressure to cover up problems in the delivery       of services to veterans.        The bill destroys the right of registered nurses and other       front-line VA employees to use a union grievance procedure to       efficiently and fairly address proposed adverse employment       actions. This is union busting.        This bill will not help improve the care to veterans from       the VA but rather make such care politicized and subject to       corrupting and corrosive influences unrelated to quality.       Moreover, this bill sets a dangerous precedent that could       subsequently harm more than one million additional federal       workers in other agencies and occupations, and the public       they serve. We urge you to vote against H.R. 1259.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                             AFGE,                                                      March 7, 2017.      Re AFGE Opposition to H.R. 1259.      Hon. Phil Roe,      Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Walz,      Ranking Member, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz: I am writing on       behalf of nearly 700,000 federal employees represented by the       American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE),       including 230,000 employees of the Department of Veterans       Affairs (VA) to urge you to oppose H.R. 1259, a bill       introduced by Representative Phil Roe (R-TN) to eliminate       collective bargaining rights and significantly cut the due       process rights of employees facing a proposed removal,       demotion, or suspension (adverse action).        H.R. 1259 is a direct assault on the union rights of every       VA employee, including more than 120,000 veterans within the       VA workforce. This bill will hurt, not fix, the VA. It will       reverse the significant improvements made over the past two       years, and will make it harder for veterans to get the       veteran-centric medical care and benefits on which they rely.        In addition to punitive, counterproductive due process       attacks recycled from earlier bills, H.R. 1259 breaks new       ground by union-busting. The bill destroys the right of every       VA front line employee to use union grievance procedures to       efficiently and fairly address proposed adverse actions. The       grievance procedure is not only part of the law but also part       of the contract negotiated between labor and management. The       only avenue that VA front line employees will have left is a       rushed management-run appeals process that does not allow       good employees enough time to gather the evidence they  [[Page H2119]]       need to defend their jobs. For medical professionals facing       proposed adverse actions related to professional conduct or       competence, the reductions in the timeframe for the agency       review process are more severe, even though their cases       typically involve complex medical issues.        In addition, all front-line employees and managers will       have weaker rights to appeal to the Merit System Protection       Board (MSPB), their first chance at an independent review.       They will only have seven days to appeal to the MSPB after       they are fired (and off the payroll), and the bill ties the       hands of the MSPB Administrative Judge (AJ) with the recycled       ``one-size-fits-all'' prohibition against mitigating the       penalty, regardless of the facts of the individual case.        When the employee loses at the MSPB (which happens in 80%       of cases now), he would have only seven days to prepare an       appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal       Circuit.        How does this impact the life of a veteran working in a VA?       What if a veteran working in a regional office processing       claims is trying to do his job in the face of unfair       allegations of poor performance by a manager who did not want       to hire a veteran and did not train him properly before       rushing him onto the job? It means that he only has ten days       to gather all the evidence he needs to respond to a proposed       removal and his manager only has five days to decide whether       to go ahead and fire him. Therefore, 15 days after learning       that he may be fired, he has no job and no paycheck. Then he       has one week to get his appeal to the MSPB, during which he       must hire an attorney if he can afford one, where the AJ       cannot give him a suspension or demotion even if the judge       believes that the facts dictate a less severe punishment than       removal. When the MSPB upholds the decision to fire him, he       has just one week to prepare his appeal to a federal appeals       court (and again, hire an attorney if he can afford one),       while he is without a job and without a paycheck.        Just last month, Chairman Roe stated that ``the men and       women who have fought for our great nation should never have       to struggle to find a job,'' but his bill attacks every       option that veterans in the VA workforce have to save their       jobs in the face of unjustified firings.        Chairman Roe has also expressed his intentions to reduce       mismanagement at the VA, but his bill weakens the critical       protections that VA employees need to speak up against       mismanagement and patient harm. Every day, employees       throughout the VA report concerns to management that directly       impact patient safety, health care access, processing of       disability claims, and many other functions essential to the       agency mission.        Chairman Roe opposes the hiring freeze because he       understands how critical it is for veterans who depend on the       VA to have a ``robust clinical workforce.'' Yet his bill       singles out VA employees, including every clinician caring       for veterans, for worse treatment than other federal       employees through recoupment of compensation already earned,       including pensions, relocation bonuses, and performance       bonuses. These provisions are unnecessary and violate due       process. There are already ample safeguards in the law       against retention of improper relocation and performance       bonuses, and the VA has already dismantled the relocation       bonus program that was the subject of abuse allegations. In       addition, this bill directly contradicts private sector law       that forbids the recoupment of pensions.        Thank you for considering the views of AFGE. If you need       more information, please contact Marilyn Park of my staff.            Sincerely,                                                 J. David Cox, Sr.,      National President.                                   ____                                                          AFL-CIO,                                                      March 8, 2017.      Hon. Phil Roe,      Chair, House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Walz,      Ranking Member, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz: On behalf of the       AFL-CIO, I urge you to reject the VA Accountability First Act       (H.R. 1259), introduced by Chairman David Roe. H.R. 1259 is a       thinly veiled effort to destroy union rights and shift the       blame for management failures at the VA onto the backs of       front line employees.        The bill severely truncates the appeals process in current       law and destroys grievance procedures that have been       successfully used throughout the federal government to       provide stability and protection against arbitrary treatment,       and with it any guarantee that employees will feel safe       speaking out against mismanagement or to protect patient       safety.        Rather than building a culture of trust at the VA, H.R.       1259 would turn back the clock to an era when employees could       be fired with the slightest justification and almost no       opportunity to mount an effective defense. Worse, the bill       would single out VA employees for harsher treatment than       other federal workers, including the recoupment of       compensation already earned without adequate due process,       including pension benefits, and relocation and performance       bonuses.        The Roe bill reflects the Chairman's opposition to       collective bargaining and the crucial role labor       organizations play in giving federal workers a voice on the       job. For the 120,000 veterans who work at the VA, this bill       is not only a slap in the face but a betrayal of the promise       that they would be guaranteed fair treatment if they came to       work for the federal government.        We urge you to reject H.R. 1259.            Sincerely,                                          William Samuel, Director,                                     Government Affairs Department.     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment in the nature of a substitute would strike  the text of H.R. 1259 and insert a new provision allowing the Secretary  to suspend, without pay, any VA employee whose performance or  misconduct threatens public health or safety, including the health and  safety of veterans. It would give the Secretary the authority to remove  a suspended employee after an investigation and review if the Secretary  determines removal is in the interests of public health and safety.   Both parties share the desire to protect veterans from mistreatment  or harm, especially when they are seeking medical care at a VA  facility, but the language in my amendment would be more likely to  achieve the majority's stated outcome of removing VA employees whose  misconduct harms veterans.   We have voted on similar accountability bills before, but I want to  point out that this bill goes much further in the wrong direction.  While in the past we have had disagreements on procedure and the amount  of time an employee is given to file an appeal, for the very first  time, this version of the accountability bill is attempting to  undermine VA employees' collective bargaining rights.   Buried in this bill is a new provision that would take away the  rights of frontline VA employees to use collectively bargained  agreements for settling grievances. This has not been a part of past  negotiations, and the vote that Members take on the underlying bill  should not be based solely on their votes on previous accountability  bills.   Collectively bargained grievance settlement procedures often lead to  quicker and simpler solutions, and they give added protection to  potential whistleblowers. When these basic protections are undermined,  we give too much power to managers whose goal may be to retaliate  against someone who called out a mistake.   The bill, as it is currently being offered, does not provide enough  time for an employee to get their case together to file an appeal. It  undermines collective bargaining agreements negotiated in good faith  between management and employees. It doesn't do enough to protect  whistleblowers.   My amendment addresses our shared goal to create accountability at  the VA. It would ensure that the Secretary has the authority to  immediately suspend any VA employee whose behavior threatens the health  and safety of veterans, and that the suspended employee does not accrue  pay while the investigation is being carried out.   I hope that Members will join me and vote in favor of my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose the underlying bill and  support my amendment.   I would assert that my amendment would apply to many of the employees  in the scandals who were cited by our esteemed chairman.   I want to remind the body that several Republican speakers this  afternoon repeated a phrase that the vast majority of employees at the  VA are doing a good job. My amendment really does address those few  employees who really do pose a threat to veterans' safety or health.   I would also say that I want to remind also the chairman and inform  the body that we heard testimony from the bipartisan Commission on Care  established through the Choice Act. They were charged with the  responsibility of reviewing VA health care.   One of the co-chairs was appointed by a Republican--I believe the  Senate majority leader--and the other by the White House. They both  reported back that we cannot create excellence at the VA through  enhancing the firing process.   They were astounded that more effort and resources have not been  invested in the personnel function of the VA to better train our  managers in progressive discipline and to do the kind of documentation  that really will bring about effective accountability.   By the way, both of these co-chairs led, and do still, large, private  sector healthcare organizations. They pushed back on a suggestion that  we needed to enhance our dismissal process, our accountability process.  [[Page H2132]]    I do agree with the chairman and the ranking member that we have an  opportunity to work together as Democrats and Republicans. We are not  far apart on the bipartisan agreement that came out of the Senate.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
