 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3372 authorizes the Attorney General to provide  grants to community-based nonprofits to operate one stop reentry  centers.   The biggest problem, though, is the Department of Justice already  does exactly what this bill would require it to do.   The Second Chance Act of 2007, reauthorized by Congress and signed  into law by President Trump in the First Step Act of 2018, provides  comprehensive assistance to individuals in transition from prison back  to the community. This bill is duplicative. It is redundant, and maybe,  most importantly, the Democrats know that.   Last Congress, the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland  Security held a hearing. The majority's own briefing memo for that  hearing highlighted the reporting center in Somerset County,  Pennsylvania. And the center said this: It was a community-based  correctional program that has been designed to provide services for its  participants at one location.   This is the exact type of program outlined in H.R. 3372. And indeed  the center's program received a grant from the Justice Department's  Bureau of Justice Assistance.   In fact, the name of that grant is Smart Supervision: Reducing Prison  Populations, Saving Money, and Creating Safer Communities.   H.R. 3372 is duplicative of efforts found in the Second Chance Act  under which nonprofit entities are eligible for grant funds. While we  want successful reentry programs to reduce recidivism, we should not be  creating duplicative and additional bureaucracy in the process.   Also, the bill encourages State, Indian Tribes, and local governments  to employ sex offenders, murderers, and human traffickers, and other  dangerous criminals to operate the reentry service assistance hotlines.   H.R. 3372 authorizes $7.5 million in grants to States, Indian Tribes,  and local governments to operate these reentry service assistance  hotlines that direct individuals to local reentry services.   It requires the Attorney General to give preference to applicants who  would employ people to operate the hotlines, ``who have been convicted  of an offense or have served a term of imprisonment and have completed  any court-ordered supervision. But the bill provides no exceptions for  violent offenders, such as sex offenders, murderers, human traffickers,  and other dangerous criminals.   While it might be appropriate to employ certain offenders who have  demonstrated full rehabilitation, Congress should not be incentivizing  local communities to hire certain offenders who may not have been  rehabbed.   What should we be doing? Spending our time, our limited time, in  addressing the rampant crime epidemic in America. Cities are rejecting  lenient, soft-on-crime policies and encouraging prosecutors to actually  enforce the law.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), a respected member of the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I would just point out there is nothing in  the bill that requires that you screen these individuals. It says you  are supposed to hire these folks with that past criminal record to  answer the hotlines. That is what the bill says. If you want to amend  it to say no, that they have to be screened even more before you let  them answer the phones, that is not what the legislation says.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Again, I would just point out that that is not what the legislation  says. It says the Attorney General shall give preference for hiring  folks, that I described in my opening statement, to answer these  hotlines.   So what the gentlewoman from Texas, my friend, said is just not  accurate. It doesn't reflect what is in the bill itself.   That's not the first thing she said today that is not accurate.  Earlier, the gentlewoman made a statement. I wrote it down: Isolated  programs will not help Americans.   How do you know?                                time  1300    Which isolated programs are you talking about?   I assume you were talking about the one I referenced in Pennsylvania  that is doing exactly the same thing this bill seeks to do.   Have you checked that program out?   If they don't help Americans, then whom do they help?   Are they helping illegal immigrants?   I don't know.   Again, all I am saying is it is important when we have these debates  we stick to the facts.  [[Page H8684]]    For the reasons I outlined before, Mr. Speaker, we oppose the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, it requires the Department of Justice to  issue a report. Seeing how the Department of Justice is already doing  what is authorized in this bill, it would be kind of nice, frankly, to  have this report done before we spend an additional $59 million over  the next several years.   Mr. Speaker, for the reason we outlined against the legislation  itself--it is redundant, it allows people with a violent past to work  at these facilities, and it actually encourages them to be the  preference for answering the hotlines at these facilities, and for  those reasons we are opposed to the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment as well, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
