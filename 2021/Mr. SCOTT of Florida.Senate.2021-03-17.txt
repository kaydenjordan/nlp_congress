 Madam President, I am proud to join my  colleagues in celebration of Sunshine Week and promote the importance  of government openness and transparency. Transparency isn't something  you see too much up here in Washington. Being accountable to the  American people should be a basic function of government.   In Florida, we have sunshine laws to promote openness and build our  citizens' trust in government. When I came to Washington, I made it my  mission to bring the success and transparency we had in Florida to the  Federal Government and make this dysfunctional place work for the  American people.   Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues have blocked nearly every  single one of my efforts for transparency and requests for information  to help Congress make the best decisions for American families.   Last month, I wrote to President Biden's Acting Director for the  Office of Management and Budget requesting any documents related to  enacted but currently unspent COVID-19 stimulus funding. The response?  None. Total silence.   This month, as we considered the Democrats' wasteful and partisan  $1.9 trillion COVID spending package, I introduced a resolution calling  on President Biden to inform the Senate and the American people of how  much unspent funds are left over from the previous COVID spending  bills, but Democrats blocked it.   When my colleague Senator Johnson called for their massive, 600-page  bill to be read on the floor so the American people could know exactly  what was in the bill, Democrats complained and called it a waste of  time.   Let me be clear. Being transparent, open, and accountable to the  American people is actually never a waste of time; it is our job. That  is why I have been working on several measures to bring sunshine  transparency to Washington, including my bill to make sure Members of  Congress work for the American people and actually read bills before  casting their votes and my STOP COVID-19 Act to set vaccine  distribution reporting and transparency standards for States and create  a program for cities and counties to increase funding, testing, contact  tracing, and transparency efforts in order to reduce the spread of  COVID.   I will never stop fighting to bring sunshine to Washington and  working to make sure our government and the Biden administration are  transparent, open, and accountable to the American people who elected  us to serve.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, the first thing I would like  to do is correct what my colleague from Pennsylvania said with regard  to preexisting conditions.   I was here last year. I brought to the floor a bill that would say it  didn't matter what the Supreme Court did; we would make sure that we  could keep preexisting conditions if the Supreme Court declared that  the Affordable Care Act was not constitutional. The Democrats blocked  it.   I have been up here 2 years, and I have never seen once my Republican  colleagues want to reduce spending for Medicaid.   What I do think is unfair is, in my State of Florida, what money we  receive from the Federal Government is significantly less per person  than what a State like New York has. So I would like changes to the  Medicaid Program. I would like it to be a fair program in which States  like Florida will get treated just as well as States like New York.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 798    Madam President, I rise today to discuss an insane issue in the  Democrats' COVID spending bill that we need to fix.   Tucked into the Democratic bill is a provision to give $1,400  stimulus checks to inmates. That is right. As our Nation faces a public  health crisis and a crippling debt crisis, Democrats are handing out  stimulus checks with your tax dollars to Federal inmates who don't pay  income taxes, have all their needs--food and medical expenses  included--paid for by taxpayers, and they do nothing to stimulate the  economy. It simply doesn't make sense.   My friends and colleagues, Senators Bill Cassidy, Tom Cotton, and Ted  Cruz, tried to fix this by introducing an amendment to strip this out  of the Democratic bill, but the Democrats wouldn't have it.   Senate Democrats voted unanimously to block the passage of that good  amendment and chose instead to waste even more taxpayer dollars by  sending $1,400 checks to inmates.   Let's talk about what that means for American taxpayers. There are  nearly 1.5 million State and Federal inmates incarcerated in Federal  prisons across the United States. These are people convicted of  committing serious crimes and victimizing their fellow Americans.   Under this bill the Democrats passed, American taxpayers are on the  hook for $1,400 checks to some of the most heinous people we have ever  seen. I am talking about people like the racist Charleston Church  shooter, Dylann Roof; serial rapist and predator, Larry Nassar;  aspiring terrorist, Muhammad Dakhlalla, who tried to join ISIS and is  now in prison in Georgia; convicted serial killer and rapist, Mark  Goudeau, who is on death row in Arizona; convicted cop killer, Michael  Addison, who is on death row in New Hampshire; and the monster who  killed 17 innocent Floridians in Parkland at Marjory Stoneman Douglas  High School on February 14, 2018.   How could anyone--anyone--possibly justify sending checks to these  people?   If we send $1,400 checks to all State and Federal inmates, all 1.5  million, that is more than $2 billion--$2 billion in taxpayer money  going to stimulus checks for inmates.   That is $2 billion that could be used to help our small businesses  recover; $2 billion that could be used to enhance vaccine development  and distribution so that more Americans can get the shots they need to  move us forward and away from this virus; $2 billion that could be used  to pay down some of our massive debt. There are so many positive uses  for these funds that provide a real return for American taxpayers, but  sending them to inmates isn't one of them. It is an unjustifiable  expense that does nothing to fight COVID-19.   Today, I ask for full support of this body to strip this bad policy  from law. We cannot forget that America is in a  [[Page S1595]]  debt crisis. I have been talking about it for a while, and I won't stop  talking about it because it is a crisis my Democratic colleagues still  don't seem to understand.   Right now, our Nation is headed toward $30 trillion in debt. Think  about that--$30 trillion. The U.S. debt will be equal to $240,000 per  taxpayer. That is insane. And what are the Democrats doing to rein in  this unsustainable debt? Absolutely nothing.   In fact, the Democrats' wasteful and untargeted spending bill, which  will raise the debt from $28 trillion to $30 trillion contains loads of  handouts and provisions, just like this one, that recklessly spend on  their priorities unrelated to COVID.   That is why I sent a letter to the Biden administration on Monday,  urging him to rescind hundreds of billions in waste from this bill and  create a targeted approach Americans truly need.   It is clear that Democrats are living in a fantasy land where debt  doesn't matter, spending has no consequences, and inflation is  impossible. Of course, reasonable Americans know that is not true   The Biden administration needs to take immediate action to request  the rescission of the non-COVID-related, liberal agenda-driven, and  wasteful funding found throughout this bill.   So I will keep fighting to cut down on this liberal wish list. Today,  we can start that important work and pass my bill to not only save $2  billion from going to inmates who have no need for the money, but also  show the American people that Congress is committed to remaining fully  accountable to the American people for the proper stewardship of tax  dollars.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the immediate consideration of S. 798, introduced earlier today. I  further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Madam President, it is hard to imagine that my  colleague just rose in opposition to this good bill.   Let's be clear. By objecting to this bill, Democrats are standing in  full support of spending $2 billion to send $1,400 checks to inmates.  Democrats want to spend $2 billion in taxpayer money to send checks to  people in prison, convicted of committing serious crimes and  victimizing their fellow Americans.   That means Democrats are saying that they want American taxpayers to  be on the hook for $1,400 checks to some of the most heinous criminals  we have ever seen--people like Dylann Roof and the Parkland shooter.   How can anyone justify sending checks to these people? Let's  remember, inmates don't pay income taxes. They have all their needs,  food and medical expenses included, paid for by taxpayers. They don't  do anything to stimulate our economy.   I do hope my colleague will reconsider his objection and stand with  me in putting accountability to American taxpayers over this insane  policy that does nothing but throw $2 billion we don't have out the  window.   Thank you, Madam President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
