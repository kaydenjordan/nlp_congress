 Mr. President, I am pleased to advise the Senate  of the 150th anniversary of Sigma Nu Fraternity, a principles-based  men's fraternal organization with more than 160 chapters on college  campuses in the United States, approximately 12,000 current collegiate  members, and more than 250,000 initiates in its history. This year,  Sigma Nu celebrates the 150th anniversary of its public founding on  January 1, 1869, at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, VA.  Cadets James Frank Hopkins, James McIlvaine Riley, and Greenfield  Quarles joined together to form Sigma Nu as a brotherhood committed to  the principles of love, honor, and truth and in firm opposition to  hazing. Sigma Nu Fraternity remains the only men's college fraternity  founded in direct opposition to hazing. Its history and its mission to  develop ethical leaders for today's society are worthy of the highest  esteem.   Originally founded as the Legion of Honor, Sigma Nu's central  founding value is honor, and the concept that a man's character and  conduct should always be governed by a high sense of honor guides all  its work. This value is as relevant 150 years later as it was then.   For 150 years, members of Sigma Nu have led in their respective  communities, professions, and families. From NASA to the Pentagon, from  the arts to the sciences, and from business to public service, there  are few facets of American life and history in which a Sigma Nu  initiate has not made his mark.   When this Nation has called upon its citizen-soldiers, Sigma Nu  initiates have answered that call. They have fought and died in every  major conflict since the Civil War. Its members are veterans of every  branch of the Armed Forces, including two Medal of Honor recipients.  Sigma Nus have understood the price of freedom and been willing to make  the ultimate sacrifice for it.  [[Page S2269]]    The 12,000 collegiate members on campuses across the country today  serve their communities in student government, interfraternity  councils, athletic teams, and other student organizations. Last year,  these young future leaders of our Nation performed over 375,000 hours  of community service and raised over $2 million for philanthropic  causes.   Whether it is through its award-winning ethical leadership  development program, LEAD, or through the mentorship of more than 2,000  volunteer advisors, Sigma Nu continues to be at the forefront of  developing the minds, hearts, and character of its initiates, inspiring  them to excel with the timeless value of honor.   Today, in its 150th year, Sigma Nu Fraternity calls upon its  initiates to renew that legacy, to reflect on the principles of its  founders, and to commit to a strong future for this esteemed  brotherhood. As a proud initiate of Sigma Nu Fraternity, I would like  to congratulate the fraternity on achieving 150 years of love, honor,  and truth and to wish it many more years to come.                            ____________________
