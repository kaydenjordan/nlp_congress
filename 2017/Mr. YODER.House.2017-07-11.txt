 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter  be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 392, a bill originally  introduced by Representative Chaffetz of Utah, for the purposes of  adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of  rule XII.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 17-year-old Erin  Smith of Shawnee Mission West High School in Overland Park in my  district at home in Kansas.   Erin recently won the International BioGENEius Challenge held in San  Diego, California, earning $7,500 for her research with the award from  the Biotechnology Institute.   The International BioGENEius Challenge pushes high school students  from across the world to find solutions to healthcare, sustainability,  and environmental needs through biotechnology.   Erin's research and work focused on Parkinson's disease which affects  about 7 to 10 million people worldwide and about 60,000 new patients in  America each year. Erin coded a website that can record the facial  expressions of subjects using special software which enabled her to  discover early indicators of Parkinson's disease. She then built an  algorithm that could be used as a diagnostic tool.   Mr. Speaker, Erin sounds like one of the world's foremost  researchers, but she is only a rising senior at Shawnee Mission West.  She is truly incredible.   I congratulate her and wish her the best in what is just the  beginning of a long journey helping many people living with this  dreaded disease.                            ____________________
