 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week, the Senate will vote on two  bills that will protect our most vulnerable citizens--literally, our  babies. The first bill we will vote on is the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act, which was introduced by our colleague from  Nebraska, Senator Sasse.   This legislation is simple and straightforward. It requires  physicians and healthcare providers to treat babies who survive an  abortion with the same lifesaving care that other infants born at the  same stage receive. While you might be forgiven for wondering, why  would we need such a bill; surely, that standard must already exist in  our law--unfortunately, no. There are no Federal laws requiring  healthcare providers to care for abortion survivors, just as they would  for any other infant in their care.   One of the most notorious reasons why we need this law sits in the  Governor's mansion in Virginia. About this time last year, our country  was shocked and outraged by comments made by Gov. Ralph Northam--a  pediatrician, believe it or not--about what should happen when a baby  is delivered and survives an abortion. He said:         The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept       comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what       the mother and family desired. And then a discussion would       ensue between the physicians and the mother.    Rather than immediately doing everything possible to save the baby,  to provide the same sort of care he would to any infant, he wants to  sit around and decide whether the baby will live or die. That is not  healthcare; that is infanticide. Voting for the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act is how each Member of this Chamber can go on  record to say they are against killing innocent babies.   While some are desperately trying to paint this as an anti-abortion  bill, which would infringe on women's reproductive rights, those claims  could not be further from the truth. There is nothing in this bill  about limiting access to abortion, no mention of first, second, or  third trimester abortions, nothing about overturning Roe v. Wade.   There is one goal with this legislation and one goal only: to give  every baby a fighting chance. In a rational world, we wouldn't be  having this discussion but would, rather, unanimously be condemning  this practice for the evil that it is. I am proud to be an original  cosponsor of the bill and, once again, vote to stop the practice of  infanticide and protect babies who survive abortions alive.   We will be voting on a second bill, which will provide protections  for unborn children that are practiced in almost all of the civilized  world. This is the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act that would  make it a crime for doctors to perform abortions on unborn babies at or  beyond 20 weeks.   There is significant medical research that shows that unborn children  at this stage experience pain. At 5 months into a pregnancy, these  babies are beyond halfway to delivery.   One of President's Trump's guests at the State of the Union a few  weeks ago was 2-year-old Ellie Schneider--one of the youngest babies to  survive in the United States. Ellie was born at 21 weeks and 6 days-- just 13 days beyond the point in time we are discussing. She weighed  less than a pound at birth and is living proof of the medical  achievements and advancements that have improved the chance of survival  for extremely premature babies.   Ellie and her mother Robin are an example of the impact this  legislation would have on the lives of many Americans families.  Unfortunately, just as our Democratic colleagues have tried to deceive  the American people about the purpose of the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act, they are trying to mislead everyone about  what this bill would do as well.   First, this bill would apply only to elective abortions, not those  involving rape or incest or where the life of the mother could be in  danger. It in no way places the mother in legal jeopardy for seeking an  abortion. It clearly and solely places responsibility on healthcare  providers.  [[Page S1099]]    Passing this legislation wouldn't make the United States an extreme  outlier when it comes to abortion practices. In fact, it would put us  in line with international norms. Currently, only seven countries in  the world allow elective abortions after 20 weeks. One, of course, is  the United States. The other countries on the list should make all of  us second-guess allowing abortions beyond 20 weeks--China, Vietnam,  North Korea. Countries with a history of human rights violations are  hardly the model we should aspire to.   It is time to give every baby a chance to live and stop doctors from  performing abortions on infants who feel pain. I am proud to be a  cosponsor of both of these bills and stand with my colleagues in the  fight for human life.   Our friend from Montana, Senator Daines, established the first-ever  Senate Pro-Life Caucus to fight for the lives of our most vulnerable  citizens. A couple of weeks ago, he said: ``These back-to-back votes  will present an opportunity for Senate Democrats and all of us to show  the American people whether there are any limits at all to radical  abortion extremism.'' We will soon learn the answer.   I appreciate our colleagues--Senator Sasse, Senator Graham, and  Senator Daines--for their leadership on this legislation and for  consistently fighting for the most vulnerable among us. I will be a  proud ``yes'' vote on both of these bills--yes to protecting newborn  babies, yes to equal medical care for all infants, and yes to a  fighting chance for all babies.
