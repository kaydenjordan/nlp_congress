 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent that the scheduled vote occur  immediately.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Lester Carter,  who passed away on January 31, 2022, at the age of 90. Dr. Carter was a  pharmacist who founded one of Milwaukee's first Black-owned pharmacies  and worked there for over five decades.   Dr. Carter enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean war. He  was sent to the Hospital Corpsman School in Portsmouth, VA, for  training in healthcare and was later assigned to the USS Tortuga for 2  and a half years. After being discharged in 1954, he attended pharmacy  school at Creighton University in Omaha, NE, and became the school's  first African-American graduate in 1958. Dr. Carter worked at a  ``Whites only'' pharmacy in Omaha for 6 years, only being allowed to  work in the backroom out of public view.   After filling in at a pharmacy in Milwaukee, WI, Dr. Carter was  offered a position at the store and moved to the city. He then began  looking for his own store and found out about a pharmacy located on  North 24th and West Burleigh where the owners wanted to retire. Dr.  Carter purchased the pharmacy and set up shop in what at the time was a  majority White and German neighborhood. Dr. Carter learned German  phrases and quickly earned a great deal of respect and trust from his  customers.  [[Page S571]]    During his career on Burleigh Street, Dr. Carter always welcomed  everyone with a smile. He touched thousands of lives in positive ways,  making time to talk and get to know his customers well. Dr. Carter saw  many children grow up and become adults during his career, and some  went on to become pharmacists due to his influence.   Dr. Carter never retired after his pharmacy merged with Hayat,  working part-time as the pharmacy's herbal specialist. Recognizing  people's concern for medication side effects he developed 12 herbal  formulas to resolve health issues his customers were having. He always  listened to customer concerns and invested himself into the care of the  community.   Dr. Carter served as an example for Milwaukee on how to break down  barriers. He treated everyone with dignity and respect. A common  consensus was that once you left his store, you were already feeling  better just by being in his presence. In 2018, North 24th Street was  named in his honor. While Dr. Carter will be missed, he will be  remembered by the generations of families he helped take care of and by  the community he helped shape.                            ____________________
