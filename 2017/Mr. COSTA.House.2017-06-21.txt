 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for  yielding me time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to commend my colleagues for this  commonsense legislation. As a result of drought and the bark beetle,  there are an estimated over 107 million dead trees in over 33 million  acres of forests in California, and it is also throughout the West.  Part of this is due to climate change, which is one of the most vexing  challenges of our time.    This unprecedented tree mortality has created serious fire risk of  wildfires throughout the West. Today, in California, in the Central  Valley, we have record temperatures of 109 degrees and 112 degrees.  Obviously, that adds to the concern.   One thing that can be done, though, to prevent wildfires is to manage  and control the amount of vegetation, particularly in areas where we  have increased fire risk. We just, bottom line, have to manage our  forests a lot better than we are. We are putting way too much of our  budget for managing our forests to putting out fires, and that must  change.   But an example of a location with higher fire risk is a utility  corridor with exposed electrical lines that we have throughout the West  in forested areas.   In 2015, the Butte fire in northern California, which was the seventh  most destructive in California's history, was sparked by a tree that  came into contact with a power line. This is easily prevented by  removing those trees that could damage lines, reducing fire risk and  the cost of repairs to the utility ratepayers, plus the people in the  surrounding area, which these fires are devastating, and sometimes  lives are lost as well as property.                                time  1515    H.R. 1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act, if  enacted, would create a process to expedite routine maintenance of  vegetation along electric utilities in and near utility corridors and  would help prevent future tragedies like the 2015 Butte fire in  northern California that was devastating, once again.   The bottom line is that we must do more, and we can. I concur that we  should utilize the Stafford Act for forest fires, and that would free  up more money to manage the forests. But that is a separate piece of  legislation that, hopefully, we will get a chance to act on.   This is a separate piece, and I urge support of this commonsense  legislation, for my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
