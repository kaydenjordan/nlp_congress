 Madam President, I come to the floor today following  my friend, the Senator from Maine, at a critical moment for our country  and for the United States. Americans, as we know, are facing an  unprecedented health and economic crisis that has gripped our country  for over 9 months. But, sadly, that is not what brings us to the Senate  floor today. It is not why the Republican leader has called the Senate  into session.   Is it to pass the legislation that we need to pass, to carry on the  work of the CARES Act, to help people out in our country right now when  nearly every State is starting to see increases in this virus again?  That is not why we are here. On this rainy, cold Sunday in October,  instead of meeting to debate and vote on a comprehensive bill to  provide relief to the American people during this soul-crunching  pandemic, we are instead here today because our Republican colleagues  insist on rushing through the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to  be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, to fill the vacancy  left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   Let me start with Justice Ginsburg because that is really where it  all starts. Justice Ginsburg was an icon. She was celebrated well into  her eighties by people young and old. I will never forget my own  daughter when we were at an event and got a photo with Justice  Ginsburg. My daughter was just in college. We had that nice photo of  the three of us, and she said to me: Mom, I am going to cut you out of  this because I want to put it on Facebook, and the ``Notorious RBG'' is  just so cool.   Justice Ginsburg made justice cool because Justice Ginsburg  understood that justice is supposed to be about people, and it is  supposed to be about the Constitution. She started when no one gave her  a chance, going to law school when there were hardly any girls going to  law school. In fact, they told her not to, and she ends up graduating  first in her class. She then comes up with landmark theories on equal  protection, and she is told maybe a man should argue these cases  because they are so important and a man would have a better chance of  winning them. She said: No, I will do them myself. And she wins five  out of six cases. She ends up on the Supreme Court, writing landmark  opinions and infamous dissents.   At her memorial in the Capitol, it was the rabbi--and I was so  honored to be there, a moment I will never forget--and the rabbi said:  You know, those dissents, those weren't cries for defeat, they were  blueprints for the future.   That is how I must think of this moment in time, as we are in the  middle of voting, as over 50 million Americans have already cast their  ballots, making their voices heard, that you can't take away the fact  that this nomination was plopped down in the middle of an election,  which is what I have argued from the beginning.   This will not be a cry of defeat for the people of this country who  care about Justice Ginsburg's legacy--her legacy on protecting women's  rights, her legacy on voting rights, her legacy on so many other  fundamental issues to the people of this country.   We know what her last fervent wish was. Those were her words,  ``fervent wish.'' Only Justice Ginsburg would use those words at the  end of her life, but she did. She said that her last fervent wish was  that the next President--the President who wins this election--should  be able to pick the person to take her place.   That is what she asked for. That is what so many Americans--the  majority of Americans--think should happen there. But that is not what  is happening. We are not doing what we should be doing, and people are  watching.   More than 220,000 Americans have lost their lives. So many families  have lost loved ones. Millions more have gotten sick or no longer have  jobs. People are scared for themselves and their families. Moms are  trying to balance their toddlers on their knees and their laptops on  their desks. They are having to teach first graders how to use the mute  button. But instead of working to pass a relief package--something that  74 percent of the people want us to be doing right now--that is right,  when they were asked, Do you think we should be pushing through a judge  or working on pandemic relief, 74 percent of the people said: You  should be working on pandemic relief. But instead, we are here, not in  a rush to justice but a  [[Page S6495]]  rush to put in a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.   The President has made his intent clear. In fact, he, in his  inimitable way, sent out a tweet on his intent. He said: If I win the  Presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing, unlike  Bush's appointee, John Roberts, on ObamaCare.   This is no surprise, I guess. The Affordable Care Act is something my  Republican colleagues have been trying to repeal for 10 years. Just 1  week after election day, the Court will hear a challenge to the law  coming out of the State of Texas that millions of people are depending  on for healthcare--especially during this pandemic, after we learn more  and more about people who have gotten COVID, who then end up struggling  later. Of course, what would that be called? That would be called a  preexisting condition. Yet this is what this President and my  Republican colleagues are focused on.   The American people--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--are  continuing to face reality--not this reality in this Chamber tonight,  but the reality in their lives--once again, misplaced priorities in a  rush to do what the President wants.   The coronavirus is, in fact, still raging across our country because  of the President's failed leadership. That is true. His lies, his  refusal to listen to science--cases have been up, as I noted, in about  two-thirds of the States in just the last few weeks.   The President was first told about the potential for this virus in  January. He was telling people he knew, behind closed doors, that it  was airborne and it was deadly. He knew that back in February. He said  it would go away, though. To the public, he said: This will go away by  Easter. He said: People will be back in church by Easter.   There are people who went to church around that time in Minnesota who  died. He said it would go away with warmer weather. We all know that  these things did not happen.   For me, this is personal, like it is for so many Americans. My  husband got sick with coronavirus. He got really sick. He ended up with  pneumonia in the hospital, on oxygen, for over a week. Why is this so  personal for me, what the President says about this? Because back then,  we were just cleaning off every surface in our house, which, of course,  is still important now. But we thought, oh, that is good. We will just  clean off everything, wash everything. But the President, we now know-- we found out about a month or two ago--back in March, he knew it was  airborne, but he said he didn't want to tell the American people  because--well, he thought it might panic people. He didn't tell you the  truth.   Now, we know that at least 130,000 American lives could have been  saved if the President had taken real action early on. That comes out  of a new study from Columbia. That is 130,000 families who would still  have their mom or dad or grandparent with them at the table, with them  at the table this Thanksgiving--if the President had done what we  needed to get testing in place, to do contact tracing, to listen to the  experts.   And, no, it is not just the Big Ten football, as much as we love Big  Ten football in Minnesota. It is not just those players who should be  able to have that testing. It is not just the people in the White House  who should be able to have that testing. There are consequences of this  failed leadership. The American people who are dealing with this  pandemic are not concerned about the false claims in the President's 3  a.m. rants or his attempts to relitigate the 2016 election right now.  They are just trying to make it through the day. They need help. But  instead of giving them that help, here we are, once again, jamming  through a nominee.   In fact, according to reports, Senator McConnell is actively telling  the White House not to negotiate on a bipartisan package, just so the  Senate would do this. They have broken promise after promise. They have  blown every precedent. They have ignored all logic and taken on every  risk, just to push this nomination through.   Why the rush? Well, I can give you some ideas. One, as I mentioned,  just 1 week after the election, just 2 weeks from now, the Supreme  Court will consider the future of the Affordable Care Act. We also  know--and this is coming directly from the President, via tweet--that  he wants the Justices to potentially count the ballots--those are his  words, not mine--and that he wants nine Justices on that Court.   No, I will not concede that this election will end up in Court, not  the way people are voting, not the numbers we are seeing out there, not  the reality that people are facing, but that is what he wants in place.   Everything is on the ballot, but many of these things end up in  Court. We know that. And during the Judiciary hearing, many of my  colleagues would act like the Supreme Court was some far away, distant  ivory tower institution, debating things and talking about things, and  in their words, like the Dormant Commerce Clause. That is true, they  decide cases on the Dormant Commerce Clause.   What else do they decide? They decide who you can marry. They decide  where you can go to school. They decide if you can use contraception.  They decide all kinds of things. They decide if you can vote. They  decide if you can have healthcare. All those things are decided in the  Supreme Court.   What is on the ballot when it comes to healthcare? What is before us  with this Justice? The Affordable Care Act. What is this about?   I still remember the day that we passed the bill. I was here early in  the morning on Christmas Eve. And I also remember the day when our  colleagues tried to repeal the bill, and my friend, Senator McCain,  actually whispered to me what he was going to do before he did it. But  he came in, and he put a big thumbs down while he himself struggled-- struggled--with his own life.   What did the Affordable Care Act mean to people? Millions of people  got coverage and millions of people who weren't able to get coverage  before--and then for everyone, even people who had coverage before,  they got something that they so badly needed, and that is, protection  from being kicked off your health insurance for preexisting conditions.   What else did it mean? Young people can stay on their parents'  insurance until the age of 26. What a difference that makes. It makes a  difference for people like Evelyn and Maraya, identical twins from  Cambridge, MN, honor roll students and star athletes. They play  basketball, and they also play softball. One is a pitcher and one is a  catcher. One of them was born and early on got severe diabetes when she  was very young. Does it matter which one, the pitcher or the catcher?  They both deserve good healthcare, especially now when they both know  they have diabetes. But early on, did it matter which one? They both  deserve good healthcare.   There are people like Steve, a senior from Tower, MN, who has a heart  condition and relies on his prescription medication to stay alive; like  Elijah from St. Paul, who was born with cerebral palsy, and because of  the Affordable Care Act, is now 16 and a proud Boy Scout; or Christie,  a mom from Bloomington whose daughter had a tumor; like Casie, whose  brother lives in Alexandria and has chronic kidney failure and needs a  transplant. Without the ACA, her brother will die waiting for a  transplant. And then, like Emily, from Minneapolis, whose mom was  diagnosed with breast cancer; or Burnette from the suburbs of St. Paul,  whose daughter has multiple sclerosis and depends on the ACA; or Janet  from Rochester, whose brother has a mental illness; or Liliana from  Fridley, who has a 21-year-old son with autism and needs her children  to be able to stay on her insurance until they are 26; or Melanie, a  senior from Duluth, who is treated for ovarian cancer and needs access  to healthcare.   Repeal after repeal after repeal attempt, that is what has been  happening here. And none of that worked. So what happened? A case was  brought in Texas, and the administration is now before the Supreme  Court arguing that the entire Affordable Care Act, not just one  provision, they are arguing--and let me be clear about this--that the  entire Affordable Care Act, all those provisions and all the coverage I  just mentioned, should be thrown out.   During Judge Barrett's hearing, there was a lot of talk from my  colleagues on the other side about the doctrine of severability, which  the Supreme Court has said includes the presumption in favor of  throwing out part  [[Page S6496]]  of a statute in order to save the rest. Their point, I suppose, was  that the American people shouldn't actually be worried about the case  pending before the Supreme Court. It is OK.   So I asked Judge Barrett whether the brief that was filed by the  Trump Justice Department, which argued that the entire Affordable Care  Act must fall, represented the President's position before the Supreme  Court. She confirmed, as a former clerk of the Supreme Court to Justice  Scalia--she confirmed that it did, and she confirmed that if the  President believed that the Court should throw out just part of the  Affordable Care Act and save the rest, well, he could direct the  Justice Department to withdraw the brief. That has not happened. That  is not the position of this administration. They have told the Court  that they want to throw the whole thing out, and now they are rushing  to confirm the President's nominee with the hope that she will cast a  deciding vote to strike down the ACA.   For me, as I noted at the hearing, it is about following the tracks.  No, the nominee didn't give us a sense of pending cases. We know that.  But she didn't even give a sense of what she thought about existing  laws that are on the book or about certain fundamental rights that  other nominees have discussed. So I followed the tracks, just like we  do when we go hiking.   When we would go hiking in Northern Minnesota when I was growing up,  my mom would always say: OK. That is a deer track or that is an elk or,  if we were really lucky, that is a bear. And you would follow those  tracks down the trail or down the road, and then you would get to the  corner and maybe you would see that deer. Every so often, you did. We  would follow the tracks.   So that is what we must do--ordinary citizens and U.S. Senators--to  try to figure out where this Justice is going to be on these  fundamental cases that are in front of the Court. You have got to  follow the tracks.   So what do we have? Well, we have got the fact that President Trump  promised that his judicial appointments would do the right thing and  overturn the Affordable Care Act. He tweeted that it would be a big win  if the Supreme Court strikes down the healthcare law. And if that  wasn't clear, he just went on ``60 Minutes''--he released the tape  himself on Thursday, and then it was on tonight--and he said it will be  so good if the Supreme Court overturns the Affordable Care Act. OK. So  this isn't something from 3 years ago. No, no, no. This is something  that we all saw tonight.   Then, on September 18, when the Nation was mourning the loss of a  judicial giant, President Trump saw his moment, and on September 26, at  what became a superspreader party at the White House, he announced his  nominee.   So here is what we know as we follow the tracks. In an article Judge  Barrett wrote for the University of Minnesota Law School journal called  ``Constitutional Commentary,'' in 2017--the same year that she became a  judge this was published--she wrote that Chief Justice Roberts--these  are her words--``pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible  meaning to save the statute.'' That was a case called NFIB v. Sebelius  that she was writing about--``pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its  plausible meaning to save the statute.'' That is direct criticism of  the Chief Justice's decision to allow the Affordable Care Act to stand.   And in a 2015 NPR interview on King v. Burwell--this is a different  case, but it involves the Affordable Care Act; another case where Chief  Justice Roberts cited in favor of the Affordable Care Act--there, Judge  Barrett acknowledged that the majority's holding is good because  millions of people won't lose their healthcare subsidies. Yet she  praised the dissent by Justice Scalia saying it had the better of the  legal argument.   Now, remember, she spent all her time in the hearing saying: Whatever  the policies are don't matter. What matters is the legal argument. What  matters is the law. And her position, which I don't agree with, but her  position was that Justice Scalia had the better of the legal argument.  That is one big track to see where she is coming down.   When she accepted the President's nomination at the White House, she  made clear that she considers Justice Scalia, one of the most  conservative judges in our Nation's history, as a mentor. Those are our  tracks.   But it is not just on healthcare. What other tracks do we have to  follow? Well, she signed her name to a public statement featured in an  ad calling for an end to what the ad called the ``barbaric legacy'' of  Roe v. Wade, which ran on the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court  decision. There is your track.   She wrote her own dissent disagreeing with longstanding Court rulings  on gun safety, expressing her legal opinions that some felons should  get guns.   She once discussed the dissent in the marriage equality case of  Obergefell v. Hodges, asking whether it was really the Supreme Court's  job to make that decision.   Those are the tracks that lead all of us down that path to the point  where you go around the curve, and you realize at least one thing for  sure, and that is that Judge Coney Barrett's judicial philosophy is the  polar opposite of Justice Ginsburg's.   Voting rights. Here is another example. Given the timing of this  nomination and the fact that we are just over 1 week from election day,  when I asked Judge Barrett would she say that mail-in voting is  essential right now, even though the coronavirus continues to spread  and people are having to choose between their health and their vote,  she instead called it, well, it is a matter of policy. When I asked  her, she would not say that voter intimidation is illegal, even though  in Minnesota, an outside contractor was recruiting poll watchers with  Special Forces experience during the judge's hearing. That is clear  voter intimidation. I was not asking her about an ongoing case. I was  actually asking her just if it is against the law. It is. It violates  18 U.S.C. section 549.   And while in the case of Minnesota, the company has now agreed to  cancel its plans after Minnesota Attorney General Ellison opened an  investigation, we are seeing threats to the right to vote in States  across the country. And when I asked, Judge Barrett even refused to  acknowledge that the Constitution empowers Congress to protect the  right to vote.   So the inescapable conclusion from these tracks is that Judge  Barrett, again, would be very different than Justice Ginsburg. Justice  Ginsburg was a champion of voting rights.   When a 5-to-4 Court gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act  in Shelby County v. Holder, Justice Ginsburg wrote in her famous  dissent that the Constitution uses the words ``right to vote'' in five  separate places, and in each place, it reaffirms--these are her words,  Justice Ginsburg--``Congress holds the lead rein in making the right to  vote equally real for all U.S. citizens.'' Justice Ginsburg understood  that voting--you don't just say it is a fundamental right. It is how  you protect it.   How do we do that? By standing up to voter intimidation and voter  suppression, by protecting our democracy from a President who tries to  undermine free and fair elections, by protecting the millions of people  who are going to the polls right now during this pandemic, some risking  their lives to cast a ballot. And during her hearing, Judge Barrett did  not make these simple commitments.   So I am very concerned about this fundamental issue of voting rights.  The stakes have never been higher than they are right now. Look at what  is happening. In Texas, they are trying to force each county to have  only one ballot drop box, including Harris County, which has 4.7  million people, one box. A judge stepped in and said: No, this is  wrong, and then three Trump-appointed judges on the Fifth Circuit  vacated the district court's order. No matter what the size of your  county, you just get one box.   In Tennessee, Republicans have tried to prevent ballot drop boxes,  and they have argued in court that COVID-19 is not a valid excuse to  vote by mail.   In South Carolina, the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month  reinstated a South Carolina requirement that mail-in ballots must have  a witness signature, so voters in South Carolina are going to be forced  to go out in the middle of a pandemic and find someone to witness their  ballot.  [[Page S6497]]    And as we saw last Monday, in a case that went to the Supreme Court  from Pennsylvania, Judge Amy Coney Barrett could in fact be the swing  vote on a case like this. This is a case where last week the Supreme  Court issued a split 4-to-4 decision that let stand the Pennsylvania  Supreme Court's ruling allowing election officials to count mail-in  ballots received within 3 days of the election even if they are not  postmarked.   And just last Wednesday, the Supreme Court blocked curbside voting in  Alabama, which was intended to help whom? Voters with disabilities. In  dissent, Justice Sotomayor quoted Howard Porter, Jr., a Black man in  his seventies with asthma and Parkinson's, who said this:        So many of my [ancestors] even died to vote. And while I       don't mind dying to vote, I think we're past that--we're past       that time.    That is how I feel a lot about what this judge who is before us now,  her views on originalism, her views on not changing with the times,  like so many other Justices interpret the Constitution to mean, so that  it matters to everyday people--but not this judge.   Some of my Republican colleagues, as I noted, think that this is  something distant and far away. As I noted, we cannot divorce this  nominee and her views from the election we are in now. The last time we  had a vacancy so close to a Presidential election was in 1864. Then  President Abraham Lincoln did the wise thing, the right thing, and he  waited until after the election to fill the vacancy.   And in 2016, when Justice Scalia died about 9 months before the  election, Senator McConnell said this:         The American people should have a voice in the selection of       their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy       should not be filled until we have a new President.    That is what we are talking about with the unfairness of this, with  the sham of this proceeding, and I laid out for you tonight the reasons  I believe that this has become such a high priority instead of passing  pandemic relief.   During the week of Judge Barrett's hearing, more than 220,000 more  people got COVID-19. At least 2,700 more people died from it. Nearly  800,000 people filed for unemployment. More small businesses closed  too. According to one study, actually, recently, around 800 small  businesses are closing every day. In my home State, one in five small  businesses say they will be forced to close if we don't do something  about it.   Let me give you an example. Jose Frias from St. Paul is one of them.  He is a third-generation business owner who owns Boca Chica Mexican  family restaurant, which includes a fast-food taco house, restaurant,  and catering service. He started as a manager at 20 years old and  worked his way up, taking over 2 years ago--his dream. The future  looked bright, but then the virus hit. Jose was forced to go from 98  employees to just 48. His guest restaurants closed entirely and revenue  from catering is down 90 percent. In his words, the business, which he  has been running with his sisters, aunts, nieces, and a few remaining  staff, was his ``whole life . . . and it [has] come to a standstill.''   This is happening all over the country. On October 6, Federal Reserve  Chair Jerome Powell made clear that it would be tragic if Congress  fails to pass an economic relief package. We have startups that were  already in a slump before this and numbers are plummeting more. Small  businesses are closing. A conservative Supreme Court that has done  nothing when it comes to antitrust--nothing--yet Justice Ginsburg, she  always dissented. She made the cases for those small businesses. But  the Trump Justices, they have gone the opposite way.   I want to end with this. America, you deserve better. You deserve  leaders who will put you first. You deserve leaders who will protect  your jobs, your families, and your healthcare. You deserve a Supreme  Court nominee who will speak truth to power or at least acknowledge  when basic precedent exists, even if it is inconvenient to the  President who nominated her.   There may be nothing we can do any longer to stop this confirmation,  but there is one thing you can do to determine the future of this  Nation--those blueprints for the future that Justice Ginsburg would  refer to--you can vote. And when you cast your ballot, remember where  those tracks lead.   There is another way other than this administration and this  hypocrisy we are seeing and this gridlock that has taken over this U.S.  Senate. It is spelled out right there in the first three words of the  Constitution. We can be a nation in which ``We the People'' truly means  all the people--a nation in which the people have a say and in which  the people determine the future.   Remember, this isn't Donald Trump's country. It is yours. This  shouldn't be Donald Trump's Justice. It should be yours.    Madam President, today I rise to honor and pay  tribute to Sid Hartman, a sports journalist and a Minnesota legend who  passed away on October 18, 2020, at age 100.   Born in 1920 on the north side of Minneapolis, Sid Hartman was born  to be a newspaperman. He began selling newspapers when he was 9 years  old and even pioneered the use of newspaper boxes where customers would  pay by leaving coins in a change box. Sid would ride his bicycle to  Newspaper Alley, where he would buy 100 copies of the Minneapolis Star,  the Journal, and the Morning Tribune for $1.10 and then sell them for  two cents apiece.   That is how Sid got his start in business, but his big break came  when Dick Cullum, the sports editor at the Minneapolis Times, hired him  to work on the sports desk in 1944. And during his tenure, Sid's  columns were a big reason why people bought the newspaper. Sid went on  to become the unofficial general manager for the Minneapolis Lakers and  helped secure a Major League Baseball team for Minneapolis. Since 2010,  a statue of Sid holding a newspaper and microphone has stood near the  corner of Sixth Street and First Avenue North in Minneapolis, a fitting  tribute to his legacy outside of the Target Center and the Minnesota  Twins' Target Field.   Sid was also a popular radio personality on WCCO Radio. I know I will  never forget the day at the Minnesota State Fair WCCO Radio booth when  we both appeared on the Dave Lee show for the annual ``Minnesota  Hospital'' soap opera spoof skit, where I was given the role of Nurse  Helen and Sid played the infamous ``Dr. Kidney Hartman.''   Sid knew everyone. His 1996 autobiography, titled: ``Sid! The Sports  Legends, the Inside Scoops and the Close Personal Friends,'' was  endorsed by some of the biggest names in sports, from legendary Vikings  coach Bud Grant to Arnold Palmer, Wayne Gretzky, Ted Williams, Bob  Costas, and George Steinbrenner. Nobody had better relationships in the  sports world than Sid.   Ten years after the book's release, the Star Tribune published ``Sid  Hartman's Great Minnesota Sports Moments'' featuring this quote from  Tom Brokaw: ``I grew up on Sid Hartman columns about my Midwestern  sports heroes and I still think of him as a Hall of Fame  newspaperman.''   My dad, a future newspaperman himself, first met Sid in 1945 while  Sid was covering the Minnesota high school basketball championship  game. My dad was playing for his hometown high school team Ely, a small  town on Minnesota's Iron Range, and they were up against Patrick Henry  High School, a powerhouse that had only lost one game that season. As  soon as my dad got off the bus, Sid stuck a microphone in his face and  said, ``You don't have a chance. How are you going to win?'' Sid was  right, and Ely lost 66-35.   Years later, my dad started writing for the Associated Press and then  for the Star Tribune. He and Sid got to know each other well. They were  fierce competitors, but had respect for each other's drive and work.   Throughout Sid's career, he never had any plans to quit. He was  always driven to get the scoop. He was relentless. At the time of his  death, he was still writing three or four columns a week. In fact, Sid  produced 21,235 bylined stories from 1944 to 2020. In his final column,  he wrote: ``Writing a column as I turn 100 years old is hard to  believe.'' But for all who knew Sid, it wasn't hard for any of us to  believe.   My prayers and condolences go out to Sid's son Chad, his daughter  Chris, and his entire family. It is hard to be surprised when someone  dies at age 100, but Sid was someone who just never stopped loving his  work and our State.   We miss you, Sid.   Thank you.
