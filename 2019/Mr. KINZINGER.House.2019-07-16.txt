 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment is very simple. It would  require that the Director of National Intelligence and other relevant  agencies report to Congress on the threat that international mobile  subscriber identity catchers, also referred to as ``cell-site  simulators'' or under the brand name ``StingRay,'' pose to U.S.  Government personnel and national security.   In addition to providing this report, the DNI would need to provide  recommendations to Congress regarding possible policy changes to  counter these devices.   IMSI catchers send signals to mobile phones that appear to be coming  from legitimate mobile networks. Once connected, the phones are used to  track the locations of the users, which can be seen by whoever is  controlling the IMSI catcher. The more advanced versions of these cell  devices allow their owners even to access messages and phone call data.   Many of us were shocked when a report came out last year that the  Department of Homeland Security had found these devices around the  national capital region. Even more concerning was that many of these  were located around sensitive government buildings.   My amendment would help Congress understand the proliferation of  these devices around our Nation, with a focus on their prevalence in  the national capital region. We need to know which actors, foreign or  domestic, are deploying them and what Congress can do to ensure the  safekeeping of our national security apparatus.   Madam Chair, I urge support for this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
