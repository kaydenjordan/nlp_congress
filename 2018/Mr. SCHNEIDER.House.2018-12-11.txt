 Mr. Speaker, I recently asked my constituents about  their priorities, and we received more than 2,400 responses. Their top  issues? Healthcare, gun safety, and the environment.   It is worth noting that on each of these issues this Congress has not  only not made progress, we have moved backwards. On healthcare, this  Congress spent months fighting a failed fight to repeal the Affordable  Care Act, and now the administration continues to cynically sabotage  the law to weaken protections for pre-existing conditions and increase  premiums.   On gun safety, this Congress sits idly by as senseless gun violence  and mass shootings claim lives across the country. In fact, the only  gun legislation we passed this year, concealed carry reciprocity,  actually weakened our gun laws.   On climate, this Congress has not only not listened to the science  that tells us to reduce emissions, and instead the administration,  President Trump, recklessly withdrew the United States from the Paris  Climate Accord.   It is time Congress put the interests of the American people first.  In the coming new Congress, we have a new opportunity for progress.  Let's listen and prioritize the issues that matter most to our  constituents and our country: affordable healthcare, the safety of  their children, and a sustainable planet.                            ____________________
