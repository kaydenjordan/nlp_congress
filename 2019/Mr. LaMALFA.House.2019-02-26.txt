 Madam Speaker, California's high-speed rail system has  broken promise after promise and made false claim after false claim.   I want to commend President Trump for working to pull back the $928  million that is still authorized, that could be reachable, and turn  this money into something that could be useful for more Americans or  even for more Californians.   Now, we also need to send a bill to the State of California for $2.5  billion for the money they wasted for a project that has not fulfilled  what was required in the proposition the people passed by 52 percent to  48 percent. The price has more than tripled since then.   We need to focus on doing the transportation projects in the country  that would actually help move people in a fashion that they can use.   Governor Newsom was right there with his State of the State speech  the other day. I know he knows different.   Let's go ahead and put a stop to this project, put the money back  into fixing our highway system or our levee system or our water system  in the State of California and not send the bill to the other 49 States  of this country that, in good faith, initially sent that as part of the  stimulus package. Let's put it into good, solid projects.                            ____________________
