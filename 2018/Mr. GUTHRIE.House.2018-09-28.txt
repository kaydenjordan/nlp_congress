 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the SUPPORT for  Patients and Communities Act.   One of the main things I hear back home is how our Nation's ongoing  opioid crisis has affected either themselves, their loved ones, or  their community.   Mothers, fathers, children, bankers, dentists, bus drivers, or high  school athletes, anyone can fall victim to opioid use disorder. That is  why I am proud to work with my colleagues in support of the act so that  we can help these people who are suffering from this terrible epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical  legislation so that we can deliver relief to those communities.                                time  1115     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 3354) to amend the Missing Children's  Assistance Act, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
