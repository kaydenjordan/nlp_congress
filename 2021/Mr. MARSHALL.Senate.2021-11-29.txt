 Madam President, today I wish to recognize a  fellow Kansan, Jace Ward, for his incredible fight against cancer,  inspiring advocacy work, and unyielding display of hope in the face of  a terminal illness. At the age of 22, Jace passed away surrounded by  family and friends, and today, I commemorate the remarkable  accomplishments during his short life.   Jace was born on February 18, 1999, in Wichita, KS. He enjoyed a  fantastic childhood in Inman and then moved to Wamego at age 12, where  he excelled in school and extracurricular activities. After graduating  from Wamego High School in 2017, Jace attended the University of  Kansas, studying law and business with scholarships under the Law  Education Accelerated Degree Program and the Business Scholars Program.   Following a rollover car accident in February 2019, Jace started to  experience eye problems. After an MRI, it was revealed that Jace had an  aggressive and particularly deadly form of brain cancer called diffuse  intrinsic pontine plioma, DIPG. It generally affects children between  the ages of 5 to 9 and has no chance of survival as no effective  treatment exists. In fact, only 10 percent of patients survive 2 years  after their diagnosis, and less than 1 percent survive past 5 years.  Despite these unforgiving odds, Jace decided to make the most of the  time he had left.   After being diagnosed with DIPG, Jace transferred to Kansas State  University--KSU--on scholarship and majored in business  entrepreneurship. He was awarded a bachelor of business administration  degree posthumously from KSU, but while he was studying, he also  championed advocacy and awareness for pediatric cancer.   While attending KSU, Jace worked vigorously for California-based  Emerson Collective as a member of the Health Team, which focuses on  advocating and investing funds to combat rare cancers like his. As a  member of this organization, he visited with Federal officials in  Congress and various agencies at the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services to raise awareness. Notably, Jace delivered a keynote  address at a congressional briefing on DIPG, spoke to the NIH on  patient ownership of genomic data, and met with over 67 congressional  offices, including mine. As a Member of the House of Representatives  and his Congressman, I cosponsored a House resolution expressing  support for honoring a day towards DIPG to raise awareness and  encourage research into cures for DIPG and other pediatric cancers.   As a business major keenly aware of private sector dynamics and  pharmaceutical manufacturing, Jace also helped establish partnerships  with biopharmaceutical innovators and foundations. He regularly brought  together foundations to partner with him on aspirations he had to fill  gaps in research and patient navigation. Jace conceptualized a DIPG  Patient Navigation System to direct patients to molecular diagnostics  and clinical trials, attracted the support of 20 top doctors and  several foundations to open this novel system in November. Because of  Jace, over 300 tumors previously held in storage awaiting funding for  genomic sequencing are now being sequenced added to quadruple those  available for researchers. Jace inspired an astonishing $5 million in  funding for pediatric brain cancer research and treatment, and it is  because of him that over 200 patients received expanded access to an  investigational drug.   When asked about what he wanted to do with the remaining time he had  left and whether he would devote it towards travel or other personal  experiences, Jace responded, ``I can't die, I'm busy.'' Jace ignored  the ticking clock tethered to him to become a thundering voice for  future patients, always putting the need to advance science and protect  younger kids and their legacies before his own.   As a physician for nearly 30 years, I am no stranger to cancer or the  miracle of hope when faced with the heartbreaking news of a diagnosis.  Even during the toughest of times, I have witnessed God in my patient's  grace and acceptance; Jace is no exception. I am profoundly honored to  have had the opportunity to get to know him and his remarkable family.  Jace is survived by his loving parents, Roger and Lisa, and his sister,  Brooke.   I ask my colleagues and all Kansans to join me in remembering Jace's  courageous fight, his ability to rise to the challenge, and to make a  lasting impact in the fight against pediatric cancer.

Both are remarkable achievements on  their own, but attaining both is truly a remarkable feat.   For her Gold Award, Lacy decided to focus her efforts to helping the  Hutchinson domestic violence center with her project, ``A Walk of  Love.'' To help the shelter, Lacy worked with the community to collect  over $5,000 worth of toiletry items, which she then turned into 200  toiletry bags to donate to the shelter. In addition, she helped  establish a continual collection process for these items so the shelter  can more adequately provide resources for those that use it in the  future.   Of course, that is only half the story. To accomplish the double  feat, Lacy needed to create yet another community project for her Eagle  Scout rank. Lacy set her sights on repainting the gymnasium of a church  in Hutchinson. After plenty of preparation and recruiting, what she  initially thought would take 2 weeks only took her 2 days after  successfully recruiting help throughout the Hutchinson area during her  preparation process.   After achieving these two feats, Lacy has said that she hopes to be  an inspiration for young girls to show that they are capable of making  a difference and achieving what they want, so long as they put their  mind to it. She has certainly set a tremendous example for young women  everywhere, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Lacy for  her outstanding achievements.                            ____________________
