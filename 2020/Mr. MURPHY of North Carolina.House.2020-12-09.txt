 Mr. Speaker, today I would like to  address the crippling cost of student debt.   Although my Democratic colleagues and I agree substantially on the  issue, we disagree substantially on the solution. We need to cure the  disease, not just put a Band-Aid on it.   Absolving student debt or making college free altogether does not  address  [[Page H7060]]  the problem. It just passes the debt on to people who have responsibly  paid off their student loans, while encouraging the reckless spending  on administrative bloat in higher education.   From 1988 to 2018, the average tuition and fees at public 4-year  institutions tripled and more than doubled at private 4-year  institutions. We have seen an explosion of vice presidents, counselors,  diversity coaches, and all types of administrative staff who have  nothing to do with giving their students a means of finding employment.   Why? Because they can. The money flows freely from the Federal  Government, and they know that--all at the expense of the student.   So rather than climbing walls, lazy rivers, and so-called safe spaces  and then asking for bailouts, universities should be cutting costs and  focusing on educating their students. This frivolous spending has  ruined many young people's futures, and that is how we address the  calamity of student debt.                            ____________________
