 Mr. Speaker, protecting our  national security should be among one of the top concerns of any  administration--Republican or Democrat. Yet, President Trump has  demonstrated an alarming disregard for the national security interests  of the United States.   There have been a number of incidents that I believe warrant  additional scrutiny by Congress and the American people. Just last  week, it was reported that President Trump revealed highly classified  information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador during a  White House meeting. In direct contravention of standing diplomatic  agreements with our closest allies, President Trump also reportedly  divulged the source of that highly classified information. Not only did  this blatant disregard for protocol damage our credibility among the  international community, but President Trump may have very well also  exposed extremely sensitive information about U.S. and allied  intelligence operations abroad.   Earlier this month, President Trump also took a bold step in firing  former FBI Director James Comey in the midst of an investigation into  his administration and alleged ties to Russian officials. Shortly after  Director Comey was fired, an unnamed White House source revealed that  President Trump told Russian officials during the same meeting that he  did so in order to ease some of the pressure from the Russia  investigation. This is deeply alarming, if not simply just ironic.   During the Presidential election, House Speaker Paul Ryan criticized  Hillary Clinton over her mishandling of classified emails on a private  email server. He stated, ``individuals who are `extremely careless'  with classified information should be denied further access to such  info.'' Today, I have yet to hear Speaker Ryan--or other key House  Republicans--speak out against this blatant mishandling of classified  information. It is hypocrisy in its purest form.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford the unauthorized divulging of  classified information and national security secrets, especially to  hostile nations such as Russia. I find it deeply troubling that a  sitting president would display such a blatant disregard for the  safeguarding of U.S. national security interests. I continue to join my  colleagues in calling for an independent commission to investigate any  possible collusion between the Trump Campaign and the Kremlin.                            ____________________
