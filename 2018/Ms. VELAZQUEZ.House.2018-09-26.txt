 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to  thank both the chairman and the ranking member for their important work  on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, a year ago, Hurricane Maria made landfall in my hometown  of Yabucoa. The storm ravaged the island, and 115-mile-per-hour winds  damaged hundreds of thousands of homes. The entire island lost power,  and thousands would not regain electricity until 10 months later, the  longest blackout in U.S. history.   Sadly, as this crisis unfolded, the President and the administration  repeatedly claimed the Federal response was going well. As evidence,  they pointed to an artificially low death toll that for months  suggested only 64 people had perished. We know now that the true toll  is closer to 3,000 lost lives.   We can never again allow an artificially low death toll to disguise  how the local and the Federal Government failed American citizens. That  is why I am pleased this bill contains my legislation, the COUNT Act,  to establish Federal guidelines for disaster death counts.    Death tolls shape public opinion and, in turn,  influence how resources are allocated in response. This new bill will  make sure Congress and the American people have a clear picture of the  severity of future catastrophes.   I thank the ranking member and the chairman for working to include my  bill as a provision. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6729 is a well-intentioned bill aimed at countering  human trafficking. My first concern with the bill, however, is the lack  of a deliberative process surrounding the measure, which could lead to  a number of serious unintended consequences as currently drafted.   The bill will give a sweeping safe harbor to nonprofits that share  information with financial institutions regarding the involuntary  trafficking of children, women, and men that will nullify all State and  local defamation, libel, and privacy laws.   This means eligible nonprofits could share personally identifiable  information about any person the nonprofit merely suspects of human  trafficking with any financial institution, even if their information  is false or misleading. Such sharing of information could, in turn,  lead financial institutions to close an individual's account and deny  them access to the financial system, even if the individual has not  been arrested or indicted for a crime.   Importantly, this bill also explicitly states that the Treasury  Department may not impose a requirement that the nonprofits share the  information in good faith. Therefore, this bill doesn't protect against  malicious or negligent reporting. In fact, the Due Process Institute  has stated: `` . . . Surely not every suspicion or accusation that  would come through a nonprofit will be accurate or truthful. Some  suspicions or accusations might even be motivated by personal,  political, ethnic, racial, cultural, or religious animus.''   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters of  opposition to the bill from two coalitions of civil liberty and privacy  advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Due  Process Institute, Freedom Works, the National Association of Criminal  Defense Lawyers, the Project On Government Oversight, Defending Rights  and Dissent, and New America's Open Technology Institute, among others.                                                 September 25, 2018.        Dear Representatives: We urge you to vote against H.R. 6729       when the measure is considered later this week. The       legislation would allow the Treasury Department to expand the       surveillance and sharing of Americans' financial records       beyond what is provided for by the USA PATRIOT Act. The       government has previously sought and Congress has rightly       voted to reject such an expansion. Similar legislation in the       114th Congress, H.R. 5606, drew opposition from 177 members       and failed on a suspension vote.        The legislation has broad applicability and significantly       harmful effects that go far beyond its stated purpose of       allowing financial institutions to combat human trafficking.        H.R. 6729 contains an overly broad provision that prohibits       Treasury from requiring nonprofit organizations to show that       they are sharing information in good faith and preempts       liability for organizations under privacy laws. While the       measure is described as allowing nonprofits to report       suspicions of human trafficking or money laundering to       financial institutions, it risks our privacy and raises       concerns about the misuse of information.        In addition, H.R. 6729 allows a wide range of institutions       to communicate with each other about ``suspicious''       activities regardless of the basis for the suspicion and       despite other applicable laws and consumer agreements. The       concerns need not be rooted in reality. Moreover, the safe       harbor provision does not merely encompass traditional       financial institutions like banks and financial services       providers, but extends more broadly. This legislation also       fails to establish any legal recourse for negligent or       malicious acts.        H.R. 6729 would create the risk of financial institutions       closing accounts of people they deem too risky to do business       with on the basis of meritless or otherwise unsupported       claims from nonprofit organizations. Every financial       institution already has a legal obligation to file a       ``Suspicious Activity Report'' with the government whenever       it ``knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that an       individual, entity, or organization is involved in or may be       involved in terrorist activity or money laundering.'' It is       an unfortunate fact that suspicions and accusations can be       based on or motivated by personal, political, ethnic, racial,       cultural, or religious animus. It is unacceptable to expand       the scope of entities that can submit this information in a       process that is broadly immunized from legal recourse.        This legislation goes far beyond the goal of combating       human trafficking and significantly expands governmental       surveillance, the impact of which falls most heavily and       relentlessly on those who are the least able to defend       themselves. Now is not the time to rush this legislation,       introduced a mere two weeks ago, through a legislative       procedure intended for uncontroversial bills.            Sincerely yours,        American Civil Liberties Union, American-Arab Anti-      Discrimination Committee, Color Of Change, Defending Rights &       Dissent, Demand Progress Action, Free Press Action, Freedom       of the Press Foundation, Government Information Watch, New       America's Open Technology Institute, Project On Government       Oversight, X-Lab.                                   ____                                            Due Process Institute,                                                 September 25, 2018.      Re Bipartisan Concerns Regarding H.R. 6729 on Suspension           Calendar       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      U.S. House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Majority Leader,      U.S. House of Representatives.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      U.S. House of Representatives.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Minority Whip,      U.S. House of Representatives.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, and Whip       Hoyer: The Due Process Institute, FreedomWorks, the National       Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), and       Defending Rights and Dissent write to raise concerns with       several aspects of H.R. 6729 (``Empowering Financial       Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act of 2018''). There       is an effort to put this bill, which was introduced just two       weeks ago, on the suspension calendar this week even though       it contains controversial expansions of regulatory power that       could have serious unintended consequences for innocent       people. We urge leadership to ensure this bill not be placed       on the suspension calendar and instead allow deliberate       consideration of the serious changes it seeks to make. We       urge Members to vote NO on this bill.        On its face, H.R. 6729 would protect nonprofits wishing to       report suspicions of human trafficking or money laundering       activities to law enforcement. Importantly, there are no       known legal impediments to nonprofits who wish to engage in       such reporting. Anyone can report credible suspicions of       criminal activity to law enforcement. However, it is possible       that a reporter could potentially face civil liability if the       report was false and led to reputational damage, or if the       report violated a privacy law. This bill offers a very broad       ``safe harbor'' from such liability. In conflict with the       principle of federalism, it would nullify any and all       federal, state, or local laws that might otherwise allow       someone to seek damages in the instance of damaging or       malicious reporting or for otherwise invading their privacy.       This powerful and all-encompassing ``safe harbor'' does not       require good faith on behalf of the reporting organization       yet it would invalidate all defamation, libel, or privacy       laws in existence. The undersigned organizations recognize       the importance of preventing and appropriately investigating       human trafficking related crimes but have grave concerns       about aspects of this bill that go far beyond the purpose of       preventing human trafficking.        Importantly, H.R. 6729 does much more than provide a safe       harbor from civil liability for nonprofits wishing to share       information with law enforcement and it is those aspects of       the bill that might not be readily apparent but cause       concern. The bill also sets up a structure to encourage       nonprofits to share their suspicions with ``financial       institutions,'' and also creates a related structure by which       financial institutions will be encouraged to then share these       suspicions with each other. Importantly, the term ``financial       institution'' is not confined to entities like traditional       banks and financial services providers, but also applies to       insurance companies, real estate firms, casinos, jewelers,       and even car dealers. (Again, there is nothing that prevents       such reporting but the ``safe harbor'' protection discussed       above would also apply to any financial institution, thus       preventing customers of a wide array of businesses who would       otherwise have legal recourse under privacy laws or tort law       to seek relief for the negligent or even malicious acts of       others.) Importantly, the ``information sharing'' at stake in       this bill is not based on provable criminal acts, or even       criminal accusations brought by law enforcement. The types of       information subject to this extraordinary ``safe harbor''       protection are mere suspicions that could be based on       purposefully malicious information or stem from improper       motivations.        Unfortunately, the harm that is likely to result to       innocent Americans is very real and not just because of the       safe harbor provision. Current banking regulations already       require financial institutions to file ``Suspicious Activity       Reports'' (SARs) with the government any time it ``knows,       suspects, or has reason to suspect that an individual,       entity, or organization is involved in, or may be involved in       terrorist activity or money laundering,'' because of shared       information  [[Page H9055]]       it has received. Because a financial institution can face       criminal prosecution for failing to investigate or file SARs       after receiving such information, these institutions       invariably err on the side of over-filing. This bill would       add a broad swath of new suspected activity to the SARs       regime, causing the overall amount of SARs to increase--      despite the fact that over one million SARs are already filed       each year--the vast majority of which never lead to a formal       investigation of any kind.        But even more importantly, one of the stated purposes for       information-sharing between financial institutions is to       allow these businesses to determine ``whether to establish or       maintain an account, or to engage in a transaction.'' Thus,       the filing of a SAR frequently leads to a person being ``de-      banked'' or deemed ``too risky to do business with.'' This       bill would dramatically increase the number of SARs filed on       the basis of unproven suspicions passed to financial       institutions, not from law enforcement agencies but from       nonprofits. Stories already abound regarding instances of       innocent consumers having their accounts closed or       transactions prohibited as a result of unproven suspicions.       See Emily Flitter & Stacy Cowley, ``Wells Fargo Accused of       Harming Fraud Victims by Closing Accounts,'' New York Times,       Feb. 28, 2018; Rick Jones, ``Closing the Door on Closing       Accounts: Ending the Damaging Impact of De-Banking,'' The       Champion, March 2018; and Alex Morrell, ``Banks are keeping       closer tabs on your reputation than ever before--and it may       explain why one . . . cardholder mysteriously had his account       shut down. . . .'', Business Insider, Sept. 14, 2018. While       the threat of human trafficking is real and law enforcement       should continue to engage in best efforts to prevent such       crimes, surely not every suspicion or accusation that would       come through a nonprofit will be accurate or truthful. Some       suspicions or accusations might even be motivated by       personal, political, ethnic, racial, cultural, or religious       animus. But by encouraging nonprofits to share their       ``suspicions'' with financial institutions, and to encourage       financial institutions to in turn share these suspicions with       each other, law-abiding customers could be improperly de-      banked, preventing them from engaging in critical financial       activities like home buying, investing, or even having a bank       account on the basis of unproven hearsay.        Another concerning aspect of H.R. 6729 is that it contains       multiple authorizations for the Treasury Department to       promulgate an unlimited number of additional regulations       regarding the ``sharing of information between financial       institutions on suspected unlawful activities.'' These       incredibly broad strokes of authority--not limited to the       context of the subject matter of the bill [human trafficking]       but applying to any ``suspected unlawful activity''--are       deeply concerning given that the regulatory state is already       out of control and given previous recent attempts by the       Treasury Department to increase the use of warrantless       surveillance through ``information-sharing'' programs and       other extraordinary powers it was previously granted only for       the purposes of preventing terrorist activities. The blanket       authorization in this bill would allow unelected regulators       to enact changes in the law to expand surveillance and the       access and sharing of Americans' financial records under       Section 314 of the USA PATRIOT Act that they have been unable       to get authorized in bills such as H.R. 5606 (``Anti-      Terrorism Information Sharing is Strength Act''), H.R. 3439       (the ``Financial Institution Security Act'') and the November       2017 draft ``Counter Terrorism and Illicit Finance Act''--      efforts that were widely opposed by a diverse group of       concerned organizations. For all the reasons listed herein,       we urge leadership to ensure this bill not be placed on the       suspension calendar and instead be subjected to a full and       fair law-making process that will allow for deliberate       consideration of the serious changes it seeks to make and we       urge Members to vote NO on this bill.            Respectfully,      Due Process Institute.      FreedomWorks.      National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL).      Defending Rights and Dissent.     Mr. Speaker, I remain committed to fighting against  human trafficking, but this bill may result in serious unintended  consequences for innocent people, including losing access to their  money and to the financial system based on the mere accusation from a  nonprofit. For this reason, I oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
