 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of one of  New Jersey's finest, Deptford Township Officer Robert ``Bobby''  Shisler, who died last week after being shot in the line of duty in  March. He was just 27 years old.   Born and raised in Deptford, Officer Shisler dedicated his life to  serving and protecting his community. He served Deptford with honor and  integrity and made south Jersey a better, safer place for all of us.   We must never forget the ultimate sacrifice made by the officer and  all those who wear the uniform who protect us. We will always remember  Officer Shisler for the hero that he is.   I am keeping his family, his friends, his fellow law enforcement  officers, and the entire Deptford community in my thoughts and prayers.   May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
