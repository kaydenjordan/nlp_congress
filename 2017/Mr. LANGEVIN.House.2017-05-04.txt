 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  Republicans' latest plan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. After  Republicans failed to earn the votes to pass their American Health Care  Act in March, I thought that we could finally move forward to find  bipartisan solutions to improving health care in America. Instead,  Republicans have revived their partisan goal of ACA repeal by adding  provisions that have made a bad bill even worse.   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it; the bill before us today will  make Americans' health care worse in this country:   This legislation will cause 24 million people to lose coverage, while  drastically increasing healthcare costs on everyday families;   It eliminates Federal safeguards that prevent insurers from charging  older Americans higher premiums;   It guts essential health benefits, like maternity care and  prescription drugs;   Further, it removes crucial patient protections that prevent  discrimination against people with preexisting conditions, leaving our  most vulnerable populations with a false promise of sufficient coverage  through these failed high-risk pools.   Mr. Speaker, I am saddened that so many Republicans appear willing to  place hollow partisan victories above the health of their constituents.  I oppose the Republican AHCA in the strongest possible terms and urge  all of my colleagues to put the health of Americans first.
