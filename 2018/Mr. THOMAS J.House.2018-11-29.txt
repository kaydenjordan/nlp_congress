 ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this is the last time I  will have the privilege to address this body.   It has been an honor to serve the people of Florida's 16th and 17th  Districts over the last 10 years. I am eternally grateful for the trust  that the people of Florida's heartland bestowed upon me to be their  voice in the United States Congress for the last five terms.   I would not have been able to do this job without the great work of  my staff both here in Washington, D.C., and back in Florida. Thank you,  Team Rooney.   Thanks always to the love and support of my family: my mom and dad;  my brothers and sisters, Pat, Joe, Suzanne, Terry, Chris, Molly, and  Brian; and, most importantly, to my wife, Tara; and my sons, Tommy,  Jr., Sean Patrick, and Seamus. I will be home soon. I love you guys.                            ____________________
