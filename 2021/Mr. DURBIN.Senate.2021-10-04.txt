 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, let me say at the outset that I will  yield the floor if either leader comes. I know they are busy in their  offices, and I would be prepared to give them whatever opportunity they  need.                            ____________________     Madam President, this week, the Senate will consider  Lauren King's nomination for the U.S. District Court for the Western  District of Washington.   Ms. King is an incredibly qualified jurist with experience as a  lawyer and a judge. If confirmed, she will make history--the first  Native American Federal judge to serve in Washington's Western  District, which is home to more than 25 federally recognized Tribes.   Ms. King received her undergraduate degree from the University of  Washington, her law degree from the University of Virginia, and for  more than 12 years, she has been a litigator in private practice. She  has handled cases involving intellectual property, commercial contract  disputes, construction litigation, and Tribal hunting and fishing  rights.   In addition to her work in private practice, Ms. King has served the  public as an appellate court judge in the Northwest Intertribal Court  System. She has also advocated for her community as a member of the  Seattle Indian Health Board, which provides care to Native Americans  and Alaskan Natives.   Ms. King has long been recognized as a leader in the legal community.  She served on the board of the Northwest Tribal Court Judges  Association, has chaired both the Federal Bar Association's Indian Law  Section Conference and the Washington State Bar Association's Indian  Law Section.   How is she rated by the American Bar Association? ``Well qualified.''   Ms. King has the strong support of her home State Senators, Murray  and Cantwell, and bipartisan support in our Judiciary Committee, with  Ranking Member Grassley and Senator Graham joining us in supporting her  nomination.   Her nomination has been endorsed by dozens of Tribes and Tribal  organizations throughout the United States, including the National  Congress of American Indians, the Native American Rights Fund, and the  Midwest Alliance of Sovereign Tribes. Ms. King has given back to her  community every step of her career.   With her confirmation, the Members of the Senate can continue the  vital work of building the Federal judiciary that really reflects the  diversity of this Nation.   I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.                            ____________________     Madam President, today is the first Monday in October. It  is the date that marks the start of a new term for the U.S. Supreme  Court.  [[Page S6880]]    All indications are this term will be of major consequence. The Court  has chosen to take up a number of cases that have the potential to  dramatically change America as we know it. For example, the Court has  decided to hear cases in which it is being asked to overturn Roe v.  Wade, as well as strike down State laws regarding the carrying of  weapons in public places. These are among the momentous issues on the  Court's first term.   Madam President, I would yield the floor to the leader.    He has asked me to carry on for a little bit here.   Back to my statement.   These are among the momentous issues on the Court's merits docket  this term.   But the Court has been also very active on another docket, the  ``shadow docket.'' Most are not familiar with that term and don't know  what it means. We learned in the Senate Judiciary Committee. It refers  to decisions issued by the Supreme Court outside of the regular routine  merits docket. These decisions are often rendered on a very short  timetable without full briefing, public deliberation, detailed  explanation, or signed opinions.   Historically, shadow docket orders were mostly noncontroversial. They  typically involved routine or procedural questions, such as  establishing deadlines for parties to file briefs. But that has changed  in recent years. Not only have the orders from the Supreme Court shadow  docket become more substantive and controversial, they have also been  taking an increasingly clear, ideological bent.   Consider the weeks leading up to the start of this new October term.  The Court's conservative majority used the shadow docket to block the  Biden administration's COVID eviction moratorium and to reinstate the  Trump administration's cruel ``Remain in Mexico'' policy that,  unfortunately, blocked families and children fleeing persecution.   The Court's majority also used the shadow docket last month to allow  Texas law S.B. 8 to take effect, a law that effectively bans abortion  after 6 weeks, directly violating the constitutional protections the  Court recognized half a century in Roe v. Wade.   These and other shadow docket orders from the Court's conservative  Justices are having profound consequences for millions of Americans.   Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair and the  Presiding Officer has joined as a member, held a hearing on the Court's  use of the shadow docket.   We heard from a number of experts about the increased use of the  docket and the increasing ideological nature of its use. They pointed  out, for example, that President Trump's Justice Department, in 4  years, requested the Court take emergency action on their shadow docket  a recordbreaking 36 times in 4 years. The Court granted 28 of those  requests.   What about previous Presidents? In contrast, the Justice Department  only requested emergency relief eight times total--eight times--in 16  years of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and on only four occasions  was the shadow docket approved--the request was approved.   At this point, I am going to yield the floor and ask unanimous  consent that when I return to the floor, I be able to resume these  remarks. But I want to yield to the majority leader.    I ask consent to speak as if in morning business.    Madam President, I listened closely to the speech by the  Republican Senate leader, and I have heard statements made over the  weekend on television. I think this is a moment where we might consider  for just a minute or two a lesson on Senate 101 so there is an  understanding of where we are and why we are at this place.   There are 100 Members of the Senate. Currently, there are 50  Democrats and 50 Republicans. Under the ordinary course of business,  which has become extraordinary in this Chamber, a majority rules, so 51  votes will pass an amendment or a bill in most cases.   However, there is a creature in the Senate known as a filibuster, and  the filibuster requires that 60 votes be found in order to prevail on a  motion or a measure.   The filibuster raises the requirement from a simple majority to 60  votes. The Senator from Kentucky knows that as well as I do, he has  been here longer than I have, that filibuster makes all the difference  in the world. So to argue ``The Democrats have the majority; why don't  they just take this majority and do their business?'' is to ignore the  obvious.   What the Republicans have decided to do is, for the first time  perhaps ever--I don't want to say that without checking the record for  sure--but certainly in modern history, to require that when we pass the  debt ceiling, we need to have 60 votes on the floor of the Senate.  Well, it is no great revelation that with 50 Democrats, we would need  10 Republicans, and the Senate Republican leader has made it clear: He  ain't giving us a vote, not one. So we have come to a standstill.   We are 2 weeks away from a default. For the first time in the history  of the United States that we would default on our debt, it is as if  America had a big home and a big mortgage and decided one month not to  pay on the mortgage. Well, let's hope the day would come when the  payment would be made, but in the meantime, there is a serious question  then raised about the credit reputation of the United States, and that  is exactly the fire that the Republicans are playing with by imposing a  filibuster on this simple measure. They know that they can stop us as  long as 60 votes are needed and they give none.   One of our colleagues, Senator Whitehouse, made an interesting  observation in our caucus lunch last week. I hope he will forgive me if  I try to paraphrase it. He said: Many people argue that we need a  filibuster because it really encourages bipartisanship. We have to come  together. We have to look for compromise.   Well, how do you compromise when the debt ceiling question is whether  you do it or don't do it? And that is what is at stake here. Are we  going to acknowledge the debt of the United States to its creditors far  and wide and continue the business of this economy and this government?  Republicans say: No, we would rather play fire with it. But they leave  out that one element that is so critical: It is their decision, their  filibuster that stops this.   I believe that Senator Schumer and the Democrats will offer them this  opportunity again this week. Senator Schumer said as much. But it  really troubles me that we are at a point in our history, recovering  from this pandemic, businesses getting back on their feet, employees  need to go back to work--and the Republicans have taken this strategy  of defaulting on the national debt.   As far as the characterization of what reconciliation will do,  Senator McConnell continues to come to the floor repeatedly and say:  ``It will hurt families.'' Well, one of the provisions in the  reconciliation bill, which I hope survives our compromise negotiation,  will help families find affordable, quality daycare.   When you look at the fact that the vast majority of those who are not  returning to work are women, you understand the circumstances. Many of  them question whether or not school is going to be in person or by  Zoom. They question whether or not they can find affordable daycare in  any direction, and they question whether they can afford it once they  find it.   If we took that worry off the family plate and said ``We are going to  make sure that you have accessible, affordable childcare for your  children,'' think of the relief it would give and the fact that many  would return to the workplace.   According to the Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, that hurts  families. Hurts them? It helps them in ways that many of us don't even  understand. Can you imagine frantically leaving a child at home in the  care of someone you don't quite trust because you have no alternative  but to go to work and try to earn a paycheck to feed that child and pay  the rent? I wouldn't want to be in that desperate situation. I wouldn't  want anyone in family to face it. To say that hurts families, to do  that, is certainly wrong. It would help them if reconciliation includes  that measure.   We also have a pre-K program to give kids who struggle a helping hand  and a fresh start. We know the Head Start Program--it was created I  guess almost 60-plus years ago--has had positive results in preparing  people to go to college. Yes, Head Start Programs when they are young  children--3, 4, and 5 years old--can make difference in their lives,  how they learn, and what they do. So we want to make that the official  policy of this country, that we have 2 years of pre-K education  available to families. I think they will thank us for it, and in the  future, generations that are helped with this will thank us as well.   The notion of extending the school year from K-12 through K-14, to  put 2 years of community college without cost for families, is an  extraordinary commitment.   There was a time in the turn of the 19th to the 20th century when  America decided to make a big, bold experiment. It was called high  schools. Up until that point, most families were lucky to get kids  through eighth grade. The rich families, the ones well-positioned,  would take them to high school. Well, we decided to make high school a  universal, national experience in America. So you wouldn't quit at the  8th grade; you would finish in the 12th grade. Did it result in  anything good for us? Take a look at the 20th century. With an  educated, motivated workforce, America led the world. It is  [[Page S6883]]  no accident that extending education brought us to that moment.    Now, Joe Biden and many of us agree the 21st century is a brandnew  set of challenges and putting 2 more years that you don't have to worry  about going deep in debt affording on to a person's education gives  them a better chance. Some will go to college. Some will develop skills  that they need to get into the workforce and succeed. Some will have an  experience that will change their lives. That is what this additional 2  years will be.   Senator McConnell thinks an additional 2 years of free higher  education hurts American families. What is he thinking? I don't know  what it is like in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, but just north of it,  in Illinois, we appreciate education and how it liberates, motivates,  and educates young people to be part of the future.   So I would say to Senator McConnell: Understand Senate 101. Your  filibuster is stopping the extension of the debt ceiling, and stopping  the extension is going to jeopardize our credit rating, raise interest  rates, and cost 6 million American jobs, according to the best  economists. Why would we do that to America at this moment in history?  We should be doing just the opposite, helping everybody we can.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to return to my statement  that I was making earlier when I voluntarily surrendered the floor.    Madam President, I noted that the shadow docket in the  Supreme Court was a subject of the Senate Judiciary Committee last  week. It is one of those esoteric subjects you wonder if anybody will  even notice. We thought it was important enough to talk about it in  light of the Texas abortion statute.   We noted the fact that in the last 4 years, there were 36 times when  the Trump administration asked for the shadow docket to be used. The  Court granted 28 of those Trump Justice Department administration  requests. In the previous years, under George W. Bush and Barack Obama:  16 years; 8 requests; 4 were granted--4 versus 28 out of 36.   You can tell that something is happening in the Court. The day after  our hearing, someone happened to notice. That person was Justice Samuel  Alito. He made headlines for a speech he gave at Notre Dame Law School  criticizing lawmakers--I suppose that is myself and the Presiding  Officer--journalists, and scholars who raised concern about the Court's  use of the shadow docket.   There doesn't appear to be a publicly available transcript or video  of the full speech given by Justice Alito, so I ask unanimous consent  to have printed in the Congressional Record an article from The Hill  newspaper entitled ``Alito bristles over criticism of Supreme Court's  `shadow docket'.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From The Hill, Sept. 30, 2021]       Alito Bristles Over Criticism of Supreme Court's Shadow Docket                              (By John Kruzel)         Justice Samuel Alito on Thursday bristled over recent       criticism of the Supreme Court's handling of emergency       matters under its so-called ``shadow docket,'' a phrase the       justice said plays into a warped portrayal of the court as a       ``dangerous cabal.''        The staunchly conservative 71-year-old justice said he       welcomes substantive debate over the court's rulings, but       takes exception to what he characterized as a distorted       depiction commonly found in media reports on the court's       emergency activity.        ``The catchy and sinister term `shadow docket' has been       used to portray the court as having been captured by a       dangerous cabal that resorts to sneaky and improper methods       to get its ways,'' Alito told students during a speech at       Notre Dame Law School.        ``And this portrayal feeds unprecedented efforts to       intimidate the court or damage it as an independent       institution,'' he said.        The phrase ``shadow docket,'' originally coined by       University of Chicago Law School professor William Baude, has       come to refer to the court's use of a truncated process to       issue rulings on an emergency basis. The procedure departs       from the court's regular operations by forgoing a       comprehensive set of paper briefs and oral arguments in favor       of ruling quickly on an emergency application.        Although Alito's speech Thursday gave the impression that       the principal critics of the court's shadow docket were       observers and politicians, three of his fellow justices have       criticized the shadow docket's recent use as a vehicle for       rulings of major significance.        In recent weeks, the court's three more liberal justices--      Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan--have either       individually criticized the procedure's use or joined a       dissenting opinion that did so.        The liberal jurists denounced the majority's use of the       shadow docket in August to block an eviction freeze put in       place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)       to shield cash-strapped renters from the coronavirus       pandemic. Likewise. a 5-4 majority court refused to block       Texas' six-week abortion ban from taking effect earlier this       month.        Kagan took direct aim at the practice in a dissent from the       majority's Texas ruling that was joined by her two fellow       liberals.        ``[T]he majority's decision is emblematic of too much of       this Court's shadow docket decisionmaking--which every day       becomes more unreasoned, inconsistent, and impossible to       defend,'' Kagan wrote.        The shadow docket itself is nothing new. But the Supreme       Court had previously used the abbreviated process only       sparingly to render decisions of major consequence, according       to a report by The Economist, which found the practice became       more common during the Trump administration.        Alito conceded in his Thursday speech that the emergency       docket has seen an increase in activity.        ``Now it is true that we have issued more emergency rulings       in recent years, but there is a simple reason for that and       it's not part of a nefarious strategy: it's because we had       been receiving more emergency applications,'' he said.        ``We would much prefer to have days or weeks or months to       think about these matters before we have to do anything,'' he       added. ``But we don't have that luxury. The world will not       sit still while we cogitate.''     In his speech, Justice Alito reportedly zeroed in on our  Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week and criticized one of the  experts who testified, University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck.  He also reportedly criticized an article by a respected journalist who  writes about the Court frequently for a major magazine.   Justice Alito derided the phrase ``shadow docket'' as a ``catchy and  sinister term'' meant to convey something ``sneaky and dangerous.'' In  fact, the phrase ``shadow docket'' was coined by a University of  Chicago law professor, William Baude, who, incidentally, clerked for  Chief Justice Roberts and has spoken more than 30 times in Federalist  Society events.   Justice Alito dismissed concerns about the shadow docket. He said:         The media and political talk about the shadow docket is not       serious criticism.    What he failed to mention, however, is that some of the strongest  warnings about the Court's changing use of the shadow docket have come  not from politicians like ourselves or journalists but from Justice  Alito's colleagues on the Court.   Our hearing in the Judiciary Committee highlighted how Justices  Kagan, Sotomayor, Breyer, and even Chief Justice Roberts sounded the  alarm about the Supreme Court's shadow docket ruling on the Texas  abortion ban.   Justice Sotomayor said of the Court's shadow docket decision on the  Texas law:         The Court's order is stunning. Presented with an       application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law       engineered to prohibit women from exercising their       constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority       of Justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand.    That is from Justice Sotomayor.   How about Justice Kagan? Justice Kagan expressed alarm that the  Court's shadow docket decisionmaking ``every day becomes more  unreasoned, inconsistent, and impossible to defend.   The Justices made it clear that the Court's shadow docket handling of  S.B. 8 in Texas raises urgent concerns that American people should be  aware of. That is why we had the hearing. Chief Justice Roberts noted  that Texas has now created ``a model for action,'' in his words,  showing how States can undermine constitutional rights by using a  bounty hunter enforcement scheme that avoids judicial scrutiny, thanks  to the shadow docket. Lawmakers in a number of States are eyeing this  procedure to try to copycat Texas's enforcement model. That ought to  trouble anyone who cares about our Constitution.   With its order on the Texas abortion ban, the Court's majority has  also shown its willingness to use the shadow docket to allow  ``flagrantly unconstitutional'' laws, in the words of Justice  Sotomayor, to take effect, at least when the laws align with the  majority's ideological beliefs. As a result,  [[Page S6884]]  millions of Texans have had their constitutional rights stripped away,  and the rights of all Americans are less secure. That is a major change  that demands serious discussion.   Justice Alito may bristle at perceived criticism of the Court's  practices, but that doesn't mean the Court should be immune from  scrutiny from the American people, a free press, even legislative  branch of government.   Historically, Congress has played an important and essential role in  debates over the proper functioning of the courts.   First and foremost is the Senate's advise and consent role that  results in the appointment of men and women to the Supreme Court. In  addition, many aspects of the Supreme Court's operation, including the  starting date of the Court's fall term, are established by an act of  Congress. In fact, much of the Court's jurisdiction is set by Congress.   Congress is asked regularly by the Judicial Conference to pass new  legislation governing the operations of the judiciary, and Justices  have routinely come before Congress to discuss the requests and a wide  range of other matters. In March 2019, for example, Justice Kagan  testified before the House Appropriations Committee about such topics  as whether the judicial code of conduct should apply to the Supreme  Court. With her that day was none other than Justice Alito.   The Senate Judiciary Committee has frequently and appropriately been  the forum for many debates over the Supreme Court's operations. I  remember in 2011 when Justices Scalia and Breyer appeared before the  Judiciary Committee for a wide-ranging discussion of the role of judges  under the Constitution.   Our committee also has robust debates about the appropriate degree of  transparency for the Court's operation. Earlier this year, the  committee approved bipartisan legislation to allow cameras in the  Supreme Court so that all Americans can see what is going on.   We are going to continue this debate in the Judiciary Committee over  the shadow docket. It is not politicizing the Court to do so. And  Republicans have no standing to accuse Democrats of politicizing the  Court, especially after their unprecedented, politically motivated  blockade of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee in 2016 and their  haste to confirm a third Trump Justice mere weeks before the 2020  election--both acts of raw, political power.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) are necessarily  absent.
