 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6511) to authorize the Secretary of Energy to carry out a  program to lease underutilized Strategic Petroleum Reserve facilities,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6511         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Strategic Petroleum Reserve       Reform Act''.       SEC. 2. USE OF UNDERUTILIZED STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE                     FACILITIES.         Section 168 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42       U.S.C. 6247a) is amended to read as follows:       ``SEC. 168. USE OF UNDERUTILIZED FACILITIES.         ``(a) Authority.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       this title, the Secretary may establish and carry out a       program to lease underutilized Strategic Petroleum Reserve       storage facilities and related facilities to the private       sector, or a foreign government or its representative.       Petroleum products stored under this section are not part of       the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.        ``(b) Protection of Facilities.--Any lease entered into       under the program established under subsection (a) shall       contain provisions providing for fees to fully compensate the       United States for all related costs of storage and removals       of petroleum products (including the proportionate cost of       replacement facilities necessitated as a result of any       withdrawals) incurred by the United States as a result of       such lease.        ``(c) Access by the United States.--The Secretary shall       ensure that leasing of facilities under the program       established under subsection (a) does not impair the ability       of the United States to withdraw, distribute, or sell       petroleum products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in       response to an energy emergency or to the obligations of the       United States under the Agreement on an International Energy       Program.        ``(d) National Security.--The Secretary shall ensure that       leasing of facilities under the program established under       subsection (a) to a foreign government or its representative       will not impair national security.        ``(e) Deposits of Amounts Received.--        ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2),       amounts received through the leasing of facilities under the       program established under subsection (a) shall be deposited       in the general fund of the Treasury during the fiscal year in       which such amounts are received.        ``(2) Costs.--The Secretary may use for costs described in       subsection (b) (other than costs described in subsection       (f)), without further appropriation, amounts received through       the leasing of facilities under the program established under       subsection (a).        ``(f) Preparation of Facilities.--The Secretary shall only       use amounts available in the Energy Security and       Infrastructure Modernization Fund established by section 404       of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 for costs described in       subsection (b) of this section that relate to addition of       facilities or changes to facilities or facility operations       necessary to lease such facilities, including costs related       to acquisition of land, acquisition of ancillary facilities       and equipment, and site development, and other necessary       costs related to capital improvement.''.       SEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAM TO LEASE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE                     FACILITIES.         (a) In General.--Part B of title I of the Energy Policy and       Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6231 et seq.) is amended by       adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 170.

(b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of contents for the       Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended by adding after       the item relating to section 169 the following:  ``Sec. 170. Pilot program to lease storage and related facilities.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials in the Record on this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in 1995, President Ford signed a bill to ban the sale  of crude oil overseas. Two years ago, we repealed that ban, and, last  month, we were exporting some days 3 million barrels of oil per day.                                time  1545    We have gone from a nation that was importing up to 80 percent of our  oil to a nation that, today, if we absolutely had to, could be totally  energy independent.   Because of the Arab oil embargo in the early 1970s, a little before  President Ford signed the bill that said you couldn't export crude oil,  we established a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The idea was that we  wanted to store oil in underground caverns--crude oil--so that, if  there were another supply disruption, we would have the crude oil even  if the OPEC cartel cut off oil shipments to the United States.   We have authorized up to a billion barrels of crude oil in this  reserve, and there is currently a little under 700 million barrels.  But, Madam Speaker, we don't need 700 million barrels of crude oil  today because, as I have just pointed out, when we allowed crude oil to  be exported, we unleashed a drilling boom in the United States that has  driven our oil production on a daily basis from around 6 million  barrels of oil per day to, this past month, 11 million barrels of oil  per day.   So, hence, the idea embodied in H.R. 6511, cosponsored by my good  friend from Chicago, Democrat  Bobby Rush. It is pretty  straightforward.   We have quite a bit of excess capacity right now in the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve. We have authorized the sale of about 300 million  barrels between now and 2028. If that oil is actually sold, we will  have almost half of the SPR without any crude oil in it. So why not set  up a program and authorize the Department of Energy to put that vacant  space up for bid?   Oil producers all over the United States are scrambling for ways to  store all the oil that we are producing while it is waiting to be  refined or shipped overseas.   This is not a mandatory program. We are not mandating that the  private sector has to lease the space. What we are saying is, if the  private sector wants to negotiate with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  managers, and it is a good deal for both sides, they can.   We currently--now, this number may not be exactly right, Madam  Speaker, but we spend about $200 million a year, I believe, to store  the oil that we are storing in the reserve, that is owned by the  taxpayers.   If you have vacant space and you allow the private sector to use that  vacant space and you charge whatever the market rate is for the private  sector to put oil in the reserve for a short term, those funds will  offset the cost of storing the government-owned oil. They will also  offset the cost of maintaining the reserve, and they will offset the  cost of improving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Again, this is not a mandatory program, so we believe that this bill,  H.R. 6511, is a win-win. It helps the taxpayers because it might  generate some revenue that could be used to offset the cost of  maintaining the reserve as it exists. It might save the private sector  some money if they decide to utilize it.   And it might--and I would say, probably will--make our energy sector  more efficient because the private sector, should they choose to  participate in this program, doesn't have to go out and build above- ground storage and maintain the above-ground storage. They can use the  existing capacity that has already been hollowed out on the Gulf Coast  of the United States that is very conveniently located adjacent to our  refineries and/or to our export terminals; and that will, overall,  lower costs of the whole system and end up being a win for the consumer  both in the United States and overseas. So I would hope that, when the  time comes later today, we will pass this unanimously.   I want to thank, again, my original Democratic sponsor, Congressman  Rush of Chicago, Illinois. I want to thank the subcommittee chairman,  Fred Upton of Michigan; the full committee chairman,  Greg Walden of  Oregon; and the full committee ranking member, who is on the floor, Mr.  Pallone of New Jersey.   We have all worked on a bipartisan basis to pass this, and we think  that is why we have put it on the suspension calendar.   As you know, Madam Speaker, suspension bills have to get a two-thirds  vote, and I am hoping that this bill gets a 100 percent vote. It is a  good bill. It is a win-win.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I have been in Congress for 34 years. I am about to  retire at the end of this session. I have been on the House floor with  many tumultuous battles. I have watched the fight over the Keystone  pipeline, drilling in ANWR up in Alaska. My good friend, Senator Markey  of Massachusetts, when he was in the House, would come to the floor  with his chart, an oil well drilling into the Social Security trust  fund.   It is refreshing, Madam Speaker, to be on the floor today in the  spirit of bipartisanship where we are all for something which I think  really is good for the American people, good for the taxpayer, and good  for the consumer.   This is on suspension, so, obviously, we have to have a huge vote. I  hope we get it. It looks like we will since we don't have any other  speakers.   I would urge a ``yes'' vote, Madam Speaker. Let's do something good  for America. Let's vote for this bill. Please vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6511  when the vote is called.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
