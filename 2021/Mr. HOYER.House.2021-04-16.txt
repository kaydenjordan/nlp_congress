 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning- hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes expected no  earlier than 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate  and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Wednesday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for legislative  business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business,  with last votes no later than 3 p.m.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business today.   In addition, Madam Speaker, we will consider bills relating to  justice and civil rights: H.R. 1333, the NO BAN Act, which prevents  origin-based discrimination against those seeking to visit our country  to do business, see family, or engage in tourism, rejecting the  previous administration's policy of banning arrivals from predominantly  Muslim countries; H.R. 1573, the Access to Counsel Act, which reaffirms  key American principles of justice with regard to immigrants' rights to  counsel during status hearings; and then lastly, H.R. 51, standing for  the 51st State. H.R. 51 is the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, to admit  the District of Columbia as a State and provide equal representation in  Congress for its residents.   That will be our schedule for the week to come. The following 2 weeks  in April will be our committee workweeks so that the committees can  produce additional product for consideration on the floor of the House  of Representatives.    I have not had a discussion with Mr. Nadler, but as the  gentleman knows, we have a lot of work to do on the floor of the House  of Representatives, and we intend to get that work done. We have not  considered bringing to the floor the bill to which the gentleman  refers.   Did the gentleman in his research find any instances in any  authoritarian country where they refused to consider a constitutional  appointee to their Supreme Court that the President, with 10 months on  his term, sent down to the United States Senate or some other body in  those countries?    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I don't know about the Nadler bill, but I  do know that the Constitution says nothing about the Senate's ability  to simply refuse to consider an appointee of the President of the  United States. I don't think the Founders had any concept that that  would be the case when they gave the power of appointment to the  President of the United States.                                time  1230    And then when that occurred, when the present Attorney General was  appointed to the Supreme Court, Mitch McConnell said, We are not going  to consider it, ten months before the end of the term of a President of  the United States. And then they said the reason being is because we  have an election coming up in just a few months--in that case, it was 8  months--and the next President ought to appoint.   Madam Speaker, that deep principle enunciated by Mr. McConnell, by  Mr. Graham, and others--who was the chairman of the Committee on the  Judiciary, that deep principle was abandoned immediately when it became  politically pragmatic for the Republican Party to do so and steal a  Supreme Court justice.   So he can talk about socialism all he wants. What a distraction that  is. A failure to want to discuss on the merits of the issues.   So what do they do, Madam Speaker? They talk about socialism or  communism or dictatorship, none of which we have in the United States  of America.   Now, we just lost a President of the United States that, in my  experience--and I have served with many Presidents of the United  States--was the most authoritarian-seeking President with whom I have  served.   Madam Speaker, so I tell my friend that we are going to focus on  issues important to the American people. We want to pass a jobs bill to  make sure that America is competitive in the 21st century. We want to  pass a jobs bill to make sure that families have good-paying jobs that  they can support themselves and their families. We want to support  bills that build America back better. I want an America that makes sure  that everybody can ``make it in America,'' not only manufacture it in  America but make it in America. That is what we are going to be focused  on.   Madam Speaker, we hope that the debate is on the merits of those  proposals, not some aspersion of some ideological tinge that they may  think their supporters regale at.    The gentleman refers to Communist China, apparently wants  to follow that example. A communist authoritarian government that owns  most of the manufacturing capability in China--not all of it. It is  ironic that in two different debates in less than 5 minutes that the  gentleman would point to China as the example of what perhaps we ought  to do, when their tax policy is approximately 100 percent, except what  they want to allow their citizens to have.   Madam Speaker, let me just close on that point with: The Supreme  Court has been packed.    Madam Speaker, we have a situation that is heart-wrenching  and unacceptable. And it must be dealt with. In part, this situation  comes because of the draconian policies of the previous administration.   It comes also because Republicans have refused, in both Houses, to  come to agreement on a comprehensive immigration reform bill. So we  have chaos as a result because our immigration system, as I believe  almost every Member of your side of the aisle and every Member of my  side of the aisle believes, is broken.   Now, unfortunately, what we see in that picture is broken systems  causing great danger, apprehension, and fear among many people who are  fleeing to America for refuge. It has, of course, Lady Liberty at the  head of the harbor, the Hudson River, raises her torch and says, ``That  is what America is for.''   Now, having said that, this situation is unacceptable. It is  unacceptable for humanitarian reasons. It is unacceptable for the  safety of not only those people that are in that picture, but for  American citizens as well.   Madam Speaker, now it is my understanding that the CDC's existing  pandemic public health order for closed borders is, in fact, being  followed. In Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, California, unaccompanied  children crossing the border are tested--are tested--by the Department  of Health and Human Services. The migrants entering ICE facilities are  tested, and they are quarantined if they test positive.   So protections are trying to be effective, and this administration is  working very hard to ensure the safety of Americans and the safety of  these many children who have come across the border.                                time  1245    None of them have been taken out of the arms of their parents. None  of them have been made orphans by this administration.   I didn't hear the gentleman lamenting the fact that we had hundreds  of children who had been taken out of the arms of their parents, and  then they could not be found--that is, their parents. They could not be  reunited with their parents.   This is a challenge. It is not a partisan challenge. It is a  challenge for America. It is a challenge for us all.   This administration is working to try to come to a solution that is  both humanitarian and effective. I am hopeful that they will proceed in  accomplishing that objective.   The gentleman mentions the policies of the Trump administration,  which substantially underfunded its own policies of trying to help the  Northern Triangle countries. When I say help the triangle countries,  unfortunately, the leadership of those countries, in too many  instances, is not trying to help itself. So, we see panicked people  fleeing.   Madam Speaker, I don't know whether the gentleman from Louisiana, my  friend, Mr. Scalise, saw the pictures of two children being dropped  over the fence--by the way, that very large fence, billions of dollars  of fence. Smugglers dropped two children over the fence. That is how  secure it was.   The tragedy of those children being dropped over that fence alone, I  don't care where they are from or who they are, but my faith teaches me  that they may be strangers, but they are brothers and sisters.   In that context, we need to come to grips, and I am hopeful that the  gentleman will support the administration's desire to get a  comprehensive immigration bill adopted in this Congress.   In 2013, the Senate passed, Madam Speaker, a bill which was supported  by Democrats and Republicans, 14 Republican Members of the United  States Senate. We pleaded with the Republican leadership to bring that  bill to the floor. They will say they brought a  [[Page H1877]]  bill to the floor, and they did bring a bill to the floor, and almost  nobody thought it was effective in accomplishing the objective of  having an immigration system that would work.   So, I tell the gentleman, the pictures that he is displaying ought to  concern us all deeply. We ought to urge all of our colleagues to  cooperate and work toward making sure that we don't have scenes like  that and that we have the ability to deal with this surge at the border  in a humane way.   But no one in the previous administration can wash their hands of the  responsibility of creating a situation which--the gentleman says Mexico  is adjudged to be one of the most dangerous nations on Earth for COVID- 19. The previous administration said to people trying to seek solace  and health and safety: Stay. Stay in the most dangerous nation on Earth  for COVID-19.   I don't know whether that is a very humane policy. That is not a  sanctuary for people who are in dire straits.   We said ``no'' to some people who came here from Germany. We said,  no, you can't come in. Many of them returned in the 1930s and early  1940s and were slaughtered. They came here for sanctuary and found  none.   That doesn't mean we can take everybody, but it does mean that we  need to deal with it in a humanitarian way, in a way that honors our  values and honors these people as our fellow human beings.   So, I tell the gentleman, in conclusion, that these are sad scenes,  and we need to respond to them in a humanitarian way, but also a smart  way. We need to respond to the cause as well as the effect.    Will the gentleman yield on the asylum issue?    Does the gentleman believe we ought to obey America's laws  on asylum?    Donald Trump didn't fix the problem; he delayed the  problem. That is what happened. That is what those pictures reflect.   He didn't fix the problem. He would say to those kids: Get out of  here. Go back to Mexico. Maybe you have a parent there, maybe you have  somebody who will take care of you, but get out of here.   That was one way to ``solve'' the problem, I presume. Those kids  didn't go away. The fear that they have for being home didn't go away.   Now, I have said, Madam Speaker, this is something that we all need  to deal with from a compassionate standpoint, from a legal standpoint,  and from a human standpoint, which I guess is redundant to  ``compassionate.'' But the fact of the matter is that President Trump  did not solve this problem; he simply delayed it.   When he left, the pressure was so great because they did not believe  that this President would simply throw them to the wolves, take them  from their parents, treat them as refuse.   We need to deal with this, and, hopefully, we will. Hopefully we will  get comprehensive immigration reform.   I will say again that one of the reasons that we have the problem of  not adjudicating these people quickly is because we don't have enough  judges. And the reason we don't have enough judges, which were included  both in the 2013 bill and the subsequent reform bills, is because we  haven't passed bills to provide the judges on the theory that if we  don't provide the judges, then we won't be able to approve asylum and  people won't be able to get in.   Madam Speaker, I am at the end of this circuitous argument.                                time  1300
