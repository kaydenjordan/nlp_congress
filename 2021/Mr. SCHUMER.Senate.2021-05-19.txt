 Mr. President, so the Spanish philosopher, Jorge  Santayana, is credited with the saying, ``Those who cannot remember the  past are condemned to repeat it.''   When it comes to January 6, we would all do well to heed that advice.  But right now, there is an effort on the part of the House Republican  leadership to make sure we forget that that fateful day ever happened.   Later today, the House will vote on establishing an independent  Commission to investigate the events of January 6, a complement to the  investigation in the House and Senate committees. Both sides negotiated  for months. The House Republican leader made three specific requests in  February. All three were granted by House Democrats. Modeled after the  bipartisan 9/11 Commission, it will have equal representation from both  Democrats and Republicans. Subpoenas can only be issued if Members from  both sides agree.   It appeared we had reached a consensus with the support of rank-and- file Republicans and, frankly, I thought the Speaker was being very  generous because subpoena power is so important when you look into  something, but she did that. I salute her for it. But even when she  went that far, at the eleventh hour, the House Republican leadership  turned tail, threw its own negotiators under the bus, and decided to  try to sabotage the Commission. Once again, they are caving to Donald  Trump and proving that the Republican Party is still drunk off the Big  Lie.   Just one week after House Republicans fired Congresswoman Cheney for  simply telling the truth about the election, their new leadership is  trying to kill a bipartisan investigation--a very down-the-middle  bipartisan investigation--of the attack on our Capitol.   At the root of both efforts is the shameful desire to protect Donald  Trump and perpetuate the Big Lie, even though it undermines our  democracy, because when people don't believe elections are on the  level, that is the beginning of the end of a democracy.   What the Republicans are doing--the House Republicans--is beyond  crazy. To be so far under the thumb of Donald J. Trump, letting the  most dishonest President in American history dictate  [[Page S2746]]  the prerogatives of the Republican Party, will be its demise. Mark my  words. Whatever that means for Democrats, it is bad for America.   We all know there needs to be a thorough and honest accounting of  what took place on January 6, the greatest attempt at insurrection  since the Civil War. We have to make sure such a despicable event never  repeats itself. That is why we need the investigation.   Getting at the truth is more important now that some Republicans are  trying to rewrite history. It is just incredible what they are doing.  How dishonest can they be, in abject fear of the most dishonest  President who has ever sat at the White House, Donald Trump, who will  tell lies at will? He doesn't care. It is only his own ego. We know  that. One Member said it was a ``boldfaced lie'' to call it an  insurrection and likened the mob to a ``normal tourist visit.'' Give me  a break.   Several Members have spread the lie that it was actually Antifa that  stormed the Capitol and so have some commentators on one of our leading  news networks--shamefully, shamefully.   One Republican went so far as to say the mob, not the police, were  the real victims of the violence that day. Can you imagine being in the  family of one of the police officers who died or was injured? It is bad  enough, but hearing that? How far will they go in obeisance to the  lying President Donald Trump? How far?   These are dangerous lies rooted fundamentally in the Big Lie that has  seemingly enveloped the Republican Party. Shame on them. Shame on the  Republicans for choosing the Big Lie over the truth--not all  Republicans, but the majority who seem to be doing it. Shame. Shame on  them for defending the mob over our Capitol Police officers. And shame  on the House Republican leadership for punishing Republicans who tell  the truth, instead of those who poison faith in our democracy.   Here in the Senate, we will have a vote on the January 6 Commission.  The only way to stop these lies is to respond with the truth, with  facts, with an honest, objective investigation of what happened that  day.   An independent Commission can be the antidote to the poisonous  mistruths that continue to spread about January 6. That is what our  Founding Fathers believed in. They believed in a fact-based nation, and  they believed the facts will come out. People will have different views  when they see those facts and assemble those facts, but they believe in  the truth.   I can't think of a time when a political party has been so abjectly  far away from the truth than the perpetuation of the Big Lie.   So again, the Senate will vote on the January 6 Commission. It ought  to gain bipartisan support. There are reports--sad, unfortunate  reports--that the Republican leader here in the Senate might be  following his House colleagues down the rabbit hole and will oppose the  Commission. I hope that isn't true.   But the American people will see for themselves whether our  Republican friends stand on the side of truth or on the side of Donald  Trump's Big Lie                                Voting Rights    Mr. President, on voting rights, the Texas State Senate recently  passed a bill that repeals all requirements for carrying a handgun,  including a valid license, registering fingerprints, and 4 hours of  training. Texas would be the sixth State to pass a permitless carry  law, with Louisiana waiting in the wings. If both Texas and Louisiana  pass these laws, fully a third of Americans would live in States where  it was legal to carry firearms without training or a license.   Just one week after the Texas legislature advanced that law to make  it as easy as possible to carry a handgun, it advanced another law to  make it harder to vote. You need stringent identification to vote and  no identification to carry a handgun. What the heck is going on in  Texas?   Just think about that for a moment. Across the country, Republican  legislatures are removing all barriers to carry firearms, while at the  same time putting up barriers around voting. The political right wants  to make it easier for felons to get a gun but harder for younger,  poorer, and non-White Americans to vote. It is hard to think of a more  reactionary vision for our country, a more backward-looking vision, a  vision that eventually will be repudiated not only in the history books  but in our Nation's politics.   Sadly, as voter suppression laws sweep through Republican State  houses from Florida, Montana, and everywhere in between, the political  right is actually bragging about how successfully they are restricting  the franchise.   Last week, a spokesperson for Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of  the far-right think tank, told a group of Republican donors that  Heritage Action was drafting new voter restrictions and literally  handing them over to State legislatures in order to give the laws  ``that grassroots feel.'' She went on to crow about how ``quickly and  quietly'' her organization managed to get new limits on voting passed  in Iowa. She told the donors that she looked at her team of rightwing  lobbyists and said: ``It can't be that easy.''   That is how the far right is talking about making it harder for  Americans to vote. Behind closed doors, with well-heeled donors, they  are laughing about how easy it is to limit American voting rights, and  that is because Republican legislatures, from one end of the country to  the other, are eagerly and willfully going along. It is despicable.   In this country, in a democracy, when your side loses an election,  you try to win more voters over. You don't try to stop the other side  from voting.   But seizing on that Big Lie that the election was stolen, Republican  legislatures are orchestrating the greatest contraction of voting  rights since the end of reconstruction and the beginning of Jim Crow.   These laws cannot go unanswered. Senate Democrats are moving forward  with legislation, S. 1, to combat this rash of voter suppression laws.  It has gone through the Rules Committee, and it will receive a vote  here on the Senate floor.   Our Republican colleagues need to decide if they are going to stand  up for democracy or not.                            Clean Cars for America    Mr. President, on one final matter, clean cars, yesterday, at an  event in Michigan, President Biden declared that the future of the auto  industry is electric. He is absolutely right.   But even though the transition to electric vehicles has already  begun, it is progressing too slowly. China is outpacing the United  States in the electrical vehicle market, and the only way we are going  to meet our ambitious climate targets is to accelerate the transition  to zero-emission vehicles.   That is why I was so glad to hear President Biden get into the  specifics and talk about the many ways that government, industry, and  labor can partner up to put more electric vehicles on the road and  create more jobs in the process.   At the heart of that effort is legislation called Clean Cars for  America. It is a proposal I drafted and introduced several years ago,  and now it has become a central component to the American Jobs Plan and  President Biden's Build Back Better agenda.   Through a mixture of point-of-sale incentives for consumers, charging  infrastructure investments, and support for American manufacturing of  electric vehicles, it would make electric vehicles affordable for all  Americans and create thousands and thousands and thousands of good- paying union jobs in automaking, construction, and battery  manufacturing.   We need a large-scale effort to achieve an electric vehicle future.  Clean Cars for America is the way to get there.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
