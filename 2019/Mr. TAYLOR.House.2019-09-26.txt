 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation,  H.R. 3246, the Traveling Parents Screening Consistency Act.   As a new Member of Congress, I endeavor to listen to my constituents.  As a new Member, I have actually had over 300 individual meetings with  my constituents in the last 8 months. I have had 24 Coffees with Your  Congressman.   One of my constituents, a mother from Fairview, Texas, took advantage  of this Coffee with Your Congressman opportunity and came and told me  about her problems that she was having with TSA as a new mother trying  to get her breast milk through to feed her child.                                time  1445    This I realized was a problem not just for her, but many mothers  across my district and really many mothers across this entire country.  I have heard story after story, as I have worked on this legislation,  telling about how the TSA is just not consistent with how they are  applying their rules.   So this bill seeks to create clear and consistent rules that parents  can understand as they travel our Nation's airports. This is important  legislation to help streamline that very important process to both keep  us safe and make it easy to travel.   I want to thank my colleague very much from across the aisle,  Congresswoman Rice. I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Thompson  and Ranking Member Rogers, and I also want to thank Senator McSally for  carrying this piece of legislation in the other Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to, hopefully, passing this today, and I  urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3246.
