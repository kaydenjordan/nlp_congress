 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Rogers for yielding.   Yesterday, we remembered the 81st anniversary of the bombing of Pearl  Harbor. The United States was surprised by the audacious Japanese  attack and our national security was placed in peril. Times have  changed, though, and Japan is now a bedrock ally of the United States  today. I can't help but wonder if we learned the hard-earned lessons of  Pearl Harbor or whether we are drifting into strategic malaise and will  be caught unprepared by another attack on our national security.   Frankly, we are not ready. With a Navy fleet that continues to tread  water in overall force structure and an Air Force that continues to  cede combat firepower, I am not confident of our trajectory.   That is why I am pleased to have rejected a multitude of reckless  national security objectives proposed by the Biden administration. This  bill authorizes a 20 percent increase in ship construction, partially  rejects an ill-advised divest-to-invest strategy and blocks a multitude  of poison pills that were haphazardly tacked on to this legislation.   While this is a good bill worthy of support, I look forward to the  next Congress where we can assert with greater certainty a revised  trajectory for our national security. We need to better assure our  partners and allies and avoid our pre-World War II hubris by decisively  deterring future aggressors. We have much work to do.   I thank Ranking Member Rogers and his leadership during the top-line  debate this year. We are adopting his budget vision today, a vision  that ensures real growth for defense. I also particularly thank  Chairmen Smith and Courtney for their desire to reach bipartisan  consensus.   My friends, this is a good bill that advances the national security  of the United States. I urge all Members to support the bill.
