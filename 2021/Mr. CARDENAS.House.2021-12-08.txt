 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for this  opportunity for us to pass these amazing bills.   Madam Speaker, I want to take note: The seven bills that we are  discussing on the floor over the last hour and a half, which we will  soon vote with the entire body of this House, all of those bills passed  out of the Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously. That means every  Republican and Democrat voted ``yes.'' There were no ``no'' votes.   I feel it is important for us to mention that because when you look  at the press, they think that all we are doing here is arguing,  fussing, and fighting with each other, but we do work together.   To all of my Republican colleagues on the committee and Democratic  colleagues on the committee, thank you so much for doing our job.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan bill with Congressman Bilirakis, the Oral Health Literacy  and Awareness Act of 2021.   Oral health is whole body health. It is often neglected by parents  who, unfortunately, lack resources and knowledge.   Oral health accounts for some of the deepest health disparities in  all low-income families across America. For many, the cost of dental  neglect can be detrimental, especially for children. Arthritis,  autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory skin  disorders, gut issues, and more can all be caused or worsened by  untreated tooth decay and oral disease.   According to the CDC, children who have poor oral health often miss  more school and receive lower grades than children who don't. Even more  alarming, Latino kids, like those in my district, experience two times  more tooth decay and cavities than their White peers.                                time  1700    We can and must do better for our children and our country. Most of  these issues can be prevented with access to the right information and  resources. Our legislation will help low-income families and  communities of color learn about the benefits of regular dental care  and empower them to make better decisions on their overall oral health.   Madam Speaker, this is a picture of a child's mouth. Too many  children across America are going through this pain, through this  detrimental situation, because their parents don't understand that they  can do better for their children with better practices and information.  That is what this bill is about.   Once parents have access to information on the importance of healthy  habits, they can prevent this kind of result. These tips help families  and children maintain long-term oral hygiene at home. Through simple  education and awareness campaigns, we will ensure families are better  equipped to take control of their family's health.   We can't cut corners here, Madam Speaker. Let's start ensuring oral  health is part of the conversation in every home every day as often as  possible. It is the only way we will make sure that children across  America do not suffer like this child has suffered.   I also want to say, once again, thank you to Chairman Pallone, House  subcommittee Chairwoman Anna Eshoo, and all of my colleagues,  Republican and Democrat, on the committee for passing this bill.
