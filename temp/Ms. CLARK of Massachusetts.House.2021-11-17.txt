 Madam Speaker, it started with a white  supremacist online fringe movement, and it turned into a deadly January  6 insurrection.   Now I stand before you because a Member of this body has once again  had her life threatened, but this time by a colleague who posted a  video of killing her on his official account. Think about that.   It is no coincidence that the recipients of this violence are most  often women and women of color because this violence is directly  connected to sexism and racism.   We cannot and must not accept this behavior. Silence and excuses are  condoning it. And the excuses we have heard today--this is okay because  it is a highly stylized killing; it is a cartoon; it was some sort of  youth outreach--are grotesque.   Enough is enough. Vote for this resolution. Vote for censure. Vote  for decency.
