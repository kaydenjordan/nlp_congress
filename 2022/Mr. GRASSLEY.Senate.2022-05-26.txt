 Mr. President, I speak today on the Domestic Terrorism  Prevention Act.   As I have said many times, I am committed to fighting political  violence from across the political spectrum. This bill doesn't help us  do that.   In fact, career DOJ attorneys reviewing the legislation have  indicated that the bill is ``harmful'' and ``counterproductive.'' I use  their words.   This short bill merely reorganizes the government offices that  already fight domestic terrorism in DHS, DOJ, and the FBI. This  reorganization wasn't sought by the Agencies themselves.   In fact, in technical assistance provided to us, the operators  pointed out a number of problems with it. For example, the bill assigns  responsibilities monitoring and analyzing domestic terrorism activity  to DHS that actually belong in FBI.   The other major feature of the legislation is a direction to the  Agencies that they must focus on the greatest historical threats,  looking backward.   The operators have told us this means they can't be agile or address  rapidly evolving threats if they were to follow this law.   I am always willing to listen to the needs of Agencies that keep  Americans safe.   In fact, there are authorities that DOJ and the FBI need, for  international terrorism.   I introduced an amendment to the NDAA last year, to expand these  authorities. I hope we will pass it into law this year.   The domestic and international functions work together, and siloing  them would not help DOJ fight terrorism.   The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act won't help us prevent or combat  terrorism. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote no on moving to this  bill.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, last April, I came to the floor to honor  fallen Iowa State Patrol Sergeant Jim Smith, who was murdered trying to  apprehend a violent criminal. Last week, justice was served. His killer  was convicted. I thank everyone who worked on this case.   Today, after the completion of National Police Week, it is with a  heavy heart that I recognize another Iowa State Patrol officer killed  in the line of duty last year in a tragic car accident. State Patrol  Trooper Ted Benda was a dedicated servant of the people of Iowa for 16  years.   He began his career in Marquette and later moved to the Iowa State  Patrol to serve the communities of Mason City and Oelwein. Trooper  Benda was beloved by his colleagues who described him as dedicated. He  ``fully embraced the call to protect the community.''   He put his family first, always lent a hand to friends and neighbors  and cherished both his country and his community. Even in death, his  service continued. As an organ donor, Trooper Benda continued to save  lives. Trooper Benda: We thank you.   Trooper Benda left behind a loving family including his wife, Holly,  and his four young daughters: Madilyn, Avery, Vivyan, and Sylvia.   Let me say to them: Your immeasurable sacrifice is honored by your  community and your country. We thank you.   Losses like Trooper Benda's remind us of the great dangers that law  enforcement officers and first responders face in service to our  communities.   Last week, the Judiciary Committee held a Police Week markup. We  passed several important measures through our committee that will help  the police.   Soon, at my request, the Judiciary Committee will have a hearing on  attacks on police. I have and will continue to lead efforts in the  Senate to support law enforcement. After all that they have done to  protect and serve us, it is the least I can do to protect and serve  them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in 1988, President Ronald Reagan first  recognized May as National Foster Care Month.   Each year since then, the month of May has been recognized as a time  to bring awareness to youth in foster care.  [[Page S2742]]    I thank my colleagues for once again unanimously passing a resolution  to recognize the experiences of youth and families in the foster care  system and celebrate those who work to improve their lives.   Organizations in Iowa and around the country tirelessly serve kids  and families in foster care and the foster parents who open their homes  to kids in need.   I salute these organizations and individuals for their year-round  efforts to support the kids most in need.   In 2020, there were over 400,000 kids in foster care, including over  4,000 kids in Iowa.   During the pandemic, there was a drop in reports of child abuse, as  well as entries into foster care and exits from foster care.   There were the fewest adoptions from foster care since 2016 with  8,000 fewer children being adopted compared to the previous year.   However, Iowa deserves recognition for being one of only nine States  to increase adoptions from foster care during 2020.   Permanency for youth in foster care is so important, and I am glad  that Iowa continued to make this a priority during the pandemic.   Older youth in foster care and adults who experienced foster care as  a child can speak to what worked for them and what didn't work.   These young adults should always have a seat at the table.   When I founded the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth in 2009, the special  focus was to hear directly from youth themselves.   Over and over again, I have heard the same thing from kids in foster  care: They want a mom and dad. They want a family and a place to call  home.   All children, no matter their circumstances, deserve a permanent,  loving home and consistent, caring adults in their lives.   We know that just having one caring and consistent adult can  meaningfully improve the lives of kids in the long-term.   For some kids, this can be a biological parent who receives the  support they need to safely care for their child.   For others, a foster parent, mentor or court-appointed special  advocate can be that adult.   My resolution marks May 31 as a particular day to recognize and show  appreciation for foster parents.   Congress has worked to expand access to prevention services in the  hopes of keeping families out of foster care in the first place.   But in addition to this, it is crucial for foster parents to get the  support they need to continue serving kids in their communities.   In Iowa, almost every county has a shortage of trained foster parents  who are able to provide a temporary home for kids.   Without volunteer foster parents, kids who cannot remain safely at  home end up sleeping in hotels and in the offices of social workers.   Moving forward, Congress must continue to work to find better  solutions and secure better outcomes for youth in foster care.   It is clear that there is no one answer for kids in foster care. Some  can be reunified with their families; others are best cared for by  adoptive parents or a kinship caregiver.   But the goal should always be the same: to protect kids from neglect  and abuse and provide them with love and support.   I thank my colleagues for unanimously passing my resolution honoring  May as National Foster Care Month once again and look forward to  continuing to work on this issue.                            ____________________
