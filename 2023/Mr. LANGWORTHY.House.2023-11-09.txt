 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor an extraordinary  Vietnam veteran from Chemung County, Larry Sherman.   After America entered the Vietnam war, Larry Sherman answered the  call to serve his fellow Americans and enlisted in the United States  Navy. Shortly after he completed training, he deployed to Vietnam to  join the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 10, the Seabees. He spent  his deployment supporting our military in building critical  infrastructure under fire, often dodging mortars and rockets.   When Larry returned home, he received the same harsh treatment that  many Vietnam veterans faced, and he decided to take action. Larry has  been a leader in local initiatives to support his fellow veterans.   He now serves as the president of Vietnam Veterans Association  Chapter 803 and leads the Chemung County Honor Guard, which provides a  ceremonial military presence at the funerals of veterans and other  important events.   Madam Speaker, I thank Larry for his courage and service and for  going the extra mile to support veterans across the Southern Tier.                            ____________________
