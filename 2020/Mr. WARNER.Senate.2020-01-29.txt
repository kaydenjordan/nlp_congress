 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for the  House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Warner's question is:         Do you know about additional information related to Russia       disseminating President Trump's or Rudolph Giuliani's       conspiracy theories? Should the Senate have this information       before we deliberate on the Articles of Impeachment?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, I think there are  three categories of relevant material here.   The first, we do have access to, and that is the supplemental  testimony of Jennifer Williams, and I would encourage you all to read  it. I think it sheds light very specifically on the Vice President and  what he may or may not know vis-a-vis this scheme. So I would encourage  you to read that submission.   There was a second body of intelligence that the committees have been  provided that is relevant to this trial that you should also read, and  we should figure out the mechanism that would permit you to do so  because it is directly relevant to the issues we are discussing and  pertinent.   There is a third category of intelligence, too, which raises a very  different problem, and that is that the intelligence communities are  for the first time refusing to provide to the Intelligence Committee.  That material has been gathered. We know that it exists. But the NSA  has been advised not to provide it.   Now the Director says that this is the Director's decision, but  nevertheless there is a body of intelligence that is relevant to the  requests that we have made that is not being provided. That raises a  very different concern than the one before this body, and that is, are  now other agencies like the intelligence community that we require to  speak truth to power, that we require to provide us with the best  intelligence, now also withholding information at the urging of the  administration? That is, I think, a deeply concerning and new  phenomenon. That is a problem that we had previously with other  Departments that have been part of the wholesale obstruction, but now  it is rearing its ugly head with respect to the IC.   But the shorter answer to the question of, apart from Jennifer  Williams, are there other relevant materials? The answer is yes, and I  would encourage that you and we work together to find out how you might  access them.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The majority leader.
