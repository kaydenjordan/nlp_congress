 Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on the  Republican effort to roll back the joint-employer rule that the Obama  administration promulgated. This joint-employer rule is an attack on  workers, and it is an attack on franchisee businesses.   For people watching, Mr. Speaker, understand that when a franchisor,  the big headquarters, tells a franchisee, ``You have got to do every  single thing we tell you. You basically work for us. We are going to  tell you the size of the sandwich. We are going to tell you the kind of  oil to use. We are going to tell you how to schedule your workers. We  are going to, basically, control your enterprise, though you are  supposed to be an independent business,'' the Obama administration  said, ``We are going to treat you as if you are joint employers.'' So  if there is wage theft or there is unfairness on the job or some  problem that comes up with workers, then the big company, the  headquarters, will also be held responsible for solving the problem.    What the Republicans do today, Mr. Speaker, is say: ``No, we might  impose all these conditions on you per the franchisee agreement, but,  if there are problems, it is going to be your problem, franchisee.''   This is absolutely unfair. As workers are going all over this country  trying to get higher wages, this is a whole movement for them to get  livable wage for people who work every single day at our fast-food  chains. They are going to their local franchisee owners to ask for  those wages.   But if the franchisor says: ``You can't pay any more than this. We  are going to restrict you in multiple number of ways. We are going to  make you sell food items at a cost that you can't even sustain, like  the dollar menu''--those things cost more than a dollar, folks. But if  the big headquarters says you have got to charge a dollar as a  promotion, then the franchisee has to eat that.   But when workers need more money, the big company makes that  impossible, and then workers are left holding the bag along with the  franchisee.   The joint-employer rule, holding both sides responsible for those  wage thefts to pay for hours, these things make a more fair process and  require the big headquarters to take responsibility as well.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this. This is an antiworker bill. This is an  anti-small business bill, which is somewhat surprising to me, given  that my friends on the other side of the aisle say they are for small  business, but, really, they are just for big business. If you have any  doubts about that, all you have got to do is look at this tax bill they  are putting out there.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter from  United Steelworkers urging a ``no'' vote on the joint employer bill.                                            United Steelworkers,                                   Pittsburgh, PA, November 1, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 850,000 members of       the United Steelworkers (USW), I strongly urge you to oppose       H.R. 3441, the ludicrously named ``Save Local Business Act''.       The bill has virtually nothing to do with small businesses       but will greatly restrict the definition of employer under       the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).        Targeting a National Labor Relations Board decision,       Browning-Ferris Industries, H.R. 3441 is not only drafted to       repeal a decision where the employer tried to avoid       collective bargaining responsibilities through       subcontracting, but radically changes the Fair Labor       Standards Act. Currently, under the FLSA, employers cannot       hide behind labor contractors or franchisees when they set       conditions of employment. H.R. 3441 strips nearly a century       of workforce protections to give large employers almost       unfettered ability to hide from long established employer       responsibilities.        The rise in temporary or precarious work in the United       States is fast becoming an unfortunate norm in the economy. A       recent study on the rise of temporary employment found the       proportion of American workers engaged in ``alternative       work'' jumped from 10.7% to 15.8% in the last decade. When in       the last decade 94% of net job growth is in the alternative       work category, workers continuously find themselves unable to       seek remedy for their grievances or an ability to       collectively hold their ultimate employer accountable. H.R.       3441 will accelerate the growth of job-instability as       employers will be able to manipulate the system to avoid       collective bargaining by hiring temporary employees or       contractor employees.        Congress' responsibility to American workers in this time       of rising income inequality and precarious work must be to       improve access to collective bargaining and stop employer       circumvention of U.S. labor laws, not to weaken them. H.R.       3441 strips workers of another tool to hold their employers       accountable. A vote for this legislation is a vote against       working people and the right to democratic representation in       the workplace. I urge you to vote no on H.R. 3441.            Sincerely,                                                     Leo W. Gerard,                                           International President.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Signatory Wall and Ceiling Contractors Alliance, which says that this  legislation would not benefit small businesses that create good jobs.  It actually would place such employers at a permanent competitive  disadvantage to unscrupulous companies that seek to thrive solely at  the expense of the workers and taxpayer-funded social safety net  programs.                                                  Signatory Wall and                                    Ceiling Contractors Alliance,                                    Saint Paul, MN, October 5, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Leader Pelosi: I am writing on behalf       of the Signatory Wall and Ceiling Contractors Alliance       (SWACCA) to express our strong opposition to H.R. 3441, the       ``Save Local Business Act.'' This legislation will not       benefit honest small businesses that create good jobs with       family-sustaining wages and benefits. It will actually place       such employers at a permanent competitive disadvantage to       unscrupulous companies that seek to thrive solely at the       expense of their workers and taxpayer-funded social safety-      net programs.        SWACCA is a national alliance of wall and ceiling       contractors committed to working in partnership with our       workers and our customers to provide the highest-quality,       most efficient construction services. Through the superior       training, skill, and efficiency of our workers SWACCA       contractors are able to provide both cost-effective       construction services and middle class jobs with health and       retirement benefits. Our organization prides itself on       representing companies that accept responsibility for paying       fair wages, abiding by health and safety standards, workers       compensation laws, and unemployment insurance requirements.        Unfortunately, however, we increasingly find ourselves       bidding against companies that seek to compete solely on the       basis of labor costs. They do so by relieving themselves of       the traditional obligations associated with being an       employer. The news is littered with examples of contractors       who have sought to reduce costs by willfully violating the       laws governing minimum wage, overtime, workers compensation       unemployment insurance, and workplace safety protections. The       key to this disturbing business model is a cadre of labor       brokers who claim to provide a company with an entire       workforce that follows them to job after job. It is a       workforce that the actual wall or ceiling contractor controls       as a practical matter, but for which it takes no legal       responsibility. In this model workers receive no benefits,       are rarely covered by workers compensation or unemployment       insurance, and are frequently not paid in compliance with       federal and state wage laws. The joint employment doctrine is       an important means for forcing these unscrupulous contractors       to compete on a level playing field and to be held       accountable for the unlawful treatment of the workers they       utilize.        As an association representing large, medium, and small       businesses, we oppose H.R. 3441 because it proposes a       radical, unprecedented re-definition of joint employment       under both the FLSA and the NLRA that goes far beyond       reversing the standard articulated by the NLRB in Browning-      Ferris or retuning to any concept of joint employment that       has ever existed under the FLSA since the Act's passage. H.R.       3441's radical and unprecedented redefinition of joint       employment would proliferate the use of fly-by-night labor       brokers by ensuring that no contractor using a workforce       provided by a labor broker would ever be deemed a joint       employer. This is because the bill precludes a finding of       joint employment unless a company controls each ``of the       essential terms  [[Page H8540]]       and conditions of employment (including hiring employees,       discharging employee, determining individual employee rates       of pay and benefits, day-to-day supervision of employees,       assigning individual work schedules, positions and tasks, and       administering employee discipline)''. H.R. 3441 goes further       by expressly countenancing a company using labor brokers       retaining control of the essential aspects of the workers'       employment in a ``limited and routine manner'' without facing       any risk of being a joint employer.        Simply put, H.R. 3441 would create a standard that would       surely accelerate a race to the bottom in the construction       industry and many other sectors of the economy. It would       further tilt the field of competition against honest, ethical       businesses. Any concerns about the prior administration's       recently-rescinded interpretative guidance on joint       employment under the FLSA or the NLRB's joint employment       doctrine enunciated in Browning-Ferris can be addressed in a       far more responsible manner. Make no mistake, H.R. 3441 does       not return the law to any prior precedents or standards. It       creates a radical, new standard. This standard will help       unethical employers get rich not be creating more value, but       instead by ensuring their ability to treat American workers       as a permanent pool of low-wage, subcontracted labor that has       neither benefits nor any meaningful recourse against them       under our nation's labor and employment laws.        On behalf of the membership of SWACCA, thank you in advance       for your attention to our concerns about this legislation.       Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any       questions or require additional information.            Sincerely,                                                   Timothy J. Wies,                                                         President.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to this point I have been making about  how this is now officially the most closed Congress in history, and I  think people need to keep that in mind before they vote for this rule.   But the gentleman from Alabama, again--I guess in this age of Trump,  I mean, you can twist things all kinds of different ways, you know-- bragged about all this great bipartisanship here. In that number that  he was referring to, a number of bills that were supported in a  bipartisan way, a big chunk of them are things like naming post  offices, suspension bills that are not controversial, Hats Off to  Teachers Day, those types of bills.   But on major legislation, whether it is healthcare or whether it is  this crummy tax bill that they are going to be bringing up, this place  is polarized because they block out any competing ideas.   Let me again reiterate for my colleagues: the Rules Committee has  blocked more than 1,300 amendments this year. That is just this year  alone.   Now, I already mentioned amendments on the AUMF, climate change,  Afghanistan, and more. I think those are important subjects. But the  Members offering these amendments, I think, no matter what you believe  about these amendments, deserve the right to be heard by the whole  House and to receive an up-or-down vote.   But here are a few more examples of the germane amendments that my  friends on the Republican side on the Rules Committee blocked under the  closed and structured rules. They blocked an amendment to prohibit the  repeal of DACA.   You know, I mean, 800,000 people's lives now are in the balance  because of Donald Trump rescinding the protection for these DREAMers,  and he said: Congress, you do it. You fix it.   Well, we tried to bring an amendment to the floor to have a debate  and fix it, and if my Republican friends don't want to vote for it,  they can vote ``no.'' But they blocked it. They blocked an amendment to  bar funds from being spent on this stupid, idiotic wall that the  President seems enamored with along our border. They blocked an  amendment to increase funding to fight rural domestic violence and  child abuse. They blocked several amendments to ensure the Trump family  doesn't profit off the Presidency, and we all know that they are, but  we can't even have that debate.   They blocked an amendment to protect asylum seekers and human  trafficking victims, and they blocked an amendment to ensure victims of  incest can have access to abortion care. I can go on and on and on. I  mean, they blocked Congressman Grothman's budget amendment twice. He is  a Republican. It was germane. He even testified before the Rules  Committee, but you blocked it.   Last week, you blocked Representative Jimmy Duncan's amendment to  allow doctors to practice medicine out of State on a volunteer basis.  Germane. It may be a good idea. It deserves to be debated. You blocked  it.   Is that a poison pill? Is that what the gentleman was referring to?  You know, process matters, and it matters for this reason, because when  you have a lousy process, you end up with a lousy product.   I know it is not sexy to talk about process, you know, but it is  important. It is important that we do our jobs, we debate these issues,  and that we listen to Democrats and Republicans, you know, come before  us with ideas: some we may agree with, some we may not, but let's have  that debate. What is wrong with that? Why is that such a radical idea  in this place? To get up and say I am proud of this; I am proud that we  are now the most closed Congress in the history of our country? That is  something to be proud of?   I think that is something to be ashamed of. I think it diminishes  this House of Representatives, and it diminishes every single member of  this House, Democrats and Republicans alike.   This is supposed to be a deliberative body. Let's deliberate. Let's  not negotiate things in the back room and then rush it to the floor and  demand an up-or-down vote. You know, you don't have a monopoly on good  ideas, and there are people in your own party who have some good ideas,  too, and I think we have good ideas as well. And if you want  bipartisanship, true bipartisanship, and you want to end the  polarization, open the process a little bit. That would be helpful.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
