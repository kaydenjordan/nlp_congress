 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because our Nation continues to  have blood on its hands. This week, we, once again, bore witness to the  senseless murder of dozens of innocent people where States like  California experienced three mass shootings in just 44 hours.   How many more sisters, brothers, siblings, parents, grandparents, and  loved ones have to be senselessly shot and killed?   That doesn't sound like freedom to me. Our people deserve the freedom  to live without the fear of gun violence, the freedom to go to the  grocery store, to school, and to live life for God's sakes.   When will we stop valuing guns more than human life?   Can anyone in this Chamber look a parent in the eyes who just lost a  child due to gun violence and tell them that their child isn't worth  meaningful action?   Because I won't.   Yet, here we are today, another shooting, another day, and another  community devastated due to senseless gun violence.                            ____________________
