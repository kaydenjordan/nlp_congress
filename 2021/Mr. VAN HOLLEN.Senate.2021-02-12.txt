 Time is of the essence both in terms of the       fight.         To disqualify him from running for office.         Mr. President, I send a question to the desk for the  House managers.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland, Senator Van  Hollen, has a question for the managers.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Would you please respond to the answer that was just given       by the former President's counsel?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House manager will be recognized.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, thank you.   I am not sure which question the Senator was referring to, but let me  quickly just dispense with the counsel's invocation again of Bond v.  Floyd. This is a case I know well, and I thank him raising it.   Julian Bond was a friend of mine. He was a colleague of mine at  American University. He was a great civil rights hero. In his case, he  got elected to the Georgia State Legislature and was a member of SNCC,  the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the great committee  headed up by the great Bob Moses for a long time. He got elected to the  Georgia Legislature, and they didn't want to allow him to be sworn in.  They wouldn't allow him to take his oath of office because SNCC had  taken a position against the Vietnam war. So the Supreme Court said  that was a violation of his First Amendment rights not to allow him to  be sworn in.   That is the complete opposite of Donald Trump. Not only was he sworn  in on January 20, 2017, he was President for almost 4 years before he  incited this violent insurrection against us, and he violated his oath  of office. That is what this impeachment trial is about--his violation  of his oath of office and his refusal to uphold the law and take care  that the laws are faithfully executed.   Please don't desecrate the name of Julian Bond, a great American, by  linking him with this terrible plot against America that just took  place in the storming of the U.S. Capitol.   I am going to turn it over to my colleague Ms. Plaskett.   Ms. Manager PLASKETT. Thank you.   Let's just be clear. President Trump summoned the mob, assembled the  mob, lit the flame. Everything that followed was his doing. Although he  could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence,  he didn't. In other words, this attack would not have happened without  him.   This attack is not about one speech. Most of you men would not have  your wives with one attempt of talking to her.   (Laughter.)   It took numerous tries. You had to build it up. That is what the  President did as well. He put together the group that would do what he  wanted, and that was to stop the certification of the election so that  he could retain power to be President of the United States, in  contravention of an American election.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.
