 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of Mr. Rosendale's  amendment to remove mask mandates from our Veterans Affairs facilities.   Last April, President Joe Biden signed the Pandemic Is Over Act into  law to decisively end the COVID-19 national emergency. Accordingly,  hospitals and clinics across the country have rescinded their policies  requiring visitors and patients to wear a mask.   However, VA clinics continue to enforce the so-called sensitive areas  policy where patients must wear a mask while sitting in a meeting room  waiting on his or her doctor. There is no reason for the VA to continue  with this frivolous charade. Enough of the drama.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
