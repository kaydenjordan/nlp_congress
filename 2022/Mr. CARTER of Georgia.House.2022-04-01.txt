 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and service of Captain James T. Bellew.   Captain Bellew was tragically killed in a helicopter crash at Hunter  Army Airfield in Savannah, Georgia, earlier this week, on March 30.   He was a native of Charlottesville, Virginia, and entered the United  States Army in 2017 as a medical service officer. In 2019, he became an  aeromedical evacuation officer, and in 2020, he was assigned to the 3rd  Infantry Division.   This sudden and tragic loss has dealt a heavy blow to the brigade,  division, community, and his family.   During his service, Captain Bellew had successfully evacuated  critically ill COVID-19 patients to better care across the country and  was the top platoon leader in his company. He was decorated with the  Army Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and the Global  War on Terrorism Service Medal, among other accolades.   Captain Bellew was a hero in its truest sense, and he will never be  forgotten.   May God bless his family, friends, and fellow servicemembers, and may  God bless our troops.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, how is it that we here in  Congress, in the face of all the domestic and international crises that  we are facing right now, that we are here talking about decriminalizing  and descheduling marijuana?   Now, we are all going to go home this weekend, and what are our  constituents going to be talking about? They are going to be talking  about the price of gas. They are going to be talking about the price of  food. They are going to be talking about the price that they have to  pay to heat their homes.   They are going to turn on the TV. What are they going to see? They  are going to see in real time Ukrainians being bombed by Russia,  fleeing for their lives.   And what are we doing here in Congress? Talking about marijuana? You  have got to be kidding me.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, I am a pharmacist. I know addiction. I know  and I have studied addiction. I can tell you, marijuana is nothing more  than a gateway drug. It leads to other harder drugs. Don't try to  justify this by saying, Oh, alcohol is a drug and it is legalized. That  is not what we do. That makes no sense whatsoever.   Mr. Speaker, we had a hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee.  We had 10 parents before us whose children had died due to opioid  addiction. Not 8 out of 10, not 9 out of 10, but 10 out of 10 of those  parents said they smoked marijuana to begin with; 10 out of 10. It is a  gateway drug that leads to harder drugs.   This is not a Republican-Democrat situation here. This is an American  problem. You know that we had 100,000 Americans die of overdose last  year.   Mr. Speaker this is misguided. This is wrong. This is not what we  should be discussing.
