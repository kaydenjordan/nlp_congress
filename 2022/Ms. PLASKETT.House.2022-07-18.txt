 Mr. Speaker, this June, the private sector added  372,000 jobs to the economy, surpassing pre-pandemic levels.   I would recognize the leadership of the Biden administration and my  Democratic colleagues in Congress for taking swift action to strengthen  the economy through robust job expansion.   Since President Biden took office, the economy has added over 9  million jobs, and the unemployment rate has decreased from 6.4 percent  to 3.6 percent after losing 3 million jobs during the pandemic.   The price of oil is decreasing due to the leadership of President  Biden. Despite high inflation rates, today, we are seeing the strongest  economy for American workers in decades. People are receiving higher  wages, increased benefits, and better jobs overall.   House Democrats will keep working to develop the labor market,  underpin economic progress, and prioritize expanding accessible and  inclusive employment opportunities for American people, because that is  who we care about.                            ____________________
