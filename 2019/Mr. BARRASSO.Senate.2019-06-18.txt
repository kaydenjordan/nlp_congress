 Madam President, today I wish to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the American Legion. Following the end of World War I,  the generation who fought the war to end all wars created an  organization dedicated to the protection and defense of all veterans  who answered the call of duty.   The American Legion has been our Nation's leading advocate for proper  healthcare and earned benefits for America's veterans, establishing  hospitals and other services for the returning servicemembers of World  War I. The Legion champions compensation and pensions for the disabled  and for widows and orphans and was instrumental in creating the  Veterans Administration in 1930. It also played an important role in  the enactment of the GI Bill of Rights, first for World War II  veterans, and then for veterans of following eras, establishing  education, vocational training, and home loan benefits.   Known as the father of the American Legion, Lt. Colonel Theodore  Roosevelt, Jr., son of President Roosevelt, organized the first caucus  of the American Legion in Paris in March 1919. The meeting continued in  St. Louis in May 1919 where the official name was adopted. A preamble  and constitution were adopted during the first National American Legion  Convention in Minneapolis in November 1919. The preamble became one of  the fundamental tenets of the American Legion's orientation and  objectives, beginning with: ``For God and Country we associate  ourselves together for the following purposes:   To uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of  America; to maintain law and order; to foster and perpetuate a 100  Percent Americanism; to preserve the memories and incidents of our  association in the Great War; to inculcate a sense of individual  obligation to the community, state, and nation; to combat the autocracy  of both the classes and the masses; to make right the master of might;  to promote peace and good will on earth; to safeguard and transmit to  prosperity the principles of justice, freedom, and democracy; to  consecrate and sanctify our comradeship by devotion to mutual  helpfulness.''   Through the work of American Legionnaires, those same words remain  compelling today. With members represented in all facets of our  culture, including Presidents, Governors, Academy award winning actors,  professional sports players, and Members of Congress, the American  Legion played a role in many of America's triumphs. Today's  Legionnaires, known for their legacy of patriotism, service, sacrifice,  and community, continue the march. They dedicate their time and service  to ensure these doctrines remain the heart of the American Legion.   The American Legion has deep roots in Wyoming's history. Wyoming was  represented in both Paris and St. Louis and at the first National  Convention in Minneapolis. True to their pioneering nature, Wyoming's  Ferdinand Bransetter Post No. 1 organized to situate themselves at the  forefront of the Legion organization. However, due to the bureaucracy  encountered by the first posts, Van Tassell was actually among the  first 10 posts to be chartered.   In October 1919, Wyoming held its First American Legion Convention,  hosted by Samuel Mares Post No. 8 in Douglas. The first department  officers included Commander Charles S. Hill and Adjutant Harry Fisher.  Department headquarters was originally in Casper, later moving to  Cheyenne as membership gradually grew to a high of 10,805 in 1949.   Today's Wyoming American Legions continues to care for their  comrades. As leaders in their communities, they demonstrate honor and  respect for veterans and their loved ones. They actively support  numerous youth programs including Boys and Girls State, the Child  Welfare Fund, Boy Scouts, baseball, and scholarship programs. Their  accomplishments continue to grow as they serve our veterans, their  families, and our communities.   Today's Wyoming American Legion is comprised of 57 posts. Their  leadership includes Commander Richard F. Dansereau, Jr., Vice Commander  Mike Cooke, 2nd Vice Commander Jerry Clark, Immediate Past Commander  Kenneth V. Persson, Sr., Finance Officer Deanna Hurless, National  Executive Committeeman Terry Miller, Alternate National Executive  Committeeman Doug Uhrig, Adjutant Lee Buchschacher, Department Service  Officer Dwight Null, Service Officer Michelle Jones, Historian Penny  Merryfield, Chaplain Jim Vandivort, Judge Advocate Gary Hartman, and  Office Manager Gina Mayhan.

They are  more than buildings or posts. They are the lifeblood of our country,  endowed with the never-ending spirit of patriotism and liberty. They  will never quit, they will never falter and will always complete their  mission. America and the State of Wyoming are better for it.                            ____________________
