 I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to bid farewell  to an individual who has not only served as a longtime staff member but  a highly respected member of our close-knit team, Jake Oken-Berg.  Serving for the last 10 years as my business liaison, Jake has been my  ambassador to Oregon's business community and its leaders. Frankly,  when you consider some of my positions, Jake has undoubtedly developed  the diplomatic skills necessary to actually be an ambassador.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S6546, September 20, 2021, the following appears:  I ask  unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to bid  farewell to an individual who has not only served as a longtime  staff member but a highly respected member of our close-knit team,  Jake Oken-Berg.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Jake has always approached his work with enthusiasm and a positive  attitude, with steadfast determination to help me build and maintain  critical partnerships with the business community throughout the State  and to provide their feedback on how we can write better legislation.   His creative pursuit of my partnership with the business community  was on full display when he organized our office's ``Made in Oregon''  manufacturing tour. That tour comprised many trips across the State  over several years, with business leaders, owners, and managers. Some  of the most interesting gatherings I have ever been at were part of  that ``Made in Oregon'' tour. It highlighted the contributions that  Oregon's businesses, manufacturers, and workers are making to our State  and to the country, and it shined a light on policies that are needed  to ensure American companies and American workers stay competitive in  the 21st century.   Over the past decade, Jake has helped develop policies and strategies  relevant to many sectors of Oregon's growing economy.   One such strategy has been to make Oregon a global leader in mass  timber, including the production of cross-laminated timber and mass  plywood and the research on charring and stress loads necessary to  rewrite building codes.   Another strategy has been to make Oregon a national leader in the  production of hemp for CBD, building on Oregon's legal cannabis  industry.   Yet another strategy has been building up Oregon's sustainable energy  industry, accelerating the development of wind and solar and wave  energy and supporting measures to increase the efficiency of the  manufacturing process to use less energy.   It is pretty staggering to think of all the balls Jake had to juggle  at the same time over those 10 years, but he did it, and he did it  making it look easy.   Our team and our State saw the fruits of Jake's decade of partnership  pay off over this last year and a half as businesses throughout Oregon  faced extremely difficult, dark days amid the pandemic and the economic  recession.   As businesses ground to a halt and workers quarantined at home,  owners and managers were grappling with issues of how to continue to  pay employees or whether they had to let them go, paying rents and  leases, paying subcontractors and suppliers under the threat of going  out of business.   So many owners and managers reached out to my office seeking  assistance to access the economic injury disaster loans and the  Paycheck Protection Program to keep their businesses and their  employees afloat. Jake coordinated our response, communicating not only  with the business leaders but with the local elected officials and the  leaders of our business chambers. He produced guidance. He organized  roundtables. He led discussions. He served as a hotline for every  question. He helped owners figure out how to address unique challenges  as they arose.   When business owners were getting turned away from their own banks,  for instance, Jake took the lead in developing alternative approaches  so they could get the help they needed. And when specific sectors, like  the live entertainment sector, which is such a staple of life and  culture in our State of Oregon, was left out of the list of businesses  that could receive emergency aid, Jake made it his business to get that  changed. I can't even begin to guess how many Oregon businesses and  workers were able to weather those dark and difficult days because of  Jake's all-out efforts.   I suspect that if he was here right now and we asked him what, after  a decade of service, his greatest accomplishment has been, he would say  it was simply to help make Oregon a better place for businesses and for  workers, and then he might pause and, being the huge soccer fan that he  is, say that a high point was when he made a connection so that I could  spend a day with the owner of our Portland Timbers.   So, Jake, thank you for giving so much to the team and to the people  of Oregon over these last 10 years. It goes without saying that it is  going to be a monumental undertaking trying to fill your shoes, and you  are going to be missed by every member of our team. We wish you the  best. We look forward to continuing to follow the great things that you  will do in your next chapter for our State and for the country. We know  that in whatever form it takes, you will never stop working to build a  better world.   Well done, Jake Oken-Berg, and thank you.
