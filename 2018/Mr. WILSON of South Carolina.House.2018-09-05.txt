 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.  [[Page H7833]]     Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, last month, at Fort Drum  New York, surrounded by brave soldiers, I had the incredible  opportunity to attend the signing of the John S. McCain National  Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, by President Donald Trump, fulfilling  promises made, promises kept.   This critical legislation, thanks to the leadership of House Armed  Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, passed the House and  Senate, bipartisan, in record time, becoming law before the start of  the fiscal year for first time in 20 years.   As Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee chairman, I appreciate that  the NDAA begins and enhances training, spare parts, equipment, and  weapons systems maintenance, promoting safety and effectiveness.   The NDAA has an important part for South Carolina by promoting Fort  Jackson and its role as the largest initial entry training facility of  the U.S. Army, which is commanded by Brigadier General Milford Beagle.   Also important are the missions of the Savannah River National  Laboratory, which is a bipartisan effort by Congressman Jim Clyburn  from South Carolina and a bistate effort by Congressman Rick Allen from  Georgia.   I am also grateful that Fort Gordon has been reinforced to continue  as the U.S. Army Cyber Command headquarters.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
