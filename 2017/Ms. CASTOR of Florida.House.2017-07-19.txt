 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2910. The bill shortcuts the  important review process for interstate natural gas pipeline projects,  a process which already boasts one of the quickest review periods for  any type of major energy project. The bill is unnecessary.   To my colleague from the Energy and Commerce Committee's point when  he says that too many of these projects are being delayed: to the  contrary. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission testified in front  of our committee  [[Page H6002]]  that almost 90 percent of interstate natural gas pipeline projects are  approved within 1 year. This is a dangerous bill because of what it  does to short-circuit safety and environmental review processes.   Now, I want to say, at the outset, pipelines can be a safe and  practical way to transport natural gas. Natural gas pipelines are part  of a modern energy infrastructure system--I would say that almost all  Democrats agree with that--but what this bill does is it shortcuts, it  overrides safety, private property rights, environmental concerns.   This is a problem, because when you look at the long list of serious  accidents involving natural gas pipelines, the fatalities, the  accidents, the injuries, it is just inappropriate and very poor public  policy to give those natural gas pipelines a pass.   Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Rush), the ranking member of the Energy and  Commerce's Subcommittee on Energy.    Mr. Chair, I think the point on eminent domain  is the fact that this bill will trample on the rights of landowners,  because my colleague is correct, current law gives natural gas pipeline  companies access to Federal eminent domain authority, allowing these  corporations to take private property to build their pipelines. But  what the bill does, it would further narrow the already few  opportunities that landowners and stakeholders have for review of  safety and important environmental protections.   It also would allow surveying while circumventing local permitting  and without property owner consent, and that is a very significant  change, because it would allow Federal and State agencies to accept  aerial survey data and provides that the agencies may grant conditional  approvals based on that data, and that can be unwise and unsafe. So we  wanted to highlight that as a very significant concern for those  Members who are concerned about eminent domain and private property  rights.   Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.  Watson Coleman).    Mr. Chairman, I want to make it clear: I heard  the comments of my colleague from Tennessee, and the Democrats do  support natural gas pipelines, a very important part of our energy  infrastructure.    And, as a reminder, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approves  [[Page H6004]]  almost 90 percent of all pipeline applications within 1 year. And if  there is any holdup recently, it is because the Republican-led Senate  has not confirmed an additional FERC appointee. That is holding up the  process of approving more natural gas pipelines.   What we don't approve of, however, is a spill that attempts to short- circuit very important safety and environmental review processes and  take private property rights away from landowners.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Tonko).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, when we had a hearing earlier in the year in the Energy  and Commerce Committee, I assumed there was a major backlog of  unreviewed applications that spurred my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle to draft this bill. But then we heard from experts from the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission about this, and they testified  that nearly 90 percent of these major infrastructure projects are  approved in less than a year.   Many companies working to have other interstate energy projects  approved can only dream of a Federal review occurring in less than a  year. So this is already a very efficient process.    I would say this bill is unnecessary, it is duplicative, and it is  wasteful. And I know many in the Congress here are looking for ways to  eliminate government waste and duplication.   The Congress has already taken action to streamline the Federal  environmental permitting review process for major infrastructure  projects. Sometimes our memories are short, but it was just last  Congress where Congress adopted the major Transportation and  Infrastructure bill, the FAST Act. It passed in a bipartisan manner and  was signed into law.   The FAST Act authorized the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering  Council, or FPISC, to improve the timeliness, predictability, and  transparency of Federal environmental review processes for these major  infrastructure projects.   Now, FPISC is already getting underway. It has set up this enhanced  coordination and transparency by establishing a lead agency for the  project, recommends performance schedules, and public project  timetables. Many of the provisions in this bill, however, seem to be  largely duplicative of the activities of FPISC and what they are  already doing.   FPISC is already overseeing and coordinating permitting processes for  32 major infrastructure projects, including seven interstate natural  gas pipelines--just to highlight that this is an unnecessary power grab  that really is short-circuiting very important safety and environmental  review processes.                                time  1500    There is no problem across this country right now with getting your  natural gas pipeline approved unless there is a real problem in the  details of the application.   Now, I used to practice environmental law in a previous lifetime, and  what I learned is, when you provide for these short-circuited processes  that keep the public out, that keep other stakeholders out, what you  are going to do on the back end, you are going to cause more lawsuits,  more delays, rather than just adhering to the proper process, answering  questions as you go along, pressing ahead, altering the route when it  needs to be rerouted.   So this is a very important issue. The details really matter here.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have one additional speaker  and some submissions for the Record.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I include in the Record some information on pipeline incidents from  the U.S. Government, just to highlight the fact that it is vitally  important that these pipelines undergo safety and environmental  reviews. These are the pipeline incident reports from 1997-2016 for all  States. I will just read a few of these statistics here.   In 2016, you had 16 fatalities from natural gas pipeline incidents,  83 injuries, total cost of property damage, over $300 million. In 2015,  10 fatalities, 49 injuries, over 328 incidents. There is a 3-year  average from 2014-2016 of 312 incidents. The 5-year average across the  country is 299 incidents; 10-year average, 286 incidents.   For fatalities, the 3-year average, 15 fatalities; the 5-year  average, 13; the 10-year average, 13; the 20-year average, 16.   And for injuries, the 3-year average, 75 injuries; the 5-year  average, 64 injuries; the 10-year average, 64 injuries; the 20-year  average, 65 injuries. And the property damage report, just the 3-year  average is about $315 million.

Mr. Chairman, I would just say that it is  inappropriate to short-circuit the very important safety and  environmental review processes for our interstate natural gas  pipelines. This is a solution in search of a problem.   We know that FERC approves these gas pipeline applications at about  90 percent. The only reason a little delay has fallen off recently is  because the Senate has not approved the new FERC appointee over a  matter of 5 months. If they would do that, I think they could get back  on track as well.   The ones that are not approved are undergoing very significant  review. Even in the case for the major projects now, we have a new  system, a coordinated effort through the FPISC, the new council that is  overseeing interstate natural gas pipeline, so it is duplicative as  well.   It is inappropriate for a process that already grants eminent domain  rights through pipeline companies to go through private property now to  short-circuit the environmental and safety reviews. That is just really  going too far for corporations and their profits, where landowners and  other stakeholders have to have the ability to weigh in. Otherwise, you  are going to cause more lawsuits and more delays at the very end of the  process and, I think, do exactly the opposite of what the author of the  legislation intends to do.   So at this point, based upon all of the evidence that has been  presented, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill. Don't  elevate corporate profits over the interests of the public.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy  Infrastructure Act. My Republican colleagues argue that we need more  bills like H.R. 2883 to extract and transport more oil and gas as  quickly as possible. But building a modern energy infrastructure for  the 21st century requires a lot more than drilling wells, laying more  pipelines, filling more railcars with crude oil, and putting more  tanker trucks on our highways.    A modern, American, 21st century energy infrastructure plan must  address the threat of climate change. This is the biggest energy  challenge that we face as a country. We cannot have a meaningful  conversation about America's energy infrastructure without also having  a conversation about the changing climate and the huge costs heaped on  hardworking American families and businesses because of the change in  climate.   I am proud to represent the State of Florida, but here is what my  neighbors are experiencing now: higher AC bills, more extreme weather  events, heat waves, higher cost for flood insurance and property  insurance, and property taxes that are having to go now to repair our  water and wastewater infrastructure on the coast.   We have a rapidly diminishing window to act to reduce our carbon  pollution before the catastrophic impacts of climate change are  irreversible. The energy infrastructure decisions that we make today  will have a real impact on whether we can mitigate climate change in  the future. We need to understand this risk before we lock in  infrastructure that will produce carbon pollution for decades to come.   This bill's supporters don't like to be reminded of the daunting  challenges of the changing climate. That is reflected in our discussion  today, and, frankly, it is reflected in the glaring inaction of this  Republican Congress to address climate change.   If enacted into law, H.R. 2883 would move us backwards in our fight  for the clean energy economy and the jobs of the future. H.R. 2883  would rubber-stamp permits for pipelines to carry oil, natural gas,  even tar sands crude into the United States.   Tar sands crude is the dirtiest fuel on the planet from a climate  perspective, and this bill creates a permitting process for cross- border pipelines that make it difficult, if not impossible, for the  Federal Government to say no to any of these projects.   This bill asserts that every cross-border energy project is always in  the public interest. It is up to a project's opponent to try to prove  otherwise. The bill even allows the oil industry to make major  modifications to its pipelines without getting any approval at all.  That means, if a company wants to increase its pipeline capacity or  reverse an existing pipeline to carry more oil, natural gas, or tar  sands crude into the United States, the company can do just that, no  questions asked.   Building new pipelines or expanding existing ones could have a  profound environmental impact, but the bill allows for no meaningful  environmental review for a cross-border pipeline. The bill says the  Federal Government can only examine the cross-border segment of the  project.   Who thought that up? That is very creative.   It is almost hard to believe that this is what the bill does, but it  is true. For a pipeline spanning hundreds of miles, the environmental  review will focus on only that tiny part that crosses the U.S. border.  That is irresponsible. That would eliminate the possibility of any  meaningful examination of the carbon pollution impacts of these  pipelines.   We should be examining the carbon impact of every pipeline before we  approve it. Many are very important. But to do so without important  environmental reviews in this day and age is frightening.   The future will belong to the country that builds an energy  infrastructure to support a cleaner, lower carbon economy, and it is  our responsibility to lead the country in the clean energy future with  all of the jobs, consumer savings, and economic growth that would be  provided.   This bill also provides more proof of what is plain: In this  Republican-led Congress, it is, unfortunately, likely to go down in  history as having failed to meet one of its greatest responsibilities  of this time--the challenge of the changing climate. Our children and  grandchildren will be poorer for it, and they will ask us, and  especially my Republican colleagues: Why didn't you act when you had  the chance?   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).    Mr. Chairman, lest anyone be left with the  impression that there is a problem with cross-border pipeline  approvals, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, from a December  2016 report, says that over the last 5 years, natural gas pipeline  capacity between the U.S. and Mexico has grown substantially and is  projected to double through 2018.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gonzalez).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record letters from a number of  environmental and other organizations in opposition to the bill.   They write, in part: ``On behalf of the undersigned organizations and  our millions of members and supporters across the country, we write  today to express our strong opposition to H.R. 2883, the `Promoting  Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act.' This bill represents a fourth  irresponsible attempt to pass the previously titled `North American  Energy Infrastructure Act' in as many years. For the reasons below, we  are opposed to the passage of this legislation and its attempt to ram  through permits for new cross-border oil and gas pipelines and electric  transmission lines without meaningful environmental review or public  participation.''                                                      June 26, 2017.      Re Please Oppose H.R. 2883, the ``Promoting Cross-Border           Energy Infrastructure Act''.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the undersigned       organizations and our millions of members and supporters       across the country, we write today to express our strong       opposition to H.R. 2883, the ``Promoting Cross-Border Energy       Infrastructure Act.'' This bill represents a fourth       irresponsible attempt to pass the previously titled ``North       American Energy Infrastructure Act'' in as many years. For       the reasons below, we are opposed to the passage of this       legislation and its attempt to ram through permits for new       cross-border oil and gas pipelines and electric transmission       lines without meaningful environmental review or public       participation.        Our reasons for opposing H.R. 2883 are as follows:        It is unnecessary and eliminates longstanding procedure.       Executive Order 13337 established a longstanding process that       has been used by both Republican and Democratic       administrations for decades to ensure that energy       transmission projects crossing our international borders from       Canada and Mexico are in the national interest.        It eliminates critical environmental and economic analysis.       H.R. 2883 eliminates the current requirement that proposed       oil and natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines       that cross the U.S. border with Mexico or Canada obtain a       presidential permit, after an environmental review and       determination that the project is in the national interest.        It irresponsibly narrows the scope of environmental review.       HR 2883 replaces existing processes with one that limits       environmental review to a narrow portion of the project,       exempts certain types of projects from any permit       requirement, and shifts the burden of proof to make it       difficult to not approve a project.        It undermines the National Environmental Policy Act. The       bill effectively exempts cross-border projects from       meaningful environmental review under the National       Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by dramatically narrowing the       focus of that review. Under the bill, the permit requirement       and NEPA review apply only to the cross-border segment of the       project. Trans-boundary pipelines and transmission lines are       multi-billion dollar infrastructure investments that stretch       hundreds of miles, last for decades, and pose environmental       risks well beyond their border crossings. However, contrary       to NEPA, the bill precludes review of the project's full       impacts, such as oil spills and the consequences for       landowners, public safety, drinking water, climate change,       and wildlife.        It eliminates the need to justify projects as in the       national interest. The bill eliminates the requirement that       to issue a permit, the federal permitting agency must find       the project to be in the national interest. Instead, the bill       requires an agency to approve the project, unless it finds       that the narrow segment that crosses the border ``is not in       the public interest of the United States.'' By shifting the       burden of proof to require a showing that the project is       contrary to the public interest and sharply narrowing the       focus of that inquiry, this provision makes it extremely       difficult for an agency to ever deny a permit, and it largely       eliminates the ability to approve a permit subject to       protective conditions.        Large, complicated, risky projects like oil and gas       pipelines and electric transmission facilities are precisely       the types of activities that ought to be well-planned and       reviewed before they are built. Failure to do so not only       results in threats to public safety, but can also harm our       economy and environment.        Instead of improving responsible siting, construction, and       operation of oil and gas pipelines and electric transmission       facilities, this bill goes in the opposite direction by       forcing these projects through no matter what the costs may       be. For these reasons, we urge you to oppose this bill.

Re Oppose H.R. 2910 and H.R. 2883, Dangerous Handouts to the           Oil and Gas Industry.        Dear Representative: The League of Conservation Voters       (LCV) works to turn environmental values into national       priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National       Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of       members of Congress on environmental legislation. The       Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters       nationwide, and the media.        LCV urges you to vote NO on H.R. 2910, the Promoting       Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines       Act, and H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy       Infrastructure Act.        H.R. 2910 sacrifices public input and thorough       environmental review in favor of giving the Federal Energy       Regulatory Commission (FERC) more power to fast-track       approval of interstate natural gas pipelines. FERC has no       accountability to the public or the environment, yet this       bill would allow it to limit the participation and input of       other state and federal agencies with relevant expertise in       reviews required under the National Environmental Policy Act       (NEPA). Additionally, H.R. 2910 would allow FERC to establish       the scope of the environmental review and conditionally       approve projects with incomplete environmental impact       analysis, which could result in irreversible harm to our       environment and public health. Given FERC's history of rash       approval of pipelines, H.R. 2910 is unnecessary, dangerous,       and nothing more than a handout to the oil and gas industry       at the expense of the health and safety of our communities.        H.R. 2883 would greenlight permitting of new, potentially       harmful cross-border oil and gas pipelines and electric       transmission lines without meaningful and thorough review and       oversight. It eliminates many important longstanding       procedures, undermining critical environmental and economic       review by abolishing the requirement that a project obtain a       presidential permit and be affirmatively determined to be in       the public interest. H.R. 2883 also narrows the scope of       environmental review under NEPA, exempting certain projects       altogether and severely limiting the review of these massive,       expensive, long-lasting infrastructure projects to only the       section that crosses the border, ignoring the potential       damaging impacts from the project as a whole. By only       reviewing a small portion of these projects and essentially       erasing the national interest requirement, this bill would       make it almost impossible for an agency to ever deny a permit       and could result in irreversible damage to our health, public       safety, climate, environment, and economy.        Again, we urge you to REJECT H.R. 2910 and H.R. 2883, and       will consider including votes on these bills in the 2017       Scorecard.            Sincerely,                                                    Gene Karpinski,      President.                                   ____                                                      July 18, 2017.

The bill eliminates the requirement that       to issue a permit, the federal permitting agency must find       the project to be in the national interest. Instead, the bill       requires an agency to approve the project, unless it finds       that the narrow segment that crosses the border ``is not in       the public interest of the United States.'' By shifting the       burden of proof to require a showing that the project is       contrary to the public interest and sharply narrowing the       focus of that inquiry, this provision makes it extremely       difficult for an agency to ever deny a permit, and it largely       eliminates the ability to approve a permit subject to       protective conditions.        Large, complicated, risky projects like oil and gas       pipelines and electric transmission facilities are precisely       the types of activities that ought to be well-planned and       reviewed before they are built. Failure to do so not only       results in threats to public safety, but can also harm our       economy and environment.        Instead of improving responsible siting, construction, and       operation of oil and gas pipelines and electric transmission       facilities, this bill goes in the opposite direction by       forcing these projects through no matter what the costs may       be. For these reasons, we urge you to oppose this bill.            Sincerely,          350.org; Bold Alliance; Center for Biological Diversity;             Clean Water Action; Defenders of Wildlife;             Earthjustice; Environment America; Greenpeace USA;             Indigenous Environmental Network; League of             Conservation Voters; Natural Resources Defense Council;             Oil Change International; Power Shift Network; Public             Citizen; Seeding Sovereignty; Sierra Club.     Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2883 eliminates the current  requirement that proposed oil and natural gas pipelines and electric  transmission lines that cross the U.S. border obtain a Presidential  permit. That only happens after an environmental review and a  determination that the project is in the national interest. I know this  might be tempting to some of my colleagues, but I encourage you to have  a closer look at what this bill really does.   The bill replaces this process with a new process that limits  environmental review to a narrow portion of the project, just the  portion that crosses the border. It exempts certain types of projects  from any permit requirement and shifts the burden of proof to make it  difficult to disapprove a project.   The bill also allows a project that is rejected under current law to  reapply under the new, weaker process and exempts all modifications to  existing cross-border projects from any requirement for Federal review  or approval.   In essence, it grants a get-out-of-jail-free card, or, actually, I  guess it is more akin to whatever you roll, you get to pass go, and you  get to collect your $200. That is not okay for some international oil  pipelines, natural gas pipelines, and electric transmission lines.  These are major infrastructure projects, and we have got to maintain  the ability to have a meaningful review; otherwise, we are going to  suffer significant incidents, accidents, fatalities, and more.   So let me close my remarks and my portion of the debate here today. I  have enjoyed this debate, but I want to highlight again that the  Congress is really missing an opportunity to address one of the most  significant challenges that we face, and that is the challenge of  climate change.   What is particularly troubling about this bill, as well, is it keeps  the public in the dark. Think about it. If you live near a major  international pipeline project, shouldn't you have the right to  participate and understand what such project will allow in your  backyard?   The bill would allow large and long-lived cross-border energy  projects to be approved with no understanding or consideration of their  environmental impact or to be exempted from any permitting requirement  at all. The bill assumes that these projects are always in the public  interest regardless of the merits. It is an unjustifiable giveaway. It  elevates corporate profits over the public interest, and it is wrong.   The public, including communities and landowners directly affected by  the projects, would have little or no information and no opportunity to  object or request mitigating action except to the extent provided under  limited State laws.   For all of these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman an additional  30 seconds.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge the Members of this body to oppose this  misguided bill so that the Congress can turn its attention to the most  daunting challenge of our time: climate change, our clean energy  future, and the clean energy economy and all of the jobs it entails.   Mr. Chair, again, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
