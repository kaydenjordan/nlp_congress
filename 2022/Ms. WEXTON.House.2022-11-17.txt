 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Transgender  Awareness Week.   Each and every day, our trans friends and neighbors fight to make  their voices heard, to demand their basic human rights, and to live  free from increasing dehumanizing and hateful attacks. Their spirit and  fight deserve to be celebrated this week and every week.   Madam Speaker, we stand with the trans community and join their fight  to live openly and authentically without fear of discrimination. We  also must not ignore the horrific violence targeting the trans  community.   Sunday marks Transgender Day of Remembrance as we honor the at least  32 transgender or gender-nonconforming Americans who have been killed  this year and commit to doing all in our power to end this bigoted  violence.   As co-chair of the LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus' Transgender Equality Task  Force, I will never stop working to uplift the voices and visibility of  trans Americans and shine the light on injustices this community faces.   To my friends in the trans community, I want to let you know that you  are seen, you are heard, and you have allies here in Congress.                            ____________________
