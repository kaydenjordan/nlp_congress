 Madam Speaker, in 2014, four MS-13 gang members  brutally murdered a 14-year-old boy from Texas with a machete. Just  this year, two MS-13 gang members laughed and waved at the cameras as  they faced trial in a Houston courtroom for the kidnapping, rape, and  murder of young girls. These are just two examples that reflect the  horrific and gruesome reality of what gangs across this country are  capable of.   There are as many as 100,000 gang members in my home State of Texas,  several of whom are linked to Mexican cartels, who help them distribute  drugs and traffic people and weapons. Nearly 60 percent of identified  prison gang members in Texas are serving sentences for violent crimes,  including homicide, robbery, and assault.   MS-13 is one of the most dangerous gangs in our State, with almost  500 members throughout Texas. They have been described by the Houston  police chief as a ``transnational terrorist organization,'' the ``worst  of the worst,'' and a ``cancer.'' It is State and local law enforcement  officers like him, as well gang task forces, who are on the front  lines, putting their own lives in danger to deal with these heinous  criminals.   Today, I rise in support of Mrs. Comstock's bill, which will do what  we should have been doing a long time ago, and that is giving local  entities the ability to expeditiously deport gang members who are here  illegally and ensure they never are able to come back to the United  States.   Our first job is to keep Americans safe. H.R. 3697 certainly improves  the prospects of that.
