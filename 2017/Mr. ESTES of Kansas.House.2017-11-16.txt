 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for his  efforts to get this tax reform bill done.   Our outdated and uncompetitive Tax Code has led to slow economic  growth over the past decade in America. Today, we are taking an  important step to fix that. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will reform the  Tax Code and help foster economic growth.   For more than three decades, families have paid a growing cost for  our country's increasingly complex and burdensome Tax Code that is  chockfull of special interest loopholes. This is not fair.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will simplify the process of filing taxes  by doubling the size of the standard deduction and removing the need  for millions to itemize their deductions. It will provide tax cuts to  millions of middle-income working families.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also includes many tax reforms for  businesses in order to spur economic growth. The bill makes it easier  for entrepreneurs to start businesses, and it brings down the corporate  tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent to be in line with our  competitors around the world.   This will help spur economic growth by encouraging businesses to move  their capital and jobs back to the United States and will help lower  prices for Americans, who are the ones who ultimately pay for high  corporate taxes through higher prices.   I'm proud that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is focused on growing the  economy, bringing jobs back to Main Street, and increasing paychecks  for workers. This bill is committed to helping families because the  family unit is the cornerstone of our nation. We made a promise to  families that we'd deliver them tax relief--and we're holding to it.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will fix our bureaucratic tax nightmare and  puts families first again.
