 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of  Command Sergeant Major Timothy Bolyard who lost his life this past  Monday in the line of duty in the Logar province in Afghanistan.   A native of Thornton, West Virginia, Sergeant Major Bolyard was a  decorated soldier with 24 years of service. He had received numerous  recognitions for his dedicated service, including, among others, six  Bronze Star Medals, two with valor; four Meritorious Service Medals;  six Army Commendation Medals; 9 Army Achievement Medals.   This was Sergeant Major Bolyard's seventh deployment. His tours have  included Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Qatar, and Albania.   Yesterday, the State flags in West Virginia were flown at half-mast  in his honor.   Mr. Speaker, we grieve with Sergeant Major Bolyard's family and are  keeping them in our thoughts and prayers.   To Command Sergeant Major Bolyard, we thank you for your service and  sacrifice. You, sir, were truly an American hero, an inspiration, and  we will always honor your memory.                            ____________________
