 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Many communities have larger-than-life figures, people who dedicate  themselves to the service of others and change countless lives for the  better, leaders who touch so many lives that their legacies outlive  them. For my community in southern California's Inland Empire, that  figure was Jack H. Brown.   Jack was the executive chairman of Stater Bros. Markets, one of the  Inland Empire's largest employers. But he will be remembered for far  more than his successes as a local community member than as a business  leader.   Jack poured himself into our community using his time and resources  to make the Inland Empire a better place, especially for children. He  helped establish the Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino to give the  children of our community a safe place to learn, live, and grow.   He served as the founding chairman for the Children's Fund of San  Bernardino County, a nonprofit organization that has provided  assistance to more than 1.4 million children in our region since its  inception in 1986.  [[Page H6208]]    But Jack's commitment to his community didn't stop there. Each time  our region has been rocked by earthquakes, wildfires, floods, or acts  of terror, like on December 2, 2015, we knew that Jack Brown would be  there for the community and for the brave first responders who ensured  that loss of life didn't continue to grow.                                time  1600    When we lost Jack Brown in late 2016, we lost a constant presence in  our community. That is why I offered this bill to designate the U.S.  Post Office at 390 West 5th Street in San Bernardino as the Jack H.  Brown Post Office Building. While I can never truly repay Jack for all  that he did for our community, I am hopeful that honoring his name in  this way will restore that constant presence and remind the Inland  Empire of the contributions of this truly great man.   Jack and I had a great relationship. Although he liked to tell me  that I was his mayor in Redlands, Jack was sure to remind everyone that  San Bernardino was his hometown. I am proud that this bill will  memorialize his name at the center of the hometown that he loved so  much.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.
