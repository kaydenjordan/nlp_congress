 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2456, a resolution to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military  Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.   Madam Speaker, the President's interpretation of the 2002 AUMF as a  blank check for military intervention in the Middle East is certainly  troublesome. It is because of this abuse that the United States has  been involved in a seemingly endless conflict in the region, as  demonstrated in the Administration's justification for the recent  strikes in Iran.   A repeal of the 2002 AUMF is a step in the right direction towards  ending the cycle of military interventionism in the Middle East. Our  foreign policy must instead be guided by diplomacy and collective  dialogue; only with military action as a last resort can we build peace  in the region.   This bill will send a clear message to the President that the power  to declare war begins and ends in Congress. I plan to vote in favor of  it and would urge my colleagues to do the same.
