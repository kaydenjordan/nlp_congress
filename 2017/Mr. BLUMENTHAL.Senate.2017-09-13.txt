 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Without objection, it is so ordered.                                     DACA     Mr. President, we have seen the chaos and confusion  created by the President's rescission of DACA that has created a  humanitarian crisis in our country. That statement may seem like an  exaggeration, but, for me, it is very clearly a statement of fact. I  know it because I have seen it.   I held an emergency field hearing on Monday morning, and I listened  to the stories of Dreamers--young people brought to this country, many  of them before they could even say their own names, let alone know  where they were going. This country has given them education, a place  to live, a sense of freedom, and a sense of future. That future now is  cut short. They have been threatened with deportation in just 6 months.  Their employers, their universities, their communities have no idea  whether they can stay and continue their lives, productively and  importantly to them and their communities, those workplaces and schools  where they currently give back. They not only live and work here, but  they give back.   Maybe, most importantly, there is the promise that has been made to  them--the promise that was made to them when they came forward and they  provided the United States of America with information--some of the  most personal information that exists--about their Social Security  number, their birth date, their address, and their family. The promise  to them was that information would never be used against them and that  they had a place here for the time that DACA guaranteed it. That  promise now is about to be broken.   Great countries do not break promises. The United States is the  greatest country in the history of the world. It should not be breaking  promises to innocent young men and women who know only this country,  speak only this language, have friends here alone, and actually  families here. This rescission of DACA threatens to tear apart  families, decimate lives, and create disarray and derailed futures. We  are a country that is better than this rescission. We are and remain a  country that keeps its promises.   At our hearing, I heard from young men and women like Carolina  Bortolleto, originally from Brazil, brought to the United States when  she was 9. She has lived in Connecticut for 19 years. She knew she was  undocumented, but what she didn't know was that getting a job after  school, a driver's license, applying for scholarships and financial aid  for colleges would be out of bounds for her.   Seven years ago, she graduated from college with a degree in biology,  but she was stuck. She had a diploma but couldn't use it. To fight for  others like her, she cofounded CT Students for a DREAM. That  organization has grown and become a formidable and powerful advocate  for Dreamers.   When DACA was adopted in 2012, it changed the lives of young people  like Carolina. It opened a new vista. She could get a driver's license  and a job at a nonprofit where she was volunteering. She testified that  she finally felt free and independent. She could be the person she  wanted to be and the person the United States wanted her to be because  she was contributing to our great Nation.   What we know of the Dreamers is that there are many like Carolina and  like Alejandra. Alejandra Villamares was brought to the United States  from Mexico at age 1. She and her family first settled in a small town  in Colorado. She recounted in her testimony difficult memories of  growing up undocumented. She remembers her older sister coming home  from first grade crying because she had been bullied by other students.  She was bullied because she couldn't speak English. Her teachers also  couldn't understand or help. She remembers her mother's anguish and  pain when she heard about this bullying. Alejandra later encountered  the same problems as her sister did.   When she was 11, her father was deported to Mexico. Her mother ran  into the threat of financial problems, and the threat of deportation  always lingered. She told us at this hearing about this life story,  powerful and moving, but with a seemingly happy ending because she was  able to go to Wesleyan, one of the best colleges in the country, and  major in film studies with a certificate in international relations.   President Trump has put a target on the backs of these young people.  Alejandra's happy ending will be dashed. It will be a nightmare and a  tragedy if this order truly goes into effect.   President Trump has thrown this ticking timebomb into the lap of  Congress. It has potential real effects on real lives like Alejandra's  and Carolina's and 10,000 like them in Connecticut--800,000 around the  country--people whom the President has described as incredible and  terrific, people whom he said he loves.   It would be the height of hypocrisy and inhumanity to deport them. It  would be unprecedented in our history to have this kind of massive  ejection from this country by plane, by boat, by car, by walking. It  would be shameful and shocking for America to force this massive  deportation, but it would also be an absolutely reprehensible and  unforgivable violation of our promise,  [[Page S5273]]  breaking our word, and violating certainly morality, if not law, and  there would be legal claims based on due process and other rights that  could be violated.   As I said, Carolina Bortolleto is originally from Brazil, but she was  brought to the United States when she was 9. She has lived in  Connecticut for 19 years. Growing up, she knew that she was  undocumented, but she didn't know what that meant until high school,  when she saw the opportunities that her classmates could have and that  she couldn't--things like getting an after-school job, a driver's  license, applying for scholarships and financial aid in college.   Seven years ago, she graduated from college with a degree in biology,  but she felt stuck. She had a diploma but couldn't use it. To fight for  others like her, she cofounded Connecticut Students for a DREAM, which  has grown into a formidable organization that advocates on behalf of  immigrants.   When DACA was enacted in 2012, it changed Carolina's life. She got a  driver's license, a car, a job at a nonprofit where she had been  volunteering. She told me that she finally felt free--that she finally  felt independent. She told me that she could be the person that she had  always wanted to be. Finally, she could plan for her future with  certainty. Excited about what was to come, she went to graduate school  for a Master's in Public Health.   She was on cloud nine--until last week, when President Trump made the  decision to rescind DACA, threatening to take away all that Carolina  has worked for--if we don't act.   In New Haven on Monday, I also heard from a girl who has requested  that I don't mention her name here. She is from Canada. When she was 4  years old, her mother passed away in a terrible car accident. She was  brought here with her grandmother, a hard-working nurse, who later also  passed away. She has had to endure unimaginable loss at such a young  age.   She was tremendously lucky that her aunt and uncle took her in as one  of their own. She has grown into a leader at home who helps take care  of her cousins, acting like a second mom to them. Her dream is to  become a lawyer, and she works hard every single day toward that goal.   If Congress doesn't act, this ambitious young girl--who has already  endured so much pain and suffering in her life--will be torn from  everyone she knows. The children she helps to take care of will lose a  mother figure. America will be robbed of a bright new lawyer.   I have heard some people treating Dreamers as bargaining chips in a  political battle between the two parties. I have also heard that this  is just about ``handouts'' for a particular group of people.   That is simply not true. Let me tell you what I know: The Dreamers I  have met represent some of the best of America--young men and women who  have pulled themselves up by the bootstraps, eager to build bright  futures, and prosper, and give back to the only country that they have  called home. They want to stay here, and we need them.   The statistics reinforce this point: If Congress doesn't pass the  Dream Act, we will lose nearly $500 billion over 10 years. We will lose  $25 billion in Medicare and Social Security taxes. In my home State  alone, we stand to lose over $300 million a year.   It is time to do away with the myth that the Dreamers work on the  sidelines of American society. They are woven into the fabric of this  Nation. They drive our economy.   As I said, Alejandra Villamares was brought to the United States from  Mexico at age 1. She and her family first settled into a small town in  Colorado.   Alejandra recounted difficult memories of growing up undocumented.  She remembers her older sister coming home from the first grade, crying  because she had been bullied by other students because she could not  speak English. Her teachers did not understand her either and couldn't  help. She remembers her mother's anguish at the pain and bullying her  daughters endured. As Alejandra entered kindergarten, she began to go  through the same struggle.   When she was 11, her father was deported to Mexico. Her mother ran  into financial problems. The threat of deportation was always lingering  in the back of her mind. Things weren't looking good.   And yet, she told me on Monday, ``I wanted this to be my country so  badly. One thing I knew from the bottom of my heart was that I wanted  to stay here, and that I was an American.''   In 2012, when DACA came into effect, she got her chance. She earned  admission to Wesleyan, one of the best colleges in Connecticut, and she  followed her artistic passions by majoring in film studies with a  certificate in international relations.   She felt more empowered to speak up and help others. She held  sessions for her peers at her high school to tell them about the  college application process, and later became a program coordinator of  an educational non-profit to mentor over 200 kids to navigate the  college application process.   President Trump is putting a target on the backs of Alejandra and  others like her. They will be deported if we do not pass the Dream Act.   In just a week, the President's decision has already sown confusion  and chaos. There have been reports of ICE temporarily detaining DACA  recipients, including reportedly 9 in Texas on Monday. Hurricanes  Harvey and Irma have devastated Texas and Florida, but the White House  has not announced any extension to the DACA renewal deadline.   The administration has also been torn between two messages. The  President has toed an apologetic line, telling Dreamers that they have  ``nothing to worry about'' and that he will ``revisit the issue'' if  Congress doesn't act--and yet his Department of Homeland Security has  said that Dreamers should prepare to leave. If Congress does not pass  the Dream Act, Alejandra, Carolina, and others will be at the mercy of  a fickle administration. Their lives will be thrown into chaos.   In the stories of the Dreamers, I see my father, who fled Nazi  Germany when he was 17 with little more than the clothes on his back.  He didn't know anyone, and he didn't speak English. He still believed  in the promise of this country. These Dreamers believe in the promise  of America, too.   The character of our Nation is at stake. We must act now.   Mr. President, I am convinced these stories are evidence that will be  persuasive and convincing to my colleagues and that we cannot shirk our  responsibility. We have a public trust to make America worthy of the  American dream, to make that dream a reality for these young people, to  make sure the Dreamers are protected against this cruel and irrational  action that has threatened them.   We are the greatest Nation in the history of the world. We do keep  our promises. We must enable the Dreamers to stay. We must pass the  Dream Act, without encumbrances or poison pills or extraneous  amendments. We must pass the Dream Act now.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCAIN.

(4) In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of       the Senate on April 4, 2017, the Commander of United States       Strategic Command, General John Hyten, identified the       conventional prompt global strike weapons system as the       ``leading technology maturation effort in the realm of       hypersonics'' and stated that his command sees ``an       operational need for a CPS capabilities by the mid-2020s.''.        (5) Hypersonic weapons present a radical change in warfare,       because they can circumvent many of the challenges associated       with contested warfare and integrated air defenses.        (6) Hypersonic weapons may provide solutions to difficult       problem sets, such as anti-access area denial schemes, deeply       buried or hardened target sets, and mobile high value target       sets.        (7) Other countries are aggressively pursuing hypersonic       weapons at an alarming rate that threaten to outpace the       United States if the United States does not more aggressively       pursue development of hypersonic weapons.        (8) The Air Force has a $10,000,000 requirement on the       Unfunded Priority List for hypersonic prototyping.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Department of Defense should expedite testing,       evaluation, and acquisition of hypersonic weapon systems to       meet the stated needs of the warfighter;        (2) testing of such weapon systems should include flight       testing, ground based testing, and underwater launch testing;        (3) the Department of Defense should adhere to the       requirement in section 1688 of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328)       to proceed to a Milestone A decision on the conventional       prompt global strike weapons system not later than September       30, 2020, or the date that is 240 days after the successful       completion of intermediate range flight 2 of such system;        (4) the United States cannot afford to lose its advantage       over foreign countries in developing hypersonic weapons; and        (5) the Department of Defense should focus on the next       generation of weapon systems, including third offset       technologies, such as hypersonics.

(a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility located on       Oahu, Hawaii is a national strategic asset that--        (A) supports combatant commander theater security       requirements;        (B) supports contingency operations;        (C) provides essential and timely support to the United       States and allies' military mobilizations and disaster       response efforts in the Indo-Asia-Pacific and around the       world; and        (D) is routinely used to support normal transit of Navy and       Air Force movements in the region;        (2) the facility in its current form cannot be replicated       anywhere else in the world;        (3) moving the fuel to another storage facility in the       Indo-Asia-Pacific would have implications for the United       States military force structure in the State of Hawaii and       put at risk billions of dollars in annual economic activity       that the Armed Forces bring to the State of Hawaii;        (4) if the facility were closed, the United States Armed       Forces would be unable to support the National Military       Strategy, including the goals of the United States Pacific       Commander, and national security interests would be       significantly undermined;        (5) constant vigilance is required to ensure that facility       degradation and fuel leaks do not pose a threat to the people       of Hawaii, especially the drinking water on Oahu; and        (6) despite its importance, the facility continues to face       long-term challenges without robust and consistent funding       that provides the Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency with       the resources needed to improve the tanks and associated       infrastructure.        (b) Budget Submissions.--        (1) Annual budget justification.--The Secretary of Defense,       in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, shall ensure       that the budget justification materials submitted to Congress       in support of the Department of Defense budget for any fiscal       year (as submitted with the budget of the President under       section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code) includes a       description of how the Department will use funds to support       any deliverables that the parties of the Administrative Order       on Consent/Statement of Work have identified as necessary to       mitigate and prevent fuel leaks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel       Storage Facility on Oahu, Hawaii.

REPORT ON LARGE-SCALE, JOINT EXERCISES INVOLVING                     THE AIR AND LAND DOMAINS.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) General Milley has stated that the Army would       experience ``High Military Risk'' against emerging threats or       great power conflict.        (2) General Goldfein has stated that ``for 15 consecutive       years, the Army's been decisively committed to Iraq and       Afghanistan and other counter terrorist, counter insurgency       type operations. In order to do that, [the Air Force]       essentially came off of a core warfare fighting skills of       combined arms maneuver against a near peer or a higher end       threat''.        (3) The United States has grown accustomed to technological       supremacy and weapons overmatch to deter and defeat potential       adversaries.        (4) The Department of Defense conducts several large-scale,       joint exercises that stress interoperability in contested air       and sea domains, including the VALIANT SHIELD, NORTHERN EDGE,       and RIMPAC exercises, yet few large-scale, joint Army and Air       Force exercises exist to stress interoperability in contested       air and land domains.        (5) Large-scale, joint training exercises that stress       interoperability across domains are a vital part of       establishing and maintaining military readiness for conflicts       involving near-peer competitors.        (6) It is to the benefit of the United States and the North       Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to train to contested air       and land operations in order to increase joint and coalition       readiness, as well as to correct capability gaps in the       European theatre of operations that may be discovered during       these exercises.        (b) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the       Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees       a report on the following:        (1) Existing large-scale, joint exercises involving the air       and land domains.        (2) Plans to expand the scale and scope of the exercises       described in paragraph (1).        (3) Plans to conduct new large-scale, joint exercises in       the domains referred to in paragraph (1).        (c) Potential Locations for Expanded or New Exercises.--The       report under subsection (b) shall include an analysis of       potential locations for the expanded or new exercises covered       by the plans described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of that       subsection, with priority given to locations that facilitate       training by and with--        (1) sufficient overlapping airspace and ground range       capabilities and capacity to meet the training requirements       for operating within an anti-access area denial (A2/AD)       environment for air and ground operations;        (2) the ability to host bilateral and multilateral training       opportunities with international partners in both the air and       land domains;        (3) limited encroachments that adversely impact training or       operations;        (4) robust use of the electromagnetic spectrum, including       global positioning system (GPS), atmospheric, and       communications-jamming;        (5) minimization of adversary intelligence collection       capabilities;        (6) realistic replication of diverse geographic,       topographic, and weather environments in which a near-peer       combined air and ground campaign might occur;        (7) existing facilities to support personnel, operations,       and logistics associated with the flying missions and ground       maneuver missions; and  [[Page S5337]]         (8) minimization of overall construction and operational       costs.

SEC. 1216. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE AFGHAN SPECIAL                     IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The Armed Forces, the Department of State, the United       States Agency for International Development, and other       agencies and departments of the United States rely on the       services of Afghan nationals in a variety of sensitive and       trusted capacities to support the operations of the United       States Government in Afghanistan.        (2) Afghans who have supported the United States Government       in Afghanistan face grave threats from the Taliban and other       terrorist groups as a result of their service.        (3) Commander of the United States Central Command, General       Joseph L. Votel, warned in a June 14, 2017, letter that       ``curtailing or abandoning'' the special immigrant visa       program for Afghans carried out under the Afghan Allies       Protection Act of 2009 (8 U.S.C. 1101 note) ``would risk       significantly undermining years of progress and goodwill and       could serve to tip the balance in favor of malign actors''.        (4) Commander of Resolute Support and United States Forces-      Afghanistan, General John W. Nicholson Jr., warned in a June       12, 2017, letter that if such program ``is not fully       resourced it could significantly undermine our credibility       and the 16 years of tremendous sacrifice by thousands of       Afghans on behalf of Americans and Coalition partners''.        (5) All visas allocated for such program are projected to       be exhausted and all visa issuances for principal applicants       will cease in October 2017, if additional visas are not       authorized.        (6) The cessation of the issuance of special immigrant       visas for Afghans is likely to cause panic among the Afghans       who are assisting the United States, often at great personal       risk, and could significantly affect the operations of the       United States Government in Afghanistan.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that an       additional 4,000 visas should be made available for principal       aliens who are eligible for special immigrant status under       the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009 (8 U.S.C. 1101 note)       to prevent harm to the operations of the United States       Government in Afghanistan.

SUPPORT OF EUROPEAN DETERRENCE INITIATIVE TO DETER                     RUSSIAN AGGRESSION.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Military exercises, such as Exercise Nifty Nugget and       Exercise Reforger during the Cold War, have historically made       important contributions to testing operational concepts,       technologies, and leadership approaches; identifying limiting       factors in the execution of operational plans and appropriate       corrective action; and bolstering deterrence against       adversaries by demonstrating United States military       capabilities.        (2) Military exercises with North Atlantic Treaty       Organization (NATO) allies enhance the interoperability and       strategic credibility of the alliance.        (3) The increase in conventional, nuclear, and hybrid       threats by the Russian Federation against the security       interests of the United States and allies in Europe requires       substantial and sustained investment to improve United States       combat capability in Europe.        (4) The decline of a permanent United States military       presence in Europe in recent years increases the likelihood       the United States will rely on being able to flow forces from       the continental United States to the European theater in the       event of a major contingency.        (5) Senior military leaders, including the Commander of       United States Transportation Command, have warned that a       variety of increasingly advanced capabilities, especially the       proliferation of anti-access, area denial (A2/AD)       capabilities, have given adversaries of the United States the       ability to challenge the freedom of movement of the United       States military in all domains from force deployment to       employment to disrupt, delay, or deny operations.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that,       to enhance the European Deterrence Initiative and bolster       deterrence against Russian aggression, the United States,       together with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and       other European partners, should demonstrate its resolve and       ability to meet its commitments under Article V of the North       Atlantic Treaty through appropriate military exercises with       an emphasis on participation of United States forces based in       the continental United States and testing strategic and       operational logistics and transportation capabilities.        (c) Report.--        (1) In general.--Not later than March 1, 2018, the       Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional       defense committees a report setting forth the following:        (A) An analysis of the challenges to the ability of the       United States to flow significant forces from the continental       United States to the European theater in the event of a major       contingency.        (B) The plans of the Department of Defense, including the       conduct of military exercises, to address such challenges.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE EUROPEAN DETERRENCE                     INITIATIVE.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the European Deterrence Initiative will bolster efforts       to deter further Russian aggression by providing resources       to--        (A) train and equip the military forces of North Atlantic       Treaty Organization (NATO) and non-North Atlantic Treaty       Organization partners in order to improve responsiveness,       expand expeditionary capability, and strengthen combat       effectiveness across the spectrum of security environments;        (B) enhance the indications and warning, interoperability,       and logistics capabilities of Allied and partner military       forces to increase their ability to respond to external       aggression, defend sovereignty and territorial integrity, and       preserve regional stability;        (C) improve the agility and flexibility of military forces       required to address threats across the full spectrum of       domains and effectively operate in a wide array of coalition       operations across diverse global environments from North       Africa and the Middle East to Eastern Europe and the Arctic;       and        (D) mitigate potential gaps forming in the areas of       information warfare, Anti-Access Area Denial, and force       projection;        (2) investments that support the security and stability of       Europe, and that assist European nations in further       developing their security capabilities, are in the long-term       vital national security interests of the United States; and        (3) funds for such efforts should be authorized and       appropriated in the base budget of the Department of Defense       in order to ensure continued and planned funding to address       long-term stability in Europe, reassure the European allies       and partners of the United States, and deter further Russian       aggression.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)       Intelligence Fusion Center provides a crucial contribution to       the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance and the       national security of the United States.        (2) The fast-paced evolution of the security situation       throughout Europe and its periphery, as well as a marked       increase in conventional, nuclear, and hybrid threats from       the Russian Federation, require optimized efforts to track       and attribute critical threats to the security and stability       of Europe and United States national security interests.        (3) The ability of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization       Intelligence Fusion Center to leverage strategic intelligence       partnerships with the United States and other allies       facilitates daily and direct collaboration that provides       operational advantages and efficiencies needed to ensure the       rapid and proper response by the North Atlantic Treaty       Organization to Russian aggression in the conventional,       nuclear, and hybrid domains.        (4) The collocation of the North Atlantic Treaty       Organization Intelligence Fusion Center with the Joint       Intelligence Analysis Complex of the United States European       Command facilitates the sharing and fusion of intelligence,       contributes to filling intelligence gaps within both the       North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United States       European Command, and supports a common intelligence picture       for the North Atlantic Council, which is essential to       establishing political consensus on evaluating, analyzing,       and attributing existing and emerging threats.        (5) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Intelligence       Fusion Center and its collocation with the Joint Intelligence       Analysis Complex contribute significantly to providing the       North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance and the United       States European Command timely and effective indications and       warnings of threats emanating from within and around Europe.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the collocation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization       Intelligence Fusion Center with the Joint Intelligence       Analysis Complex of the United States European Command       provides the optimal solution to intelligence and operational       requirements, while fostering critical diplomatic       relationships, and is the most efficient configuration of the       intelligence enterprise.

UNITED STATES POLICY WITH RESPECT TO FREEDOM OF                     NAVIGATION OPERATIONS AND OVERFLIGHT BEYOND THE                     TERRITORIAL SEAS.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Since the Declaration of Independence in 1776, which       was inspired in part as a response to a ``tyrant'' who       ``plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts'' and who wrote laws       ``for cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world'',       freedom of seas and promotion of international commerce have       been core security interests of the United States.        (2) Article I, section 8 of the Constitution of the United       States establishes enumerated powers for Congress, which       include regulating commerce with foreign nations, punishing       piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offenses       against the law of nations, and providing and maintaining a       Navy.        (3) For centuries, the United States has maintained a       commitment to ensuring the right to freedom of navigation for       all law-abiding parties in every region of the world.        (4) In support of international law, the longstanding       United States commitment to freedom of navigation and       ensuring the free access to sea lanes to promote global       commerce remains a core security interest of the United       States.        (5) This is particularly true in areas of the world that       are critical transportation corridors and key routes for       global commerce, such as the South China Sea and the East       China Sea, through which a significant portion of global       commerce transits.        (6) The consistent exercise of freedom of navigation       operations and overflights by United States naval and air       forces throughout the world plays a critical role in       safeguarding the freedom of the seas for all lawful nations,       supporting international law, and ensuring the continued safe       passage and promotion of global commerce and trade.        (b) Declaration of Policy.--It is the policy of the United       States to fly, sail, and operate throughout the oceans, seas,       and airspace of the world wherever international law allows.        (c) Implementation of Policy.--In furtherance of the policy       set forth in subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense shall--  [[Page S5348]]         (1) plan and execute a robust series of routine and regular       naval presence missions and freedom of navigation operations       (FONOPs) throughout the world, including for critical       transportation corridors and key routes for global commerce;        (2) execute, in such critical transportation corridors,       routine and regular naval presence missions and maritime       freedom of navigation operations throughout the year;        (3) in addition to the operations executed pursuant to       paragraph (2), execute routine and regular maritime freedom       of navigation operations throughout the year, in accordance       with international law, including the use of expanded       military options and maneuvers beyond innocent passage; and        (4) to the maximum extent practicable, execute freedom of       navigation operations pursuant to this subsection with       regional partner countries and allies of the United States.       SEC. 1266. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF                     LAW IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the South China Sea is a vitally important waterway for       global commerce and for regional security, with almost 30       percent of the maritime trade of the world transiting the       South China Sea annually;        (2) the People's Republic of China is undermining regional       security and prosperity and challenging international rules       and norms by engaging in coercive activities and attempting       to limit lawful foreign operations in the South China Sea;        (3) a tribunal determined ``that China had violated the       Philippines' sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone       by (a) interfering with Philippine fishing and petroleum       exploration, (b) constructing artificial islands and (c)       failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from fishing in the       zone,'' and that ``Chinese law enforcement vessels had       unlawfully created a serious risk of collision when they       physically obstructed Philippine vessels'';        (4) the arbitral tribunal award of July 2016 stated that       there is ``no legal basis for China to claim historic rights       to resources within the sea areas falling within the nine-      dash line''; and        (5) the United States should play a vital role in securing       the South China Sea and ensuring freedom of navigation and       overflight for all countries by undertaking freedom of       navigation operations on a regular and consistent basis, as       well as maintaining persistent presence operations in the       region.       SEC. 1267. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE                     RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND                     JAPAN.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States and Japan are indispensable partners       in tackling global challenges, and have pledged significant       support for efforts to counter violent extremism (including       the threat of the Islamic State), combat the proliferation of       weapons of mass destruction, prevent piracy, and assist the       victims of conflict and disaster worldwide;        (2) the security alliance between the United States and       Japan has evolved considerably over many decades and will       continue to transform as a partnership, sharing greater       responsibilities, dedicated to ensuring a secure and       prosperous Asia-Pacific region and world;        (3) the alliance between the United States and Japan is       essential for ensuring maritime security and freedom of       navigation, commerce, and overflight in the waters of the       East China Sea;        (4) Japan, a cornerstone of peace in the Asia-Pacific       region, stands as a strong partner of the United States in       efforts to uphold respect for the rule of law and to oppose       the use of coercion, intimidation, or force to change the       regional or global status quo, including in the East China       Sea and the South China Sea, which are among the busiest       waterways in the world;        (5) the United States and Japan are committed to working       together towards a world in which the Democratic People's       Republic of Korea (DPRK) does not threaten global peace and       security with its weapons of mass destruction and illicit       activities, and in which it respects human rights and its       people can live in freedom;        (6) the alliance between the United States and Japan should       be strengthened to maintain peace and stability in the Asia-      Pacific region and beyond, to confront emerging challenges,       and to safeguard maritime security and ensure freedom of       navigation, commerce, and overflight in the East China Sea       and the South China Sea;        (7) although the United States Government does not take a       position on sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands, the United       States acknowledges that the islands are under the       administration of Japan and opposes any unilateral actions       that would seek to undermine their administration by Japan;       and        (8) the unilateral actions of a third party will not affect       the United States acknowledgment of the administration of       Japan over the Senkaku Islands, and the United States remains       committed under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security       with Japan to respond to any armed attack in the territories       under the administration of Japan.       SEC. 1268. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UNITED                     STATES ALLIANCE WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Government of North Korea has repeatedly violated       its commitments to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible       dismantlement of its nuclear weapons programs.        (2) Based on its past actions, including the transfer of       sensitive nuclear and missile technology to state sponsors of       terrorism, North Korea poses a grave risk for the       proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass       destruction.        (3) North Korea has--        (A) unilaterally withdrawn from the Korean War Armistice       Agreement, done at Panmunjom, Korea, July 27, 1953; and        (B) committed provocations against South Korea--        (i) by sinking the warship Cheonan and killing 46 of her       crew on March 26, 2010;        (ii) by shelling Yeonpyeong Island and killing 4 South       Korea civilians on November 23, 2010; and        (iii) by its involvement in the ``DarkSeoul'' cyberattacks       against the financial and communications interests of the       Republic of Korea on March 20, 2013.        (4) North Korea maintains a system of brutal political       prison camps that contain as many as 200,000 men, women, and       children, who are--        (A) kept in atrocious living conditions with insufficient       food, clothing, and medical care; and        (B) under constant fear of rape, torture, or arbitrary       execution.        (5) The Government of North Korea has provided technical       support and conducted destructive and coercive cyberattacks       including against Sony Pictures Entertainment and other       United States persons.        (6) The conduct of the Government of North Korea poses an       imminent threat to--        (A) the security of the United States and its allies;        (B) the global economy;        (C) the safety of members of the United States Armed       Forces;        (D) the integrity of the global financial system;        (E) the integrity of global nonproliferation programs; and        (F) the people of North Korea.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that,       in order to achieve the peaceful disarmament of North Korea,       the United States should--        (1) reaffirm the commitment of the United States to       defending our allies in the region, including through the       deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)       battery to the Republic of Korea, and the commitment to       provide extended deterrence, guaranteed by the full spectrum       of United States defense capabilities, including conventional       capabilities, missile defense, and the nuclear umbrella;        (2) support ongoing efforts to strengthen the alliance       between the United States and the Republic of Korea alliance,       to protect the 28,500 members of the United States Armed       Forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula, and to defend the       alliance against any and all provocations committed by the       North Korea regime; and        (3) support efforts to deepen trilateral coordination and       cooperation between the United States, the Republic of Korea,       and Japan, to address the grave and growing threat of the       ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons programs of North       Korea.       SEC. 1269. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON EXTENDED DETERRENCE FOR THE                     KOREAN PENINSULA AND JAPAN.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the nuclear and missile program of North Korea is one       of the most dangerous national security threats facing the       United States today; and        (2) given the threat posed by North Korea to our allies,       the Republic of Korea and Japan, the Nuclear Posture Review       that will occur this year should fully consider the       perspectives of key allies and partners of the United States       in East Asia, including the Republic of Korea and Japan.

SEC. 1284. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON REAFFIRMING STRATEGIC                     PARTNERSHIPS AND ALLIES.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Since World War II, the United States has sought       partnership and cooperation in establishing a rules-based       international order which has resulted in one of the most       prosperous periods of human history.        (2) The United States is signatory to seven mutual defense       treaties with 56 different countries.        (3) One of the United States defense alliances is the 29-      nation-strong North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) which       is celebrating its 68th anniversary.        (4) The United States has not faced a more diverse and       complex array of crises and threats, including the emergence       of competitors like Russia and China, increasingly unstable       threats from North Korea and Iran, and the continued threat       from transnational violent extremist groups like the Islamic       State and al-Qaeda.        (5) The strain of a decreased military budget has decreased       capability at precisely the time when demand for United       States military strength has increased.        (6) Fifteen years of continuous war has stymied military       modernization, focused training on asymmetrical warfare over       large-scale conflicts.        (7) Secretary of Defense James Mattis stated that       ``alliances provide avenues for peace,  [[Page S5350]]       fostering the conditions for economic growth with countries       that share the same vision, while tempering the plans of       those who would attack other nations or try to impose their       will over the less powerful''.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States is an ally rich nation and our       potential competitors--such as Russia, China, and North       Korea--are ally poor;        (2) United States allies and partners are critical to       defending peace and prosperity throughout the world;        (3) the rules-based international order supported by the       United States and its allies has ensured--and will continue       to promote--an international system that benefits all       nations;        (4) throughout the world, the United States will continue       to foster relationships with nations of like minds and       beliefs;        (5) as the United States manages multiple strategic       challenges, our enduring strength remains in alliances such       as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and        (6) the United States will continue to deepen alliances and       expand them, and will take no ally for granted.

It is the sense of the Senate that--        (1) the Secretary of Defense should use the Ballistic       Missile Defense Review (BMDR) to consider accelerating the       development of technologies that will increase the capacity,       capability, and reliability of the ground-based midcourse       defense element of the ballistic missile defense system;        (2) upon completion of the Ballistic Missile Defense       Review, the Director of the Missile Defense Agency should, to       the extent practicable and with sound acquisition practices,       accelerate the development, testing, and fielding of such       capabilities as they are prioritized in the Ballistic Missile       Defense Review, including the redesigned kill vehicle, the       multi-object kill vehicle, the C3 booster, a space-based       sensor layer, boost phase sensor and kill technologies, and       additional ground-based interceptors; and        (3) in order to achieve these objectives, and to avoid       post-production and post-deployment problems, it is essential       for the Department of Defense and the Missile Defense Agency       to follow a ``fly before you buy'' approach to adequately       test and assess the elements of the ballistic missile defense       system before final production decisions or operational       deployment.       SEC. 1655. SENSE OF THE SENATE AND REPORT ON GROUND-BASED                     MIDCOURSE DEFENSE TESTING.         (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate       that--        (1) at a minimum, the Missile Defense Agency should       continue to flight test the ground-based midcourse defense       element at least once each fiscal year;        (2) the Department of Defense should allocate increased       funding to homeland missile defense testing to ensure that       our defenses continue to evolve faster than the threats       against which they are postured to defend;        (3) in order to rapidly innovate, develop, and field new       technologies, the Director of the Missile Defense Agency       should continue to focus testing campaigns on delivering       increased capabilities to the Armed Forces as quickly as       possible; and        (4) the Director of the Missile Defense Agency should seek       to establish a more prudent balance between risk mitigation       and the more rapid testing pace needed to quickly develop and       deliver new capabilities to the Armed Forces.        (b) Report to Congress.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Missile       Defense Agency shall submit to the congressional defense       committees a revised missile defense testing campaign plan       that accelerates the development and deployment of new       missile defense technologies.        (2) Contents.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall       include the following:        (A) A detailed analysis of the acceleration of each of       following programs:        (i) Redesigned kill vehicle.        (ii) Multi-object kill vehicle.        (iii) Configuration-3 Booster.        (iv) Lasers mounted on small unmanned aerial vehicles.        (v) Space-based missile defense sensor architecture.        (vi) Such additional technologies as the Director considers       appropriate.        (B) A new deployment timeline for each of the programs in       listed in subparagraph (A) or a detailed description of why       the current timeline for deployment technologies under those       programs is most suitable.        (C) An identification of any funding or policy restrictions       that would slow down the deployment of the technologies under       the programs listed in subparagraph (A).        (D) A risk assessment of the potential cost-overruns and       deployment delays that may be encountered in the expedited       development process of the capabilities under paragraph (1).        (c) Report on Funding Profile.--The Director shall include       with the budget justification materials submitted to Congress       in support of the budget of the Department of Defense for       fiscal year 2019 (as submitted with the budget of the       President under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States       Code) a report on the funding profile necessary for the new       testing campaign plan required by subsection (b)(1).

(a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense shall establish a       pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of       distributing royalties and other payments as described in       this section. Under the pilot program, except as provided in       subsections (b) and (d), any royalties or other payments       received by a Federal agency from the licensing and       assignment of inventions under agreements entered into by       Department of Defense laboratories, and from the licensing of       inventions of Department of Defense laboratories, shall be       retained by the laboratory which produced the invention and       shall be disposed of as follows:        (1)(A) The laboratory director shall pay each year the       first $2,000, and thereafter at least 20 percent, of the       royalties or other payments, other than payments of patent       costs as delineated by a license or assignment agreement, to       the inventor or coinventors, if the inventor's or       coinventor's rights are directly assigned to the United       States.        (B) A laboratory director may provide appropriate       incentives, from royalties or other payments, to laboratory       employees who are not an inventor of such inventions but who       substantially increased the technical value of the       inventions.        (C) The laboratory shall retain the royalties and other       payments received from an invention until the laboratory       makes payments to employees of a laboratory under       subparagraph (A) or (B).        (2) The balance of the royalties or other payments shall be       transferred by the agency to its laboratories, with the       majority share of the royalties or other payments from any       invention going to the laboratory where the invention       occurred. The royalties or other payments so transferred to       any laboratory may be used or obligated by that laboratory       during the fiscal year in which they are received or during       the 2 succeeding fiscal years--        (A) to reward scientific, engineering, and technical       employees of the laboratory, including developers of       sensitive or classified technology, regardless of whether the       technology has commercial applications;        (B) to further scientific exchange among the laboratories       of the agency;        (C) for education and training of employees consistent with       the research and development missions and objectives of the       agency or laboratory, and for other activities that increase       the potential for transfer of the technology of the       laboratories of the agency;        (D) for payment of expenses incidental to the       administration and licensing of intellectual property by the       agency or laboratory with respect to inventions made at that       laboratory, including the fees or other costs for the       services of other agencies, persons, or organizations for       intellectual property management and licensing services; or        (E) for scientific research and development consistent with       the research and development missions and objectives of the       laboratory.        (3) All royalties or other payments retained by the       laboratory after payments have been made pursuant to       paragraphs (1) and (2) that are unobligated and unexpended at       the end of the second fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year       in which the royalties and other payments were received shall       be paid into the Treasury of the United States.        (b) Treatment of Payments to Employees.--        (1) In general.--Any payment made to an employee under the       pilot program shall be in addition to the regular pay of the       employee and to any other awards made to the employee, and       shall not affect the entitlement of the employee to any       regular pay, annuity, or award to which the employee is       otherwise entitled or for which the employee is otherwise       eligible or limit the amount thereof. Any payment made to an       inventor as such shall continue after the inventor leaves the       laboratory.        (2) Cumulative payments.--(A) Cumulative payments made       under the pilot program while the inventor is still employed       at the laboratory shall not exceed $500,000 per year to any       one person, unless the Secretary  [[Page S5444]]       concerned (as defined in section 101(a) of title 10, United       States Code) approves a larger award.        (B) Cumulative payments made under the pilot program after       the inventor leaves the laboratory shall not exceed $150,000       per year to any one person, unless the head of the agency       approves a larger award (with the excess over $150,000 being       treated as an agency award to a former employee under section       4505 of title 5, United States Code).        (c) Invention Management Services.--Under the pilot       program, a laboratory receiving royalties or other payments       as a result of invention management services performed for       another Federal agency or laboratory under section 207 of       title 35, United States Code, may retain such royalties or       payments to the extent required to offset payments to       inventors under subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(1), costs       and expenses incurred under subparagraph (D) of subsection       (a)(2), and the cost of foreign patenting and maintenance for       any invention of the other agency. All royalties and other       payments remaining after offsetting the payments to       inventors, costs, and expenses described in the preceding       sentence shall be transferred to the agency for which the       services were performed, for distribution in accordance with       subsection (a)(2).        (d) Certain Assignments.--Under the pilot program, if the       invention involved was one assigned to the laboratory--        (1) by a contractor, grantee, or participant, or an       employee of a contractor, grantee, or participant, in an       agreement or other arrangement with the agency; or        (2) by an employee of the agency who was not working in the       laboratory at the time the invention was made,      the agency unit that was involved in such assignment shall be       considered to be a laboratory for purposes of this section.        (e) Sunset.--The pilot program under this section shall       terminate 5 years after the date of the enactment of this       Act.

SUPPORT OF EUROPEAN DETERRENCE INITIATIVE TO DETER                     RUSSIAN AGGRESSION.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Military exercises, such as Exercise Nifty Nugget and       Exercise Reforger during the Cold War, have historically made       important contributions to testing operational concepts,       technologies, and leadership approaches; identifying limiting       factors in the execution of operational plans and appropriate       corrective action; and bolstering deterrence against       adversaries by demonstrating United States military       capabilities.        (2) Military exercises with North Atlantic Treaty       Organization (NATO) allies enhance the interoperability and       strategic credibility of the alliance.        (3) The increase in conventional, nuclear, and hybrid       threats by the Russian Federation against the security       interests of the United States and allies in Europe requires       substantial and sustained investment to improve United States       combat capability in Europe.        (4) The decline of a permanent United States military       presence in Europe in recent years increases the likelihood       the United States will rely on being able to flow forces from       the continental United States to the European theater in the       event of a major contingency.        (5) Senior military leaders, including the Commander of       United States Transportation Command, have warned that a       variety of increasingly advanced capabilities, especially the       proliferation of anti-access, area denial (A2/AD)       capabilities, have given adversaries of the United States the       ability to challenge the freedom of movement of the United       States military in all domains from force deployment to       employment to disrupt, delay, or deny operations.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that,       to enhance the European Deterrence Initiative and bolster       deterrence against Russian aggression, the United States,       together with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and       other European partners, should demonstrate its resolve and       ability to meet its commitments under Article V of the North       Atlantic Treaty through appropriate military exercises with       an emphasis on participation of United States forces based in       the continental United States and testing strategic and       operational logistics and transportation capabilities.        (c) Report.--        (1) In general.--Not later than March 1, 2018, the       Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional       defense committees a report setting forth the following:        (A) An analysis of the challenges to the ability of the       United States to flow significant forces from the continental       United States to the European theater in the event of a major       contingency.        (B) The plans of the Department of Defense, including the       conduct of military exercises, to address such challenges.        (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be       submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified       annex.       SEC. 6214. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE EUROPEAN DETERRENCE                     INITIATIVE.

SEC. 10302. SENSE ON CONGRESS ON THE SMALL TURBINE ENGINE                     INDUSTRIAL BASE.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The United States small turbine engine industry has       been innovating, developing, producing, and sustaining small       gas turbine engines in a competitive market for more than 75       years.        (2) The United States small turbine engine industrial base       has made the United States the knowledge leader in low cost,       no maintenance engine designs with unmatched field       reliability.        (3) The United States small turbine engine industrial base       is at a critical juncture, as military requirements have       tapered and missile programs, in misguided attempts to save       money, are narrowing production contracts to a single vendor       causing two of the three existing small turbine engine       manufacturers to go out of business.        (4) The departure of these companies from the United States       small turbine engine industry will leave only one viable,       proven source for small turbine engines for the Department of       Defense.        (5) In 2016, a number of engine failures were encountered       that severely diminished the throughput of the F107-WR-101       engine maintenance process for the AGM-86 Air Launched Cruise       Missile (ALCM), thereby putting the weapon system at major       readiness risk.        (6) The narrowing of the United States small turbine engine       industrial base would leave the Department with a sole source       United States supplier resulting in a loss of manufacturing       and testing capability that would be extremely detrimental to       both the United States industrial base and national security       by creating a single point of failure, increasing engine       procurement and testing prices by eliminating competition,       raising new engine development and air vehicle program risk,       and eliminating capabilities and expertise that would require       decades and millions of dollars to reconstitute.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress       that the Department of Defense should--        (1) allocate sufficient funding to properly sustain the       F107 turbine engine in order to ensure this vital weapon is       viable until a replacement is fielded; and        (2) contract with multiple, capable engine manufacturers to       stabilize and revitalize the United States small turbine       engine industrial base.

(2) An assessment of whether the capacity of ranges,       including limitations on flight operations, is adequate to       meet current and future training needs.        (3) An assessment of whether the establishment of a       dedicated squadron for the purpose of coordinating the use of       a special use airspace at the installation located in that       airspace would improve the achievement of the objectives       described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1).        (4) Recommendations for improving the management and       utilization of special use airspace to meet the objectives       described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1)       and to address any gaps in capacity identified under       paragraph (2).

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I again thank my friend and colleague,  Senator Jack Reed, for the continued cooperation which has  characterized our work together.   First, I wish to say that this modification to the substitution  amendment that I am offering, with the agreement and support of Senator  Reed, includes 48 amendments from both Republicans and Democrats that  will help improve this legislation. The modification submitted this  morning included 56 amendments, also evenly divided between Republicans  and Democrats. I want to emphasize that these amendments which were  just included are the result of bipartisan agreement on both sides.  They would not have been proposed if they hadn't already been agreed  to.   This means that now we have incorporated 104 bipartisan amendments in  this legislation. The amendments have the support of both Republicans  and Democrats in strengthening this legislation, making the NDAA more  reflective of the voices and opinions of all Members of the Senate. So  I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for allowing  us--helping us come up with these amendments which tremendously improve  the underlying legislation.   But I must say that we are at an impasse on about four amendments,  all four of which are very important amendments, and we simply can't  get agreement, which will probably call for the majority leader to file  cloture.   I really wish we weren't filing cloture. I wish we were treating  amendments the way we treated the Chair's amendment earlier today.  Every Senator should have the right to speak and to vote on any issue  that comes before this body, and that includes amendments.   Unfortunately, the majority leader will have to file cloture, we will  go through a period of time, and then we will move forward with the  bill, which, in my view, could be finished tomorrow.   The bad news is that not every Senator is able to be heard and able  to file amendments--second-degree, whatever it is. They are going to be  shut out by the cloture procedure. That is not right. It is not right.  Every one of these 100 Senators should be able to vote, to amend, and  to debate. That is what the Senate is supposed to be all about.   There are four basic amendments, and I won't describe them, but I  hope that overnight my colleagues on both sides can sit down and figure  out, as we have on a number of amendments, a way that we can reach a  point where we can have up-or-down votes on these amendments, which are  important to the Nation, particularly when we are talking about the  National Defense Authorization Act.   So I again thank the Senator from Rhode Island, my partner. I thank  him for all the work he is doing and ask him if he has any suggestions  or ideas.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my  defense fellow, Margaret Read, be granted floor privileges for the  length of the current debate on the National Defense Authorization Act.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
