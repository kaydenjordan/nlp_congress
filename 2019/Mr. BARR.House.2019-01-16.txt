 Mr. Speaker, during a meeting in the White House, our newly  elected Speaker of the House interrupted Homeland Security Secretary  Kirstjen Nielsen, who was reciting statistics relating to the border.   ``I reject your facts,'' Ms. Pelosi said.   Well, here are the facts:   Fact: Last year, 17,000 people with prior criminal convictions were  stopped trying to cross our southern border.   Fact: The recent 8,000-plus caravan that attempted to breach our  southern border contained over 600 confirmed criminal migrants.   Fact: Approximately 90 percent of the heroin seized by Customs and  Border Protection is interdicted along the southwest border of the  United States at and between the ports of entry, and Mexico continues  to be the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.   Fact: The Department of Homeland Security reports a 73 percent surge  in the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl interdicted at the southern  border over the last 2 years.   Fact: Over 72,000 Americans died of an opioid overdose last year.   Fact: In my home State of Kentucky, we suffer from the fifth highest  opioid overdose rate in America.   Fact: The administration's request to Congress is not funding for a  sea-to-sea  [[Page H610]]  concrete wall, as some falsely claim. It is a commonsense request for a  sophisticated border wall system, including strategically placed 30- foot steel barriers, technology, lights, cameras, sensors, and other  infrastructure.   Fact: Currently, there are 700 miles of physical barriers on our  southern border, a measure 90 Democrats, including Barack Obama, Joe  Biden, Hillary Clinton, Dianne Feinstein, and Chuck Schumer supported  in 2006.   Speaker Pelosi, it is interesting you claim walls are ``immoral,''  when many of the leading voices in your party have a previous record of  supporting physical barriers on our southern border. Do you consider  them immoral?   Fact: Border walls work. The Department of Homeland Security reports  that, where a wall was built, illegal crossings have dropped by 90  percent or more. For example, apprehensions of illegal aliens crossing  the border in El Paso, Texas, dropped 72 percent in 1 year and 95  percent over 22 years. And veteran Chief Border Patrol Agent Gloria  Chavez, a Hispanic American, not a political appointee, a career  professional with the Border Patrol agency, has said that the newly  constructed border wall in her El Centro Sector of California has  already reduced illegal border crossings.   Speaker Pelosi, you are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not  entitled to your own facts. I certainly agree with my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle who say we must end this government shutdown  and pay our Federal employees. It is wrong that these workers are  missing paychecks, especially essential government workers who are  required to work.                                time  1045    After all, many of these people are corrections officers, air traffic  controllers, Federal court personnel, and Border Patrol agents. These  are the very people who are charged with the responsibility of keeping  the American people safe. That is why I cosponsor the No Work Without  Pay Act, which would require us to pay these essential Federal workers  during the pendency of a shutdown.   But as important as it is that we timely fund these patriotic  Americans' paychecks, it is equally important, and perhaps more  important, that we fund their mission. So by all means, we must end  this government shutdown, but that objective won't happen when the  Speaker of the House refuses to accept basic, irrefutable facts. It  won't happen until both parties sit down and offer a proposal, and a  compromise, and a counterproposal, something that the Speaker of the  House refuses to do.   So my other friends on the other side of the aisle, many of them who  I know are equally committed to protecting the American people, to  Speaker Pelosi, and Senator Schumer: Stop the partisan games. Do your  job. Protect the American people from drugs and criminals. End this  shutdown, and fund commonsense border security.
