 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor, the likes of which I can't  think of a comparison, to stand here, in this week of April 2018, and  commemorate a battle undertaken by a student that I would argue was a  continuation of the American Revolution.   The American Revolution began when a group of White male landowners  cast off the tyrannical throne which lorded over them from across an  ocean, but it moved forward 80 years later when a million Americans,  through disease and starvation and battlefield death, gave their lives  to rid this Nation of the horrific institution of slavery. Then 55  years later, I would argue that it continued when the franchise was  extended through women's suffrage to women.  [[Page H3564]]    Then 30-plus years after that, by a 16-year-old high school student  at the R.R. Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia, who had heard  about the foundational ideas espoused by a slave owner named Jefferson  who wrote that all people are created equal, but couldn't reconcile  that with her life experience, because in the county where she lived, a  brand-new high school had been built, but only some kids could attend  it.   So in extending this American Revolution that continues to this day,  this 16-year-old young woman, Barbara Rose Johns, led a school walkout  that was the only student-initiated case amalgamated into the decision  in Brown v. Board of Education, which rid America of the ridiculous lie  that was ``separate but equal.''   So her walkout was not to take rights from others, but to extend  rights to all, and the idea of an American Nation founded on the idea  that all people had fundamental rights, and that it was the role of  government to protect those.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), my  colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Scott for his comments.   I refer to myself as a nerd--which is okay, because the nerds usually  win in the end--who loves history. My acquaintance with the story of  Barbara Johns did not begin as a school student taking Virginia history  in Virginia, it did not begin as a student at a top tier university  studying history.   It began when I became a candidate for the State Senate of Virginia.  The district that I wished to represent and had the honor of  representing included Farmville. So when I went to Farmville, I had the  opportunity to attend a function at the Moton Museum, which stands  where R.R. Moton High School stood and, in fact, encompasses the bulk  of that facility.   I heard about Barbara Johns, and I thought: Who is Barbara Johns? And  the more I learned about Barbara Johns, the more I was amazed that I  didn't know the answer to that question.   When we put in a bill to commemorate April 23, the day that this  courageous, and I would stress without ceasing, 16-year-old student-- when I was 16 years old, I think I was more concerned with the zit on  my nose and whether I could get a homecoming date than whether I was  going to change the world.   But when I learned more about her and we put in a bill to commemorate  April 23 as a holiday in the Commonwealth of Virginia, it was my hope  that one day someone would look at a calendar and see Barbara Johns Day  and say: Who was Barbara Johns?   Someone had the temerity to say to me: Well, Tom, this is Black  history.   I reject that on its face. This is not Black history or Brown history  or White history. It is American history, and it is red, white, and  blue.                                time  1715    That this country is the worst nation in the world, except for all  the others, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, is something that I am  proud of.   That we were founded by geniuses like Jefferson, who was a flawed and  fallen man by virtue of his participation in an evil, evil enterprise  that was the slave trade, does not diminish the brilliance of the idea  expanded upon by Locke and Rousseau and Hume, of natural law that all  people have certain fundamental rights. That is who we are as a  country.   The reason I postulated earlier that the American Revolution should  never end is because in the preamble to the Constitution, our Founders  gave us not a perfect union, but sought to establish  [[Page H3565]]  a more perfect union. And the word more's inclusion is important  because it implies the perpetual need to act because, in any  institution governed by flawed and fallen human beings, there will  always inherently be imperfection, but that does not absolve us of our  duty to do the best we can.   You can judge a nation and its character by the people whose virtues  it extols. And to suggest that Barbara Johns is an American hero is to  understate it.   Again, a revolution to cast off a tyrannical crown, followed decades  and decades later by a civil war to abolish a horrific, horrific  activity, followed by a fight for generations to ensure suffrage to an  entire sex, followed 30-some years later by a young girl with the  courage to stand up and assert that justice should be equal for all,  and that transcends even educational opportunity, inarguably.   So I hold in high regard foundational heroes like Patrick Henry, and  I have spoken from this spot on this floor before and talked about his  speech: ``I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give  me liberty or give me death.''   But my favorite ``Patrick Henryism'' was when, on speaking on  separating from the crown, someone from the back of the room shouted  ``Treason,'' and Henry said: ``If this be treason, make the most of  it,'' a willingness to stand and fight and die because something was  the right thing to do.   Now, let's skip forward to a 16-year-old girl in the segregated  South. She undoubtedly had the fortune of a strong family. I have had  the honor of speaking on multiple occasions with her sister and an  amazing uncle in Vernon Johns, a pastor first educated at Virginia  Theological Seminary and then at Oberlin and, I believe, at the  University of Chicago.   But Vernon Johns studied what? The classics and natural law, the  Jeffersonian ideas that liberty was inherently a gift to humans, not  from a government, but to be protected thereby. And so I like to  imagine, and presume it is true because I asked Joan Johns, with whom I  spoke last, if they ever discussed these sorts of things with their  Uncle Vernon, and she said, of course; that someone had to stand up and  assert these God-given rights in a land where they weren't protected by  the government in accordance to its responsibility.   Who did that? A 16-year-old young woman.   Okay. What was the cost? Well, no different than Patrick Henry, who  said: ``If this be treason, then make the most of it,'' quite  literally, Barbara Johns had to move away for fear for her life.   People think about the civil rights movement as many things. Many  don't realize that well over 1,000 people died, a lot in civil unrest,  but also in things like horrific bombings of churches based on the  color of the skin of the people who attended them.   So the threat to Barbara Johns was existential and real but, in the  face of that threat, she stood, and she led. And it wasn't about self- aggrandizement. There was no future political career. Barbara John's  aspiration in life was to be a librarian. She became one.   But when her moment came, she led. And she led, not to take from  anyone, but to give to everyone what is inherently their right and  should be cherished and protected by government.   And so we have, with incredible humility, had the opportunity to  serve in this hallowed institution, and this week, have filed for  Barbara Johns to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. It is the  highest award that can be bestowed by this Chamber.   Tragically, Ms. Johns passed from this life in 1991, but I would  submit that she is well-worthy of this honor. And then if bestowing  this honor upon her posthumously will lead more American young people  to read and learn about the leadership and courage demonstrated by this  school student from Prince Edward County, Virginia, then it is well  worth doing.   I in no way, shape, or form mean to make light, but if Bob Hope and  Roberto Clemente and John Wayne and Arnold Palmer and Dr. Muhammad  Yunus and Louis L'Amour can receive the Congressional Gold Medal, then,  by gosh, Barbara Rose Johns Powell deserves it.   This is a story that should be told. And it is not a political story,  it is an American story. It is not a black or white story, it is an  American story. It is not a story about a powerful woman, it is a story  about a powerful human being.   We, collectively, are great because individuals have been allowed and  encouraged and supported and uplifted and extolled for doing great  things. And it is ridiculous that I should have studied Virginia  history, American history, and then majored in history in college,  grown up less than 100 miles away from where this young woman did this  amazing thing, and have never heard her name.   So today, I genuinely and sincerely thank my colleague, and I hope  that somebody at home somewhere is Google searching Barbara Rose Johns,  because hers is an amazing story, and we stand on the shoulder of such  giants. It is overdue that she be recognized for her contribution to  our American family.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
