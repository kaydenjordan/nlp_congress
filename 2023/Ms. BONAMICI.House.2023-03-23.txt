 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  5, which should be called the politics over parents act.   After spending 15 years as a very involved public school parent, I  can say without hesitation that I strongly support parental involvement  in education. You won't meet a Member on this side of the aisle that  disagrees with that. The bill before us today misses the mark.   This could have been an opportunity to address the real challenges  facing education, to make changes that would involve parents in a  constructive way, and also make a positive difference in education. I  am disappointed that we aren't doing that.   House Democrats have shown time and time again that we are committed  to providing all parents--including those who traditionally face  barriers to engagement--with meaningful involvement in their kids'  schools. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Democratic  Party is the party of parental rights and family values.   We have put forward a substantive plan that will actually increase  the frequency, quality, and accessibility of parental involvement and  engagement in schools; a substantive plan that invests in evidence- based models and support systems that have been shown to increase  family engagement and improve student achievement; a substantive plan  that encourages parents to be partners, not adversaries, in their  children's education; a substantive plan that roots out discrimination  based on race, disability, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or  gender identity in our public schools; a substantive plan that, unlike  H.R. 5, doesn't carry dangerous, authoritarian undertones encouraging  book bans, discouraging the teaching of scientifically and historically  accurate curricula, and leading to the micromanagement of the work of  educators.    We welcome a conversation about how to empower parents, and urge our  friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle to abandon their  politically motivated attacks on schoolteachers and students. We should  instead be working together on these issues in a bipartisan manner. Our  Nation's students and families deserve that.   We need more parents, including those from diverse backgrounds, to  feel included, supported, engaged, and welcomed at their kids' school.  This bill does not even begin to do that.   I am leading more than 45 of our colleagues on a Bill of Rights for  Students and Parents, a resolution that is supported by more than 250  education, civil rights, and parents' groups, including the National  PTA.   I have heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that  history will judge us on how we respond to the needs of students and  families at this moment, and I agree with them.   Will we succumb to an extremist, discriminatory, narrow-minded, anti- public-education agenda, or will we work together to advance  commonsense, meaningful policies that will support parents, students,  and educators?   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to take the approach that  still sees public education as the great equalizer for all students  regardless of who they are or where they are from, essential to our  communities, the economy, and our democratic Republic.   Please join me in rejecting this bill.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a statement from the National PTA  in opposition to H.R. 5.   [[Page H1350]]          Dear Representative Bobby Scott: National PTA and our       network of millions of parents and educators across the       country urge you to support adoption of the Bonamici       Substitute Amendment and oppose the underlying legislation,       H.R. 5, on the House Floor tomorrow.        PTA opposes the underlying bill, H.R. 5, because it has the       potential to cause significant harm to children and families.       If passed as written, H.R. 5 could:        Prevent mental health support for students in need;        Limit access to learning-enhancing technology and       educational materials;        Lead to inappropriate and harmful book bans and curriculum       censorship;        Create confusion for school staff and burdensome opt-in       requirements for families;        Impair relationships between educators and parents; and        Undermine efforts to create safe, welcoming, supportive,       and inclusive learning environments for all students and       families.        PTA supports Representative Bonamici's Substitute Amendment       to H.R. 5 as the ONLY PATH forward to ensuring supports and       services are in place for true family-school partnerships. We       stand behind our National Standards for Family-School       Partnerships that have been in place for over 20 years. The       Substitute Amendment provides the opportunity for meaningful       and inclusive family engagement in K-12 education and if       adopted would replace the current H.R. 5 and enable our       Nation's public schools to:        Create a parent coordinator position in public schools;        Reinforce existing parents' rights under federal law;        Prohibit the federal government from curriculum censorship       and banning books; and        Invest in full-service community schools and Statewide       Family Engagement Centers Program (the new authorization       level of $60 million would allow all states to participate).        As the Nation's oldest and largest child advocacy       association, we know what meaningful family engagement looks       like and what parents want from their policymakers. We ask       you to join us in supporting the Bonamici Substitute       Amendment and opposing the underlying bill, H.R. 5 on the       House Floor. We thank you for consideration of this request       and if you have any questions, please reach out to our       Director of Government Affairs, Kate Clabaugh.     Madam Chair, today, the National Parents Union released  a poll that supports an alternative version of H.R. 5 and does not  support H.R. 5 in the least.   In fact, the majority of people believe that the bill of rights  should guarantee that students should have access to a high-quality,  well-rounded education with resources to support their individual  needs. They overwhelmingly agree that parents' own personal beliefs  should not prevent other students from accessing certain curricula and  materials.   The majority encourage the teaching of topics like women's history,  Black history, Native American history, and Latino, Latina, and  Hispanic history.   The majority of parents want Congress to focus on issues like anti- bullying measures in schools and providing students with access to  career and technical education and academic tutoring.   They rank requiring public schools to provide parents with a list of  books and reading materials in the library as the least important  priority for Congress compared to other issues.   They say that public schools should teach about and discuss concepts  like kindness, empathy, cooperation, and collaboration.   Ninety percent say that students should have access to high-quality,  well-rounded education. Ninety percent say that students should be  protected from any form of discrimination against them at school.  Eighty-nine percent say that students should be taught using  educational materials that are historically accurate. Eighty percent  say students should be taught using educational materials that reflect  the diversity of the United States. Eighty-three percent say students  should be taught about how government works so they can be prepared to  participate in democracy.   My colleagues, H.R. 5 misses the mark. Please, vote it down. I will  be offering a substitute amendment. We have something we can stand for  that will really, truly address the needs of students and parents.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter from the Council of the  Great City Schools in opposition to H.R. 5.                     Council of the Great City Schools,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: The Council of the Great City Schools,       the coalition of the nation's largest central city school       districts, writes to offer our perspective on H.R. 5, the       Parents Bill of Rights Act pending before the Committee.       Urban schools have long supported and encouraged family       involvement in our students' education and view parental       engagement as an invaluable tool to further school       improvement. Yet H.R. 5 includes excessive and redundant       federal requirements that are costly, time-consuming, and       unnecessary to improve student performance. The bill also       contains problematic requirements, such as provisions that       impede school districts' ability to operate effective       instructional programs and ones that may deter the       identification of students that need mental health support.       The Council does not support H.R. 5 and urges House leaders       to develop legislation that focuses on the instructional       improvements and supports that provide our students with the       best opportunity for success in school and life.        Urban school districts provide an endless number of       engagement opportunities and have longstanding local policies       and state laws to foster this connection. Parental       involvement on school-based committees is routine in urban       schools, with positions designated specifically for parents       and family members to review library materials and textbooks,       budget expenditures, school safety procedures, and school       improvement plans to increase student learning. The inclusion       of federal requirements in H.R. 5 that, for example, mandate       a specific number of in-person teacher meetings per year, the       annual disclosure of library and reading materials at each       school, and detailed budget publications needlessly duplicate       commonplace practices in districts that customarily have       multiple parent-teacher meetings, online card catalogs, and       regular public meetings for developing annual district-level       and school-level budgets that are posted on the districts'       websites.        We also do not support provisions that hinder districts'       ability to provide the instruction and support that our       students need to succeed. Urban school districts have worked       hard to ensure that the benefits of content-rich resources       are available to our children and have invested in online       tools to promote an ``anywhere/anytime'' approach to       learning. Encouraging parental objections to the use of such       technology will likely prove extremely disruptive for all       students and creates avoidable strictures for school and       district staff. Similarly, any restrictions on access to       school psychologists and counselors to support mental health       will unsettle school districts that are prioritizing the       well-being of those students that need it most.        Urban school districts are committed to their students,       parents, and families and have long worked to keep them       informed, inspired, and ready to partner with their local       schools. Authentic parent engagement is essential to       increasing student achievement and readiness for college,       career, and life. The Council urges a NO vote on H.R. 5 and       encourages Congress to develop legislation that will help our       districts and school communities reach these goals.            Sincerely,                                                      Raymond Hart,                                                Executive Director.     Madam Chair, I have a substitute amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support my amendment in the nature of a  substitute to H.R. 5.   My amendment in the nature of a substitute is a commonsense piece of  legislation that makes tangible investments in parental involvement. It  enhances the ability of school districts to involve all families, not  just the privileged few.   By adopting this amendment in the nature of a substitute, we will  invest in evidence-based, full-service community schools, public  schools that coordinate closely with community organizations to improve  the integration, accessibility, and effectiveness of services for  students and families; provide families with access to critical  wraparound services; and, importantly, improve student achievement.   We will be able to hire dedicated parent coordinators in public  schools to work directly with parents, connecting them with the  resources and support they need to help their children succeed and  ultimately improve parental involvement and student success.   We will direct more investments toward the Department of Education  Statewide Family Engagement Centers program so States can share best  practices on parental engagement, and school districts can receive the  support and training they need to increase parental participation and  involvement.   Madam Chair, I was a very involved parent, and I talked to parents  who wanted to come to school and wanted to participate, but they were  working extra shifts, didn't speak English, or didn't have  transportation. Let's break down those barriers.   Importantly, we will prohibit the banning of books and curricula in  our public schools and restore the ability of students to receive a  historically accurate, well-rounded education.   Madam Chair, I worked on this substitute with the input of  stakeholders who are in our public schools each and every day, who are  parents themselves, and who represent diverse communities in red and  blue States across our Nation. I am proud to introduce this amendment  in the nature of a substitute for consideration on the House floor  because, unlike the bill it seeks to amend, it reflects the true  diversity of our Nation and embodies the approach we should be taking  to make lasting improvements to public education, an inclusive,  collaborative, and evidence-based approach.   On behalf of all students and parents, I encourage all of my  colleagues to vote for this amendment and soundly reject H.R. 5, a bill  that should be named the politics over parents act.   Madam Chair, I thank the staff of the Education and the Workforce  Committee for all of their help with this amendment in the nature of a  substitute. I also thank my own staff in my office, Sujith Cherukumilli  and Dr. Alfonso Garcia, both of whom have spent time as classroom  teachers. I acknowledge the work of the staff on this important work,  as well.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Madam Chair, in response, again, I reiterate that every  single Democrat on our side of the aisle absolutely supports parental  involvement and parental engagement. We talked about that in the debate  on the bill.   About costs, it is my understanding that the so-called Parents Bill  of Rights Act doesn't have any additional funding with all the extra  obligations that are put on our schools, districts, and teachers.   There is no effort to silence parents. We want parents to be  involved, peacefully, and peacefully state their concerns.   I know that Ranking Member Scott talked about how Democrats tried to  put an amendment in to put some reasonableness in there. If you have  200 parents show up at a school board meeting, and each one of them  wants to speak for 2 hours, that is not reasonable.   We absolutely support parental involvement. We want to do that. We  want to provide that evidence-based engagement and, again, make the  relationship collaborative, not adversarial.   That is why I encourage colleagues to support this collaborative,  evidence-based approach to involve all parents in education.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
