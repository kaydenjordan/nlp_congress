 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res.  543, a resolution ``Recognizing Hong Kong's bilateral relationship with  the United States, condemning the interference of the People's Republic  of China in Hong Kong's affairs, and supporting the people of Hong  Kong's right to protest.''   As a senior member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, I support  H. Res. 543 because it calls on the Hong Kong government to address the  protesters' five demands, condemns police brutality against peaceful  protesters, and condemns efforts to falsely accuse U.S. diplomats of  fueling unrest.   On June 30, 1997, China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong, ending more than 150 years of British colonial rule.   Hong Kong is a customs territory and economic entity separate from  the rest of China and is able to enter into international agreements on  its own behalf in commercial, economic, and certain legal matters.   U.S. policy toward Hong Kong is stated in the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy  Act of 1992 and grounded in the determination to promote Hong Kong's  prosperity, autonomy, and way of life.   The United States maintains substantial economic and political  interests in Hong Kong.   The U.S. supports Hong Kong's autonomy under the ``One Country, Two  Systems'' framework by concluding and implementing bilateral  agreements; promoting trade and investment; broadening law enforcement  cooperation; bolstering educational, academic, and cultural links;  supporting high-level visits of U.S. officials; and serving the large  community of U.S. citizens and visitors.   After 22 years, protests erupted over Carrie Lam's proposal to amend  extradition laws to allow suspects to be transferred to mainland China  for trial.   A few days after proposing the amendment to the extradition laws,  Carrie Lam suspended the proposal, but the protests in Hong Kong  continue as the people of Hong Kong demand the high degree of autonomy  promised by the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984.   It is critical for the United States Congress to stand with the women  and men advocating and speaking up for the autonomy and dignity of  people of Hong Kong.   I applaud the efforts and sacrifices pro-democracy activists have  made and they should know that the United States fully supports their  desire for freedom and peace, and strongly condemns the violent and  oppressive tactics of the Hong Kong police.   As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I  support the bilateral relationship between Hong Kong and the United  States and the promotion of international peace.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res.  543 to condemn the brutality faced by the people of Hong Kong and which  poses a strong threat to the democratic values we work to protect.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4270,  the ``PROTECT Hong Kong Act.''   H.R. 4270 calls for the President to prohibit the issuance of export  licenses for nonlethal crowd control items and defense articles to the  Hong Kong police.   This prohibition will be terminated once the Hong Kong police have  stopped engaging in a pattern of gross human rights abuses, and there  has been an independent investigation conducted on policy brutality.   During the 2019 anti-extradition bill and pro-democracy protests, the  Hong Kong Police Force used non-lethal crowd control articles such as  water cannon trucks, tear gas, rubber bullets, sponge grenades, beanbag  rounds, batons, pepper spray, pepper balls, and projectile launchers.   Hong Kong citizens and the international community have called for  changes to the Hong Kong Police's crowd control tactics and these  requests have gone unheeded by the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region government.   I applaud the efforts and sacrifices pro-democracy activists have  made and they ought to know that the United States fully supports their  desire for freedom and peace, and we strongly condemn the violent and  oppressive tactics of the Hong Kong police.   When enacted, H.R. 4270 will prohibit the issuance of licenses to  export covered defense articles and services and covered munitions  items to the Hong Kong Disciplined Services.   As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security I find  it important to increase bilateral relations with allies and abroad to  help eliminate the injustices of the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4270  to confront the pattern of gross human rights abuses which pose a  strong threat to the democratic values we work to protect.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1199,  the ``Directing of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study  regarding the accessibility of websites of the Department of Veterans  Affairs to individuals with disabilities.''   H.R. 1199 permits the Secretary of VA to use grants rather than  federal contracts to fund cemetery research programs and produce  educational materials as part of the Veterans Legacy Program.   This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to report  to Congress regarding the accessibility of VA websites (including  attatched files and web based applications) to individuals with  disabilities.   According to the United States Census Bureau 31,390 residents in  Harris County, Texas are disabled veterans and this study would greatly  benefit them.   The report shall indentify websites, files, and applications that are  not accessible to such individuals and include the VA's plan to make  each of them accessible.   There are 21.8 million veterans of the U.S. armed forces as of 2014,  according the Census Bureau, approximately 10 percent of whom are  women.   The states with the highest number of veteran residents are  California with 2 million, Texas with 1.6 million and Florida also with  1.6 million.   Each of these states have major military bases including Fort Hood in  Texas, Fort Irwin in California and Naval Air Station Pensacola.   The Department of Veterans Affairs offers health and welfare services  to veterans but has fallen short in its task of serving the mental and  physical needs of generations of former troops.   The study required by this bill must be enacted no later than 180  days after the date of the enactment of this bill.   Once this study has been conducted we will be better able to assist  veterans with disabilities in accessing the website for resources.   It is critical for the United States Congress to ensure that veterans  have access to the resources they need.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1199  to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study  regarding the accessibility of websites of the Department of Veterans  Affairs to individuals with disabilities.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 95,  the ``Homeless Veteran Families Act.''  [[Page H8137]]    H.R. 95 updates the Department of Veterans Affairs per diem payment  calculation for entities furnishing services to homeless veterans to  include funding for a minor dependent.   The rate for per diem payments is the daily cost of care as estimated  by the grant recipient or eligible entity.   This bill would expand the per diem payment amount for a homeless  veteran who has care of a minor dependent to the daily cost of care,  plus, for each minor dependent, an amount that equals 50 percent of  such daily cost of care.   This bill is an intrinsic part of a much greater national movement to  recognize the transitional needs of all Veterans and their families  nationwide.   Our Veterans are America's indispensable asset; their dedication to  the United States Military and protecting the lives of the American  people is to be commended.   Lack of access to childcare presents a unique safety hazard to  homeless veterans' families, and puts a unique pressure on the shelters  and facilities in Houston.   Less than 3 percent of Veterans experiencing homelessness (2.9  percent) were in families with children.   Veteran women experiencing homelessness are more likely to be a part  of a family with children, compared to Veteran men.   Because of a lack of affordable health treatment and job prospects,  veterans represent about 12 percent of America's homeless population,  and approximately 50,000 veterans are homeless each night.   This bill will allow homeless veterans with children to receive  enhanced child care services.   When enacted, H.R. 95 will alleviate the financial burdens homeless  veterans experience with child care and assist them to transition into  the workforce.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 95 to  expand resources for homeless veterans with children.    Madam Speaker, a week ago Sunday, the Commander in  Chief of this Nation made a call to the head of the Government of  Turkey. No one knows the basis of that call, but we do know that it was  made without the consultation of the national security apparatus of the  United States of America and, to our knowledge, not with any  consultation of the Joint Chiefs.   Within minutes, within a period of time, a tweet directive was given  to take vital, important military personnel away from the Syrian- Turkish border.   No one knows what promises may have been made. We do know that if any  were made that this would be handled with care, they were broken. Right  before our eyes, massive havoc.   What strikes me the most, as the chair of the Congressional  Children's Caucus, is the video that shows the bloodletting of our  children, children in shock with limbs bloodied, mothers fleeing.   We do not need a backdoor peace treaty that is too late. We need a  no-fly zone, Madam Speaker.   We need real action, and we need the Commander in Chief not to lead  foreign policy by tweets. I am begging them to save the children.                            ____________________
