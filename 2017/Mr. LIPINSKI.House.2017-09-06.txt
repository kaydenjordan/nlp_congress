 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3388, the SELF  DRIVE Act. Connected and automated vehicles are a rapidly evolving  technology that are novel today, but will be a reality tomorrow. This  legislation will provide the auto industry, consumers, and policymakers  with the certainty they need to advance automated vehicle technology.  Automated vehicles have the potential to increase safety, improve  mobility, and decrease congestion while improving the efficiency of our  transportation network.   As the co-chairman of the Congressional Unmanned Systems Caucus and  an engineer, I have for the past three years been convening automated  vehicle stakeholders to discuss the policy issues related to the  development and deployment of these new technologies. In addition, I  authored the Future TRIP Act during the 114th Congress. Key provisions  of that bill, including the establishment of a regional transportation  center to study automated vehicles were passed into law in the FAST  Act. It is imperative that we maintain the United States'  manufacturing.   I commend my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for  their bipartisan work on this important legislation. The SELF DRIVE Act  includes language will promote industry growth by preventing a  potentially stifling patchwork of differing local regulations. By  asserting the authority of the federal government to regulate these  vehicles and corresponding safety standards, the Committee has struck  the right balance by allowing states to retain their traditional roles  in driver licensing, insurance, and vehicle registration in a way that  does not impede innovation. In addition, I am pleased that the bill  enables the Department of Transportation to review the vehicle systems  through the Safety Assessment Letter process.  [[Page H6677]]    Automated vehicles are highly complex, and present a number of  equally complex policy considerations. While this bill is a significant  step forward in defining the federal government's role in this emerging  technology, I believe there is more work to be done with respect to  ensuring that NHTSA has appropriate resources to carry out the federal  role in oversight and regulation, and to ensuring the privacy of  consumers' data. Data sharing between government and industry holds the  possibility of improving safety operations and performance, but must be  a collaborative partnership, and must protect consumers' personally  identifiable data.   For that reason, I have an amendment that has been made in order to  the Fiscal Year 2018 Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development  appropriations bill, that we will consider later today. The amendment  will provide the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration with an  additional $9 million for the Salaries and Expenses account. These  funds will enable the agency to expand its workforce, define new  testing protocols as the technology emerges, and better partner with  industry and state and local governments to conduct adequate oversight.   In addition, I continue to have concerns about the collection, use,  and privacy of consumers' data. A recent report issued at the direction  of myself and my colleague, Congresswoman Comstock, the Government  Accountability Office found while nearly all of the major auto  manufacturers now offer vehicles with connected technologies, NHTSA has  not clearly defined its roles and responsibilities as they relate to  the privacy of vehicle data, making it difficult for NHTSA to  coordinate with other federal agencies to effectively oversee these  emerging technologies.   We still have important issues to consider, including insurance,  cyber-security, and data sharing. I look forward to continuing to  collaborate with my colleagues to examine this evolving industry, and  defining the federal government's role in promoting industry while  protecting the public. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 3388, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend  title 49, United States Code, regarding the authority of the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration over highly automated vehicles,  to provide safety measures for such vehicles, and for other  purposes.''.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        Page 1141, line 18, after the first dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $9,000,000)''.        Page 1180, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $9,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment that  will provide the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration with $9  million in order to facilitate their critical work on self-driving  cars.   Earlier today, the House passed the SELF DRIVE Act, which expanded  NHTSA's authorities in this area. This amendment I am offering supplies  the initial financial resources needed to carry out the directives of  that bill. This includes validating the safety of self-driving cars;  defining new testing protocols as the technology advances; and  partnering with industry, along with State and local governments, to  conduct oversight of these new vehicles.   NHTSA will play a key role in fostering adoption of this technology  that promises so much: expanded mobility, much safer roads, decreased  energy usage and emissions, and less congestion.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Will the gentleman yield?    I yield to the gentleman from Florida.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. If the gentleman would be all right with that, I  would be willing to agree to his amendment. As long as we can move the  process quickly, I would agree to the amendment.    I thank the chairman for supporting it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 22 Offered by Mr. Mitchell    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 22  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
