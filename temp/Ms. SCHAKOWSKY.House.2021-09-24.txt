 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Women's Health Protection Act that will end the horrifying State-level  attacks on abortion access. The Texas law would encourage vigilantism  and criminalizes anyone who would even help someone to get an abortion.  But Texas is not alone.   Abortion is healthcare. This is a pro-choice country, a pro-choice  nation. Women can make the decision to have a child or not have a  child. It is about bodily autonomy.   I want to be very clear; Roe v. Wade was not the beginning of women  having abortions. It was the end of women dying from abortions.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  legislation and to say ``no'' to harming women.
