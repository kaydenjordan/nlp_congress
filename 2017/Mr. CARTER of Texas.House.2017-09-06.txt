 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  supplemental funding for Hurricane Harvey relief. H. Res. 502 totals  $7.85 billion in emergency funding, including $7.4 billion for FEMA's  Disaster Relief Fund. This supplemental funding is a necessary first  step toward assisting our communities in immediate need.   However, rebuilding and recovering from the devastation of Hurricane  Harvey will continue to require further resources and really hard work.  I will continue to work closely alongside my colleagues in the Texas  delegation, the Louisiana delegation, and the Appropriations Committee  to meet the needs of our neighbors in the southeastern part of our  State.   My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this  devastating storm.   Colleagues, I encourage each and every one of you to vote for this.  H. Res. 502 is focused on addressing the immediate needs of those  affected by Hurricane Harvey. It sends them a powerful message: that we  are here and we are here for them, and we will be working hard for them  throughout this recovery.   Just this morning, I saw another newsman standing waist-deep in water  in Houston as it continues to recede. Let's cast our vote properly and  start the recovery for the southeastern part of Texas and the western  part of Louisiana.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Frelinghuysen  and Mrs. Lowey for all the work that we did together on this bill. The  whole bill is a good bill. It deserves this House's support.   But I am here to present the Department of Homeland Security  Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018, which, in turn, deserves your  support. This is a good bill that is essentially for the security of  our Nation. It not only funds vital security and law enforcement  capabilities, but it also restores funding for critical Federal  assistance grant programs and disaster relief.   As importantly, it provides the oversight essential to ensure the  Department's actions are in accordance with congressional intent.   Let's look at it. For CBP, $1.6 billion for 74 miles of border wall  construction that was previously included in the Make America Secure  Appropriations Act that was passed in July.   In addition to the funding for the wall construction, this bill will  fund additional border patrol agents and virtually all of the  technology, infrastructure, and assets needed for the security of our  borders.   For ICE, this bill funds 44,000 detention beds; 10,000 more beds than  were funded in 2016; almost 4,700 more than the number funded in 2017.   This bill will strengthen ICE's ability to enforce immigration laws  and conduct investigations into human trafficking, child exploitation,  and transnational crime.   For TSA, although the bill does not include the proposed increase in  aviation security fees, it fully funds required transportation security  screeners.   For the Coast Guard, all major acquisition programs are funded at the  required level: the polar icebreaker, the offshore patrol cutter, and  the fast response cutter.   For FEMA, the bill fully funds the request for disaster assistance.  It restores nearly $940 million to the Federal assistance for first  responder grants and education training exercises. Additionally, the  bill fully funds all cybersecurity acquisition requirements at the  requested levels, fully funds the Secret Service, and fully funds E- Verify.   In conclusion, my colleagues, this bill strengthens the security of  our Nation. It also sends a powerful message that if you break our  Nation's laws and cross the border illegally, you will suffer the  consequences: apprehension and a guaranteed stay in detention.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), my colleague, for the purpose of a  colloquy.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding,  and I thank him for bringing up this issue.   Last week, FEMA was forced to restrict obligations for past disasters  to prioritize funding for immediate lifesaving efforts in response to  Hurricane Harvey.   The supplemental funding bill that passed the House this morning will  enable FEMA to lift these restrictions and resume funding for long-term  recovery efforts, such as those in North Carolina and other parts of  our Nation.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Collins of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. Marshall, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 3354) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior,  environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September  30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 500, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen, I rise to  offer en bloc No. 3 as part of the consideration of Division E of H.R.  3354. A list of amendments included in the en bloc is at the desk and  has been agreed to by both sides.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), who is my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Latta).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Donovan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the proposal to cut ICE funding  for enforcement of immigration laws and removal of those here illegally  will endanger the safety of the American people and convey to bad  actors that the rule of law no longer exists in the United States,  leading to increased border crossings and even more illegal aliens in  the United States.   Cutting funding for beds will lead to the release of criminal and  other removable aliens into communities across the country and weaken  the United States border security. I ask you to join me in opposing  this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.  [[Page H7076]]     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, my good friend from Texas, I know  his heart is in the right place, but I have real concerns about the  cost and the utilization of body cameras.   We know that you have to preserve evidence. And once you have opened  this door that there are expected to be body cameras on officers, then  not only do you have to preserve every piece of film or production that  comes out of that camera as a potential piece of evidence, and if you  take that and multiply it times the number of incidents that are going  to occur as we go through a year, and then multiply that times however  many years this agency lasts, you are talking about storing millions of  gigs or whatever they are that have to be preserved to preserve  potential evidence that could be used both by the defense and the  prosecution.   And then in a case where there isn't a body camera, it is going to be  a jury argument that can be very effectively made by the defense about  why isn't there a body camera where there is a policy of having body  cameras?                                time  0000    But the real issue that I have with this is the cost of preserving  the record continuously by law enforcement. I think people haven't  thought this out to what kind of additional cost this is going to be as  you spread this out over the lifetime of an agency and all the agents  that work for that agency.   I know the reasons why people think body cameras are a good idea, and  they fit that. But does it justify the storage cost that is going to be  required to preserve the evidence that is manufactured by the body  camera?   That is the question I think we ought to consider, and that is the  reason I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand what my colleague  wants: the 45,000 agents that could potentially be acquiring these  cameras. Because the first thing you are going to have the first time  you go before a judge and you use one of these body cameras in one  case, the defense is going to be wanting to know why you are not using  them in every case. They are going to be setting up a defense of the  fact that the officers failed to meet their duty to preserve the  record.   So you take just 45,000 and 1 year of contacts. Granted, his $10  million isn't going to get all of those guys cameras, but you started  down the road to putting a camera on 45,000 agents. And then you have  to store everything they produce of any contact that they have for the  potential use in evidence by one or the other side in a legal  proceeding. That is what concerns me.   Joe Kelly is a good marine and a good Secretary, and I am sorry he is  not with us anymore. But the reality is, if you sat in the courtroom  and watched the preservation of evidence, you know this has the  potential, both for law enforcement and for us, to be a mushroom that  explodes in nuclear proportions. That is the only reason I raise this  issue.   I know the issues that they are trying to address, and they need to  be addressed. I am concerned about the fact that once you start down  that road, you are constitutionally required to preserve evidence, and  that will be costly. I will leave that up to our colleagues as to how  they feel about that.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I only want to lay out that there  is a potential very large cost once this door is opened. That is my  opposition to this.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by Ms. Roybal-Allard.    Mr. Chair, the proposal to cut ICE funding for  enforcement of immigration laws and removal of those here illegally  will not only endanger the safety of the American people, it will also  convey to bad actors that the rule of law no longer exists in the  United States, leading to increased border crossings and a growing  overall illegal alien population.   Cutting funding for beds will lead to the release of criminal and  other removable aliens into communities across the country and weaken  the United States border security.   The hiring of additional ICE agents is needed to protect our  communities by preventing terrorism and reducing crime through the  vigorous enforcement of immigration and custom laws. Restricting this  hiring compromises ICE's law enforcement mission, jeopardizing homeland  security and public safety.   Interior immigration enforcement is indispensable to national  security and public safety. It cannot be separated from border  security. A successful border control and immigration system must be  supported by the enforcement of all pertinent laws.   Adding funds to procure another polar icebreaker, while a noble idea,  is simply not practical at this time. The Coast Guard is still in the  early stages of design and will not be ready to procure the first  icebreaker until late fiscal year 2019 at the earliest. The funds will  be unexecutable and, therefore, a waste of limited resources that we  have.   In addition, if you discuss with the border patrol about the biggest  deterrent we have, it is the threat of detention.   Mr. Chair, I ask that my colleagues join me in opposing this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I, too, agree with Ms. Roybal- Allard for the need for an icebreaker, that is not in dispute here, but  to cut the beds to the proposed 30,000 that she said, in 2017, our  number was 39,000 and change, and we have been over that this year, so  we still have a real need for these beds, and that need, as I have  stated before, is why I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by Mr. Castro.    Mr. Chair, I made the statement previously when  we discussed this that this could quickly escalate. We are escalating  again by 19,000 more people who would ultimately be required to have  cameras.   Once again, without getting into what I just talked about, this is  going to be a very costly item. We have something called chain of  custody on evidence. ICE agents deal with some very serious issues,  felony issues under Federal law. They have got a wide jurisdiction, one  of the widest jurisdictions of any agency, even wider than some like  the FBI.   So, once again, now that chain of custody on that camera, where that  camera information passes from hand to hand, has to be kept in addition  to the evidence so that if you are going to present it in court, you  can prove the chain of custody. You just enhanced and expanded the  amount of costs that it is going to take for an agent to go to trial.   I know this is a very popular idea all over the country, because it  has been very much supported by the media, but I really, in good faith,  believe that people have not considered the evidentiary problems they  are going to create for themselves by the presence of these cameras.                                time  0020    We will find out fairly quickly as these cameras proliferate what the  cost is going to be and what the information required is going to be by  the courts. And maybe I am overanticipating, but just now, we have gone  from $44,000; we have added another $19,000, just in our agency. Now,  multiply that times every law enforcement entity in the United States  and it becomes an astronomical expense and something we need to think  about, and think about hard.   So, for those reasons, not because I don't think it is a good idea to  have congeniality between arresting officer and defendant or being able  to prove where there is abuse. I agree with all those things.   But I think you are creating a monster evidentiarywise as you go  forward with body cameras. We tried them back in the seventies, and  they very quickly found that they were not a good idea, but I guess we  will try them again.   Anyway, for those reasons, I oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Well, I certainly understand the example that  the gentleman gave about officers planting dope, and it certainly did  work.   I can tell you, in my 20 years on the bench, we have had cameras on  the dashboard of DPS troopers' cars for 10 years, 20 years maybe, I  don't know, maybe the whole time I was there. But I have seen at least  15 of those prove the guilt of the defendant by his actions in front of  those cameras. So it is not just to catch dirty cops; it also catches  people in criminal action.   By the way, the action of that officer was a criminal action so,  therefore, you have to preserve the evidence. My point is made by your  very argument. You have to preserve the evidence. If you lose the  evidence, you are going to lose the prosecution, and so you are going  to have to keep it secure. If it passes from one hand to the other  hand, it has to be tracked in a chain of custody.   If it is secure on the--there is going to have to be some evidence of  the security of whatever web or whatever it is that it is on, or the  cloud, that that is a secure cloud so that someone can't have messed  with the evidence while it is on the cloud. All of that is potential  argument against conviction in a criminal case, and those ICE agents  deal with serious criminal cases.   I don't think people have thought it out. If they have, then that is  fine. Let's spend that money. But it is going to be astronomical if we  do it for every law enforcement agent in the country.   I continue my opposition, and I reserve the balance of my time.    I continue to oppose, and I yield back the  balance of my time  [[Page H7080]]     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, once again, as I said before of the  gentlewoman's amendment cutting beds, that that will weaken the United  States' border security, and the hiring of additional ICE agents is  needed to protect our communities, prevent terrorism, reduce crime  through vigorous enforcement of immigration and customs laws.   Successful border control and immigration systems must be supported  by enforcement of pertinent laws. This bill recommends $240 million for  four fast-response cutters, the same as the amount requested. The  program is on schedule and on budget, and there is no need to  accelerate the procurement of additional ships. We have been building  those on time without flaws now for 4 years at that same rate. We are  building a lot of fast-response cutters very quickly.   We have, now, a new program for the offshore patrol cutter, which the  first of the contracts have been let, and that is in the process of  being built, and we have a projection for multiple of those cutters.   Taking away from our ability to detain people who have broken the law  is not a good resource for growing a program that is already very  robust and very effective and has put online multiple fast-response  cutters.   Mr. Chair, for those reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, even if this money should be moved  and the gentleman's amendment be approved, it wouldn't mean that any  more fast-response cutters would be built in this calendar year.   I am fairly certain that the commandant of the Coast Guard would say  that we have been very robust and very effective at producing fast- response cutters, and I believe that the detention beds is a deterrent  for those coming across the border and for those violating the law as  an important part of the defense of the borders and the people of the  United States.   Therefore, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have some concerns regarding  this amendment. However, I agree there is a gap in our Nation's  icebreaking capability, and I strongly support the Coast Guard's  icebreaking program. For that reason, I will not oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by Mrs. Torres.    Mr. Chair, estimating the required number of  operations and detention beds is not exact science. This reprogramming  a party is essential to be able to deal with emergent and critical  operation needs, like surges we have seen in 2014 and 2016.   Without sufficient funding for beds, ICE will be forced to release  criminal and other illegal aliens into communities across the country  and weaken the security of the United States. The proposal to restrict  ICE's ability to reprogram funding for detention beds would not only  endanger the safety of the American people, but it will also convey to  bad actors that the United States will not detain illegal aliens,  leading to increased border crossings and growing overall illegal alien  operations in the United States.   Therefore, I oppose this amendment and ask my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that  amendment No. 79 printed in part B of House Report 115-295, which was  adopted as part of the amendments en bloc, be modified by the  modification placed at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  gentleman's amendment, and I adopt all of his arguments that he has  made.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, over half of the ICE detention  population is housed in privately owned and operated detention  facilities. Neither ICE nor State and local detention facilities can  provide the number of beds required to house the detained population  that we have today. Without the capacity provided by contracts with  private detention facilities, ICE will be forced to dramatically scale  back interior enforcement and, more seriously, release thousands of  dangerous criminal aliens from custody.   Eliminating private facilities will require a significant expansion  to ICE's capacity that, according to estimates, will exceed $1.3  billion and could be as much as $5 billion to $6 billion.   I also note that my colleague in the minority considers detention  standards to be of vital importance, yet the majority of the facilities  that meet the highest and most stringent detention standards are the  very same contract facilities this language would eliminate.   For these reasons, I oppose this amendment and ask for a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I oppose the  gentleman's amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, it seems that the minority has a  very good tag team match going here. The previous amendment would  eliminate, if it passes, all of the privately owned facilities, leaving  us with, by the gentlewoman's own statement, 3,500 beds for detainees;  whereas, our total population today ranges from 35,000 to 40,000 people  that are detained, which would mean all those people would have to be  released or placed in some kind of alternative of which the no-show for  that alternative is horrendous.   This kind of restriction makes no sense. Even though there is nobody  planning to build ICE facilities right now, to restrict the government  from a possible need, should that need arise--I remind you that in  2014, in the month of August, 78,000 children came across the border,  and an equal number or more of a child with a parent came across the  border in the Laredo sector alone.   So we have real needs that need to be met, and quite honestly, this  amendment ties the hands and everybody gets turned loose. I very much  oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, what Ms. Roybal-Allard just stated  was true, but I rise in support of this gentleman's amendment because  it is time the agencies and departments fully comply, and this  amendment attempts to achieve that effort. Therefore, I support the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  King of Iowa) having assumed the chair, Mr. Marshall, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  3354) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior,  environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September  30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
