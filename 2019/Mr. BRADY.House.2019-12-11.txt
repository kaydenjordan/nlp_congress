 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, why should patients have to choose between affordable  medicines and a lifesaving cure for Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's, or  cancer? Why should parents with sick children be forced to wait longer  for the newest breakthroughs that can save their lives? Why should  Americans face shorter lives because the costliest and most painful  drug is the one that is never created?   At the depths of Nancy Pelosi's drug bill is a dangerous tradeoff of  lower drug prices in the short term but fewer lifesaving cures in the  future, and not just a few cures lost, but many, according to the  independent Congressional Budget Office and the Council of Economic  Advisers, up to 38 cures lost, according to the Congressional Budget  Office, and up to 100, according to the CEA.   The California Life Sciences Association predicts nearly 9 of 10 new  drugs would never be available--never--from their research and small  biotech companies if the Pelosi bill becomes law. This is a cruel  and false choice, which is why this bill would quickly die with no real  bipartisan support in the Senate.    As Republicans, we believe we need to do both, lower drug prices and  accelerate new lifesaving cures. Our bill, the Lower Costs, More Cures  Act, lowers out-of-pocket costs for Americans by cracking down on  overpriced drugs and empowering seniors to choose the right place to  get medicines, which can cut the cost of chemotherapy in half, pulling  back the curtain on those who set drug prices, forcing drug companies  to justify their increases and list their prices in their ads.   We accelerate, not kill, lifesaving medical cures. We permanently  make it easier for Americans to deduct high medical expenses from their  taxes. We allow them to use their health savings accounts for over-the- counter medicines, including feminine hygiene products, and save  seniors over $300 each year on their medicines in the popular Medicare  prescription drug program.   All of these proven ideas are bipartisan. All of these can be passed  by Congress. All of these can be signed by President Trump this year if  Democrats abandon their partisan games and recontinue what was our  bipartisan work that got shelved for the Pelosi drug bill.   I will finish with this. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee,  we in the Republican Congress joined with President George Bush in 2003  to create an affordable drug plan for seniors. At the time, Speaker  Pelosi and Democrats tried their best to kill it. She famously  predicted that trading the crucial part D prescription plan for the  elderly would end ``Medicare as we know it.''   Can you imagine how many seniors' lives would have been lost if she  had succeeded in stopping the affordable Medicare drug program that 43  million seniors have come to depend upon today?   Nancy Pelosi and Democrats were dangerously wrong then. Can Americans  afford the pain and risk when they are dangerously wrong again?   Madam Chair, we have an alternative that lowers costs and accelerates  cures in H.R. 19. That is the solution.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), one of our key members on the  Ways and Means Committee.  [[Page H10108]]         Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), who is one of our leaders in technology in  healthcare.    Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), who is a small business person who has always  offered quality healthcare for his workers.    Madam Chair, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. LaHood), who is a dynamic member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Chair, the Republican alternative to Lower Cost, More Cures Act  is based on both parties working together. In fact, we were doing so  until Speaker Pelosi blew this up with H.R. 3, written in secret,  without any Republican input.   Our bill contains 36 different provisions that passed unanimously out  of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Energy and  Commerce. Madam Chair, 17 provisions that passed out of the House of  Representatives also with bipartisan support; 28 different provisions  that passed out of 3 different Senate committees with bipartisan  support, and 21 of these provisions from the Grassley-Wyden Drug  Pricing Package.   When this partisan bill dies, H.R. 3, we Republicans will be ready to  take up these bipartisan measures because we agree--Democrats and  Republicans--we need to lower drug prices, and we need to accelerate  these cures.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), one of our new members of the Ways  and Means Committee who is really thoughtful on healthcare.    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Patients or politics--that is really the choice we have today when we  vote on these different drug pricing bills.   There is a path forward that chooses politics. This path takes a  partisan approach and throws away months of Republicans and Democrats  working together to lower drug prices.   Experts tell us this will delay or eliminate medical breakthroughs  and lifesaving cures for American families.   This piece of legislation is potentially unconstitutional, one that  leads to patient access restrictions while giving more power to foreign  bureaucrats to set prices for American patients right here.   And at what cost?   To save a few dollars in the short term for a dramatically worse  landscape in America that discourages science, research, and discovery.   So I think of Representative Kelly's young girl, Mattie Stuart, St.  Petersburg, Pennsylvania. She has a Facebook page, Mattie's Followers.  Go to that page. Understand how patients are waiting for us, for those  new cures.  [[Page H10112]]    I think of my friends in my neighborhood. We had a neighbor who died  from a rare brain cancer. I have another who is fighting a  glioblastoma; another neighbor, a very dynamic friend, who is now  struggling with Parkinson's; two friends who have died from ALS; and my  friends, acquaintances, coworkers who they or their parents struggle  with dementia and Alzheimer's.    This bill, from Speaker Pelosi, in my view, just rips hope, robs hope  from people waiting and praying for those cures. There is no way there  are not fewer cures.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to $1 trillion will  be taken away from research and science and revenues that are invested  in drugs and new discoveries.   Some say, well, the drug companies--and everyone seems to hate them-- but the drug companies can just not do as many ads, can just shift some  money around.   But let me put it in perspective. Drug companies could not spend a  dime on any advertisement for the next 25 years; they couldn't make up  what is taken from this bill.   We could zero out National Institutes of Health for a quarter  century. That is what $1 trillion in research and discovery investment  does.   You are in denial if you don't know there will be fewer cures-- whether it is 38, whether it is 100, whether it is something in  between. No one can tell us that cure that is lost won't be the one for  Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's, or for cancer.   This is the path Republicans reject. We believe that is too high a  price to pay for this bill, because we think there is a bipartisan road  right in front of us that we can take together, one that chooses  patients and their needs. And I am convinced Democrats believe, with  us, that we can do both.   I believe, with goodwill and good ideas, we can do this Lower Costs,  More Cures Act. It sets out what Chairman Richie Neal and I set out to  do in February of this year. We wrote that now is ``the time to take  meaningful action to lower the cost of prescription drugs in the U.S.''   We said we are committed to working together to end this cycle while  preserving access to lifesaving innovations. I believe we can do that.   I believe the solution isn't in H.R. 3. That is as dead as can be. I  think the solution is H.R. 19 and working together to fine-tune it even  better by accelerating, not killing, lifesaving medical cures; by doing  what we have already said is bipartisan: driving out-of-pocket costs  down; expanding health savings accounts; deducting medical expenses;  letting people use their FHAs more; saving seniors by redesigning part  D; forcing drug companies to justify their increases, to pull that  curtain back on how they price those drugs; everyone along the system,  making them, forcing them to pay more of the drug burdens in Medicare  part D.   And together, we can tell families suffering from Alzheimer's, ALS,  Parkinson's, cancer, and so many other illnesses that we are committed  together to finding a cure.   My vote today will be on behalf of patients. It will be on behalf of  bipartisan solutions. It will be cast with the hope that a future cure  for cancer can be discovered and developed right here in America,  sooner rather than later.   I know my Republican colleagues will join with me in that fight as  well, and I ask my friends, my Democrat colleagues, to do the same.   Let me be clear on that. I think there are Democrats who have come  here to solve problems but find themselves boxed out by the Speaker's  top-down approach. My simple request is, join us in fighting for a  bipartisan solution, H.R. 19, no matter how you will eventually vote on  H.R. 3.   Send a signal that it is not too late for the Matties of the world.  It is not too late. We can deliver a bipartisan win for lower drug  prices and that cure we all pray for for our families and loved ones.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
