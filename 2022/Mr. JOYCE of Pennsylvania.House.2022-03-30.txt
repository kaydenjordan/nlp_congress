 Madam Speaker, since the founding of our  Nation, American farms have been at the bedrock of our economy.   Our farmers, growers, and ranchers produce the dairy, wheat, corn,  apples, and peaches that we have relied on for generations to feed our  families, our neighbors, and the world.   There are over 52,000 farms across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,  and the struggles that affect them affect each and every one of us.   Right now, our farmers are facing so many difficult challenges. The  cost to run a farm is estimated to grow by nearly 7 percent next year.  To make matters even worse, the cost of fertilizer has already risen by  over 50 percent in the past 12 months. Now, the Biden administration is  preparing to implement new taxes on fertilizer imports from overseas.   Now is not the time to tax our farmers even more. President Biden  cannot use our growers and producers to pay for his out-of-control  budget.   We need to ensure that our farmers have the resources that they need  to continue producing the food that each of us relies on every day. We  need to make sure that they have the fertilizer, the grain, and the  seeds that it takes to work a farm or to tend an orchard.   American farmers feed the world. It is time to stop imposing new and  crippling taxes on our hardworking farmers. It is time to let them get  back to work on feeding all of us.                 President Biden's Far-Left Spending Proposal     Madam Speaker, on Monday, President Biden  laid out his budget for the coming year, a budget that contains $73  trillion in spending, $58 trillion in taxes, and over $16 trillion in  debt.   When he unveiled this far-left spending proposal, President Biden  said that a budget is a statement of values. However, by failing to  mention our border security, by tacking on billions of dollars for  environmental justice, and by stripping out the Hyde amendment,  President Biden has delivered to the American people a budget that does  not share our values.   We need a budget that protects the border. We need a budget that  stops the flow of illegal drugs, like fentanyl, into our communities.  We need a budget that promotes American energy in the face of egregious  Russian aggression. We need a budget that defends all human life.   We don't need this socialist spending spree; we don't need $58  trillion in taxes; and we certainly do not need $16 trillion in new  debt that mortgages the future of our children.                            ____________________
