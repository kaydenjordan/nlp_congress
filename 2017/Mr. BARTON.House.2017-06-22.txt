 Mr. Speaker, as we all know, last Thursday evening, we  played the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity. This is  normally the time when the losing manager has to congratulate the  winning manager. Over the last 10 years, I have become fairly  proficient at congratulating Mr. Doyle.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I am not going to tell a lot of jokes because, as  we all know, at the Republican practice the Wednesday morning before,  an individual opened fire on the Republican team and wounded the  majority whip, Mr. Scalise; both Capitol Police officers who were part  of Mr. Scalise's security detail; and two volunteers who were assisting  us in our practice. So I don't have a lot of jokes today, Mr. Speaker.   I do want to congratulate Mr. Doyle and his team. They played fair  and square. They were extremely gracious before the game. We had a  unity prayer. We had a unity introduction of the players. The night  before, Mr. Doyle and his team invited the Republican team, believe it  or not, to the Democratic political headquarters. I went with my two  sons. The food was great, and the fellowship was even better.   So I do sincerely want to congratulate him and his players for  playing the best game. They deserved to win.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the Republican team. We had  approximately 25 of our Members at the practice. Every one of them  exhibited courage and composure. They all looked out for their fellow  teammates.   We had an equivalent number of staff and volunteers. We had two of  the best Capitol Hill police officers it is possible to have. They  risked their lives.   I want to say this, and then I will yield to my good friend, Mr.  Doyle.   The shooter that attacked the Republican baseball team, Mr. Speaker,  was attacking democracy. When we are at full strength on this floor,  there are 435 of us. Every one of us is a winner. We get here because  we have won an election. We get here because we have got the faith of  approximately 600,000 or 700,000 people who are depending on us to be  their voice for democracy. We argue. We debate. But as I said in one of  my interviews, before our names is United States Representative.  United.   Last Thursday, at the baseball game, we were united. I could not be  prouder of being a Member of this body, Mr. Speaker. I could not be  prouder of the Republican team, including our MVP, Ron DeSantis; our  honorary MVP, Steve Scalise; and every member of the Republican team.   Would the members of the Republican team stand and let's acknowledge  their heroism.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael  F. Doyle).   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding.   This is different from the other years that we have stood up here.  This trophy isn't for either team. This trophy is for Steve.   I just want you all to know that when we got the news at our baseball  practice about what was going on, the only thing we could think about  is that we are a family. When we stood in the dugout and prayed that  you were safe and that no one was hurt, we weren't thinking about  Democrats and Republicans. We were thinking about our fellow Members.   I was thinking about your son, Jack, and all the fun times I have had  kidding him. I was thinking about Cedric Richmond's 3-year-old son, who  was with us, and what would have happened if that shooter had come over  to our dugout.   If there is a silver lining to that terrible day, it was reflected in  the outpouring of people who showed up at our game. We normally get a  crowd of 9,000 to 10,000. We had 25,000 people come to that game.   We normally raise about $500,000 for the three charities that the  game supports. I have a check here that says we raised $1.5 million,  but that is not correct. It is $1.7 million. Some worthwhile charities  are going to get a check they weren't expecting.   I want to reiterate what you said about our Capitol Police. To have  someone shooting bullets at you, that is terrifying enough. To make the  decision to put yourself out there and charge at that shooter to make  sure that there wasn't a massacre takes a special kind of person.   To see Crystal throw that ball out last night at the women's softball  game brought a lot of joy to my heart. We owe a real debt of gratitude  to the Capitol Police who protect us on these grounds.   I want Joe to know that we continue to think about all of you. You  are in our prayers, you are in our thoughts. Something terrible  happened. For many of you, it might take days before it hits you. I  would encourage anyone who is feeling that to talk to someone. Don't be  bashful about that. This was a traumatic experience for your team,  especially, but I want you to know that you are in our hearts and in  our prayers.    As we said before, Joe and I are going to walk this trophy over to  Steve's office. When the hospital gives us clearance, we are going to  go over to the hospital and present it to Steve personally. This is for  him right now. We want him to know that the entire Congress thinks  about him every day, prays for him and his family, and we hope to get  him back here on the House floor as soon as possible.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment  to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole?   If not, the question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a  substitute, as amended.   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.  [[Page H5095]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
