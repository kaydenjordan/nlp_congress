 Mr. President, unfortunately, including this legislation  in the recently passed S. 2155 was not possible due to a number of  procedural objections that could not be overcome. However, it is our  understanding that the substance of our bill has the support of several  FHLBs, and we intend to work with our colleagues, the administration,  and FHFA to find sustainable ways for housing-focused entities such as  relevant captive insurance companies to participate in the FHLB system.                            ____________________
