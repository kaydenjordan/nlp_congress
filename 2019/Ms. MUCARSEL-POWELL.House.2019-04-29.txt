 Mr. Speaker, I have spent the last 2 weeks in my  district listening to constituents and healthcare providers share  stories about how our broken healthcare system is hurting south  Florida.   One thing is clear: high prescription drugs prices are hurting  families in my community and across America, which is why this week in  the Judiciary Committee we are voting on a bipartisan bill to lower  prescription drug prices.   I am all for supporting research and innovation, but we cannot allow  the pharmaceutical industry to delay and block more affordable, generic  medicines because it may hurt their profits. Lowering drug prices for  all Americans should be a bipartisan issue, and this is just one more  step in making our country healthier and helping Americans keep more of  their paycheck.   Let's help hardworking families get ahead.                            ____________________
