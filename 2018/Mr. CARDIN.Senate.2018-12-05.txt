 Mr. President, I rise to urge the majority leader to  bring to the floor S. 3649, the First Step Act, which I have  cosponsored. This bipartisan legislation, introduced by Senators  Grassley and Durbin, includes positive prison reforms that the House  passed by a 360-59 vote, combined with Senate-added provisions on  sentencing reform that have passed out of the Judiciary Committee on a  bipartisan basis.   Senators on both sides of the aisle agree that our criminal justice  system is broken and badly needs repair.   In my own State of Maryland, we know the importance of criminal  justice reform after the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore Police  Department custody in 2015. Baltimore is a good example of the  necessary Federal and State partnership we need in order to reform the  criminal justice system. When I am talking about the criminal justice  system, I am not only talking about the so-called back end of the  system, which involves sentencing, corrections, and release from  prison. I am talking about the ``front end'' of the system, which  involves relations between the community and police and often the first  interaction between our citizens and law enforcement.   In Baltimore, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated a Federal  ``pattern or practice'' inquiry at the request of the city of Baltimore  and the Federal congressional delegation. This investigation led to a  comprehensive report finding a pattern and practice of unconstitutional  arrests and policing in Baltimore that disproportionately affected  minority residents, particularly the African-American residents of  Baltimore.   Baltimore City and the Justice Department ultimately agreed to a  consent decree and are now under supervision by the U.S. District Court  for the District of Maryland. This will entail a multiyear process of  overhauling the police department to finally give the citizens of  Baltimore the police department they deserve, using the ``guardian''  and not the ``warrior'' model, as recommended by President Obama's Task  Force on 21st Century Policing.   This fall I visited the headquarters of the Baltimore Ravens in  Owings Mills, MD, in Baltimore County. I am a Baltimore resident and  live in Baltimore County and, of course, am a proud Ravens fan. On that  day, I had come to discuss criminal justice reform. I wanted to hear  directly from the Ravens players about their insights into the criminal  justice system, and they shared their stories involving their friends  and family with me.   I am pleased that several Ravens players and team executives wrote a  letter earlier this week to Senator McConnell asking him to bring this  critical legislation to the floor. The letter reads: ``The undersigned  players and executives of the Baltimore Ravens write to voice our  support for the First Step Act, a bill which has the potential to bring  transformative and much needed change to our criminal justice system.  Criminal justice is an issue that deeply affects our community in  Baltimore, as well as the nation as a whole. Not only will this  legislation strengthen our nation's criminal justice system, but it  enjoys the backing of an incredibly diverse group of supporters.''   Indeed, this legislation is endorsed by both law enforcement and  civil rights groups. Law enforcement groups endorsing this legislation  include the Fraternal Order of Police, the National District Attorneys  Association, and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement  Executives. Civil rights groups endorsing this legislation include the  ACLU and Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. President  Trump has endorsed this legislation, which has a growing number of  bipartisan Senate cosponsors.   The legislation includes key sentencing reform provisions added by  the Senate to the House-passed measure. First, it expands the so-called  safety valve, which allows judges to sentence below the mandatory  minimum for qualified low-level nonviolent drug offenders who cooperate  with the government. Second, it makes retroactive the application of  the Fair Sentencing Act, in which Congress addressed the crack-powder  sentencing disparity, and allows individuals affected by this disparity  to petition for sentence reductions. Third, it reforms the two-strikes  and three-strikes laws, by reducing the second strike mandatory minimum  of 20 years to 15 years and reducing the third strike mandatory minimum  of life in prison to 25 years. Finally, the legislation eliminates the  so-called stacking provision in the U.S. Code, which helps ensure that  sentencing enhancements for repeat offenses apply only to true repeat  offenders. The legislation clarifies that sentencing enhancements  cannot unfairly be ``stacked,'' for example, by applying to conduct  within the same indictment.   This legislation marks the first time that the Fraternal Order of  Police, the largest police union, has ever supported a criminal justice  reform bill. At law enforcement's request, the bill prohibits time  credits for individuals convicted of a fentanyl trafficking offense, as  well as bars time credits for individuals convicted of repeatedly  possessing or using a firearm in relation to a violent or drug  trafficking crime.   On the prison reform side. this legislation includes several positive  reforms from the House-passed FIRST STEP Act. The bill makes a good  time credit fix and revises the good-time credit law to accurately  reflect congressional intent by allowing prisoners to earn 54 days of  credit per year, rather than 47 days. The bill prohibits shackling  pregnant prisoners and requires healthcare products be provided to  incarcerated women. The bill requires prisoners be placed within 500  driving miles of their home and provides additional phone, video  conferencing, and visitation privileges. The bill expands evidence- based opioid and heroin abuse treatment for inmates. The bill expands  compassionate release under the Second Chance Act and expedites  compassionate release applications.   The revised Senate bill also includes several prison reforms beyond  what were included in the House-passed bill. The bill establishes an  Independent Review Committee of outside experts to assist in the  development of the risk and needs assessment system. The National  Institute of Justice would select a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization  with expertise in risk and needs assessments to host the IRC. This  added guardrail will help to ensure the risk and needs assessment  system is evidence-based and minimize racial disparities.   It allows the use of earned credits for supervised release in the  community, such as halfway houses or home confinement. The bill also  would permit individuals in home confinement to participate in family- related activities that facilitate the prisoner's successful reentry.   It effectively ends Federal juvenile solitary confinement, and limits  the discretion of the Bureau of Prisons to deny release to individuals  who meet all eligibility criteria.   Let us take this first step to reform our broken criminal justice  system by passing this legislation during this session.  [[Page S7315]]                                ____________________
