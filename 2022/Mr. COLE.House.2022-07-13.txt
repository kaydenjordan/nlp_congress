 Madam Speaker, I thank my very good friend, the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Morelle) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes,  and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today's rule covers several major items. The first  that I will discuss, H.R. 7900, the National Defense Authorization Act  for fiscal year 2023, is of the greatest importance to the Nation and  to the world.   For 61 years in a row the NDAA has become law. As I reminded my  colleagues in the Rules Committee yesterday, this record of achievement  has only been possible because of the immense cooperation from both  sides of the aisle and is a testament to what we can accomplish when we  focus on our shared goals as a Nation.   Working together, Democrats and Republicans on the Armed Services  Committee produced a bipartisan product. I applaud Chairman Smith,  Ranking Member Rogers, and all the members of the Armed Services  Committee for their efforts.   Madam Speaker, it is no secret that the world has become a more  dangerous place in recent years. Last year saw the Taliban--a corrupt  and militant organization known for supporting and providing sanctuary  to terrorists--complete its takeover of Afghanistan.   Earlier this year, the world was shocked by Vladimir Putin's brazen,  unprovoked, and indeed outright criminal invasion of Ukraine, Russia's  democratic neighbor to the west.   Communist China continues its history of aggression in Asia and the  Pacific Rim, including increasingly aggressive acts toward Taiwan.   North Korea has continued an aggressive posturing toward the United  States and our democratic allies in Asia.   Iran continues its long march toward becoming a nuclear state.   It is more important than ever that Congress speaks with one voice  when it comes to setting our national defense policy and funding  priorities each year so that we can ensure we counter aggressive actors  and offer our allies the support they need to protect themselves.   One of the most important things accomplished in this year's NDAA is  actually what it did not do. For the second year in a row, the Armed  Services Committee rejected President Biden's proposed defense budget  number and authorized a better, higher number to ensure that  our national defense is properly funded.    Indeed, President Biden's first two budget proposals looked set to  continue the chronic underfunding of the Obama-Biden years, during  which time our military readiness declined and our rivals on the  international stage were empowered.   The increased funding in this bill will go a long way toward ensuring  that America's military is ready to confront any challenge. It will  ensure that our armed services personnel receive a 4.6 percent pay  raise, the largest in history, with additional pay bonuses to personnel  who make the least to offset the inflation caused by this  administration's policies.   On the whole, I am proud to support this legislation and I encourage  the entire House to support this measure and send it on to the Senate.   Madam Speaker, our second item in the House is S. 3373, the Honoring  our PACT Act. While this bill has gone through a frustratingly long  process to get to this point, I believe we have failed to provide our  Nation's toxic-exposed veterans with the care that they need for far  too long.   I will be the first to admit that this bill is not perfect. I share  the concerns of many about the use of mandatory spending in this bill.  Given the importance of this issue to veterans nationwide, and to those  in my district, I cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  Imperfect though it is, this bill does take important strides forward,  and I plan to support it on final passage.   Unfortunately, two other bills contained in this rule are partisan  and stand no chance of becoming law. The Democratic majority is  attempting to insert a right to an abortion into Federal law,  preempting every State law that seeks to protect life.   They want to require all States to permit abortion on demand at any  time up to the point of birth. They want to outlaw commonsense  restrictions, like  [[Page H5986]]  preventing late-term abortions, preventing sex-selective abortions, and  preventing abortions targeting fetuses with Down syndrome.   They want to prevent States from adopting commonsense protections for  the unborn, such as banning mail-order and telemedicine abortion  services. They want to limit the rights of parents by creating a cause  of action for outsiders to interfere with the parent-child  relationship. That would be an unconscionable state of affairs, Madam  Speaker.   I remind my colleagues of the words of the Declaration of  Independence: that the right to life is one of those inalienable rights  endowed upon us all, including unborn children, by our Creator.   I will always stand strongly in favor of defending life, and I  proudly stand in opposition to these bills today.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1100     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up H. Res. 11 for immediate  consideration. This resolution proposes an amendment to the  Constitution of the United States to require that the Supreme Court of  the United States be composed of nine Justices.   Madam Speaker, the Supreme Court has been set at nine Justices for  153 years. Fundamentally changing the composition of the Court to  satisfy the demands of one political party would permanently erode the  independence of the judicial branch and forever alter the separation of  powers, which is the very foundation our Constitution and our Nation  were built upon.    The independence of the judicial branch is too sacred to subject it  to the political issue of the day. The appointment of a Supreme Court  Justice is not a popularity contest, and the Court's decisions should  not be based on polls. The Supreme Court's duty is to the Constitution  and ensuring that adherence to the laws of the land.   To further explain the amendment, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), who is my very good friend and the  author of the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H5988]]    Madam Speaker, as has become all too common with the Democratic  majority, when the status quo doesn't lead to the outcome they want,  they simply change the rules to suit their needs.   You need to only look at the last 2 years for evidence: fundamentally  changing the way the House operates through the use of proxy voting; a  complete lockdown of alternative ideas; fewer and fewer committees  doing the work to make the law rather than score political points--all  aimed at protecting their razor-thin majority at the expense of the  institution and the Nation.   Democrats' current obsession with the Supreme Court is no different,  but instead of accepting the independence of the judiciary, the  majority is, instead, intent on fixing the rules of the game to ensure  their own victory. This amendment to the Constitution would prevent  that from happening and would ensure, once and for all, that the  Supreme Court will be independent and free of meddling based on the  political ideas of the day.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with the extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous  question, and I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr.  Armstrong), my very good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), my very good friend and a distinguished member of  the Rules Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice), my very good friend and a member of the House  Armed Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for the time, and frankly, for the  thoughtful and wide-ranging debate. It is not a surprise that a rule  that covers five very different pieces of legislation would provoke  that kind of discussion.   I want to begin in the areas we agree. There are actually three areas  in this bill that I will be voting for. Most importantly, quite  frankly, is the National Defense Authorization Act.   There is going to be some opposition to that. It was a give-and-take  bill, but I remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that it  actually came out of committee on a 57 to 1 vote; 57 to 1. That says a  lot of wonderful things about the leadership of Chairman Smith and  Ranking Member Rogers on that committee and its ability, after  considering over 600 or 700 amendments itself, to find common ground  and move forward.   For my colleagues that vote no, that is fine. Again, there is always  something in a bill this size you can find to disagree with, but I will  remind my friends on my side of the aisle that every single Republican  on the committee voted for the bill. So I think it is going to pass and  pass quite easily.   I also want to associate myself with my friend's support of the toxic  burn pit bill. It is a bill that I have some serious problems with,  such as the manner in which it was funded and some of the procedures by  which it moved, but it is a much better bill than we have seen before.  It is a step in the right direction.   There is no question my friend is correct when he talks about our  obligation as a Congress to look after the men and women who have put  their lives on the line for us and suffered egregious harm.   I hope we can do better in the future. I hope we can even revisit  some of the financing measures here, but it is important that it get  done and that it passes, and I look forward to working with my friend  to do that.   I agree with him on the AMBER Alert bill as well, and I will be  supporting it. There are some concerns on my side of the aisle about  that, and I understand those concerns. Again, I think this is a  commonsense measure.   The area that I will not be able to join my friend on does deal with  the fundamental protection of human life and the effort of this body to  pass legislation that it knows will go nowhere in the Senate simply to  make a point.   We ought to be working to find common ground, not to dig down the  divisions that we have even more deeply. So I will oppose the rule  partly because I oppose some of the measures in the rule; also, because  I certainly would like the previous question to be considered.   I thought both of my friends from North and South Dakota made some  excellent points on the need to codify the number nine or at least have  a discussion about that in this body, and obviously, if we defeat the  previous question, we intend to do that.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question, ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
