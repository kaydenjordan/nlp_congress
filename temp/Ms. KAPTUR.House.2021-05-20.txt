 Madam Speaker, the criminal invasion of the U.S. Capitol  on January 6th created an unprecedented test for liberty lovers to  respond and protect democracy for generations to come.   We owe it to our law enforcement community, and indeed everyone who  works in or visits our Capitol, to respond with means to recover and  rebuild from the insurrection,   The U.S. Capitol holds national and international significance as the  temple of liberty and representational democracy. The invaders, many in  paramilitary attire more modern and protective than what our own  officers were provided, exposed gaps and weaknesses at the highest  levels. Our failure to act now only invites our greatest adversaries an  open door to further harm.   We continue to mourn the officers we lost, those who were physically  injured, and the countless who continue to suffer from mental and  emotional distress. Let us act in their honor.   Through Chairwoman DeLauro's leadership, the Appropriations Committee  held extensive hearings and conversations with security experts,  gathering critical recommendations to address the immediate security  needs.   As such, this bill provides $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations  to:   Provide funds to repair the physical wounds to the Capitol Complex  and build back with stronger security enhancements.   It invests in means to protect Members of Congress, congressional  staff, and visitors following the recommendations of the Capitol  Security Review.   It provides resources to the United States Capitol Police for officer  salaries, equipment, training, and mental health counseling.   And provides resources for enhanced security for Members of Congress.   Today, Congress must provide confidence to our Capitol Hill community  that the safety and security of all who work within and visit the  temple of liberty remains a top priority. I encourage all my colleagues  to support this important legislation.
