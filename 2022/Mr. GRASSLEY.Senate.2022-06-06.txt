 Madam President, Congress has a constitutional  responsibility to ensure that the executive branch executes the laws  and uses taxpayer money that has been appropriated to do it according  to congressional intent. Now, around here, we refer to seeing that the  laws are faithfully executed as the constitutional responsibility of  oversight of the Congress of the United States. In furtherance of that  constitutional responsibility, Congress has an obligation to  investigate the executive branch for fraud, waste, abuse, and gross  mismanagement. I take my constitutional responsibilities of oversight  very seriously.   From time to time, I receive information that requires me to ask  questions of the executive branch in efforts to better understand  whether any wrongdoing has occurred and, if so, what remedial actions  will be taken and employed to cure the damage done. That is what brings  me to the floor of the Senate today, focusing on Assistant Special  Agent in Charge Timothy Thibault at the FBI's Washington Field Office.   Last week, while I was meeting with my constituents in Iowa, I sent a  letter to the Justice Department and the FBI and also a letter to the  Department of Justice's inspector general. In those letters, I provided  evidence of extreme leftwing bias shown by Special Agent Thibault. Now,  in his position, he is a very powerful agent within the FBI--so  powerful that he can open and close Federal public corruption cases and  investigations. He is a shining example, at the same time, of what is  wrong with the FBI.   Andrew McCarthy wrote about Mr. Thibault last week and wondered what  the heck has happened with the FBI. This FBI agent's leftwing political  bias was exposed by his very own LinkedIn and Twitter accounts. There,  in those accounts, he posted highly partisan material related to his  superiors, matters under the FBI's purview, and matters under his own  purview. His LinkedIn network includes current and former FBI  personnel. The general public is able to review his social media  content, which includes his political views, his political biases, and  objections.   Thibault, under the title of Assistant Special Agent in Charge,  directly posted a partisan article related to the LTG Michael Flynn  case to his LinkedIn account. The article was a September 3, 2020,  opinion piece from the Washington Post, entitled ``Why the Michael  Flynn case still matters,'' which was about the ``Trump  administration's abuses of the justice system.'' He also ``liked''  other politically charged articles relating to then-President Trump and  his superior, then-Attorney General Barr.   Thibault's public political association doesn't even end with those  examples.   According to his Twitter feed, which is also under his name, he  mocked the election of one of our new colleagues, Senator Tuberville,  and the State of Mississippi at the same time.   He said:         Thank God for Mississippi--state motto of Alabama.    I am not sure exactly what that means, but it is pretty clear that he  is making fun.  [[Page S2775]]    When Representative Liz Cheney tweeted ``Dick Cheney says wear a  mask,'' Thibault replied with this:         Your dad was a disgrace.    He recently tweeted:         Can we give Kentucky to the Russian Federation?    In response to a Catholic priest's tweet that was critical of  abortion, he tweeted an anti-Catholic slur to both Catholic priests and  then-President Trump:         Focus on the pedophiles.    There are other examples, but I think it is pretty clear you get the  bias of this particular special agent. You get the picture, in other  words.   After my letters were made public, he reportedly then set his tweets  to protected mode and deleted his LinkedIn profile. His social media  activity likely violated several Federal regulations and Department  guidelines. The guidelines are designed to prevent political bias from  infecting FBI matters. Such restrictions on political activity are  heightened by senior FBI officials like Thibault because of the risk of  improper influence on investigative matters.   If he projects this type of political sentiment in public, using his  name and title, there is absolutely no telling what he is doing within  the privacy of his office and in front of subordinates.   The fact that this FBI agent has the power to open and close  investigations, particularly into political figures--Republican and/or  Democrat--is cause for serious concern. His actions present a grave  risk of political infection and bias in his official decision-making  process.   Let me ask: What have the Justice Department and FBI done to oversee  his work behavior?   Let me ask: How many investigations have been infected by this  political bias by this special agent?   I fear, for many years, he has been able to do whatever he has wanted  to do. Accordingly, such conduct unquestionably undermines both the  Justice Department and the FBI because, at a minimum, it creates the  perception of the unequal application of the law. At the maximum, his  political bias has materially affected investigative matters that he  has been a part of.   This is why the American people have lost confidence in the Justice  Department and the FBI to do the jobs that those two Agencies are  assigned to do under our law. Political considerations have infected  these Agencies, and the cost is a loss of faith in the very  institutions that depend on the American people's trust for the  credibility of these Agencies.   My press release last week listed a phone number and an email address  for the Justice Department and FBI whistleblowers to contact my office  if they know some of these similar things that we need to know. Since  then, I have had whistleblowers reach out to me about Thibault and  others. I will have more to say on that matter, in the coming weeks, to  my colleagues here in the Senate.   I urge anyone who is willing to speak to government waste, fraud,  abuse, and gross mismanagement to contact me. And, of course, I  strongly urge the Justice Department and the FBI to clean house without  hesitation.    Transparency brings accountability, and my future investigative  actions in this space will do exactly that. I am asking my colleagues  to stay tuned.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
