 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. It is an honor to be here with you.   I think by this time most people are familiar, at least they have  heard about the Johnson amendment. It came about in 1954, when Lyndon  Johnson barely won a race for Senate because many people thought he was  soft on communism. So one of the first things he did when he got here  was, behind closed doors, without any vetting, without any debate, had  inserted into the IRS Code a statement that basically says that  nonprofits cannot address political issues, or they could potentially  lose their tax-exempt status.   That now, for 60 years-plus, has become a target for pastors, for  churches, for nonprofits using tax-exempt status as leverage to prevent  them from speaking, addressing political issues. It is political  correctness at its worst.   When our government becomes the gatekeeper of free speech, then we  actually have no free speech at all. And in this process, they also are  influencing what religious institutions can and cannot be.   Our Founders believed that our country should not establish a State  church. They also believe that government should not dictate the  religious practices of its citizens, or abridge the free speech of  Houses of worship. That is what is taking place.   As a result of this, my good friend, Whip Steve Scalise, and I  introduced H.R. 781, the Free Speech Fairness Act, which creates a  carve-out for 501(c)(3) organizations to address political discourse as  long as it is within the normal course of business with de minimis  associated expenses. I am pleased that the President has also been  extremely vocal on this issue, but we really need this codified because  the unfairness must stop.   I know our time is running short, but I urge our colleagues to  support this, and I deeply appreciate the gentleman providing me the  opportunity to speak on this Johnson amendment.
