 Madam Speaker, in 2016, our nation's premier  law enforcement agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, weaponized  its authority to illegally surveil a U.S. citizen for political  purposes.   What happened to Carter Page, then-candidate Trump, and the Trump  campaign was wrong, and it is our responsibility to ensure it never  happens again. The USA Freedom Reauthorization Act achieves that, but  our work is far from done.   While this bill doesn't include every reform sought by Republicans,  it does accomplish our central goal: To institute necessary safeguards  to protect the civil liberties of every American and reauthorize  critical counterterrorism provisions.   This bipartisan legislation also protects U.S. citizens from being  spied on for political purposes by requiring that the Attorney General  approve any investigation of an elected official or federal candidate.  This provision directly addresses the abuses against Carter Page and  the Trump campaign.   Some have claimed that provision prioritizes politicians over  Americans. It does not. That provision addresses the real abuse  documented by House Republicans and the DOJ Inspector General--abuse  that strikes at the core of our democratic republic.   In addition to multiple other reforms, this legislation makes it a  crime to willfully make a false statement to the court, and increases  penalties for those who abuse the system. These provisions are aimed  like a laser at the abuses that occurred in 2016 and 2017.   Madam Speaker, Congress must continue to conduct vigorous oversight  and work with our law enforcement and intelligence communities to  restore the American people's trust in these critical institutions.   Our government's primary duty is to protect its citizens and their  constitutional rights, and every American should have confidence we're  fulfilling that role.   I urge my colleagues to support this vitally important legislation.
