 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment within  the en bloc amendments as a step to protect the Great Lakes.   Ontario Power Generation, a Canadian energy company, has proposed to  build an underground nuclear waste facility along the shores of Lake  Huron, which borders my district.   Their plan is nothing short of irresponsible. Any failure at this  site would have devastating impacts on Michigan and Canada, which rely  on the Great Lakes for drinking water, tourism, and commerce.   Canada and OPG have displayed intransigence in the face of the near  universal objection of my constituents, and many of the residents of  the Great Lakes region. My amendment serves to further highlight to the  Canadian Government the gravity of this issue.                                time  1515    The International Joint Commission was developed to resolve  binational water disputes between the United States and Canada, yet  they have not addressed this critical risk to the Great Lakes. My  amendment would prohibit staff from attending or participating in an  annual Canadian water resources conference, ironically, titled, ``Our  Common Water Future.''   Prohibiting staff from attending this conference does not  substantially relate to the IJC's core mission of protecting shared  waters, but it sends an important message to our neighbors in Canada.  It is time for the Canadian Government to take our concerns seriously  regarding this potential threat to our precious Great Lakes.
