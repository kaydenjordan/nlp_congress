 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I cannot  in good faith support a nominee who has a lengthy track record of  tweets attacking both prominent Democratic women and prominent  Republican women. Since his nomination, these tweets have continued,  showing a complete disregard for the Senate confirmation process and a  disregard for the seriousness of the position for which he has been  nominated.   At the same time, Mr. Grenell has been dismissive of the importance  of the threat Russia poses to U.S. democracy, and we certainly need to  have U.S. Ambassadors who can work with our European allies and  partners, now more than ever, to reinforce the strength of the  institutions we have built to protect the rule of law and democracy and  to defend our western democracies against Russian interference.   So with that, I object.
