 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr., and his life of service to our Nation.   Next week, on January 20, we will observe Martin Luther King's  birthday. We know that Dr. King was the most influential civil rights  leader in our Nation's history among so many great civil rights  leaders, such as our own Congressman   John Lewis.   Dr. King's commitment to public service brought historic change to  our Nation, affected our entire country and society, and reshaped the  way we interact. So it is fitting that we observe the 25th anniversary  of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day as ``A Day On, Not a Day Off.''   It serves to remind us to ask ourselves: What are we doing for  others? Dr. King called this ``life's most persistent and urgent  question.'' What are we doing for others in our country?   As a public servant for the past 40 years, I firmly believe that  every individual has an ability and an opportunity to make a change.  Communities across the United States will host events to commemorate  Dr. King's achievements and give back to the community, including in my  own district in the San Joaquin Valley.    I will proudly participate in the Martin Luther King Day Community  March in Fresno and Merced, as well. My office will join the city of  Fresno at an awards ceremony to recognize individuals and organizations  for their outstanding service to give back to our communities in the  spirit of Dr. King.   I urge all Americans to find ways to help others in communities on  Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday. You can find those options at  NationalService.gov, a way for us all to give back. Because in the  words of Dr. King: ``The time is always right to do what is right.''     Recognizing National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today also to recognize National  Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month to raise awareness about  this atrocity that plagues our Nation and the world.   There are estimated to be more than 40 million victims of trafficking  across the planet. It happens in all of our communities here, and  because of the geographic location that I represent in California's San  Joaquin Valley, my district sees a disproportionately high amount of  human trafficking.   The fighting of this atrocity requires all of us to be involved, and  we must do more. Every year, I work hard to secure additional funding  for the Crime Victims Fund and to strengthen our efforts to stop human  trafficking.   We were successful in getting an additional $2 billion to support  investigations and operations to prevent human trafficking and another  $2.6 billion to improve services for these victims in the spending bill  that passed just last month. This helps organizations like Breaking the  Chains in Fresno, which is crucial to survivors.   We must understand that these trafficking victims are just that; they  are victims of crime. We also need to bolster our efforts to prevent  this from continuing to occur, from supporting law enforcement efforts  to holding perpetrators accountable to educating our children about the  dangers, especially in this day and age, when the internet, sadly, is  oftentimes a tool for traffickers.   It is estimated that less than 1 percent of the survivors of human  trafficking cases are identified. That is an astounding number, I  think: less than 1 percent of the survivors of human trafficking are  actually identified.   Last year, as co-chairs of the bipartisan Crime Survivors and Justice  Caucus, which I helped found with Congressman Ted Poe, Congressman Pete  Olson and I introduced a resolution in the House to prevent, eradicate,  and raise the awareness of human trafficking as today's modern slavery.  It calls for the Federal Government to coordinate efforts to fight  human trafficking between agencies and with State and local governments  and other organizations that are out there trying their best.   Just yesterday, I met with John Cotton Richmond, the State  Department's Ambassador-at-Large to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in  Persons, both here and abroad, to discuss how we can work together to  fight this injustice.   I promise you, we must fight this injustice. As a member and a co- chair of the Victims' Rights Caucus, for survivors of these kinds of  crimes, we will continue to put this among our highest priorities. The  Crime Survivors and Justice Caucus will continue to lead this  bipartisan fight to end modern slavery and human trafficking in all its  forms.                            ____________________
