 If I might say, the Senator was absolutely right. He was  central in putting that together.   Unfortunately, it passed here; would have passed the House. They had  enough votes--enough votes, Republicans and Democrats. But the then- Speaker said he couldn't bring it up because it didn't have a majority  of his party and it would violate the sacred Dennis Hastert rule. I  don't think they follow that rule after former-Speaker Hastert went to  jail.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to finish my statement prior to the vote.    Mr. President, the horrors we have witnessed in the weeks  and months following Vladimir Putin's unprovoked attack on Ukraine are  an abomination and an affront to all civilized people--entire  communities wiped from the face of the earth; countless lives ruined;  unarmed civilians summarily executed randomly in the street; millions  of desperate people fleeing everything they have ever known because of  one man's zeal to destroy whatever is necessary to realize his own  twisted vision of the world--all of this while fueling a broader  humanitarian crisis across the region, spiraling costs, and sparking a  global hunger crisis.   The need is clear for this Congress to act decisively and to act now  to reaffirm our unwavering support for the Ukrainian people in  protecting their lives and their country and to stem this global  crisis. The United States stands against the atrocities inflicted upon  the free people of Ukraine, an independent country with a  democratically elected government.   Last Tuesday, the House passed H.R. 7691, providing more than $40  billion in emergency funding, with overwhelming bipartisan support. The  Senate should have done the same, sending this bill to the President so  that he could immediately execute on it and get this much-needed aid  into Ukrainian hands. Unfortunately, one Member has decided to slow  this process down. One Member has caused needless delay. In a few  moments, we will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to  H.R. 7691. Because of Senator Paul's objection, we must go through this  step just to bring up the bill for debate. I urge everyone to vote yes.  And I would urge the Senator from Kentucky to reconsider his objections  and help us move quickly to get this bill to the President.   This emergency bill provides $40.1 billion--$7.1 billion more than  the administration requested--in critical military and humanitarian  assistance for Ukraine, to help defend democracy abroad and to address  the rising, global hunger crisis that the world is facing in large part  due to Russia's aggression.   This includes $8.5 billion in additional Presidential drawdown  authority for critical weapons transfers and $6 billion for the Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative. This will allow us to continue to  supply the Ukrainians with the tools they need to defend themselves,  their country, and their freedom. The urgent need for these resources  cannot be overstated. As we stand here today, the administration is  raising the alarm that if we do not act, the resources we provided in  March--which have been critical to Ukraine's success on the  battlefield--will be exhausted in a matter of days.   It includes more than $8.5 billion for the economic support fund to  respond to emerging needs in the country and ensure the continuing  operation of the government. It provides needed resources for temporary  housing, medical care, food, and other basic services for Ukrainian's  displaced in their own country and refugees fleeing the violence and  devastation Vladimir Putin has inflicted on them and their communities.   The humanitarian crisis instigated at the hands of Vladimir Putin is  not limited to within Ukraine's borders or even within the borders of  Eastern Europe. It has triggered a global hunger crisis. Last year,  before Putin's war, Ukraine grew enough food to feed 400 million  people. Today, Ukraine cannot even feed its own people. As David  Beasley, the Executive Director of the UN World Food Programme--WFP-- testified before the Appropriations Committee last week, war has forced  Ukraine from being a global bread basket to being on the bread lines.   Tens of millions of tons of wheat, barley, maize, vegetable oil, and  other Ukrainian produce are currently locked in warehouses and  languishing in ports occupied by Russian forces. If the ports are not  opened, this food will either be stolen or go to waste, leading to  skyrocketing prices and regional shortages. The WFP estimates that this  will have a ripple effect, increasing the number facing acute hunger by  47 million. This would bring the estimated global total to 323 million  people suffering from acute hunger in the 81 countries WFP operates in  alone.   It is important to remember that hunger is not a moment in time; it  has lasting consequences for families, communities, and whole  societies. This is why we cannot wait to act on this crisis. As noted  in one recent Washington Post editorial; preventing a looming, global  famine is ``as urgent and morally necessary as sending tanks to  Ukraine.''   This bill provides over $5 billion for global food aid. If those  funds are programmed quickly, they will save millions of lives.   Vladimir Putin's war is exacerbating a global crisis of food  insecurity already set in motion by the COVID pandemic and successive  years of severe drought in Africa. I am extremely disappointed that  this bill does not include new resources to address the ongoing COVID  pandemic.   Last week, we passed the grim toll of 1 million recorded COVID deaths  in our country and estimates as high as 20 million deaths worldwide. If  we fail to prepare for anticipated surges in the fall and winter, as  immunity from existing vaccines wanes and the virus continues to  mutate, the death toll will rise, potentially exponentially.  [[Page S2515]]    For months--for months--the administration has warned that we do not  have the necessary vaccines, therapeutics, tests, and other resources  to stay ahead of this virus. We do not have enough funding to purchase  new shots for everybody in the fall, and we already will be forced to  ration the next generation of vaccines--more suited to variants like  Omicron--to only those at the highest risk.   This is not a problem that can be solved by flipping a switch. We  cannot just say that we will appropriate the money later in the fall if  it is needed. In order to produce the tens of millions of doses of  vaccine that will be necessary, biotech companies need to begin to  purchase supplies and start production before July. This means we only  have weeks to provide the funding to secure these shots in time.   The same can be said of our testing capacity. Unless we act, domestic  manufacturing will continue to shut down, shifting production to  countries like China. This will leave us flat-footed once again should  another COVID variant wave crash over our country in the fall.   The virus traveled to this country from abroad, and that is where new  variants have also originated. The U.S. Agency for International  Development, which manages our global response to the COVID pandemic,  has obligated 95 percent of the funds they have available. They are  running on fumes, and they will have no choice but to start shutting  down their vaccine delivery operations if additional funds are not  forthcoming soon. That means more mutations, more variants, more  infections, and more death.   It is extremely frustrating that, time and again, Members on the  other side of the aisle have pushed this responsibility off. We are out  of time. We cannot defeat this virus with complacency or by burying our  heads in the sand. It remains a global health emergency. According to  the experts, it is entirely possible that we have not seen the worst  yet. As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will  continue to fight for these urgently needed resources in the coming  weeks.   However, the people of Ukraine and the millions facing acute food  insecurity require the funds in this bill today, and I strongly urge  the Senate to pass it without further delay.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
