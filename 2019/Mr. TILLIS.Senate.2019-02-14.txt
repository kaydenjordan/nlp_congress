 Mr. President, I come to the floor with a heavy heart  today. A colleague in the House passed away, and right at this very  moment, down in Greenville, NC, we have a number of Congressmen and  friends and family members congregated to celebrate the life and mourn  the death of Congressman Jones.   Congressman Jones served in Congress for over 24 years. His dad  served before that. Between the two of them, the Jones family has  represented the eastern portion of North Carolina for 50 out of the  last 53 years.   Now, Congressman Jones was somebody who was a bit of a maverick and a  bit of an independent spirit on the House side, and we didn't agree on  certain measures. But I never doubted his sincerity and his heart and  his commitment to North Carolina and to this great Nation.   He is survived by his wife Joe Anne of over 50 years. In fact, they  were married in 1966.  [[Page S1356]]    He has a number of people in the statehouse who served with him, in a  chamber where I was speaker of the house. They are mourning his death  today. I couldn't be there in person because we have to be here for the  votes that we are taking up this afternoon, but I wanted the Jones  family to know, and all the people in Eastern North Carolina, how much  I cared for and loved Walter Jones.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one of the reasons why I continue to be  here in Washington rather than visiting with family and friends of  Congressman Jones is that we have a very important vote that we expect  the Senate to take up here sometime this afternoon.   It is a vote that is borne out of compromise. To quote Winston  Churchill--I think it was--it is the worst possible option except for  all the other options considered up to this point.   It is not perfect, but it is important that we get the votes and that  we encourage the President to sign this bill into law.   Now, I walked through the hallway this morning, and I had the press  come up to me. Some in the press probably want to report honestly, but  others want to create a narrative.   So the latest narrative is this: Senator, how do you feel about a  bill that just got published last night--1,200 pages--and you are going  to be asked to vote on it today?   I told them, specifically, because I have been following this measure  since the last Congress. I said: Are you referring to the almost-1,200- page bill, of which all but 41 pages were matters that were taken up in  the Appropriations Committee, voted out of committee unanimously in all  but one case and with 26 votes in the other case? Are you referring to  that bill?   If the Senators are doing their job and the Congressmen are doing  their job, they read that months ago when they were passed out of the  Appropriations Committee. Most of this is not new information. About 41  pages of it relates to the compromise that ultimately--because we  couldn't get a compromise back in December--resulted in the government  shutdown.   It absolutely funds some of the President's priorities for border  security. There are people that get caught up on either end of the  spectrum. It reminds me of how my kids used to fight in the back of the  minivan when we used to take them on vacations. It is a childish  argument: It is a wall.   No, it is not.   It is a wall.   No, it is not.   Look, it is steps taken forward in a positive way for border  security. It is a structure that makes sense. It is technology. It is  personnel. It is what we need to ultimately secure the border.   Some people can call it a wall because you could argue that in total  it is. Other people could say it is not a wall. I don't care as long as  you ultimately recognize that voting for this measure and sending the  signal to the President that we have his back, that we understand his  priorities, and that we will continue to work on other measures on a  bipartisan basis makes sense.   So I intend to support it today. It is not a vote that I am going to  enjoy, but sometimes we have to do things here to make progress, to  compromise, and to move on. We owe it to the American people to keep  the government open. We owe it to border security to listen to their  recommendations to fund people, technology, and infrastructure. This is  a step in the right direction.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it was a year ago today that I was  presiding and something occurred to me. One is that in the 12 years  that I have been in public service, I have virtually spent none of  those Valentine's Days at home. Last year, I was thinking about how I  messed up. I didn't even order flowers or do the things that I would  normally do, although, I usually get flowers on Valentine's Day.   But then I started contemplating the Senate rules, and I know that  there are a number of, well, things you just can't do on the floor.   I determined, for example, that you can't do an ad hoc prop and say  something because it would be a violation of the rules. So although I  thought about putting this heart up and presenting this and saying, ``I  love my wife Susan Tillis of 32 years,'' I am not going to do that  because I think it would be a violation of the rules.   But in the event that someday we do change the rules and we are able  to come to the floor and express our love for our spouses and people  who sacrifice as much as we do, I hope someday to be able to give that  speech on the Senate floor.   I yield the floor.
