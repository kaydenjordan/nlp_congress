 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the disaster at  our southern border and how it is affecting our children.   This afternoon, I want to read a letter on the House floor from a  young constituent of mine, Mitch, an 11-year-old from San Tan Valley,  Arizona, and he had this to say: ``Dr. Gosar, we moved to San Tan  Valley a couple of years ago from Flagstaff. I am 11 years old and, I  want to let you know how illegal immigration is affecting me.   ``My classes are overcrowded. The teachers have to spend more time on  other children to make sure they are able to take the State-mandated  tests. This is taking time away from my education. Yes, they need to be  educated if they are here; however, why should I lose instructional  time because of the laws?''  [[Page H5198]]    He goes on further to say: ``Do you know what is being done to help  with smaller class sizes? Where are we with border control?   ``My education is important to me. I want to be successful in life.  The tensions are high at my school because of the illegal immigrants.  This is how racism is perpetuated, not prevented.   ``I will be going to a private charter this fall; however, I am still  concerned because my future wife may not be so lucky to escape this  problem. My friends are not all able to switch schools.   ``This is not the way it should be. Please hear me. I hope that you  can offer guidance. No one knows what the answer is.''   This is how it is affecting students, and I submit, it is a sad state  of affairs in southern Arizona.                            ____________________
