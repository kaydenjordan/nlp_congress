 Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that  I honor the life of Mississippi native, William David Martin. A  paramedic with American Medical Response, David served his community  during the coronavirus pandemic until he passed away due to  complications of COVID-19 on April 22, 2020. His dedication to his  patients and community represents the best of Mississippi, and I send  my deepest sympathies to his family and friends.   Mr. Martin was born in 1967 in McComb, MS, to Joyce F. Martin and the  late Billy B. Martin. Mr. Martin was a national registered paramedic  with American Medical Response of Southwest Mississippi and worked as a  paramedic in Natchez and Gulfport. Throughout his career, Mr. Martin  served on the frontlines of Mississippi healthcare, helping care for  patients during emergencies and times of great need. When COVID-19  began to spread in the United States, Mr. Martin answered the call and  continued to serve and protect his community from this dangerous new  virus. Mr. Martin will be known as a hero not only in Mississippi but  throughout our Nation. As a symbol of his dedication to his team of  paramedics, his coworkers from AMR Southwest Mississippi served as the  pallbearers at his funeral.   Mississippi and our Nation have been well-served by the diligence,  sacrifice and love provided on a daily basis by paramedics like David  Martin. His big heart and dedication to his community will be greatly  missed. I offer my condolences and prayers for Mr. Martin's children,  his fiance; and members of his family. I also pray that God will  protect his coworkers at AMR and all paramedics in Mississippi, who are  still working tirelessly to protect our loved ones throughout this  pandemic. They, like so many of our healthcare workers on the  frontlines, deserve our support and appreciation during this  time.                            ____________________
