 Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my friend from  Oklahoma for his leadership on the NDAA. I think that record of 59  years of getting the bill passed is one I am envious of.   I wanted, personally, to thank him for his willingness to put into  the original managers' package the intel authorization bill, which I  know sometimes has controversy to it, and I am grateful for the chance  for it to ride along on the NDAA.   I thank him for his leadership on this issue.                              Election Security    Mr. President, I am here today because I fear the Senate is about to  fail once again to protect our elections from foreign interference.   For the last 3 years, I worked as vice chairman of the Intel  Committee to investigate Russia's attack on our democracy in 2016. I am  proud of the fact that, with all the controversy about this subject  matter, we are the only bipartisan investigation of Russian election  interference to make it to the finish line.   The fifth volume of our report is at the ODNI right now for  declassification. Any member of the public can read the first four  volumes of declassified conclusions, and any Member of this body can  read additional classified materials.   Our report offers a stark warning of Russia's intent to interfere in  future U.S. elections and a clear roadmap for how to defend our  democracy from  [[Page S3993]]  Russia or any other adversaries copying their playbook.   Unfortunately, the White House and the leadership on the majority  side of the Senate seem to be the only ones not taking this threat  seriously.   Since 2016, this body has failed to vote on a single piece of stand- alone election security legislation. Four times in the last year, I  have come to the floor in an attempt to pass my bipartisan election  security legislation, known as the FIRE Act, by unanimous consent, and  each time these efforts were blocked by my Republican colleagues.   Of course, when they blocked it, they got what they were looking for.  They earned applause from the President on Twitter. In a different time  with a different President, this bill wouldn't be controversial at all.  It would simply say to all Presidential campaigns going forward that if  a foreign power reaches out to their campaign offering assistance or  offering dirt on a political opponent, the appropriate response is not  to say, thank-you; the appropriate response is to call the FBI.   What a sad statement about partisan politics in our country when we  can't even agree on that. We can't even agree that there ought to be a  duty to report an offer of foreign assistance in a Presidential  campaign.   I introduced this legislation months before the facts came to light  about the President's pressuring Ukraine into announcing politically  motivated investigations into the Bidens. I am not here to rehash the  impeachment trial, but I do want to note one thing. A number of my  Republican colleagues justified their vote by saying that, while not  impeachable, it was wrong for the President to solicit foreign  interference in our elections.   I take my colleagues across the aisle at their word that they believe  foreign interference has no place in our elections, but at some point  you have to put your money where your mouth is.   We know the President tried to trade election favors with Ukraine.  According to the new book from John Bolton, the President tried to  trade political favors with Xi Jinping during trade negotiations. Maybe  that happened; maybe it didn't. But I would be much more inclined to  give the President the benefit of the doubt if he hadn't asked China to  investigate the Bidens on national television, if he hadn't asked  Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails during the 2016 campaign, or if  he had shown even a shred of interest in defending our democracy from  foreign interference over the last 4 years.   We are under attack from adversaries who see this new area of cyber  warfare and disinformation as a golden opportunity to undermine  American democracy. We cannot afford to have a system that allows  Presidential candidates to welcome this interference with open arms. If  we can't trust the President of the United States and his campaign to  do the right thing and report foreign interference, then we need to  require it by law.   I spent over a year inviting my colleagues across the aisle to work  with us on this already--and I point out ``already''--bipartisan  legislation. I have tried to answer every objection and work through  the right channels to get this legislation to the floor as part of the  NDAA. What did we do? We went back to the Intelligence Committee-- again, the only committee engaged in a serious effort to prevent  foreign election interference. We made sure this year's intel  authorization bill included several provisions to strengthen our  defenses ahead of the November elections. The committee voted 14 to 1  to pass an intel authorization bill that included the FIRE Act, the act  that I just described, so that if a foreign government interferes or  offers you assistance or offers you dirt, you don't say thanks; you  call the FBI. So you can imagine my surprise and frustration when I  learned of a backroom deal to strip the FIRE Act out of the  Intelligence Committee's legislation because of a supposed turf war  with another committee.    I am back again today because the security of our elections cannot  wait. Let's not hide behind process or jurisdictional boundaries. The  stakes are far too high to continue the partisan blockade of election  security legislation that we have seen over the last 3 years.   If, behind closed doors, my Republican colleagues want to strip this  legislation out of the NDAA, then I am going to offer it up as an  amendment to force an up-or-down vote and put every Member of this body  on the record: Are you for election security or are you for allowing  foreign entities to interfere and offer assistance with no requirement  to report?   More than ever, it is time to put country over party and defend our  democracy from those who would do it harm. I encourage my colleagues to  support this amendment and send a clear message: Foreign interference  has no place in our elections.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I thank, first of all, as I see him leave  the floor, the Senator from Illinois, for his very strong statement. I  am going to echo a lot of the same things. I thank him for his  continued leadership. And, of course, I know we are going to hear from  Senator Coons shortly and Senator Blumenthal, but a lot of the efforts  go to Senator Klobuchar with her leadership on the Senate Rules  Committee.   These issues around election security go back to the first bipartisan  effort immediately after 2016, the Honest Ads Act. It is unfortunate  that we are now heading into the election--126 days, I believe, left-- and this body has still not voted on a single stand-alone election  bill, even though we have seen the Russian interference of 2016 and  even though we know that Russia and other countries are back. I think  history will judge those who prevented those votes from happening if we  see the kind of potential disruption this fall that we saw in 2016.   Today, I am here to join Senator Klobuchar and Senator Blumenthal, as  well, to make sure that everybody has the right to vote in November and  that they are able do it in a safe and secure way. As Senator Durbin  said, from Wisconsin to Georgia, to Kentucky, we are seeing a dangerous  trend where too many voters are having to choose between their safety  and their right to vote. My fear is that as we head into November  without a plan and without a strategy for protecting the right to vote  and ensuring equal access to the ballot box, we could see levels of  voter suppression not seen since the Jim Crow era.   Now, we all know we have enormous challenges with COVID-19, and we  have to make sure that our polling places don't become vectors for  spreading the virus. The way we do that is not by restricting access to  the ballot box, not in the United States of America. That is not how  the world's greatest democracy should meet this challenge.   If we are going to preserve the integrity of our elections and the  trust of the American people, it is essential that States and the  Federal Government adapt to the challenges of this pandemic and  actually expand access to the ballot box. In short, we need to make it  easier and safer for Americans to exercise their right to vote.   The good news is, we don't have to reinvent the wheel. A number of  States--red States, blue States, purple States--have adopted a range of  convenient voting procedures that work quite well. Some of these  procedures including ample early voting opportunities and no-excuse  absentee ballots, all of which reduce the risk but also make sure we  continue to be able to increase access.   In my home State of Virginia, due to recent legislative changes, we  have curbside voting for seniors and people with disabilities, and we  have expanded the no-excuse absentee ballot. Unfortunately, despite all  these effective and secure tools at our disposal, we have also seen  States implement restrictions in the name of safety that have  disenfranchised far too many Americans.   In Wisconsin's April primary, for example, Milwaukee reduced its  number of polling places from 180 to just 5. We saw similar moves  recently in Georgia and Kentucky. We know whom those restrictions  disenfranchise. It is the poor; it is the elderly; it is workers just  getting off their shift; and, disproportionately, it is Black and  Latino voters who face the brunt of these restrictions. The truth is,  this is not right. I think we all know that.   We have a moral obligation to make sure our tools to counter COVID-19  are not used to intimidate and suppress voters. Just last week, Senator  Klobuchar and I sent letters raising the warning that bad actors could  use testing, immunity, and protective equipment as a pretense to turn  away voters or increase the difficulty of reaching the ballot box on  election day.   Ideally, our election officials could come together around a national  strategy of preparing every polling place and precinct for  administering our elections during a pandemic.   Unfortunately, there are those, including the President, who have  tried to politicize this issue. In fact, we have seen the President  spreading utter misinformation about mail-in voting.   The President seems to have forgotten that he has voted by mail in  not simply the last election but in the last three elections. What he  fundamentally fails to understand is that the right to vote belongs to  the voters, not to the politicians. It is our job to make sure that  Americans can exercise their rights in a way that is safe and secure.   That is why Congress must rise to the occasion and ensure Americans  can vote safely and securely. The time is now to start serious  preparations on contingencies to protect our elections from both the  pandemic and those who take advantage of it.   I am a sponsor of the bill that Senator Klobuchar has tried to UC  tonight, and I am disappointed that it was blocked from passing, but I  look forward to continuing to work with her and all of my other  colleagues to make sure we get this job done.   I yield the floor.
