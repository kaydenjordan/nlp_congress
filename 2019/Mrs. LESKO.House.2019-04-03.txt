 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank Representative Scanlon for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I am a survivor of domestic violence. I also serve on  the advisory council of a domestic violence shelter in my district, and  I am the cochairwoman of the congressional Bipartisan Working Group to  End Domestic Violence.   That is why having a strong Violence Against Women Act, commonly  known as VAWA, that works for the American people is so very important  to me.   Ending violence against women and protecting women and children  should not be a partisan issue. However, we find ourselves debating a  VAWA reauthorization act that is literally a Christmas tree of  progressive, liberal policy objectives rather than an honest approach  to reforming and updating such an important law for millions of women  and children.   VAWA has lapsed, putting millions of women and children at risk, when  it didn't need to. I, along with 194 other Republicans, voted to  reauthorize VAWA through the end of the fiscal year on February 14,  2019.   I sponsored the Protecting Women Act, which would reauthorize VAWA  until September 30, 2019. This would have allowed the program to stay  in place while we worked in a truly bipartisan fashion to update and  reauthorize this critical program.   VAWA has historically been a bipartisan bill with little controversy.  However, this particular VAWA proposal moved through the Judiciary  Committee without a single vote of support from any Republican.   Throughout this process, my friends across the aisle have talked a  lot about bipartisanship, but I have seen little effort from my  Democratic colleagues to engage in a process to pass a VAWA  reauthorization bill that could garner wide-ranging bipartisan support.  And believe me, I have tried.   I have reached out to my Democratic colleagues to set up meetings  several times, to no avail.                                time  1245    H.R. 1585 is a treasure trove of liberal policy objectives that will  put women, girls, and children at risk. This bill, as written, forces  shelters and service providers, under the power of Federal law-- shelters that may not even be equipped--to place males in the same  sleeping and showering quarters as women and children purely based on  how that individual ``identifies.''   These gaping holes in the law will put women and children at risk to  predators, who may have experienced trauma from male predators  themselves. Based on this bill, the shelter would be required to accept  a biological male even if the shelter is not equipped to separate males  and females, forcing vulnerable women who have been abused and maybe  sexually assaulted to shower with and sleep next to males.   We hear constantly from the other side of the aisle that this is all  conjecture, what I am saying is all conjecture and completely  hypothetical, and that this just does not happen. However, we know this  is not true, and I have stated this before in the Judiciary Committee  and the Rules Committee.   Nine women in Fresno, California, are suing a shelter for being  sexually harassed in a shelter by a biological male.   The Hope Center in Alaska is another example, where a woman was  quoted as saying she would rather sleep in the woods than have to be in  close quarters with a male and relive her trauma.   Further, this legislation requires--requires--prisons to place  biological males who identify as women in women's prisons. We have seen  how this played out in Britain, where a biological man who identified  as a woman raped two females.   Those on the other side of the aisle have accused those of us who  want to preserve sex-segregated spaces based on biology as  discriminatory and demonizing transgender individuals. This is  completely false.   Nothing in the amendments that I have offered would discriminate  against anyone. Any shelter could still take anyone in, but I don't  want government forcing the shelters to take someone in if they are not  equipped to do so.   What we are pointing out are gaping holes in this legislative  proposal and potential for predators to take advantage of the law. We  must give those who are sheltering and serving women the tools to keep  them safe.   H.R. 1585 also seeks to eliminate due process and infringe on Second  Amendment rights. I agree that we need to keep guns out of the hands of  dangerous criminals, but expanding laws to prohibit individuals from  exercising their Second Amendment rights without them even being  present to defend themselves, as is the case in ex parte orders of  protection, is a dangerous precedent.   Further, H.R. 1585 includes provisions that would result in a  permanent prohibition on owning or possessing firearms by anyone  convicted on a misdemeanor. Permanently losing a fundamental civil  right for a misdemeanor conviction is virtually unheard of. The bill  uses the legitimate and serious issue of domestic violence as a way to  limit legitimate gun rights.   When coupled with the bill's expansion of the definition of  ``domestic relationship'' to include ``former dating partners,'' a  subjective term that could be easily abused, the bill expands power to  permanently remove someone's right to own firearms to an untenable  degree.   This legislation also advances policies that could reduce criminal  prosecutions by tying States' grant eligibility to policies that ensure  that compelling victim testimony is discouraged.   Further, it permits the use of VAWA funds for new ``alternative  justice'' models, under which funds could be granted to programs that  force mediation between an abuser and the victim of the abuser.   Finally, H.R. 1585 rolls back protections for sex trafficking. The  bill deprioritizes the use of grant funding to protect victims of sex  trafficking and would only allow this funding to go to grantees if  their program is primarily focused on domestic violence, dating  violence, sexual assault, or stalking.   These are just a few of the hyperpartisan provisions that my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have injected into this VAWA  reauthorization. We all want to protect women and children, and VAWA  has typically received wide-ranging bipartisan support; however, this  legislation fails to do that.   We should be focusing on commonsense, bipartisan reforms to VAWA  instead of on a bill that is a nonstarter in the U.S. Senate and a bill  that will not be signed by the President.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before I have my friend speak, I am going to address what  Representative Scanlon said, that calling a transgender woman a  biological male, she said, is offensive and it shows my disdain for  transgender individuals. That is absolutely false. I have no disdain. I  am just merely stating fact.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Hartzler), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I have one comment before I introduce my  friend from Oklahoma.   It is said that there has only been one incident where a biological  male threatened the women, and that is just simply not true. There have  been several incidences. Quite frankly, the question is, how many women  have to be put in a potentially unsafe situation or have their privacy  violated by males before you realize that this concern is really  legitimate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole), my good friend, the ranking member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time we have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  West Virginia (Mrs. Miller), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from West Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire on the time remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to provide additional consideration of H.R. 1741, authored by  Representative Elise Stefanik.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1741 is a bill that would provide a 1- year extension of VAWA while we work on negotiating a long-term  reauthorization of VAWA. I think there are a lot of things that the  Republicans and Democrats can agree on, and I would like to come up  with a bipartisan bill.   During the Rules Committee, my colleague, Representative Woodall,  asked the Democrat witness if the majority would consider moving a  short-term extension if the U.S. Senate does not take this bill up. The  witness could not answer the question.   This is a dangerous gamble the Democrat majority is willing to play.  We have received no indication that the U.S. Senate will use this bill  as a starting point or move quickly on this liberal proposal, leaving  VAWA unnecessarily expired during the meantime.   The Democrats are in control and have the votes to pass their bill;  however, they are putting the lives of millions of women in jeopardy by  gambling on what the Senate will do. We should not be gambling.   The Democrat majority has already passed up a short-term extension  once via a vote, and the program has lapsed. There is no reason why we  should not send an additional option that the Senate can take up  quickly to keep the program functioning.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, we all--Republicans and Democrats--want to  protect women and children and stop violence against women, but,  unfortunately, this particular bill advances a separate policy agenda  other than that.   The long history of bipartisanship of VAWA will become a thing of the  past with this bill. This bill leaves gaping holes for potential  predators to victimize women and children in areas that are supposed to  be safe.   It advances new gun control policies to permanently restrict people  from exercising their Second Amendment rights or does so without that  person even being able to defend themselves in court.  [[Page H3001]]    It deprioritizes funding to combat sex trafficking and includes  various new forms of criminal justice policy that could let  perpetrators walk or have opportunities to revictimize women and  children.   As a survivor of domestic violence, I want to see a VAWA  reauthorization that focuses on women and children and keeps our  country safe. We should be voting on legislation which all women of  this Chamber could support; however, this bill is not that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Chairman, I am a survivor of domestic violence from a  previous marriage. I serve on the advisory council of a domestic  violence shelter in my district. I am the co-chairwoman of the Working  Group Against Domestic Violence in Congress.   So if you haven't figured it out, this issue is very important to me  and I want to protect women.   Another role I have is, I am co-chairwoman of the Congressional  Women's Caucus. And in that, I spoke with my Democratic colleague, and  she knew it was an important issue to me, it was an important issue to  her, and we really had talked about having a bipartisan approach that  all women and all of us could vote on that we would agree on.    So once I found out that Representative Bass was going to be the  sponsor of the bill, I reached out to her office.  [[Page H3007]]  We were trying to--we just never were able to get together before the  Judiciary Committee markup on the bill, in the attempt to talk with  her, to see if she would listen to my concerns.   Then, in the Judiciary Committee, I offered an amendment that  basically would make sure that domestic violence shelters could protect  the victims and keep their privacy private. And that amendment was  rejected, and I was told that it was too broad, and those types of  things.   So in that Judiciary Committee hearing I asked Representative Bass if  she would be agreeable to meeting with me, so I could work with her to  do an amendment in a bipartisan fashion to protect women and children,  and she said absolutely, yes. And, again, I reached out to her office  on at least two occasions and never got a response.   So I have really tried to work on this in a bipartisan fashion,  because there are some concerns I have. And let me tell you the reason  why I am going to vote ``no'' on this bill, even though I am a survivor  of domestic violence.   First of all, the bill forces domestic violence shelters, under  penalty of Federal law, this law, to house biological males in with  women. And often these women have been abused themselves, and they may  not--this may violate their privacy, and it may have risks.   The second reason is this bill forces prisons to take in biological  males, under penalty of Federal law, and put them in women's prisons.  In the United Kingdom this happened, and a male identifying as a woman  was placed in a woman's prison and ended up raping women.   The third reason is this bill takes away gun rights.    This bill, thirdly, also takes away gun rights in 2  cases: One with ex parte orders of protection; that is when a woman,  like myself, would go in to see a Justice of the Peace; we would get an  order of protection. Under this bill, the perpetrator's gun rights  would be taken away, even though they weren't there in court.   Also, it would take away someone's gun rights if they were convicted  of a misdemeanor, which is very rare.   So, again, I don't think this bill is going to get heard in the U.S.  Senate, which, I hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle-- this is an important issue to all of us, and I hope that we can work  together so it is something that I can support, something that we all  can support, because it is a really important issue.
