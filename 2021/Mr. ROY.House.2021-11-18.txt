 Mr. Speaker, I can't help but wonder what my so-called  moderate colleagues on the other side of the aisle are waiting for,  with bated breath, from a CBO score.   You don't need a CBO score to know that $100 billion worth of  amnesty, when our border is wide open, will cripple the State of Texas,  cripple our country, and cause thousands of pounds of fentanyl to pour  into our country.   You don't need a CBO score to know that a 900 percent increase in  OSHA fines to go after small businesses and shut them down with  tyrannical vaccine mandates is going to cripple jobs and small  businesses across the country.    You don't need a CBO score to know that $500 billion of unicorn  climate agenda energy policies are going to drive up heating costs,  drive up the cost of gasoline, and cripple our economy. You don't need  a CBO score to oppose that.   You don't need a CBO score to know that $300 billion of tax giveaways  to basically blue State Yankees is going to somehow fix our country.
