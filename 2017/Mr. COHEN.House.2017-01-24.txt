 Madam Speaker, what this bill is about is taking women who  can't afford to get an abortion and not allowing them to use taxpayer- funded money to get it. The assumption on the other side is they won't  have money, because people who are in dire straits won't have money to  get it, and therefore they will have these 2 million children they are  talking about.   What we are talking about--let's make it clear--is they are talking  about poor women who they think can't afford to get to a doctor or to  an abortion provider and force them to have children that they can't  have because of economics.   So women, poor women, do not forgive them for they know what they do.  They are trying to put you at their mercy and make you have children  because you are poor. If they get their ultimate desire--and that is  the repeal of Roe v. Wade--then poor women will not be able to get an  abortion, but wealthy women will.   Trump said, yes, if they outlaw abortion, go to another State. Easy  to say when you are a billionaire, but not a thing to say to the middle  class and poor women of this country whom they want to force, through  their economic disparities, to bear children.
