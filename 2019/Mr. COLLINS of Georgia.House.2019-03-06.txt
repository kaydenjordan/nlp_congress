 Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate that because I  am very concerned, after two straight weeks of Democrat bills, I am  going to have a 100 percent voting record with the ACLU. That is  something new as we go forward here; although I think they do good  work, I just didn't know we were going to agree so soon on this.    Mr. Chairman, I am going to describe the terrible policy behind the  provisions of H.R. 1 in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee.   It is amazing, also, that we just did this without going through,  because we didn't want to mark this up in areas because we didn't want  to see what was in it; because here is what is going to happen:   First, the bill creates a private cause of action for lawsuits  related to the Help America Vote Act of 2002. That means the bill  allows anyone to sue anybody if they don't like the way an election was  conducted in a locality, State, or nationwide.   Do you all remember the lawsuit Bush v. Gore? In 2000, Democratic  Presidential candidate Al Gore didn't like the results of the vote in  Florida. If he could get the Florida results overturned, he would have  had enough to win the Presidency. So he sued to get the Florida results  overturned by a court. The case went all the way up to the Supreme  Court which finally stopped the recount after a month of legal  wrangling that made America look like its elections were determined by  lawyers, not voters.   Well, guess what? We are bringing them back. Here they come in,  because under this bill today, you won't just see more cases like Gore  v. Florida. You will see all sorts of lawsuits; Everybody v. Everybody.   Does a candidate need 1,000 more votes to win? Then a candidate can  sue in two or three counties and see if a judge will order those votes  into their vote column.   Does a candidate need a few more votes? Then under this bill, they  could sue in a dozen counties. Need a million votes? This bill allows a  losing candidate and disgruntled activists to sue in all 50 States:  Gore v. Georgia, Gore v. Oklahoma, Gore versus any state that it takes  to gather enough judicial relief to cobble together an election  victory, taking time and money away from State and local elected  officials who desperately need that money to administer free and fair  elections; not pay bogus legal fees.   The Help America Vote Act of 2002 was enacted to precisely avoid  future lawsuits like Gore v. Florida. Now this bill will undo all that  and make matters worse in the process.   Second, this bill takes powers away from voters and gives it to  convicted criminals by denying State voters their constitutional right  to limit voting by people who have been convicted of murder, violent  felonies, or other serious crimes including, by the way--get this-- voter fraud.   These provisions are patently unconstitutional. The Supreme Court,  including liberal Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, all  held, just a few years ago, mind you, that:         Surely nothing in the Elections Clause of the Constitution       lends itself to the view that voting qualifications in       Federal elections are to be set by Congress.    Further, the 14th Amendment of the Constitution itself explicitly  recognizes the rights of States to deny the vote for ``participation in  crime.''   Third, this is what happens when you bypass the committee process. I  spoke about this one on the floor already last week. Here we go again.  The new majority doesn't like committees.   A provision in the bill, at page 99--listen to me clearly--lines 7-12  of the Committee Print, states:         No person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise,       shall intentionally hinder, interfere with, or prevent       another from voting, registering to vote, or aiding another       person to vote in an election.    That text, if read strictly, says it makes it illegal to prevent a  four-year old from voting, to prevent an illegal alien from voting, and  to prevent any other non-qualified person from voting. This same  provision again appears in pages 102 and 103, and adds a criminal  penalty of up to 5 years in prison and a $100,000 fine.   Now here is the problem. The problem is that provision I just quoted,  doesn't refer to a person's exercising the right to vote; that is  voting when they have a legal right to vote. The standard term used  when a statutory provision is aimed at protecting legitimate voters  from voting refers to the denial or abridgment of the right to vote.   Now, listen, because this provision doesn't contain those key terms,  meaning the provisions would literally make it illegal to prevent  illegal voters from voting, we shouldn't be making it a crime--    We shouldn't be making it a crime for  election officials to do their job.   Remember, we can't prevent illegal voters from voting under this  bill, which makes it--they have no legal right to vote illegally.   Every illegal voter cancels the vote of a legal voter. This was  recognized in the Supreme Court case, Reynolds v. Sims and, in that  case it was said:         The right to vote can be denied by a debasement or dilution       of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by       wholly prohibiting the free exercise of that franchise.   [[Page H2400]]     Look, an illegal vote negated the vote of a legal voter. This bill,  my colleagues across the aisle, you are getting ready to vote for a  bill that actually could negate legal voting.   I could go on for days. This is why committees matter. This is why  this bill is bad. Why do we keep doing this and running away.
