 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Heller  amendment No. 1146. Amendment No. 1146 provides tax relief for families  with children. This week we are setting in motion one of my top  legislative priorities in the Senate; that is, to bring tax relief to  American families.   For decades, Nevadans have been waiting for an affordable and fair  tax code that they can understand, and I have long said that the Tax  Code is too costly and too complex. We need to simplify our code in a  way that creates jobs and allows Nevadans to keep more of their hard- earned tax dollars. With this budget, we are taking an enormous first  step in providing meaningful relief to Nevadans and middle-class  families across the Nation.   Under our leadership and thanks to the work of the chairman of the  Budget Committee, we are finally in a place where we can provide real,  meaningful tax relief for all of America. As a member of the Senate  Finance Committee, I have been working with my colleagues to craft a  tax bill that accomplishes three major goals. The first is to create  more jobs; No. 2 is to increase wages; and, finally, No. 3 is to boost  American competitiveness.   So the question is, What does tax reform mean to an average Nevadan  who works hard and is trying to provide a better life for themselves  and for their children? It means you can keep more of your hard-earned  paycheck, and it will be easier for you to file your taxes, less  paperwork, more money. Lower rates for businesses mean more jobs, they  mean higher wages, and they mean growth in our communities, all of  which will benefit you.   As the son of a school cook and an auto mechanic, I understand  discipline and hard work--all of it--that goes into every dollar and  every paycheck, and I am working to see that we have more of it in your  back pocket. That is why my amendment is absolutely critical, because  it delivers this desperately needed relief and lets the middle-class  families keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, helping them make  ends meet and invest in their families.   For too long, American families have been struggling with stagnant  wages and incomes, as well as slow economic growth made worse by the  policies of the Obama administration. In inflation-adjusted terms,  nationwide median household incomes stayed below what it was in 2007  all the way up to 2015. Last year, it was only $890 more than it was in  2007. In my home State of Nevada, the situation is even worse. Median  household income still hasn't fully recovered and is $7,000 lower today  than it was in 2007.   Tax relief for families with children, through an enhanced child tax  credit, for example, will help begin to address the financial  insecurities facing American families and will help families confront  the rising cost of raising children. Expansion of the child tax credit  will help hard-working, middle-class families in many ways, allowing  them to keep more of their hard-earned income to use for the needs of  their families and for their children.   I urge everyone in this Chamber to support children, I urge them to  support middle-class families, and I urge them to support my amendment.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today still in shock, still in  mourning over the events of October 1, when 58 people--some of them  Nevadans, many of them visitors to our State--were brutally gunned down  by a madman on the Las Vegas Strip.   In addition to those horrible deaths, almost 500 people were injured.  Many of them face long roads to physical recovery and an even longer  and more painful road to emotional recovery. I know I speak for all of  my Senate colleagues in praying for them and wishing them the quickest  recovery possible.   This madman's actions devastated our city, but I rise today to tell  you that the sense of devastation is being replaced by a renewed sense  of community, a renewed sense of family, of unity, of faith, and a  renewed sense of strength. I have had the honor of experiencing it  firsthand in the eyes and the voices of those who survived and those  who chose to stay in harm's way to help each other when they could have  fled to safety. I have heard and seen this renewed sense of community  and strength in the faces of our first responders, none of whom have  ever encountered anything as horrific as the carnage of October 1 but  who plunged into danger to save lives. Because? Because that is what  they do.   I had the privilege of meeting a Las Vegas police officer, Sergeant  Jonathan Riddle, who was stationed a block from the shooting scene  doing traffic work. When he first heard the popping noises, like most  of the concertgoers, he thought it was fireworks, but the second volley  told him otherwise, and his training kicked in. He grabbed his rifle  and he sprinted toward the chaos. Keep in mind, this police officer  knew, through his training, that heavy-caliber bullets were being fired  and that his protective vest would not stop them. He also knew his  rifle was useless because the shots were coming from the Mandalay Bay,  and he couldn't shoot at the hotel for fear of hitting an innocent  bystander. So he was, for all intents and purposes, defenseless. He  knew it, but he ran anyway. He ran toward the violence. He ran toward  it with one purpose, to help in any way he could.   It is almost not fair to single him out because dozens of metro  police officers did the same thing, and firefighters, paramedics, and  ambulance drivers  [[Page S6527]]  also. It was not just professional first responders who emerged as true  heroes on October 1. Taylor Winston, a marine, was just trying to enjoy  the concert that night, but when the bullets started raining down, he  was driven by his training, his instincts, his compassion for his  fellow human beings. He helped several people over a fence where they  took cover, but he realized the danger wasn't over. Looking around, he  spotted a pickup truck with a long bed. He borrowed the truck. I use  the term ``borrowed'' loosely. He loaded the back of it with injured  people and rushed them to the hospital, but he wasn't done. He made a  return trip, loaded the pickup again with wounded individuals and got  them to the hospital.   Jack Beaton's last act on Earth was one of sacrifice and heroism. He  draped himself over his wife, protecting her from the deadly bullets.  He told her he loved her, then was hit and died in her arms.   Jonathan Smith shouted warnings when he realized what was happening,  but when some people were too stunned to move toward safety, Jonathan  moved toward them, getting them out of the line of fire. That is when  Jonathan himself was hit. He survived but will likely always have a  bullet lodged in his neck. It is a painful reminder of his heroics, but  I hope it will also remind him of the people he saved.   John, a cab driver, accelerated toward the screams and the chaos and  shouted for a frightened group of girls to jump into his cab, and he  drove them to safety. Then John turned around and drove back to the  shooting scene and transported another group to safety. In all, John  possibly saved 11 lives.   There was a woman at the concert, a respiratory therapist, who had  her cell phone shattered by a bullet while the cell phone was still in  her hand. Shards of hard plastic tore through her hand and embedded in  her skin. What did she do? She pulled the shards out of her hand,  bandaged herself up, and rushed to the hospital where she worked to try  to help other people more badly injured.   At our local hospitals, doctors and nurses worked miracles around the  clock. When operating rooms were not available, they treated the  wounded in hallways. Surrounded by shouting, crying, chaos, and blood,  they saved one life after another after another. Their skill, their  composure, their dedication to saving lives was stronger that night  than the evil intentions of the madman with a rifle.   I was walking the hallway of one of our hospitals with the hospital's  CEO when a woman rushed toward him, grabbed him by the arm, and through  tears and sobs, thanked him for the work his staff had done. Her niece  had been wounded, but she was heading home. She said she could never  thank the hospital staff enough.   In the aftermath, the community banded together to provide every  resource possible to the victims and their families. The Las Vegas  Convention Center's South Hall was dedicated to family reunification  and support services. Airlines answered the call to provide free  flights to the families of victims. Hotels and casinos across Las Vegas  offered free rooms. The American Red Cross partnered with the Mirage to  host a blood drive. Millions of dollars have been raised by local  businesses and people across the country to support the victims.   The employees of Mandalay Bay and other MGM resort properties were  understandably stricken and horrified by the shooting, but they too  asked how they could help. Instead of being frozen by their shock and  grief, they mobilized--donating blood, offering help to the families of  the victims, organizing memorials, and otherwise coming together as a  team, motivated by compassion and selflessness and providing comfort  and solace.   True leaders have emerged in the wake of this tragedy. My friend  Sheriff Joe Lombardo, head of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police  Department, has been steadfast in this crisis. He will always be  remembered as a rock-solid presence when our city most needed one.   Let me say this for the world to hear. Our great city will not cower  in fear because of this horrible act. We will mourn, we will heal, we  will comfort each other, and we will pray, but make no mistake about  it, Las Vegas is open for business. Las Vegas will not simply go on,  but we will thrive. So come to Las Vegas, and maybe come away with a  greater appreciation of what our city, our people are all about. From  the blood and the horror, the terror, the carnage of October 1, Las  Vegas has risen.   We have never shied away from our image as a city of entertainment.  Our hospitality defines us, but the world has now seen a side much more  profound--something we have always seen--and that is a home, a family,  a community of people who will stand by each other during the darkest  moments, a community of people bound by faith who will stand in the  face of danger to protect a neighbor, a friend, a family member, or  someone they have never met.   Everyone around the world has heard of Las Vegas. The very name  conjures images almost immediately. Its skyline cannot be mistaken for  any other. Yet prior to October 1, almost no one knew the true Las  Vegas, the Las Vegas we are seeing now, a city that responds to  cowardly violence with love and compassion for each other, a city that  responds to hatred with faith and strength. ``Las Vegas Strong'' is a  slogan we are now seeing on billboards, marquees, and T-shirts, but  behind that slogan is a true story of true strength. It is a story of a  city growing, emerging, and becoming closer and more united.   A deranged man with a rifle brought death and carnage and terror to  Las Vegas, but today Las Vegas stands stronger. Las Vegas stands  unafraid. Las Vegas's true identity has been revealed, and it is one of  compassion and one of heroism. It is my hope that we will honor the  memory of those lost by holding on to the sense of unity and family  that has emerged since October 1 and that we will, all of us, continue  to be Las Vegas Strong.   May God bless the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and may God  bless the United States of America.   I yield back.    Mr. President, today I wish to memorialize Don  Carano, one of northern Nevada's most influential figures, a great  business leader, and a man I am privileged to have called a friend. Don  recently passed away peacefully at the age of 85.  [[Page S6533]]    My sincerest condolences go out to his family, friends, and loved  ones. All of northern Nevada mourns the loss of Mr. Carano, who helped  make Reno a better place to live and work, not only for his employees,  but for the entire community.   Throughout his life, Mr. Carano was a caring, giving man who charted  his own path as an entrepreneur. Some of his businesses include  Eldorado Resorts, Ferrari-Carano Vineyards and Winery, and the McDonald  Carano law firm. Mr. Carano was also instrumental in the construction  of the National Bowling Stadium and the Reno Events Center in downtown  Reno.   Born in Reno, Mr. Carano went to Southside Elementary School,  Billinghurst Junior High School, and Reno High School before earning  his college degree and serving in the U.S. Army for 2 years as an  officer. Thereafter, Mr. Carano completed law school at the University  of San Francisco and began his law practice in Reno. In 1973, he opened  the Eldorado Hotel Casino, the first major casino to open on Virginia  Street north of the railroad tracks, which changed the profile of  gaming in northern Nevada.   Mr. Carano's many contributions and honors include the International  Gaming and Wagering Business Hall of Fame, Nevada Food and Beverage  Directors Association Man of the Year awards, the American Lung  Association Distinguished Community Service Award, Hotelier of the Year  Award, ``Knight in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic'' by the  Consul General of Italy, University of San Francisco Law School's  Alumnus of the Year, International Restaurant and Hospitality Rating  Bureau's Lifetime Achievement Award, the WIBC Gladys M. Banker  Friendship Award, and many more. Just this year, Mr. Carano was  recognized as a ``Distinguished Nevadan'' by the University of Nevada,  Reno.   As Nevada's senior Senator, I thank Mr. Carano and his family for  their decades of work in helping make Reno the thriving, booming,  biggest little city that it is today. I ask all of my colleagues to  join me in memorializing Mr. Carano and the legacy he leaves behind.  Lynne and my family give our deepest sympathies to his wife, Rhonda,  his five children Gary, Gene, Glenn, Gregg, and Cindy, 11  grandchildren, and 6 great-grandchildren as they cope with this great  loss.                            ____________________
