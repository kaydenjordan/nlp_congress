 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H. Res. 826,  a rushed resolution to dismantle the Trump administration's Healthy  Adult Opportunity Medicaid initiative.   The Affordable Care Act expansion of Medicaid is simply  unsustainable. It is bankrupting my home State of Kentucky.   In the 114th Congress, I served as the chair of the House Committee  on Energy and Commerce's Medicaid Task Force. We explored ways that  would make Medicaid sustainable so that it can be fully utilized by  vulnerable populations for generations to come.   The Trump administration has proposed a commonsense option that will  not affect funding for children, pregnant women, the elderly, or people  with disabilities but, rather, give States flexibility for their  Medicaid programs.  [[Page H875]]    I will continue to work with my colleagues on the House Committee on  Energy and Commerce to make Medicaid sustainable and accessible to  those who need it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H. Res. 826.
