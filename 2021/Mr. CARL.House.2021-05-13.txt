 Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank my colleague from  Florida, Mrs. Cammack, aka Cat, for organizing tonight's Special Order  hour to recognize our National Police Week.  [[Page H2298]]    This morning, I had the privilege of joining Leader McCarthy and  several of our colleagues at the National Law Enforcement Memorial to  show our respect for the fallen and our support for the men and women  in uniform.   Last year was one of the deadliest years on record for law  enforcement officers. So now, more than ever, we need to back the blue  and show our continuous support for law enforcement.   When I was a child, I can remember my grandfather telling me: If you  ever get in need or get scared, go to a police officer.   Law enforcement has not changed. I still encourage my children and my  grandchildren to do the same. I think we have changed the way we view  law enforcement.   To all law enforcement officers in this country: Please know that I  support you. You are making a difference in our community. You are  helping the American people, and we are forever grateful.   On this National Police Week, I encourage all Americans to honor the  sacrifices that are made by men and women in uniform, and thank every  police officer for the job they are doing.                            ____________________
