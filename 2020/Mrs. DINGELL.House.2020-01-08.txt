 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his  leadership.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4500, the Promoting U.S.  Wireless Leadership Act of 2019, which we are considering now.   This bill, on which my colleague and good friend from Michigan, Mr.  Walberg, has taken the lead, and my good friend from Indiana, Mrs.  Brooks, the three of us have worked closely and in a bipartisan fashion  to direct the NTIA to encourage participation by trusted American  companies and other stakeholders in international standards-setting  bodies. This is about American competitiveness.   In short, it helps ensure that America's interests are protected, and  that companies have a seat at the table, as the world is deciding what  5G is going to look like. The policy choices that are being made right  now will have lasting implications for 5G technology development around  the world. It is imperative that the United States have a strong voice  in these decisions, so we can continue to lead in an increasingly  competitive market. We cannot give up a competitive edge or give it to  another country.   The Energy and Commerce Committee advanced this bill, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it today.
