 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lewis for  his work on this important legislation. I also thank the ranking  member, Mr. Scott, whom I had the pleasure of working with on this same  cause last year. This year, of course, I am proud to be a cosponsor of  this bill.    As a former member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce,  this was and remains one of my priorities, as I believe that this  reauthorization can help us achieve our antipoverty goals here in the  U.S. House.   The Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017 will help set kids up for  success that is long term, so they are not caught up in a system that  puts them on a path where failure is inevitable. This bill includes  reforms that will help juveniles transition out of the system through  community-based services and education.   It also ensures that stakeholders can offer their expertise in order  to best serve this population while also supporting prevention services  to keep kids on the right track. Another important thing to note is  that this bill prioritizes evidence-based strategies to reduce juvenile  delinquency, directing necessary resources to what actually works.   Everyone deserves the chance to improve their circumstances. Many  kids who end up in the juvenile justice system are the most vulnerable  in our communities. These kids and the stakeholders and policymakers  who support them need the flexibility and tools to effectively serve  them. I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction, and  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of it.   I appreciate the work that the Committee on Education and the  Workforce has done to help at-risk youth get on a path to a brighter  future.
