 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at  the desk.    Mr. Chair, I would like to recognize  the leadership of Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, and my  friend and colleague, Mr. Larsen.   Mr. Chairman, the amendment I have at the desk today will help start  a Federal process in providing additional flexibility for storage of  native and San Juan-Chama water to benefit the Middle Rio Grande  region.   The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority has been  working for more than 5 years to obtain congressional authorization to  increase storage in Abiquiu Reservoir by about 35,000 acre-feet. This  will provide greater and much-needed flexibility for water operations  to support municipal, agricultural, and environmental purposes.   This amendment starts that process by expediting the feasibility  study for Abiquiu Dam. According to the New Mexico Interstate Stream  Commission, the added storage will also provide opportunities to  benefit acequias in northern New Mexico, many of which have the oldest  water rights in the Rio Grande basin, but do not have any ability to  store water for use in drought years; management of operations in the  Middle Rio Grande for Endangered Species Act compliance; and for the  Rio Grande Compact compliance for the State of New Mexico.   This project is supported by the Bureau of Reclamation, the Corps of  Engineers, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land  Management. WildEarth Guardians, the Nature Conservancy, the Audubon  New Mexico, the city and county of Santa Fe, the New Mexico Interstate  Stream Commission, the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, Rio  Arriba County, and the Rio Chama Acequia Association.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this  amendment so that these communities can move forward with this critical  project, and I yield back the balance of my time.
