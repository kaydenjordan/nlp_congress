The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Wyoming is recognized  for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1245                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1245                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Wyoming?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 631,  which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 3017,  Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization  Act of 2017; and a structured rule for H.R. 3905, Minnesota's Economic  Rights in the Superior National Forest Act.   Mr. Speaker, brownfield refers normally to abandoned or closed  commercial or industrial properties that may be contaminated because of  their prior use. These sites often represent a tremendous amount of  untapped economic potential. However, developing that potential is  complicated by the presence of hazardous substances or contaminants.   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that there are more  than 50,000 brownfields in the United States. The brownfields program  has enjoyed broad bipartisan support and has been critical in  converting these vacant sites into tax-generating properties and,  eventually, well-paying jobs for American citizens.   As of May 1, 2017, the program has assessed 26,722 sites, and they  have leveraged over 124,760 jobs. On average, Mr. Speaker, over $16 is  leveraged for every EPA brownfields dollar spent, and 8.5 jobs are  leveraged per $100,000 of EPA brownfields funds.   States all over the country have benefited from this grant program.  In my home State of Wyoming, we put brownfield grants to use in cities  like Casper, Cheyenne, Sheridan, Evanston, Kemmerer, Laramie, and  Dubois.   Brownfield sites have been revitalized using these funds in places  like the Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas; development in the  neighborhoods around Danville, Illinois; and the Grijalva Park at  Santiago Creek in Orange, California.   The brownfields program has been expired, Mr. Speaker, since 2006,  and it is high time we reauthorize this critically important grant  program.   The brownfields program has enabled local communities to clean up and  repurpose vacated sites, utilizing them for meaningful economic  development, while responsibly cleaning up hazardous sites. This is an  important step in maintaining and improving what has been a  demonstrably effective program.   Mr. Speaker, the rule we consider today also provides for  consideration of a very important bill, H.R. 3905, Minnesota's Economic  Rights in the Superior National Forest Act, which was introduced by my  colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).   H.R. 3905 requires congressional approval of any mineral withdrawal  or monument designation involving the National Forest System lands in  the State of Minnesota and provides for the renewal of certain mineral  leases in those lands.   This is necessary, Mr. Speaker, because in the final hours of the  Obama administration, the administration withdrew hundreds of thousands  of acres in Minnesota from mineral development and improperly  terminated two Federal mineral leases.   The effect of this decision halted potential mining projects in  Minnesota, robbing the region of 650 direct and 1,300 indirect jobs, as  well as the tax revenue the mining operation would bring.   Mining jobs, Mr. Speaker, are good, high-paying jobs. The average  mining wage in Minnesota is roughly $25,000 a year higher than the  average wage in the State.   Coming from a State where we mine more coal than any State in the  Nation, I understand and appreciate the economic development mining  projects can bring to a region. We also understand the burden that can  be imposed by working with the Federal Government on these projects in  Wyoming.   Roughly half my State, Mr. Speaker, is comprised of Federal lands.  Receiving the appropriate authorizations to drill or mine on these  lands can be a lengthy and cumbersome process that delays projects for  many years.   Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, we must improve our Federal regulatory  process so we can better harness the vast natural resources we have in  our country, while still protecting and conserving our environment.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for the rule for these  important bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for yielding me the customary  30 minutes.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for the  consideration of two bills.   The first piece of legislation, H.R. 3017, is a bipartisan compromise  to extend the EPA's brownfields program. The successful brownfields  program assists communities across this country in cleaning up  contaminated sites to reduce pollution and health risks and spur  economic development.   Although funding for this program has enjoyed broad support over the  years, its authorization lapsed in 2006; 11 years ago. It is certainly  long past time for this important program to be reauthorized. I  appreciate the work of Republicans and Democrats on both the Energy and  Commerce and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees in coming  together to produce this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this is how the process is supposed to work. There was a  hearing, and there was a markup. I should  [[Page H9480]]  say, for the Record, the majority could have issued an open rule,  instead of a closed rule. But I am not even going to criticize that  today, Mr. Speaker, because experts on this issue came together to  negotiate it in a bipartisan manner, and the result is a good piece of  legislation that I look forward to voting for later this week.   I commend Mr. McKinley, Mr. Tonko, Mr. Pallone, and all those who  worked together, and I just want to say for the Record, as one who  routinely gets up here and criticizes the majority for issuing closed  rules and structured rules all the time, I do so not just as a knee- jerk reaction to what they produce in the Rules Committee. I do it  because usually they do closed rules and structured rules to basically  stifle a deliberative process. They do it to shut off debate and to  shut out other people's opinions. Quite frankly, the majority's record  on rules is abysmal.    In this case, what we are doing is bringing forward something that  represents a bipartisan process. I wish this wasn't an anomaly. I wish  that the majority would understand that, in the House of  Representatives, the views of Democrats are just as important as the  views of Republicans. If you want to get things done, you need to come  together in the spirit of compromise and work together for the good of  the American people, not just for the good of one political party, not  just so you can issue a press release, not just so you can play gotcha  games, but actually produce things that are meaningful.   If the Republican leadership would drop their all-or-nothing approach  to governing more often, support genuine bipartisan negotiations and  compromise, and open up the process on all pieces of legislation, both  minor and substantial, we might be able to get something done around  here. Maybe we could have more than 12 bills of any sort of real  significance signed into law.   This rule also brings to the floor legislation, I am sad to say, that  would do irreparable harm to our federally protected land by allowing a  foreign company the ability to use a half-century-old lease to mine  right next door to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.   H.R. 3905 would allow a Chilean mining company, which is facing tens  of millions of dollars in fines from the Chilean Government for their  failure to protect nearby water resources, the ability to mine just  upstream of pristine U.S.-protected land.   This is all based on a 50-year-old lease--a lease that didn't go  through any environmental review because NEPA didn't exist yet. There  are Members of this Chamber who weren't even born when this lease was  signed.   My colleagues in the majority will claim that this bill will help  create jobs, but what about the 22,000 jobs that the local protected  land already supports?   What will happen to those jobs when the water is so polluted that no  one can visit the recreational area around the mine?   The truth is, this isn't about jobs. It is about helping a few rich  owners of mining companies line their pockets at the expense of the  environment. In fact, the recipient of this Republican handout is a  subsidiary of a Chilean company, Antofagasta, which is controlled by  Chilean billionaire Andronico Luksic Craig. And get this: he just  happens to be the landlord of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, President  Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers to the Trump White  House.   You cannot make this stuff up. This is part of a pattern of sketchy  deals and questionable business contacts involving the President and  his family and their closest advisers.   Earlier this month, we learned that President Trump and his family  made millions through a hotel in Panama financed by Colombian drug  cartels and the Russian Mafia. We still don't even know how these new  deals will boost President Trump's income or how his family profits off  of the Presidency, because we are 312 days into his Presidency, and we  still haven't seen his tax returns.   Imagine if this were Hillary Clinton. Imagine if this were Barack  Obama. Imagine the screams on the other side of the aisle demanding  transparency and an open process. But when it comes to covering up all  these sketchy deals on behalf of this President of the United States,  there is silence.   President Trump promised to drain the swamp, but, instead, he has  created a cesspool. There are so many conflicts of interest, this  administration is on a collision course with corruption.   Mr. Speaker, we have only 6 legislative days left before the  government runs out of money, but the Speaker of the House thinks  another corporate handout, this time to Jared Kushner and Ivanka  Trump's landlord, is the most pressing issue that needs to be resolved  in Congress this week.   If the Speaker wants some suggestions as things we ought to focus on  this week, I know Democrats in this Chamber have a few. I can give you  an example.   Democrats think we should be debating a funding bill to avert the  coming shutdown on December 8, when the temporary spending bill  expires.   Democrats want to debate and pass the Dream Act, ending the turmoil  this President has caused by upending the lives of 800,000 young  immigrant DREAMers and their families.   Democrats want to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program,  known as CHIP, and community health centers, whose authorization  expired 2 months ago.   Democrats think we ought to debate flood insurance reauthorization,  which expires on December 8.   Democrats want to pass additional hurricane relief to help those who  are still recovering from devastating hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and  Puerto Rico.   Democrats want to address funding for the Veterans Choice Program,  which is set to run out of money before the end of the year.   But instead, here we are, considering yet another ridiculous, extreme  antienvironment bill.   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle love talking  about returning this country to the way it used to be. I have seen the  Make America Great Again stickers on many of their cars.   I can think of no pastime more important or more significant to our  national heritage and identity than our wilderness and protected areas.  My friends and colleagues who have spent time in the Boundary Waters  tell me how stunning it is. They say it is one of the most beautiful  places in our country. And we are going to risk polluting this national  treasure with copper-sulfide acid drainage running into the streams  that feed the Boundary Waters?   Worse yet, this bill makes these mining leases impossible to ever  overturn, even should the Bureau of Land Management conclude its  environmental assessment and rule against further mining in this  protected national forest.    This is a slippery slope. If we continue to allow corporations to  pillage our federally protected wilderness areas, we are opening the  door to irreversible damage. What is next? Clear-cutting in Yellowstone  Forest? Oil drilling off the coast of Acadia National Park?   Mr. Speaker, I beg my Republican friends to drop this assault on our  public lands and urge the leadership of this House to bring up the  urgent bills and priorities that we need to deal with before adjourning  in less than 3 weeks' time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and to oppose  efforts that will further degrade our natural resources.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to be clear about exactly what  H.R. 3905 does.   H.R. 3905 does not eliminate environmental requirements. In fact, it  will only allow mining as long as those strict environmental  requirements are met. What it does do is allow Minnesota itself to  advance its State and local economies.   I applaud my colleague from Massachusetts' commitment and dedication  to working together to try and come up with solutions about things  like, for example, funding the government. I will just point out that  if Democrats were, in fact, so dedicated to working with Republicans to  fund the government and to begin to come to a solution, to come to an  agreement, perhaps  [[Page H9481]]  their leadership would have shown up yesterday at the White House to  have meetings and discussions about funding the government. It is  awfully hard to claim that you are very dedicated and committed to that  concept if you don't have leaders who show up to the key meetings.   I would also point out, Mr. Speaker, my colleague has called our  bills and our process here ridiculous and extreme.                                time  1300    I can't help but note that what is truly ridiculous and extreme, Mr.  Speaker, are the massive increases in ObamaCare premiums that my  constituents all across Wyoming are now facing.   My constituents are now facing a situation, because of ObamaCare,  because of this health plan that was supposed to provide coverage for  everybody, low-cost coverage for everybody, that was supposed to  guarantee access, guarantee if you liked your doctor, you could keep  him or her, guarantee that you would be able to afford healthcare, my  constituents are now facing premiums that will bankrupt them.   They are now receiving bills that demonstrate that their premiums  next year, for example, for a retired married couple of two, the lowest  amount that they can pay under the ObamaCare Bronze Plan is $2,700 a  month. Now, that is absolutely unsustainable, and that is what is  ridiculous and extreme.   What we are doing today is making sure that we pass legislation that  reauthorizes the important brownfields program that restores rights to  the State of Minnesota.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia  (Mr. McKinley), the sponsor of H.R. 3017.   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on  H.R. 3017, the Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment and  Reauthorization Act of 2017. I am proud to be the sponsor of this bill,  which has broad bipartisan support, as you have been hearing about. It  will reauthorize the very successful EPA program, brownfields program,  for the first time since it was enacted.   Like my colleague Mr. Woodall said last night in the Rules Committee,  even though the brownfields site program is something that we all  support, and brownfields is something we all have in our districts,  working out the details of legislation like this is not easy, but the  fact that we are here today with a compromise bipartisan bill and no  amendment speaks volumes of how much support there is for H.R. 3017 and  the brownfields program.   There is no dispute that the EPA brownfields program has been a  success. As you just heard from the gentlewoman from Wyoming, the  program has resulted in over 27,000 properties being reassessed to  start them on this road to being cleaned up, and it has resulted in  over 129,000 new jobs.   Over the life of the program, the Federal dollars invested have  resulted in over $25 billion in leveraged private investment. This is a  program we all should support, and we all should encourage our  colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to fully fund this program  in the future.   I have confidence that H.R. 3017 will make the brownfields program  even more successful, and I urge my colleagues to be in support of the  rule and to vote for the bill on final passage.   I want to thank my committee chairman, John Shimkus, for his work and  the staff's work in bringing this bill together in a fine, compromised  fashion.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to just respond to my colleague from  Wyoming, you know, when she raised the issue of why our Democratic  leaders didn't show up to the meeting at the White House. Maybe she  didn't catch the President's tweet in which the President made it very  clear he didn't see a deal.   I am glad our leaders didn't show up because they are not props, and  we in the minority are not props either to be rolled out, to give the  appearance of bipartisanship or give the appearance that somehow you  are working with us when, in fact, you are not.   The President showed his hand. He had no interest in a deal, no  interest in working with us. And I would say that is one of the  problems in this House of Representatives, that the reason why we are  not more productive in getting things done and producing real  legislation to help the American people is because there is no  bipartisanship, very little. I made one exception to the issue on this  brownfields legislation, but on the big bills, nothing.   The gentlewoman brought up the Affordable Care Act. You know, what  was her solution to the Affordable Care Act? What was the Republican  majority's solution to making the Affordable Care Act better? I mean,  bringing a bill to the floor under the most closed process that you can  possibly imagine, a bill that would throw 23 million Americans off of  health insurance, what are my friends thinking?   When people talk about healthcare reform and improving the Affordable  Care Act, they talk about lowering prices; they talk about more  accessibility; they talk about more people getting coverage. What the  Republicans brought to the floor was a bill that would throw 23 million  Americans off of health insurance. That is their solution. That would  take away essential benefits protection for people who desperately need  health insurance to deal with this opiate crisis and a whole bunch of  other things.   So we don't want any lectures about what is extreme and what is  ridiculous in this House of Representatives. The way the majority  conducts business in this House is extreme and ridiculous. The  legislation, whether it is their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care  Act or even this tax bill that is a giveaway to corporate special  interests and is going to raise taxes on people earning $100,000, that  is extreme, that is wrong.   So, Mr. Speaker, I would just say to my Republican friends, again,  you know, if you want to get things done, if you want to work with us,  you have got to treat us as more than just props. You have to enter  into good faith negotiations. And I would say, if you did that, we  actually might get some things done around here that might improve the  quality of life for everybody in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just note, in response to my friend  and colleague from Massachusetts, that if the gentleman's leaders are  so fragile that they are scared off by a tweet, then probably they need  some new leaders. And I don't suspect that his argument really is they  couldn't go to the meeting because they were scared because of a tweet.    We do need to work together to get things done. We are hard at work  doing that.   In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), the chairman of the Environment Subcommittee,  who oversaw this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H9483]]    Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a very  tough job. They have to argue for policies that have failed and argue  for policies that we have actually had to live through the failure of  those policies over the last 8 years.   My colleague on the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), asked us to imagine if Hillary Clinton were President,  and imagine if Barack Obama were President. Mr. Speaker, we don't have  to imagine. We lived through Barack Obama's Presidency. We know that we  would be, today, living through completely stagnant growth, a strangled  military unable to meet its commitments around the world, out-of- control Federal agencies, a Federal Government that believed it had an  obligation to run every aspect of people's lives across this country,  and, at the same time, the Federal Government telling people that they  were forced to purchase insurance they didn't want and they didn't  need.   We know that has failed. We know that the whole system that the  Democrats believed would work, in terms of bringing healthcare costs  down, fundamentally failed. You cannot force people into the insurance  pools. The concept was, if you forced the young, healthy people in, you  would drop costs down for everybody. That is not what happened.   I have sympathy for them because it is a tough job that they are  undertaking, but it is very important that we argue based on the facts  on this floor, Mr. Speaker. In fact, the tax bill that I hope will come  back from the Senate--the tax bill that we passed out of the House, and  one that we will take to conference--reduces taxes for the middle  class, reduces taxes for families all across this country, doubles the  standard deduction, and takes steps towards making real what we know to  be true, which is taxpayer dollars don't belong to the government, Mr.  Speaker, taxpayer dollars belong to the American people.   If we allow people to keep more of their own money, they will invest  that money, they will grow our economy, and they will create jobs. That  is how we are going to get this economy growing and continue the  expansion and economic growth that we have seen just since this  President came into office.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Lewis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), the sponsor of H.R. 3905.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just, once again, point out that we have  important work that we are trying to get done here, we have important  work we have got to do on behalf of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, elections have consequences, and we have an obligation  to do what our constituents sent us here to do, and that includes a  whole range of things that we have been very effective at doing,  historically effective in this body since January in terms of  deregulation, in terms of passing the repeal of ObamaCare, in terms of  moving forward on tax cuts in terms of actually passing the legislation  to cut taxes, and importantly also, Mr. Speaker, moving forward to  provide the resources that our military needs.   We all watched just over the course of the last 24 hours as the North  Koreans launched yet again another ICBM. We live in a dangerous world.  It is increasingly dangerous, historically dangerous.   Those are the issues that we are focused on as Republicans and as  Members of this House. Those are the issues that we need to focus our  attention on.   Again, I think we have grown to expect, no matter what the rule is,  no matter what the underlying bill is, we are going to hear the same  thing from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, not  addressing the substance of these issues, not addressing the substance  of the things the American people sent us here to do. I am very proud  to stand here today doing exactly that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in opposition to  H.R. 3905 signed by virtually every major environmental organization in  the country.                                                   November 8, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters, we urge you to OPPOSE H.R. 3905, the       ``Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest       Act'' scheduled for mark-up in House Natural Resources on       Wednesday. Section 3 of this radical bill, which would       require Congressional approval of any monument extension or       designation involving National Forest lands in Minnesota,       represents yet another direct attack on one of our nation's       bedrock conservation laws, and flatly ignores the       overwhelming public support for protecting unique and       sensitive federal lands and ocean areas through national       monument designations.        We urge the committee to consider the following during       markup of H.R. 3905 this week:        Contrary to the Intent of the Law--The Antiquities Act was       designed to allow for swift and necessary action, including       when Congress is either unable or unwilling to act, to       protect irreplaceable resources from potential threats. Not       only has the law successfully protected some of our nation's       most remarkable historical, cultural and natural treasures       for a century, Congress intentionally left this presidential       power intact when passing the Federal Land Policy and       Management Act of 1976 (signed into law by President Ford).        A Vote Against our Parks--Supporting any bill that would       undermine the Antiquities Act is a vote against parks. Nearly       half of America's national parks began as national monuments       including the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion, Muir Woods, and       Olympic National Parks; and over two-thirds of our national       monuments are managed by the National Park Service. Quite       simply, a vote against the Antiquities Act is a vote against       our national parks and monuments.        Federal Lands Belong to All Americans--The Antiquities Act       is used only to protect federal lands already owned by the       American public. By carving out an exception for national       forest lands within Minnesota, Section 3 of H.R. 3905 flies       in the face of our nation's shared public heritage and       disregards how dearly the public values iconic public lands       and waters, like Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and       Voyageurs National Park.        Bipartisan History--A signature achievement of President       Theodore Roosevelt, the Antiquities Act has been used by 16       presidents since its inception--8 Republicans and 8       Democrats.  [[Page H9488]]         Out of Step with the Public--This bill is wildly out of       step with the American public's support for our national       parks and monuments. Just this summer, a vast majority of the       2.8 million people who submitted comments on the issue raised       their voices in support of keeping our national monuments       protected just as they are. These voices made Secretary       Zinke's national monuments public comment period the largest       public comment period in the history of the Interior       Department. Across the West, public support for protecting       our national monuments has proven strong, and a significant       majority of Western voters oppose more mining and drilling on       public lands. According to Colorado College's Conservation in       the West Poll, 80% of western voters support ``future       presidents continuing to protect existing public lands as       national monuments.'' This poll reinforces other surveys that       document widespread public opposition to congressional       attacks on new parks. Americans want more protected public       lands, not less!        Opposed by Diverse List of Hundreds of Organizations--As       demonstrated by this letter as well as the attached letter       signed by nearly 200 organizations, a diverse array of local       and national organizations representing sportsmen, outdoor       recreation businesses, local chambers of commerce, cultural       heritage, historic preservation and conservation have       consistently opposed efforts to undermine the Antiquities Act       in any form.        Disregards Local Economies--Economic research shows that       national monuments support the growth of local economies,       bringing in tourism and recreation dollars and boosting the       quality of life. The Outdoor Industry Association reported       this year that public lands like our national monuments help       support 7.6 million jobs in America, and $887 billion in       outdoor recreation activity.        Monuments Protect our Shared History and Culture--In       response to broad community input, sites honoring America's       military and outdoor heritage, as well as those expanding the       diversity of our national park system to better recognize the       contributions and histories of Native Americans, Hispanics       and African-Americans have been designated under the       Antiquities Act. These monuments include Fort Ord, Fort       Monroe, Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers, Harriet Tubman       Underground Railroad, Chimney Rock, Organ Mountains-Desert       Peaks, Cesar E. Chavez and many more.        Recent attacks on national monuments, from President       Trump's executive order, to Interior Secretary Zinke's hasty       and arbitrary review of these magnificent places, to       legislative proposals like H.R. 3905 are a smokescreen for       other uses of these special places.        Thank you for considering our concerns. In order to       adequately protect iconic places like the Boundary Waters,       Voyageurs National Park, and all of Minnesota's shared public       resources, we urge you to vote no on H.R. 3905.            Sincerely,        American Bird Conservancy, American Rivers, Boundary Waters       Trust, Center for Biological Diversity, Conservation Lands       Foundation, Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, Earthworks,       Endangered Species Coalition, Environment America,       Environmental Law & Policy Center, Environmental Protection       Information Center, Friends of the Earth, Hip Hop Caucus,       League of Conservation Voters, National Parks Conservation       Association, Natural Resources Defense Council, Northeastern       Minnesotans for Wilderness, Sierra Club, Southern Utah       Wilderness Alliance, Tuleyome, The Wilderness Society,       Wilderness Watch.                                   ____                                                  November 28, 2017.        Dear Representative:  On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters, we urge you to OPPOSE H.R. 3905, the so-      called ``Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National       Forest Act,'' when it is considered on the House floor.        Simply put, H.R. 3905 is a bill to allow sulfide-ore mining       at the edge of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness       (BWCAW), directly threatening one of America's most-      accessible and most-visited Wilderness Areas. At 1.1 million       acres in size, the BWCAW is the largest Wilderness east of       the Rockies and north of the Everglades. This interconnected       system of lakes, rivers, and streams provides unparalleled       opportunities for solitude, recreation, hunting and fishing.       The connections between Northern Minnesota's national       forests, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Voyageurs       National Park, and Quetico Provincial Park makes this entire       transboundary area extremely susceptible to the threat of       pollution from sulfide-ore mining, one of the most toxic       industries in America, according to the Environmental       Protection Agency.        H.R. 3905 would require congressional approval of any       mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving National       Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota and would       provide for the perpetual renewal of federal mineral leases       in Minnesota, including two that were denied by the Forest       Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The bill       undermines the Antiquities Act, National Environmental Policy       Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Boundary Waters       Wilderness Act, and other laws regulating mineral leasing in       Minnesota's national forests.        Contrary to the bill's title, H.R. 3905 would do more harm       than good for the economy of Northern Minnesota. Economic       analysis by Key-Log Economics LLC shows that sulfide-ore       mining on Superior National Forest lands in the watershed of       the Boundary Waters could lead to the loss of nearly 5,000       jobs in tourism, 5,000 to 22,000 jobs in the rest of the       economy, a $1.6 billion loss in annual income, and a $500       million reduction in private property values.        Specifically, we urge opposition to this bill because it       would:        Renew two expired and undeveloped mineral leases on       Superior National Forest lands next to the Boundary Waters       and along lakes and rivers that flow directly into the       Wilderness, advancing a foreign mining company's interests at       the expense of beloved American public lands.        Void the December 2016 record of decision by the Forest       Service withholding its consent to two mineral lease renewal       requests in the Superior National Forest due to the       unacceptable risks to this watershed, which according to the       Forest Service holds 20 percent of the National Forest       System's fresh water supply.        Undermine the National Environmental Policy Act by limiting       review of these two mineral leases to a 30-day environmental       assessment. Contrary to the bill language, there is no       `pending EA.' However, this section would override the       ongoing two-year Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)       initiated by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management       to carefully consider the potential impacts of sulfide-ore       mining on the Boundary Waters watershed. The ongoing EIS is       strongly supported by Minnesota's Governor Dayton and by the       citizens of Minnesota. More than 79% of Minnesota voters       support the study, while more than 126,000 citizens submitted       comments during the scoping phase.        Amend the 1906 Antiquities Act by mandating Congressional       approval for any national monument designations in       Minnesota's national forests. The Antiquities Act is a       bipartisan conservation law, which has been used by       Presidents of both parties, to protect irreplaceable federal       lands from potential threats. Monument designations under the       Antiquities Act have provided protection for areas including       the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion, Muir Woods, and Olympic       National Parks. Quite simply, this attack on the Antiquities       Act is an attack against our national parks and monuments.        Amend the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act       (FLPMA) by mandating Congressional approval for mineral       withdrawals in Minnesota's national forests. Additionally,       FLPMA intentionally left intact the presidential power to       protect public lands as monuments.        Bar the Forest Service from complying with its legal       obligations under the 1978 Boundary Waters Wilderness Act. In       this Act Congress requires the Forest Service to maintain the       high-water quality of the Boundary Waters and a Mining       Protection Area within the Superior National Forest. The       Forest Service concluded that sulfide-ore mining near the       Boundary Waters would be ``contrary to Congress'       determination that it is necessary to `protect the special       qualities of the [BWCAW] as a natural forest-lakeland       wilderness ecosystem of major esthetic, scientific,       recreational and educational value to the Nation.' '' Make       all mineral leases on Minnesota's national forests       essentially perpetual. The `perpetual' nature of these leases       is material change in long-standing mineral leasing law and       policy. The bill would also override the two laws (1946 and       1950) on mineral leasing in Minnesota's national forests that       require Forest Service consent to any mining.        Ignore the request of the International Joint Commission       that environmental review of impacts on transboundary water       quality and cumulative effects be studied and the requests of       four tribal entities (the area is Ceded Territory).        Thank you for considering our concerns. In order to       adequately protect iconic places like the Boundary Waters,       Voyageurs National Park, and all of Minnesota's public lands,       and bedrock environmental laws like the Antiquities Act and       the National Environmental Policy Act, we urge you to OPPOSE       H.R. 3905.

[[Page H9489]]                                          ____    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we oppose the overall rule, but I will say  to the gentlewoman that we would have no problem even with the closed  rule on the brownfields bill, which is one of the bills that I think  has bipartisan support and reflects a legitimate process.   What we have a problem with is H.R. 3905, which we think is a  corporate giveaway that puts treasured public lands in the hands of a  Chilean mining conglomerate, and we think that is wrong.   I agree with the gentlewoman that we ought to be doing important  business here, but I would argue that, rather than rewarding some  Chilean mining conglomerate, the more important business would be  making sure we keep the government open, because we have a government  shutdown fast approaching on December 8.   I would say to the gentlewoman that we have got to pass the Dream Act  and help 800,000 people whose lives have been thrown into turmoil  because of this President.                                time  1345    We ought to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program. We ought  to debate flood insurance. We ought to pass additional hurricane  relief. We ought to address funding for the Vets Choice Program. That  is more important, that is more vital to the national interest than  basically rewarding some Chilean mining conglomerate.   Finally, I would say to my colleagues here that we will ask you to  vote to defeat the previous question. We will ask you to defeat the  previous question so we can bring up and have a vote on a bill that  will require this President and all Presidents and all party nominees  to release their taxes.   I think the American people have a right to know where the conflicts  of interest are with this White House. I think they have a right to  know who benefits from this tax bill that we know is a giveaway to  corporations that will raise taxes on millions of middle class  families. They have a right to know who benefits from this.   I am astounded that the bar keeps on getting lower and lower and  lower for my Republican friends. I mean, we have daily offensive  tweets. We have irrational statements that come out of this White House  on a daily basis, and there is silence.   When it comes to transparency, when it comes to making sure that  there are no conflicts of interest, my Republican colleagues will not  even allow us to have a vote on basically requiring this President and  all Presidents to release their tax returns. That is not passing  judgment on this President. It would be a requirement of all Presidents  and nominees.   Basically, it is saying, let the sunshine in. Let us make sure that  there are no conflicts of interest. That ought to matter, because  everything that comes out of this House seems to be directed at helping  those who are well-off and well-connected.   Every corporation is cheering when this House comes up with  legislation, whether it is on tax reform or whether it is on helping  mining companies, because it always seems to benefit those who are the  most well-off.   Well, it is about time we put people first. It is about time the  American people know what is going on in this government. Let the  sunshine in. There is nothing wrong with that. We are doing it this way  because it is the only avenue available for us to bring this to a vote,  because the Rules Committee and the leadership in this House shuts off  debate on issues that they find uncomfortable.   This is supposed to be the people's House, not the Russia House. We  ought to be a place where we have deliberative engagements, where we  discuss important issues, where we do things that benefit the American  people.   I would say to my colleagues again, vote ``no'' on the previous  question so we can have this debate. If you want to help the President  cover up his tax returns, fine. You can vote ``no,'' but we ought to  have a vote.   I don't know why this is so controversial. It, to me, is a no- brainer. Vote ``no'' on the previous question and vote ``no'' on the  rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. McKinley and Mr. Emmer, for their  work on these important bills. I want to thank my colleague, Mr.  McGovern. I am glad to hear him say that they want to put people first.   Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we are doing; whether we are  talking about our tax bill, which is going to put money back in  people's pockets; whether we are talking about repealing and replacing  ObamaCare, which we have passed through this House; whether we are  talking about defense spending that is going to protect the people of  this Nation.   All across Wyoming, Mr. Speaker, I know my constituents are very  grateful that we are now suddenly putting people first after years of  putting the government first. We are not doing that anymore, Mr.  Speaker.   It is true, this is the people's House. And in this House, Mr.  Speaker, we ought to always live by and remember the rules of Alexander  Hamilton: ``Here, sir, the people govern.''   In this House, Mr. Speaker, we are charged with carrying out the  obligations of the people who elected us. The bills and the rule that  we are debating today do just that. Both of these bills are absolutely  critical for spurring economic development across our country.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of both the rule and of these  underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 631 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require       the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and       certain candidates for the office of the President, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and       Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 305.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative  [[Page H9490]]       Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th       edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the       previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is       generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority       Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
