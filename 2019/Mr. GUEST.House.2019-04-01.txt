 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today I rise in support of H.R. 1593, the CLASS Act.   While the Department of Homeland Security already coordinates its  policies relating to school security and safety across the Department,  codifying this council into law will ensure important channels for  information sharing and coordination are maintained during changes in  administration.   Currently, DHS utilizes a number of tools to assist in the protection  of our Nation's children. For example, the United States Secret Service  National  [[Page H2930]]  Threat Assessment Center has created an operational guide to provide  actionable steps that schools can take to develop specific violence  prevention plans for their students.   Additionally, DHS' Office of Academic Engagement, or OAE, supports  the Department's mission by building, improving, and leveraging  relationships with the academic community. OAE's work focuses on  outreach, engagement, and resiliency by supporting institutions of  higher learning and the K-12 community in preparing for, responding to,  and recovering from threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk.   OAE offers a Campus Resilience Program Resource Library, which  provides the academic community with access to guidelines, strategies,  and resources to address the risks and vulnerabilities on their campus.  The library is organized into categories according to a specific threat  or hazard as outlined in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's  National Preparedness Goal.   While numerous DHS components and agencies provide resources and  recommendations with regard to school security, it is imperative that  the work be done in unison and there is coordination across all  relevant agencies within DHS.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge adoption of this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 1590,  the Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act of 2019. This  legislation seeks to better position the United States Government and  relevant State, local, and private-sector agencies to detect and  prevent terrorist and foreign fighter travel.   In 2015, the Committee on Homeland Security developed a bipartisan  task force to investigate the threat from individuals leaving the  United States to join terrorist groups abroad. The task force reported  that nearly 4,500 individuals from Western countries, with over 250  from the United States, traveled to join Islamic terrorist groups. It  goes on to detail 32 findings and over 50 recommendations to address  this national security issue.   During both the 114th Congress and the 115th Congress, former  Representative and now Senator Martha McSally introduced this  legislation. Both times, the bill passed unanimously in the House.   Senator McSally previously stated: ``The abilities of these hardened  fighters to return to the United States is a legitimate security  concern to the homeland. Catching individuals who are looking to join  the ranks and train with ISIS and other terrorist organizations prior  to their initial departure is equally important and should be a goal  for law enforcement as well.''   Mr. Speaker, these words still ring true today. Just last year, an  Ohio man was arrested at the John Glenn International Airport trying to  fly to Kazakhstan. His intent was to be smuggled into Afghanistan to  train with ISIS with the possibility of conducting terrorist projects  in the United States.   According to an FBI release on this matter, when the terrorist was  asked what sort of training he wished to receive, he allegedly stated  that he wanted to receive ``weapons experts training, planning,  executing, hit and run, capturing high-value targets, ways to break  into homes and avoid security.''   The ability of these foreign fighters to return to the United States  is a legitimate security concern. Preventing their initial departure  should be a law enforcement priority as well.   Furthermore, last year, the White House released the National  Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel. It ``outlines how the United  States Government will expand coordination and maximize the full  capabilities of Federal departments and agencies to identify, detect,  and deter terrorists from transiting international borders.''   One of the Strategy's primary goals is to identify and deter  terrorists before they travel, to enhance intelligence gathering and  analysis, and to improve the sharing of terrorist-related identity  data.                                time  1630    H.R. 1590 complements and supports these efforts.   The bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination  with the appropriate Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial  agencies, foreign governments, and appropriate private-sector entities,  to develop and conduct an exercise related to the detection and  prevention of terrorist and foreign fighter travel.   The bill also requires the Secretary to produce an after-action  report to Congress, presenting the findings of the exercise and to  quickly incorporate those lessons learned into future operations of the  department.   Finally, it requires that the National Exercise Program be designed  to include emerging threats.   I cannot stress enough the importance of H.R. 1590. This bill  represents continued action in combating terrorism and ensuring the  safety of our Nation. As the threats of terrorism continue to evolve,  we must remain vigilant in our resolve to combat our enemies.   Our Nation's law enforcement, of all jurisdictions, whether it be  Federal or local, need to have access to the valuable information and  resources that this bill would provide so that our communities can be  protected from terrorist activity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this  bipartisan and commonsense bill. I urge the adoption of this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1589. We all know that  terrorist groups have long sought to develop capabilities to attack our  Nation with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials.   H.R. 1589 would address this threat by requiring the Office of  Intelligence and Analysis within the Department of Homeland Security to  conduct analysis of terrorist capabilities relating to chemical,  biological, radiological, and nuclear materials, as well as threats to  the homeland from global and infectious diseases.   To improve coordination with local law enforcement, H.R. 1589  requires the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to share threat  information not only with Federal entities, but also State, local,  Tribal, and territorial agencies.   I commend my colleague, Mr. Walker of North Carolina, for introducing  this important legislation, and I urge all Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
