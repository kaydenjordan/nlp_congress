 Mr. Speaker, Glenna Fouberg was a force  of nature. Her list of accomplishments makes that clear.   She made real and lasting contributions to at-risk youth, the board  of education, the Indian Education Summit, Teach for America, YMCA,  Northern State, and her church. She was named South Dakota Teacher of  the Year in 1994, and she was a member of the South Dakota Hall of  Fame. As I said, she was a force of nature.   But Glenna Fouberg was not a list of accomplishments to me, Mr.  Speaker. She was a friend. For 20 years, she gave me advice and  counsel. Like a good teacher, she always gave it to me straight.   She gave gifts like that to so many. Earlier this week, I was talking  to my friend Tom, who said that during the pandemic, 78-year-old Glenna  Fouberg, a force of nature and a legend, had been teaching his 12-year- old daughter how to knit.   When Glenna died in January, she left behind her loving family and  thousands of us to whom she had taught so much.                            ____________________
