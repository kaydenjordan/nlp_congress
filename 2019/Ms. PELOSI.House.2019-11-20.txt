 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for  yielding.   I salute him and Mr. McCaul, the ranking member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee. To you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. McCaul, thank you for  affording this opportunity to vote on the Hong Kong Human Rights and  Democracy Act.   This is a proud day for the U.S. Congress, for our values of freedom  and justice, and for the people of Hong Kong.   For 6 months, the people of Hong Kong have stirred the hearts of all  freedom-loving people with their extraordinary outpouring of courage  and their refusal to relinquish their demand for democracy, the  democratic freedoms, and the rule of law which was promised more than  two decades ago.   Today, the Congress is sending an unmistakable message to the world  that the United States stands in solidarity  [[Page H9094]]  with the freedom-loving people of Hong Kong, and we fully support their  fight for freedom.   We salute Chairman McGovern, a leading voice for human rights in  China and around the world, our Congressional-Executive Commission on  China chair and also chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Smith, just listening to him talk  about we are into our third generation of freedom-loving people in Hong  Kong.   I am so glad Mr. Smith acknowledged the work of our distinguished  former colleague, Frank Wolf, who was so, so very much a part and still  continues to be a spiritual leader to us in this regard.   We have worked with Martin Lee and Anson Chan way back when and--so  late 1980s, early 1990s--then into this new century with another  generation; and now, three generations, Martin Lee still being  involved, but with Joshua Wong and Nathan Wong and all of the young  participants who are there, because it is a sad situation.   In 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred Hong Kong to China,  America was hopeful that the people of Hong Kong would achieve the  ``high degree of autonomy''--that is in quotes--``high degree of  autonomy'' that they were promised. Today, it is beyond question that  China has utterly broken that promise.   America has been watching for years as the people of Hong Kong have  been increasingly denied their full autonomy and faced with a cruel  crackdown on their freedoms and an escalation of violence.   Most recently, the violent attacks against students at Hong Kong  Polytechnic University have shocked the world as unconscionable and  unacceptable.   More than 1,000 young people were denied food, water, first aid.  Scores were sent to the hospital for hypothermia after attempting to  escape through a sewer, and hundreds now languish in jail cells.   Right now, frightened parents of the students who remain on campus  are holding vigil outside, praying that their children will be safe,  clutching signs reading: ``Save the kids. Don't kill our children,''  and, ``They are children of God. Let them go.''   In the Congress, Democrats and Republicans stand united with the  protestors and with the people of Hong Kong. We have stood united in a  bipartisan way.   It has been a very unifying issue for us, whether we are talking  about the autonomy of Tibet that the Chinese are trying to destroy, the  culture, the language, and the region of Tibet; the Uighurs, where 1,  2, 3, maybe 3 million Uighurs are under education camps, which the  Chinese Government says they really enjoy being in--Oh, really?--or  human rights violations, suppression of human rights throughout all of  China.                                time  1545    If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of  commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out on human  rights elsewhere.   Since Tiananmen Square, many of us in a bipartisan way have been  fighting this fight, and we have seen that commercial interests always  win the fight. It has always for them been about money.   To those who take the repressive Chinese Government's side, I say:  What does it profit a person to gain the whole world and suffer the  loss of his soul?   Today the House is proud to once again pass the bicameral, bipartisan  Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to reaffirm America's  commitment to human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in the face  of Beijing's crackdown.   I see we have been joined by the distinguished ranking member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. McCaul. I thank him for his leadership  in bringing this legislation to the floor. I acknowledged him earlier,  along with our distinguished chairman, Mr. Engel.   We are proud to pass the Senate version of Chairman McGovern's  Protect Hong Kong Act to suspend sales on dangerous munitions to the  Hong Kong police, and we also salute Senator Merkley in his leadership  in passing that on the Senate floor.   The future of Hong Kong, the future of autonomy, freedom, and justice  for millions is at stake. America must take a stand with Hong Kong. I  am so pleased that we are making our statement in Congress in the House  and in the Senate on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans  unified in speaking out for democracy.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on both of these bills.
