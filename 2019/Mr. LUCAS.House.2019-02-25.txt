 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 539, the Innovators to  Entrepreneurs Act of 2019.   H.R. 539 extends the outreach of the National Science Foundation's  Innovation Corps program, also known as I-Corps.  [[Page H2057]]    I-Corps trains and prepares scientists and engineers to take their  research from the lab and turn it into commercial products and  services.   Research labs are making breakthroughs in new fields like quantum  computing, artificial intelligence, and bioengineering. These  breakthroughs will continue to transform our lives and the world we  live in.   But many scientists and engineers are not trained for commercializing  these discoveries and did not go to business school or take any  business development classes. I-Corps gives researchers the tools to  maximize the taxpayer investment in basic research and spur innovation.   H.R. 539 expands the eligible pool for I-Corps courses and allows a  portion of Federal small business grants be used to cover I-Corps  training expenses.   The bill also allows any private citizen to apply to participate and  pay out-of-pocket.   Finally, H.R. 539 authorizes a new I-Corps boot-camp course that  teaches valuable skills, like structuring a company, attracting  investors, and hiring staff.   In my district, Oklahoma State University has a successful support  system for business startups, both on and off campus. I-Corps is a key  part of that system, helping students and faculty learn how to  commercialize their ideas and build a business.                                time  1700    H.R. 539 will help programs like the one at OSU grow and become self- sustaining.   I want to thank Representative  Dan Lipinski and Representative  Dan  Webster for their work on this legislation. I also want to thank my  friend and our new chairwoman of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee, Eddie Bernice Johnson, for her work in advancing this  bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Webster).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for his  dedicated and diligent work over this decade on this subject matter. I  think we will all be better off for it. I know those folks who utilize  the program and will have greater opportunities to utilize the program  will benefit all of us as a society.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dr. Neal Dunn and Congressman Conor Lamb  for their work to support our Nation's veterans.   H.R. 425 will help veterans put their training and experience in  military service to new and important uses and help America stay  competitive in research and innovation on a global scale.   In the last decade alone, jobs requiring some level of STEM expertise  have grown by more than 30 percent, including jobs that do not require  a bachelor's degree.   Nearly 7 million jobs are unfulfilled in the United States due to a  shortage of skilled workers, many in STEM and related fields.   In my State of Oklahoma, our universities estimate we have 2,000 open  engineering jobs. At the same time, veterans and transitioning  servicemembers represent a valuable, skilled talent pool from which to  meet this critical need.   H.R. 425 will improve outreach to veterans through the National  Science Foundation's programs to support and train STEM workers. We can  serve our veterans and help them translate their experience into  meaningful STEM work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn), one of the great proponents of veterans and a great  proponent of moving us forward in the scientific perspective in this  Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I note that I  think the gentleman from Florida, Dr. Dunn, very eloquently summed it  up just moments ago. Veterans deserve every opportunity to transition  back and to utilize those skills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
