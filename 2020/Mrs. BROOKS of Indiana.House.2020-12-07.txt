 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from  Michigan for organizing this really important Special Order.   I have to say, many of you probably heard the phrase, a politician  thinks about the next election, but it is a statesman who thinks about  the next generation.     Greg Walden of Oregon is both. He is an amazing politician, but he  is an even more important statesman for our next generation.   Representative Walden has been a mentor to many. When he was chair of  NRCC, he mentored and helped so many people become a part of this great  institution. But then he mentored people like me, along with  Representative Upton of Michigan, to make it to the Committee on Energy  and Commerce, where I knew that big things got done and that the world  was our jurisdiction.   Not only was he a mentor, but he rose to chair of that committee, and  he did it with humility, he did it with humor, he did it with wisdom.  And I am so glad you talked about all of the things he accomplished,  but he always reminded us that he was an Oregon broadcaster, first and  foremost, and that he loved his incredible State of Oregon, and was  such a leader.   Mr. Speaker, it has been my pleasure--and my husband David's  pleasure--to travel with he and Mylene, and more importantly, most  recently, to get to know his son, that next generation of leaders,  Anthony.   I thank you for the opportunities you gave me and so many of my  colleagues. I wish you the best in retirement. You have been an amazing  mentor, an amazing friend, and an amazing leader in this country. You  are a statesman, my friend.
