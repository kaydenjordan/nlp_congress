 Mr. Speaker, I regret that I was unable to vote on  Monday, March 2, 2020, as I was unavoidably detained in my district.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 79, the  Fair Debt Collection Practices for Servicemembers Act, H.R. 5003 and  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 80, the ensuring Chinese Debt Transparency Act,  H.R. 5932.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
