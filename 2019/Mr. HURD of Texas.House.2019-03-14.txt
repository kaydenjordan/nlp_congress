 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  indulgence.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution because I want the  whole truth and nothing but the truth to come to light in this matter;  I want to know what Vladimir Putin did to our electoral process; I want  to know the failures of the Obama administration in reacting to this  attack in real time; I want any Americans complicit to face severe  consequences; and I want the American people to know as much as they  can and see as much as they can.   As a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,  I support the efforts and the request for all information pertaining to  this investigation to be open to the public. That includes all witness  lists, every interview transcript, and every document provided.   The taxpayers paid millions for this information, and they should get  to see all of it and not just the assessment of one person.   This resolution should have been broader; it should have been deeper;  and it should have covered everything dealing with the investigation.  But it is a step in the right direction.   I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle accept the calls  for all the information to be made public because full transparency is  the only way to prevent future speculation. Full transparency is the  only way to prevent future innuendo.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
