 Madam President, I want to continue to talk about some of  the challenges the administration is facing and the country is facing.  Let me talk for just a little bit about the border, about the economy,  and about our ongoing concerns on COVID.   First of all, the border--we have had a number of people come to the  floor and talk about the border, the problems at the border. Many of  these problems were really self-inflicted on day 1. The President, on  the first day of his Presidency--and I chaired the inauguration on  January 20. Hours after that, the President decided to stop building  the wall.   I was never an advocate of needing a wall everywhere along the  southern border, but we had a wall in lots of places already. It was  doing some good, but it wasn't doing as much good as it needed to do.  And just the idea that we--with the material on the ground and the old  wall torn down--would decide to stop building the wall, I think,  started these problems.    And if that wasn't enough, then-President Trump had made  arrangements, the State Department had made arrangements--everybody  involved--with Mexico to have people who were applying for asylum wait  for their court date in Mexico. It was my view at the time that we  should do anything we could to help the Mexican Government make that  work because the alternative was people would come into the United  States and not show up for an asylum date later.   In Mexico, they have learned that they weren't going to qualify for  asylum because fewer than--9 out of 10 people, roughly, will not  qualify. You found that out before you got into the United States and  successfully had entered our country, even though you weren't eligible  to. If you were waiting in Mexico and you found a lawyer to talk to and  maybe even a way to hear your case in some way there, you would find  out that you weren't going to qualify for asylum 8\1/2\ times or 9  times out of 10, and that is where you should have found that out.   To come in the country and wait for months to have a court date that  you may or may not show up for just simply has not worked, and  everybody that understands this system understands it doesn't work. And  everybody that understands the obligation of a government understands  that a government has some obligation to control its own borders, and  you don't control your own borders by having people come into the  country that aren't legally eligible to come into the country and then  just stay here. So that policy produced real chaos.   And then title 42, under the public health law, was another thing  that we put in place, as we put all kinds of other COVID-related  protections in place. And now we want to eliminate title 42. The only  place, apparently--if you follow the CDC closely right now--that we  don't need to up our game on COVID protection is the border of the  United States.   None of these things makes sense. We have too many people who have  been encouraged wrongly and told: You come to the United States, you  ask for asylum, they let you into the United States, and then you don't  show up for your asylum hearing.   I am for legal immigration. I am for solving the Dreamer problem. I  am for doing a lot of things that we need to do to make our immigration  laws work properly.  [[Page S2312]]    We need to understand the workforce needs of the country. We need to  understand what to do about people who came or stayed illegally. But we  also need to understand how to secure the border. And that is where,  for any of these other things to work, you have to do that.   The COVID problem, as I said, appears to only be a problem at the  CDC--well, actually, it appears to be a problem everywhere but the  border. The CDC, just yesterday, had a new rule that even for domestic  travel, people should now--their advice is have a test for domestic  travel--before you get on an airplane to go domestically, to have that  test.   The efforts that we were working on and working hard on to replenish  the categories that have been spent for research, particularly for the  therapeutics that we need to have a stock of that haven't been fully  certified yet--so they have to be the Government is the purchaser of  those--we were working on a $10 billion bill. And even this morning  again, the Secretary of Commerce, at our appropriations hearing, said:  Well, that would just be a start. We need 10 or 20 or 30 billion more  before the end of this fiscal year than we currently have, and it is an  emergency--10, 20, 30 billion more than we have now.   But at the border, no problem at all. At the border, this is no  problem. We need billions of dollars to deal with it internally. We  need to not only have fewer tests, which everybody agrees, fewer  standards for domestic travel; we now need a new standard, they say,  for domestic travel. Surely they will think about that. And while we  are negotiating, again, spending, this issue comes out simultaneously  that the border is a problem.   And then, of course, everybody knows the economy is a problem. All  you have got to do to find out the economy is a problem is go to the  gas station or go to the grocery store, and most Americans do that and  do it a lot. And when gas prices go up, when food prices go up, every  family knows it.   What we are seeing now is inflation that I think it is 8.5 percent.  It may be settling in at 8.5 percent. But wherever it settles in, it is  a whole lot higher than it was at any time during the Obama  administration. The highest month in the entire Obama administration of  inflation--that is not a year average--the highest single month was 3.4  percent. Under President Trump, the highest single month was 2.9  percent. We are now at 8.5 percent, and the Producer Price Index has  been in double digits since December. That is usually a sign that the  other index is going to follow that double-digit, scary number that is  out there.   So energy policies that produced exactly the result you would think  they would: higher energy prices; spending policies: the American  Rescue Plan. I thought, at the time, it was a final COVID bill, but  when you looked at the bill before we had a chance to vote on it and  saw it, it really didn't have very much to do with COVID. Maybe 6  percent of the $1.9 trillion went to COVID. The rest of it went to  things that put money in people's pockets to help them recover in an  economy that was already recovering.   You can't spend $1.9 trillion in a short period of time, even in the  biggest and most vibrant economy in the world, and not drive up prices.  So whether it is inflation, whether it is the economic stress--I talked  to a group of Missouri realtors today, and, of course, they are  beginning to see people wonder if they can afford a house at the  interest rates that are out in front of us. It makes a big difference  if the interest payment is based on 3.5 percent interest or 5.5 or 6.5  or 7.5 or, as it was in the mid 1980s, 11 to 15 percent interest.   These are issues we need to get under control. Most of these issues  have an explanation that is rooted in confused policy decisions in the  administration.   I look forward to those confused policy decisions heading in a  different direction. Let's look at the information. Let's be realistic.  Let's not continue to see all of these things headed in a direction  that makes no common sense in America today.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
