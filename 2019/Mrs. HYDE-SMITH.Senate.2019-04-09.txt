 Madam President, I am pleased to commend LCDR Steven  Davies for his dedication to duty and service as a U.S. Coast Guard  congressional fellow on my staff. Steve was recently selected to serve  as executive officer of USCGC Thetis and will soon depart to fulfill  that important responsibility.   A native of Lebanon, PA, Steve was commissioned after his graduation  from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, where he earned a bachelor of  science degree in management, served as vice president of his class,  and captained the men's soccer team. He is in the process of earning a  master's degree.   Steve has served in a broad range of assignments during his Coast  Guard career. He has served overseas in Kuwait and deployed with Patrol  Forces Southwest Asia in support of Operations Iraqi and Enduring  Freedom, conducted national security missions on five ships in the  Arabian Gulf. In addition to deployments overseas, he has served in  vital roles in support of U.S. security interests. As commanding  officer of USCGC Sailfish, he led search and rescue operations and  various law enforcement missions in the Port of New York and New  Jersey. As Commanding Officer of USCGC Kathleen Moore, Steve led a 26- person crew that interdicted $18 million of cocaine and nearly 700  undocumented migrants attempting to reach the United States.   Most recently, Steve served as the congressional fellow on my staff  and, prior to that, for the Honorable Senator Thad Cochran of  Mississippi. Steve's operational experience in the Gulf of Mexico,  Southwest Asia, and the Arabian Gulf, in addition to his technical  expertise in counterdrug and migrant interdictions, search and rescue  operations, and law enforcement missions, have been pivotal in helping  to shape Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard  appropriations for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.   As a congressional fellow, he has served the State of Mississippi,  the Coast Guard, and our Nation admirably. My staff and I have enjoyed  the benefit of Steve's counsel and have truly enjoyed working with him.  Steve's leadership has brought great credit to the Coast Guard, and I  appreciate and commend his commitment to continue to serve our nation.   It is a pleasure to recognize and thank LCDR Steve Davies for his  service to this country. My staff and I extend our gratitude to Steve  and wish him ``Fair winds and following seas'' as he continues his  journey in the U.S. Coast Guard.                            ____________________
