 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Mississippi for  hosting this Special Order tonight.   The National Guard is a special group in every one of our States.  They are the everyday citizens, your neighbors, your coworkers, and  your friends who choose to use their free time to serve their community  and protect their fellow Americans.   The Oklahoma National Guard is an exceptional group of men and women  who have responded to the call of duty time and time again. Over the  past few years, the Oklahoma National Guard has shown their dedication  to our country numerous times from supplying our States with  necessities as we navigated the pandemic to assisting our border agents  at the southern border and even representing Oklahoma in Washington,  D.C. I am proud of the work they have done on behalf of our State.   I can't mention the Oklahoma National Guard without honoring the  memory of an important constituent of mine, Technical Sergeant Marshal  Roberts, who served in the Oklahoma National Guard and was deployed to  Camp Taji when his team came under rocket fire on March 11, 2020. He  was killed in the attack, making the ultimate sacrifice for his Nation.   The day Sergeant Roberts' body landed in Tulsa was a day I will  remember forever. The Nation had just shut down due to the pandemic,  but that didn't stop Tulsans from lining the streets at the airport by  the thousands, a solemn show of gratitude and honor for Sergeant  Roberts, his wife, Kristie, his daughter, Paityn, and the entire  Roberts family.   I am glad to have this opportunity to share Sergeant Roberts' story  again on the floor of the United States House of Representatives and  join my colleagues in honoring and celebrating the incredible National  Guardsmen and women who serve us across this great country.
