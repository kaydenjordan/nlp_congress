 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of  2017, which would take a big step towards creating a more business- and  consumer-friendly insurance market that works for all Americans.   As I listened to the comments just before I stood up, I heard that  this is a fine bill. It is more than a fine bill. This is a good bill.  Let me tell you how I know it is a good bill--because, a few years ago,  both Nancy Pelosi and Mike Pence voted for it.   Now, what the Democrats don't want to tell you is that on February  24, 2010, less than a month before the Affordable Care Act was signed  into law, there was an agreement that allowing the insurance companies  to be exempt from the antitrust laws in the country was a problem.   So how is it that with a bill that passed 406 ``yes'' votes to 19  ``no'' votes--when it came out of the dark rooms, the Affordable Care  Act was brought to the floor with the comments of: Well, you will have  to read it to find out what is in it.  [[Page H2255]]    Perhaps the Democrats should have read it to find out what wasn't in  it, because the leadership not only sold America out, they sold them  out. This bill passed 406-19. Yet, in the back rooms where they put the  Affordable Care Act together, they didn't include the provision.   While the Affordable Care Act certainly has played a major role in  the disruptions patients and providers have experienced, the decades- old special exemption--which they voted to take away, and then the  leadership of the Democratic party gave it back to the insurance  industry--shielding insurers from Federal antitrust laws has eroded  confidence and competition in the marketplace. Fortunately, we have a  vehicle before us to walk back this special deal.   The legislation currently before the House would inject much-needed  competition into the health insurance market by eliminating the  antitrust exemptions for health and dental insurers, leveling the  playing field and giving consumers and providers more leverage and  better options. There are very few antitrust exemptions in our country,  and for good reason.   This exemption is not only damaging to the consumer when they  purchase health insurance, but it damages the healthcare providers,  further limiting consumers' access to services.   The dominance of the market that large insurers have enjoyed has  forced many providers to move, close, merge, or sell to larger regional  hospitals, impacting parties across the industry. In the 24 counties of  Georgia that I represent, patients have few healthcare choices left  that impacts their ability to receive quality care and negotiate a  policy that meets their unique needs.   Echoing that sentiment, I think anyone who has skin in the game will  tell you that a majority of the problems in the healthcare marketplace  trace their roots back to a lack of competition.                                time  1245    Yet, the Democrats left the insurance industry exempt from the  antitrust laws once again when they passed the Affordable Care Act.   While insurance companies have the power to negotiate, just as they  proved in the negotiations with the Democrats on the Affordable Care  Act, pharmacies, physicians, and hospitals are left without a seat at  the table. When the insurance companies get to determine who is and  isn't able to provide healthcare services, the insurer-provider  relationship is closer to extortion than negotiation.   So why do we allow the health insurance industry that controls,  through their contracts, who your doctor is, who your pharmacist is,  which medicine you can get, and which hospital you can go to, to be  exempt from the antitrust laws of the country? How could the Democrats  do that to you in the Affordable Care Act?   By definition, health care and health insurance are not the same  thing, but when one industry, one insurance company controls such  significant portions of the cash flow of all of the providers in a  region, no provider can stay in business without a contract with that  carrier; therefore, the insurance company gets to determine who is and  who is not able to provide health care.   Removing this antitrust exemption for health insurers means one more  option for consumers, increased competition between providers, and  greater certainty for insurers when it comes to hammering out policies  and working for consumers across the spectrum. It should have been done  long ago, but the Democrats turned their back on the American public  and, again, granted the health insurance industry an exemption from the  antitrust laws of the country.   While this is certainly not an end-all, be-all to reforming our  broken and dysfunctional healthcare system, it is a commonsense step  towards untangling the mess our health insurance marketplace has  become.   I also think it noteworthy to mention, again, February 24, 2010, the  Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act passed the House with a  vote 406-19 only 1 month prior to the Affordable Care Act being signed  into law. And yet, the American citizens, once again, were sold out by  the Democratic Party.   I strongly believe this piece of legislation currently before the  House lays a firm foundation in our work to fulfill our promise to fix  our badly broken healthcare system. Today we have the opportunity to  provide relief to consumers and providers alike, and I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 372, the Competitive Health  Insurance Reform Act of 2017.
