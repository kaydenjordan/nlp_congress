 Mr. President, last night, the country lost a giant of  Democratic politics, a kind and revered public servant, a Vice  President who reimagined the position and expanded Americans' views of  who could hold America's highest offices. Walter Mondale, known to  friends and foes alike as ``Fritz,'' died at the age of 93.   As President Carter's right-hand man, Fritz revolutionized the role  of the Vice Presidency. There is an old yarn about two brothers: One  went off to sea, and the other became Vice President. Neither was heard  from again. That is not true of Walter Mondale.   Walter Mondale was an uncooperative subject for those Vice  Presidential comedians. Not only was he often the last person in the  room with the President when the tough decisions were made, but he  became an unofficial ambassador for the administration. His  relationship with Prime Minister Begin of Israel helped paved the way  for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt at Camp David in 1978.   In his ultimately unsuccessful run for the Presidency, Walter  Mondale's pick of my fellow New Yorker, the late Geraldine Ferraro, as  Vice President was an early crack in the glass ceiling that our current  Vice President, Kamala Harris, would eventually shatter.   Vice President Mondale will be remembered as a lion of progressive  politics; an ardent defender of civil rights, aid to schoolchildren,  childcare, healthcare, and consumer protections. Mondale once said:         My whole life I worked on the idea that government can be       an instrument for social progress. We need that progress.       Fairness requires it.    Indeed, as Mondale said, we need government to make social progress.   As we say goodbye to one of our country's most decent public  servants, let us follow in his example.                                  Marijuana    Mr. President, now on a much different subject, today is what you  might call a very unofficial American holiday, 4/20. It is as  appropriate a time as any to take a hard look at our laws that have  overcriminalized the use of marijuana and put it on a par with heroin,  LSD, and other narcotics that bear little or no resemblance in their  effects  [[Page S2044]]  either on individuals or on society, more broadly.   The war on drugs has too often been a war on people, particularly  people of color. For decades, young men and women--disproportionately,  young men and women of color--have been arrested and jailed for even  carrying a small amount of marijuana, a charge that often came with  exorbitant penalties and a serious criminal record from which they  might never recover, being rejected from job after job because this  minor, minor deviation from the law was listed as a serious criminal  record.   It makes no sense. It is time for change. I believe the time has come  to end the Federal prohibition on marijuana in this country, and I am  working with Senators Booker and Wyden on legislation to do just that.  My thinking on this issue has evolved.   A number of States--including, very recently, my home State of New  York--have legalized the recreational use of marijuana for adults, and  those experiments, by and large, have been a success. The doom-and- gloom predictions, when States like Colorado or Oregon went forward and  decriminalized and legalized marijuana, never occurred.   In State after State, through ballot initiatives and constitutional  amendments, the American people are sending a clear message that they  want this policy changed. Senators Booker, Wyden, and I are going to  continue to work on our legislation, and in the near future, we hope to  have a draft of a comprehensive reform effort, not only to end the  Federal prohibition on marijuana but to ensure restorative justice,  protect public health, and implement responsible taxes and regulations.  This was the approach taken by legislators in New York. I believe it is  the right approach, and it serves as a model for how we should deal  with the issue in Congress.   Hopefully, the next time this unofficial holiday, 4/20, rolls around,  our country will have made progress in addressing the massive  overcriminalization of marijuana in a meaningful and comprehensive way                                Voting Rights    Mr. President, now on voting rights, today in the Judiciary  Committee, Senators will hear testimony from a number of public  officials and experts about the surge in voter suppression laws since  the 2020 election, including former Georgia gubernatorial candidate  Stacey Abrams.   These voter suppression laws--more than 250 proposed laws in more  than 40 States--constitute a grave and immediate threat to the very  core of our democracy. In ways both large and small, they seek to  restrict the franchise, often targeting minority communities, younger  voters, and dense urban districts.   Our Republican colleagues have tried in vain to defend these laws as  meaningful and appropriate protections against voter fraud. In many  cases, those attempts have been just laughable.   Just to take one example from earlier this week, the Republican-led  Montana State Legislature passed a law that ends election-day voter  registration and would no longer allow student IDs to be used as a sole  ballot form of identification. Just think about that for a moment. What  problems are the Republicans in Montana trying to solve there? Has  there been a rash of 40-year-olds showing up with student IDs to commit  voter fraud? No, there certainly hasn't been. We all know what is going  on here. Younger voters have been shown to be more Democratic. So  Montana Republicans have made it harder for them to vote. It is  despicable--just despicable--and these laws are moving through State  legislatures all across the country, including the most recent one in  Georgia, which, among other crucial reforms, makes it a crime--a  crime--to provide food and water to voters waiting in line at the  poles, even though in minority areas the lines are often much longer  because there are fewer polling places.   I know my Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee are going  to shine a spotlight on all of these efforts, and I applaud Chairman  Durbin for holding this very important hearing today. Voting rights are  a topic that deserves continued national attention. It is a top  priority for this Democratic Senate majority.                                 Puerto Rico    Finally, Mr. President, you couldn't find a better study in contrasts  than the Trump administration and the Biden administration. On so many  issues, the executive branch is finally returning to competence,  undoing the damage wrought by 4 years of Trump's Presidency.   One important example came last night. Beginning in 2017, the Trump  administration maliciously held back billions of dollars in  congressionally approved disaster aid to Puerto Rico, which was  devastated by Hurricane Maria, resulting in the deaths of thousands of  Americans. This was vicious on the part of Donald Trump--nasty, so  typical of the pettiness and inhumanity of his administration.   Well, the Biden administration has finally ended this appalling delay  and will release the much needed disaster relief funds that Puerto Rico  has waited for, for almost 5 years. The release of these funds means  the people of Puerto Rico can finally and fully rebuild their homes,  their schools, their businesses.   Puerto Rico, unfortunately, has too often been an afterthought to  work here in Washington. Funds that would normally go to any State  after a natural disaster like Hurricane Maria got delayed for years  over the course of an entire administration.   Puerto Ricans are American citizens and should be treated exactly as  such when disaster strikes. That is why, in the American Rescue Plan,  Democrats passed the largest, most comprehensive relief package for the  people of Puerto Rico in a long, long time. I am proud to have worked  with my House colleagues, particularly Representative Nydia Velazquez,  to get that done.   Prior to the American Rescue Plan, the Federal Government had never  supported Puerto Rico's tax credit for low-income workers. We did that  for the first time ever.   Shockingly, prior to the American Rescue Plan, only families with  three or more children in Puerto Rico could claim the child tax credit.  That seems, to me, to be racist in its application. We fixed that and  made sure that every family in Puerto Rico can claim the credit, just  like every other American family.   So as long as Democrats have a majority here in the Senate, I am  going to make sure that Puerto Rico is treated fairly and gets its fair  share of support. When it comes to this disaster aid, I am so glad the  Biden administration is rectifying the issue. I hope we never repeat  such a shameful delay.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the order of yesterday, the Senate recess from 12:30  p.m. until 2:15 p.m. and that at 2:15 p.m., the Senate proceed to  executive session to resume consideration of the Gensler nomination and  the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination; that  following the cloture vote, the Senate resume legislative session and  the Senate recess until 4 p.m. to allow for the all-Senators briefing;  further, that if cloture is invoked on the Gensler nomination, all  postcloture time be considered expired at 5 p.m.; that immediately  following the disposition of the Gensler nomination, the Senate resume  consideration of the Monaco nomination and vote on confirmation as  provided under the previous order; that if either nomination is  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; finally, that following the confirmation vote on the Monaco  nomination, the Senate resume legislative session.    Therefore, Senators should expect one rollcall vote at  2:15 p.m. and two rollcall votes at 5 p.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk due for a second reading en bloc.    Mr. President, in order to place the bills on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceeding en bloc.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, Tuesday,  April 20, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1260         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Endless Frontier Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) For over 70 years, the United States has been the       unequivocal global leader in scientific and technological       innovation, and as a result the people of the United States       have benefitted through good-paying jobs, economic       prosperity, and a higher quality of life.        (A) Today, however, this leadership position is being       eroded and challenged by foreign competitors, some of which       are stealing intellectual property and trade secrets of the       United States and aggressively investing in research and       commercialization to dominate the key existing and future       technology fields.        (B) While the United States once led the world in the share       of our economy invested in research, our Nation now ranks 9th       globally in total research and development and 12th in       publicly financed research and development.        (C) While wages for American workers rose in parallel with       growth in national productivity from the end of World War II       through most of the 1970s, since then wage growth has been       uneven and labor's share in national income has declined.        (2) Without a significant increase in investment in       research, education, technology transfer, intellectual       property, manufacturing, and other core strengths of the       United States innovation ecosystem, it is only a matter of       time before the global competitors of the United States       overtake the United States in terms of technological primacy.       The country that wins the race in key technologies--such as       artificial intelligence, quantum computing, advanced       communications, and advanced manufacturing--and uses       technological innovation to support high-quality jobs and       incomes will be the superpower of the future.        (3) The Federal Government must catalyze United States       innovation by boosting research investments focused on       discovering, creating, commercializing, and demonstrating new       technologies and manufacturing those technologies       domestically throughout the country to ensure the leadership       of the United States in the industries of the future.        (4) The distribution of innovation jobs and investment in       the United States has become largely concentrated in just a       few locations, while much of the Nation has been left out of       growth in the innovation sector. More than 90 percent of the       Nation's innovation sector employment growth in the last 15       years was generated in just 5 major metropolitan areas. The       Federal Government must address this imbalance in opportunity       by--        (A) dramatically increasing funding for science and       engineering research and expanding partnerships with the       private sector to build new technology hubs across the       country;        (B) spreading high-quality innovation sector jobs more       broadly;        (C) increasing the participation of underrepresented       populations, engaging workers, and collaborating with labor       organizations in innovation efforts to tap the talent and       potential of the entire Nation to ensure the United States       leads the industries of the future; and        (D) building regional capacity in such critical areas as       entrepreneurship, access to capital and other investment, and       supply chain development.        (5) As President Franklin D. Roosevelt stated, ``[N]ew       frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are       pioneered with the same vision, boldness, and drive with       which we have waged this war we can create a fuller and more       fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful life.''        (6) As Vannevar Bush stated in his 1945 report entitled       Science, The Endless Frontier, ``New products, new       industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to       knowledge of the laws of nature, and the application of that       knowledge to practical purposes. Similarly, our defense       against aggression demands new knowledge so that we can       develop new and improved weapons. This essential, new       knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific       research.''        (7) Since their inception, the National Science Foundation       and other key Federal agencies, like the Department of       Energy, have carried out vital work supporting basic and       applied research to create knowledge that is a key driver of       the economy of the United States and enhances the Nation's       security.
