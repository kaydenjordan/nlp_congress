 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remind this House of the  Democratic For the People agenda, which starts with rebuilding American  infrastructure and creating good paying jobs doing so.   It includes expanding healthcare so that it is available to more and  more Americans, and bringing down the costs of healthcare and  prescription drugs.   It includes cleaning up our American democracy and rooting out  corruption in our electoral process.   We achieved the third one this month with H.R. 1, the For the People  Act, but the other two took a serious blow this week when we saw the  President's budget, which cuts Medicare to the tune of $1.5 trillion  over the next 10 years, breaking a core promise of the President's  campaign, and also cuts infrastructure spending.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject that shortsightedness in  the President's budget, and let's go ahead and achieve the For the  People agenda.                            ____________________
