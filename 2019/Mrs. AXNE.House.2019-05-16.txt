 Mr. Speaker, Iowans are struggling to keep up with the  rising cost of prescription drugs.   A teacher in Farragut, who has had diabetes for 20 years, is spending  over $750 a month for insulin. That is a third of her take-home pay,  and she needs a second job just to cover her costs.   A woman from West Des Moines wrote to me that her medication used to  cost $50 for a 90-day supply and now that price has gone to $1,000. Her  family found they can buy the same medication in Canada for $60.   In fact, Americans pay more for prescription drugs than any other  country in the world. Brand-name drug manufacturers are gaming the  system to reap profits and they are using delay tactics to prevent  generic companies from bringing the same drugs to market.   I ran for Congress to protect Iowans, not Big Pharma. This bill will  help bring generics to market quicker to lower the cost for consumers  and save billions in taxpayer dollars.   No one should ever have to decide between putting food on the table  and taking their medicine.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation to lower  the cost of prescription drugs for all Iowans and Americans.                            ____________________
