 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Congresswoman  Waters, for standing up for consumers.   As I stand here today, first, let me just say I echo all of the  comments of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and I, too, rise  in opposition of H.R. 1699, a bill that would put the lowest income and  most vulnerable consumers at risk of becoming victims of predatory  lending. This bill would increase the chances of consumers being  steered into higher cost loans when they could otherwise qualify for  lower cost alternatives.   As an aside, it is quite interesting to sit here and listen to my  colleagues on the other side have such great interest in affordable  housing and low-income residents, and yet, as I have sat on the  Financial Services Committee, I have watched them repeatedly cut funds  to the budget for low-income residents and not stand up for some of the  statements when former Director Richard Cordray came in to talk about  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and what they have done to  stamp out this type of predatory lending.   It is also quite interesting, and I would be remiss not to mention,  that last week President Trump appointed the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, to lead the Bureau, yet he is the  same man who spent years trying to eliminate this organization, a man  who did not stand up for low-income, affordable housing.   Mr. Speaker, I will end by saying I think we need someone who can  stand up for consumers, and I am pleased to hear my colleagues say that  they believe in consumer protection and that they are going to advocate  for those with low income and they are going to stand up against  predatory lending. So it should be interesting, as we move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I am in opposition to H.R. 1699.
