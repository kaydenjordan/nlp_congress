 Mr. Speaker, the Biden war on fossil  fuels has already caused a 40-year high of inflation, harms families,  and continues to enrich war criminal Putin and force dependency on the  Chinese Communist Party for batteries.   Now the threat to American families has intensified, as explained in  a September 8 editorial by The Wall Street Journal. ``Oil prices have  climbed this week after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended their  production cuts. The Biden administration's response? Restrict U.S. oil  and gas development.   ``The Interior Department . . . canceled seven oil and gas leases in  Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . . .   ``Its climate agenda is also the most lawless and economically  destructive in history.   ``Russia is drilling in the Arctic and using it as a shipping route  to deliver oil to China. The administration's restrictions on U.S.  Arctic oil and gas development amount to unilateral energy  disarmament.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders. We  also extend our sympathy to the great people of Morocco.  [[Page H4239]]                                ____________________
