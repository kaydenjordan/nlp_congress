 Madam President, I rise today to honor the  achievements of Ms. Amy F. Woolf, a specialist in Nuclear Weapons  Policy with the Congressional Research Service, on the occasion of her  retirement.   Amy Woolf served the Congress with distinction for more than 34  years. Before joining CRS, she was a member of the research staff at  the Institute of Defense Analyses and spent a year at the Department of  Defense, where she contributed to the 1994 Nuclear Posture Review. She  earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Stanford  University and a master's degree in public policy from the Kennedy  School of Government at Harvard University.   Ms. Woolf is recognized throughout Congress, the military, and the  nuclear weapons and arms control communities as an expert on issues  related to U.S. and Russian nuclear forces and arms control. She has  authored countless CRS reports addressing issues such as nuclear  weapons strategy and doctrine, nuclear force structure, strategic arms  control and the U.S-Russian arms control agenda, hypersonic weapons,  and threat reduction programs in Russia and other former Soviet states.   A particular highlight of her tenure at CRS was her work supporting  the Congressional debate on the New START treaty in 2010. Her unique  knowledge of the issues positioned her as the go-to expert for members  of Congress and their staff with questions about the treaty. She  analyzed treaty provisions, helped staffers navigate false and  confusing claims about the treaty, and provided needed historical  context. She also gave seminars on the procedural aspects of  ratification. Throughout the time that Congress considered the treaty,  Ms. Woolf was available to members of Congress and their staff 7 days a  week and answered questions after hours. Her work for Congress on this  treaty lasted from the start of negotiations in 2009 through submission  to the Senate and ratification in December 2010.   In serving the CRS mission, Ms. Woolf helped members of Congress and  their staff navigate complex nuclear weapons issues by narrowing in on  their specific needs and succinctly providing them with accurate,  balanced, and complete information. She has equally served opponents  and supporters of nuclear arms control treaties. She answered questions  about the future of the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal from a variety of  congressional offices with diverse viewpoints. Ms. Woolf participated  in seminars for congressional staff on a regular basis and could shift  seamlessly from a 101-style overview of basic nuclear concepts for  freshly minted Capitol Hill staffers to a lengthy in-depth briefing on  U.S. nuclear posture and deterrence issues that would offer new insight  to even the most seasoned policy advisor. Because of her three decades  assisting Members of Congress and their staff, she demonstrated the  keen ability to read her audience well and discern what information  will be most useful to them. In an exceptional moment in 2018, the  chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee recognized her work  from the dais after a hearing on Presidential authority over nuclear  weapons. This followed a personal briefing for the chairman and prep  work for the committee staff.   Ms. Woolf also earned a reputation in CRS for her tireless work to  educate new analysts, researchers, and congressional staff. She is  widely recognized in the policy community throughout the United States  for her depth of knowledge, her understanding of both nuclear weapons  capabilities and arms control, and her ability to clearly express  complex issues associated with both. Ms. Woolf has been an  indispensable asset to the U.S. Congress. I am proud to say she is also  a Marylander.   Amy Woolf's deep well of knowledge and expertise will be sorely  missed in the halls of Congress and throughout the nuclear policy  community. Her colleagues and I join in wishing her all the best as she  begins this next chapter in retirement.                            ____________________
