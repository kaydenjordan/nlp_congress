 Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from South  Dakota's talking about this issue before us this week, which is these  1332 waivers, and he is absolutely right. Millions of Americans are  getting less expensive healthcare. Isn't that the whole idea here, that  healthcare needs to be affordable and that we need to have good,  quality healthcare?   There is nothing in these waivers--by the way, many of which are  going to States that have Democratic Governors--that prohibits people  from getting coverage for preexisting conditions. In fact, that is the  law of the land, so that these 1332 waivers cannot take away people's  rights to healthcare should they have preexisting conditions.   I think this is the sort of thing we ought to be supporting in this  Chamber, there being more affordable healthcare and healthcare for  people who otherwise couldn't afford it.                                Appropriations    Mr. President, my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, is on the  floor. We discussed earlier that we are actually legislating today. I  think that it is great because we are passing spending bills. The  Senate will pass four different spending bills, and she will manage all  four of them. These are bipartisan bills that will end up getting  passed here in this Chamber this week that will then go over to the  House where they will be conferenced with the five bills they have  passed. The bills aren't that far apart in terms of the total amount of  money each bill has in the so-called 302(b) category, but there are  some differences. We will work those out, and we will, hopefully, get  those to the President for his signature. That is how this place should  operate.                                  H.R. 3055    Mr. President, Senator Collins' bill is the transportation bill. This  one is  [[Page S6211]]  particularly important to my State of Ohio and to other States around  the country that are desperate for some more funding for  infrastructure.   Specifically, in her transportation bill, she deals with these  bridges that need to be replaced that are obsolete, and many are  dangerous. We have one in Ohio, called the Brent Spence Bridge, which  is not only obsolete but has no shoulder anymore because it keeps  having to be widened to accommodate the traffic. So it makes it very  dangerous. We have been trying for years to get the funding for that.  This bill has some funding that will help with regard to these kinds of  bridges that have heavy traffic but are unsafe.   This is what we ought to be doing around here. Let's get this done.  It is infrastructure. It is something we should be able to agree on as  Republicans and Democrats because it is good for the people we  represent. So I thank the Senator from Maine for her work on that.                            Workforce Development    Mr. President, I am here to talk about the historic workforce needs  we have in this country and, if we do the right things to respond to  it, the historic opportunity we have to bring people out of the shadows  and into work by providing them with the skills they need to be able to  access the jobs that are out there.   Pro-growth Federal policies, including the tax reform we passed here,  the tax cuts, the regulatory relief, and some of the things we have  done with regard to opening up more energy resources, are helping to  boost job creation, increase wages, and grow our economy. As an  example, the most recent data from the Commerce Department shows that  the economy grew by a healthy 2.6 percent in the first half of this  year and that official unemployment is now down to 3.5 percent. That is  the lowest it has been in 50 years. So the economy is moving.   To me, what is most exciting is that we are seeing solid wage growth  for the first time in years. In just over the past couple of years,  nonsupervisory employees, including blue-collar workers, have seen  about a 6-percent increase in their wages. That is about $1.30 per  hour. Think about that. After a decade--really, a decade and a half--in  my home State of flat wages, which are wages that haven't keep up with  inflation, we now see real wage growth. Now, over 2 years, 6 percent at  $1.30 an hour means something to the people I represent, but it will  also be compounded year after year if we continue this.   This is all great news for the people I represent. They have been  frustrated. They work hard, play by the rules, do the right thing, and  then they can't get ahead. Now they are starting to get ahead, and that  is good. I hear from small business owners in Ohio who have been able  to do a lot with the tax cuts and tax reform by creating new jobs and  making new investments. Everyone has. I have literally met with dozens  of small businesses around our State and have had roundtable  discussions.   I have asked them specifically: What happened with regard to the tax  relief? Where is it going? It is going toward better equipment and  better technology. Therefore, there is better productivity from  workers. It is going to higher wages, and it is going to better  benefits for workers.   For the past 18 months, we have seen more job openings in America  than there have been people who have been looking for work. Think about  that. Consistently, every month for the past 18 months, we have had  more job openings out there than there have been people who have been  looking for work. At no time in this century has that happened. This is  precedent-setting, and it is a good thing. It is all good news, but it  is not the whole story.   Part of the story is that we are still seeing a lot of individuals  who are missing the benefits of this economic expansion. Why? In part,  they don't have the skills that are needed to take advantage of this  economic growth. You have more jobs out there than you have people who  are looking. Yet you have this skills gap that keeps us from being able  to have the right people in the right place for the right jobs.   I hear from a lot of employers who say they cannot continue to grow  if they cannot find these workers. Some companies even say they are  going to have to leave Ohio or leave the United States if they don't  have the workforces because a workforce, like other inputs, is very  important to our having a competitive economy. So we have to solve this  problem.   In Ohio and elsewhere, there are now thousands of job openings for  positions for welders and machinists in factories, for medical  technicians in hospitals, and for computer programmers and coders in  almost every sector of our economy. This morning, if you go to  ohiomeansjobs.com, you will see some of these jobs advertised. There  are about 150,000 jobs out there. These jobs that you will see are what  economists call middle-skills jobs. They don't require one to have a  college degree, but they do require one to have some training and  expertise after high school.   What we have to do is to close that skills gap by providing more of  this training and education for these workers. The supply of skilled  workers in this category--students who pursue post-high school  certificates--falls way short of the demand that is out there, and it  is holding back our economy from fulfilling its potential.   In the most recent skills gap study from 2018, Deloitte and the  Manufacturing Institute highlighted this widening problem. As of  August, there were roughly 484,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs across  America. Yet the study found that the skills gap may leave an estimated  2.4 million manufacturing jobs unfilled between 2018 and 10 years from  now, 2028, with there being a potential negative impact of $2.5  trillion.   So the skills gap is already there, but, unfortunately, it is  widening. If we don't do something about it, we are going to have a lot  more unfilled manufacturing jobs--good jobs with good pay.   The best known early training for these kinds of jobs is called  career and technical education, or CTE. Some of you might remember it  as being called vocational education. I will say that today's  vocational education is not yesterday's. It is high technology. It is  great equipment. It is providing the level of skills that young people  actually need to understand what is out there in the real world and to  get a job. This is a very important part of what we are doing as a  country, and I see it all over Ohio.   Recently, I toured the Vantage Career Center in Van Wert, OH, where  juniors and seniors in high school from more than a dozen school  districts study things like carpentry, like automotive technology, like  welding, like criminal justice.   A few weeks ago, I was able to speak to over 1,000 impressive CTE  students here in Washington, DC, who were advocating for their program.  In fact, they talked to a lot of the Representatives here in the  Senate. The group is called SkillsUSA, and their rally every year is  really inspiring.   These young people are eager to get this training. They want to get  the training in order to get the jobs that are out there. We need to  get more young people engaged in that, more parents signing off on  that, and more high school counselors signing off on that.   I cofounded and cochair what is called the CTE Caucus here in the  Congress. It is focused on holding up and lifting career and technical  education. We have gone from two Senators to now 29 Senators in our CTE  Caucus. Our goal is to increase the awareness of CTE programs generally  and make sure people know this is a good education option for them, to  get more students interested in career training, and to provide the  resources and the opportunities to connect these young people with  skilled jobs that offer good pay and benefits. We have passed some good  legislation to do that.   Last year, the President signed into law my Educating Tomorrow's  Workforce Act. That bill and the Perkins grants in the States that are  currently providing $1.3 billion in funding every year for ambitious,  federally funded high schools help to encourage high quality. They make  sure that the CTE programs are high-performing. Yet career and  technical education goes well beyond these great high school programs.   Certificate-granting, workforce-training programs post-high school  are another key way to close that skills  [[Page S6212]]  gap. In fact, it is probably the most important way because you can get  an industry-recognized certificate that can lead directly to a job.  Think of the many workforce training programs that are being offered at  your local community college or at your local technical or trade  school.   For these post-high school training opportunities, we have a problem,  and we have a solution. The problem is that they are expensive, and a  lot of young people can't afford them. The opportunity is to allow Pell  grants to be used for these kinds of training programs. Currently, we  use the Pell grants to help expand access to college-level education  here in America. For low-income families, their kids can go to college  on Pell grants. Unfortunately, they can't use the Pell grants to take  this short-term, 15-week training program and see the light at the end  of the tunnel in order to get the good-paying jobs at the end of it and  have no debt.   The bipartisan JOBS Act, which I have cosponsored with Senator Tim  Kaine, of Virginia, will allow us to do just that. It will allow us to  do the same thing we do with college with these shorter term training  programs that will give you a high-quality, industry-recognized  credential. Under current law, low-income students are eligible for  Federal Pell grants if they attend college for an associate's degree or  a bachelor's degree but not if they choose to enroll in an accredited  skills training program for under 15 weeks. In this economy and in this  day and age, that doesn't make sense at all.   I am supportive of Pell grants for college. You should know that more  than half the young people who take out Pell grants for college don't  end up getting the college degrees or the certificates or anything that  helps them to get those jobs. Whereas, in these short-term training  programs, it is highly likely, based on the experience we have looked  at, that they will get those certificates, and they will get those  jobs.   The JOBS Act is needed right now to meet the needs out there. These  kinds of workforce training programs provide students with the academic  and technical skills, knowledge, and training necessary to succeed in  their future careers. They encompass the kinds of high-quality,  rigorous job training programs that are easily transferable to those  jobs that are in demand right now, whether it is learning how to  conduct HVAC installation, how to operate a factory machine--which  includes, by the way, being able to program a computer that helps run  that machine--or how to program computers generally, how to be a coder,  how to ensure you have the skills to be in one of our great healthcare  tech jobs that are open right now.   These programs teach students the practical, transferable skills that  keep our economy moving. I hear about this every time I am home in  Ohio. During the recent work period that just wrapped up, I held two  separate roundtables--one at Brainerd Industries in Dayton, OH, and one  at Talon Products in Cleveland, OH--talking about this issue with  business owners, with administrators from our community colleges, with  students themselves, with workers who are on the job. Guess what. All  of these groups agree that the JOBS Act is a great idea whose time has  come. They all agree that the skills training programs create a path to  good-paying jobs, and they want the help.   What is more, we know that a lot of business owners will help these  employees, once they get that job, to be able to go back to school if  they want to, maybe to get a 2-year or a 4-year degree, maybe even to  get a master's degree, say, in engineering, to take their education to  the next level.   The fact that you do a short-term training program to get a job  doesn't mean you are not going to go back to college, and that might be  appropriate, in some companies, for many individuals. In fact, a  representative from Clark State Community College, Crystal Jones, who  was in attendance in Dayton, OH, said that she specifically believes a  lack of Pell grant assistance for young people looking to get training  certificates is a significant barrier. She said it makes it more  difficult in their efforts to ensure that employers get the skilled  workers they need. She said the JOBS Act will help.   Crystal is right. The JOBS Act has been endorsed by the National  Skills Coalition, the Association for Career and Technical Education,  the Business Roundtable, and so many other groups. We are told that it  is the No. 1 priority of the Association of Community College Trustees  and of the American Association of Community Colleges.   A lot of us here in this Chamber support our community colleges. They  do an awesome job. Well, this is their top priority, so we should  listen to them.   I am also pleased that the JOBS Act was included in President Trump's  fiscal year 2020 budget proposal. I thank the President for that, and I  thank the administration for supporting it, as I thank so many other  outside stakeholders who are promoting this idea. Let's allow Pell to  be used for short-term training programs that we need.   The reason this JOBS Act has such strong support is that it is the  best proposal out there right now to help fill this skills gap that we  have. It will cover programs that, at a minimum, require 150 hours and  8 weeks to complete. Alternative proposals are out there, but they  severely limit the programs by requiring many more hours--320 hours, as  an example, in one program.   Our community colleges in Ohio tell me that none of their short-term  training programs--none of them--would qualify for that number of  hours--programs like welding, precision machining, CDL programs for  truck drivers, electrical trades. They all need the JOBS Act, and they  need it now.   As we work to reauthorize the Higher Education Act this year, passing  the JOBS Act is the top priority for Senator Kaine and me. It is also  supported by Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray of the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and we strongly  appreciate their support.   I hope colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us to get this  legislation enacted. It just makes too much sense not to do it.   If we make career and technical education a priority and if we enact  the JOBS Act, as I have discussed today, we are going to address the  No. 1 issue we are now hearing from employers all around the country,  and we are going to help so many thousands of Americans have a better  opportunity going forward.   We are going to help our economy at a time when we need to have this  workforce there in order to have the economy continue to grow.   There is momentum in Ohio today, with businesses expanding and  seeking skilled workers, but the skills gap is an impediment. We need  to seize this opportunity, keep our economy moving in the right  direction, and help Ohioans develop the skills to grow in the career of  their choice and to fulfill their potential in life.   I yield the floor.
