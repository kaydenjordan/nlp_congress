 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise in support of the nomination of  R. Clarke Cooper to be an Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of  Political-Military Affairs at the Department of State.   The Bureau of Political-Military Affairs plays a critical role in the  State Department and in broader diplomatic and national security  efforts around the world. Every day, the Bureau works to ensure that  our foreign policy goals are driving our security partnerships and  security assistance around the world, including nearly $100 billion  annually in arms sales.   I am prepared to support Mr. Cooper's nomination as Assistant  Secretary because I believe he brings experience, insight, and  leadership that will benefit the Bureau and our foreign policy. I also  expect Mr. Cooper to uphold the commitments he made during his  confirmation hearing, including that he will not only be responsive to  all inquiries from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its staff  about the Bureau's work but that he will also proactively keep us fully  informed about issues under his jurisdiction.                                   3D Guns    Madam President, if confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Cooper will assume  his position at a time when the Bureau is at the center of, quite  frankly, some appalling decisions by the Trump administration that will  undermine the safety and security of Americans abroad.   I cannot wrap my head around the administration's policies, for  example, on the issue of 3D-printed firearms. The Trump administration  apparently believes it is a good idea to indiscriminately distribute  around the world--to foreign adversaries, terrorist organizations, and  future mass shooters--the literal blueprints for using 3D printers  [[Page S2500]]  to make nearly undetectable firearms and components.   Apparently, the Trump administration believes this information should  be readily available to anyone as it seeks to transfer the export  control licensing of military-style firearms and ammunition from the  Department of State to the less stringent Department of Commerce. Even  the Commerce Department has admitted that its own regulations will not  permit them to effectively stop the publication of these firearm  blueprints online.   It is not difficult to imagine the devastating consequences of this  reckless decision, which will make more lethal weapons available to  more thuggish regimes and facilitate their illicit transfer to  criminals and terrorists. We are talking about making it easier for a  criminal to build his own weapons without having to get a background  check. We are talking about making it easier for terrorists to board a  plane with deadly guns, perhaps to hijack them and use the aircraft as  weapons, just as the 9/11 terrorists did. We are talking about making  it easier for armed militants to enter a U.S. Embassy undetected,  endangering the lives of our diplomats abroad. Simply put, we are  talking about preventable tragedies made possible by the thoughtless  actions of this administration. These are undetectable. That is the big  challenge here. Indeed, this decision could place all American citizens  and officials--even the President himself--at greater security risk.   It is not too late to reverse this mistake. The Trump administration  can halt its decision to transfer the export jurisdiction to the  Commerce Department. At the very least, the administration could leave  the blueprints for producing undetectable, 3D-printed firearms under  the stronger regulatory controls of the Department of State.                                 Human Rights    Madam President, on a separate note, I have made clear to Mr. Cooper  that the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs has a moral and strategic  imperative to consider human rights and end-use monitoring when it  comes to making decisions about arms sales, transfers, and security  assistance to foreign countries.   Over the past 2 years, it has been troubling to see human rights  considerations take a backseat. That includes the President's recent  decision to revise the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy to disregard a  country's human rights record. With Saudi Arabia, the Khashoggi murder,  and the debacle of the Yemen war fresh on our minds, we need no  reminder of the consequences of the President's impulse to put profit  above all else, including respect for basic human rights. Human rights  are not just a nice gesture; they are fundamental American values and  critical to advancing peace, justice, democracy, and stability around  the world.   We must ask ourselves what we as a nation want America to be. Are we  a beacon of hope for the oppressed or simply the biggest arms merchant  to the world? Count me and many of my colleagues as standing firmly for  the former, and I hope Mr. Cooper will stand with us.                              Nomination Process    Madam President, finally, for weeks, we have heard from the  President, the majority leader, and other Republicans about vacancies  at the State Department and why that contributed to the supposed need  for Senator McConnell to exercise the nuclear option on nominees. As I  recently explained on the floor, Republicans need to point the finger  at their President. In many cases, the President has simply failed to  put forward nominees for key national security positions. When he does  put forward nominees, too often these individuals have not been  thoroughly vetted, and issues that would be disqualifying for nominees  in any other administration have simply been glossed over.   It turns out there is another issue that speaks directly to the  flimsiness of the majority leader's rationale for invoking the nuclear  option, and that is the fact that Republicans themselves are blocking  State Department nominees, including career employees nominated to be  Ambassadors to Ecuador and Cambodia. These nominees were reported out  of the Foreign Relations Committee by voice vote and without any  controversies several weeks ago.   They could have been confirmed and on the ground in their posts prior  to Easter recess. Instead, their nominations are languishing because  the majority leader has refused to move. So I now call on Senator  McConnell to stop playing politics with the State Department and get  these career nominees confirmed.   As I have said repeatedly, when presented with qualified, well-vetted  nominees, my staff and I will work around the clock to advance the  confirmation process. I would ask for the same from my Republican  colleagues.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
