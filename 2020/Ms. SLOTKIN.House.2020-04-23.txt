 Madam Speaker, I support this legislation as a critical  lifeline to small businesses coping with the crisis and the hospitals  on the front lines of this war.   SBA loan programs are vital to Main Street businesses across my  district, and I am proud to support them. But this must-pass bill  should also include support for America's smallest and medium-sized  communities who face the very real possibility of eliminating basic  services without our support.   The same police and fire, health department and sanitation workers  who are risking their lives every day now have their jobs at risk. They  deserve better. We should give them better. Let's do it.
