 Madam President, last night President Trump announced the  nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He will fill the  spot left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.   Justice Scalia left a profound mark on our judicial history. He had a  brilliant mind, a ready wit, and a vivid and colorful writing style  that made reading his decisions not only illuminating but enjoyable.  But most importantly, Antonin Scalia had a profound respect for the  rule of law and the Constitution. He knew that he was a judge, not a  legislator, and his job was not to make the law but to interpret the  law. That is exactly what he did.   For 30 years, Justice Scalia ruled on the plain meaning of the laws  and the Constitution. His politics, his personal opinions, his own  feelings about a case--none of those was allowed to play a role in his  decision. He asked what the law said, what the Constitution said, and  he ruled accordingly, even when he didn't like the result. Justice  Scalia once said:         If you are going to be a good and faithful judge, you have       to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going       to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the       time, you are probably doing something wrong.    Needless to say, Justice Scalia left some big shoes to fill. But  after learning a little about Judge Gorsuch, I have to say that if  anyone can come to fill them, I think Judge Gorsuch can. Like Justice  Scalia, Judge Gorsuch has a brilliant mind. He shares Justice Scalia's  gift for the written word. The Washington Post noted the many people  ``who have praised Gorsuch's lucid and occasionally lyrical writing  style.'' Slate called Judge Gorsuch's writing ``superb, incisive,  witty, and accessible.''   But most importantly, like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch understands  the role of a Supreme Court Justice. He knows that a Justice's job is  to interpret the law, not write it. In a speech last year, Judge  Gorsuch said the following: ``Perhaps the greatest project of Justice  Scalia's career was to remind us of the differences between judges and  legislators.''   Understanding those differences is indispensable. Brilliance,  eloquence, learning, compassion--none of those things matter if you  don't understand the proper role of the Supreme Court. That role is to  interpret the law, not make the law--to judge, not legislate; to call  balls and strikes, not to try and rewrite the rules of the game.   It is great to have strong opinions. It is great to have sympathy for  causes or organizations. It is great to have plans for fixing society's  problems. But none of those things has any business influencing your  ruling when you sit on the Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch understands  this. That is why I trust him to sit on the Supreme Court.   When Judge Gorsuch was nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of  Appeals 10 years ago, he was confirmed by a unanimous vote here in the  Senate. You can't really get a more bipartisan confirmation than that.  At the time, then-Senator Ken Salazar, a Colorado Democrat who later  became Interior Secretary under Obama, noted that Judge Gorsuch ``has a  sense of fairness and impartiality that is a keystone of being a  judge.''   Given the wide respect in which Judge Gorsuch is held, his  outstanding record, and his previous overwhelmingly bipartisan  confirmation, I am hopeful that his nomination will move quickly  through the Senate. Senate Democrats have spoken a lot about the need  to fill the ninth seat on the Supreme Court. Now is the chance.   I congratulate Judge Gorsuch on his nomination, and I look forward to  seeing him confirmed to the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
