 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Protecting  Our Kids Act, a chance for us to keep our families healthy and whole  and safe.   Day after day, hour after hour, the American people have felt the  pain and the horror and the despair of yet another mass shooting,  another family torn apart, another community broken.   I know that feeling. You know my story. My son, Jordan, was just 17  years old when he was shot by a man who simply didn't like the loud  music that he was playing in his car.   How long do we let American families in this country keep suffering  this pain?   That is why we must pass this commonsense legislation, why we must  take this step toward ensuring that we are creating true progress for  the next generation.   Americans deserve better, and shame on us if we do not take action.
