 Mr. President, before I begin, there has been well- founded concern that the additional security measures required for  access to the Galleries during the trial could cause reporters to miss  some of the events on the Senate floor. I want to assure everyone in  the press that I will vociferously oppose any attempt to begin the  trial unless the reporters trying to enter the Galleries are seated.   The press is here to inform the American public about these pivotal  events in our Nation's history. We must make sure they are able to.  Some may not want what happens here to be public; we do.   Mr. President, after the conclusion of my remarks, the Senate will  proceed to the impeachment trial of President Donald John Trump for  committing high crimes and misdemeanors. President Trump is accused of  coercing a foreign leader into interfering in our elections to benefit  himself and then doing everything in his power to cover it up. If  proved, the President's actions are crimes against democracy itself.   It is hard to imagine a greater subversion of our democracy than for  powers outside our borders to determine the elections there within. For  a foreign country to attempt such a thing on its own is bad enough. For  an American President to deliberately solicit such a thing--to  blackmail a foreign country with military assistance to help him win an  election--is unimaginably worse. I can't imagine any other President  doing this.   Beyond that, for then the President to deny the right of Congress to  conduct oversight, deny the right to investigate any of his activities,  to say article II of the Constitution gives him the right to ``do  whatever [he] wants''--we are staring down an erosion of the sacred  democratic principles for which our Founders fought a bloody war of  independence. Such is the gravity of this historic moment.   Once Senator Inhofe is sworn in at 1 p.m., the ceremonial functions  at the beginning of a Presidential trial will be complete. The Senate  then must determine the rules of the trial. The Republican leader will  offer an organizing resolution that outlines his plan--his plan--for  the rules of the trial. It is completely partisan. It was kept secret  until the very eve of the trial. Now that it is public, it is very easy  to see why.   The McConnell rules seem to be designed by President Trump for  President Trump. It asks the Senate to rush through as fast as possible  and makes getting evidence as hard as possible. It could force  presentations to take place at 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning so  the American people will not see them.   In short, the McConnell resolution will result in a rushed trial,  with little evidence, in the dark of the night--literally the dark of  night. If the President is so confident in his case, if Leader  McConnell is so confident the President did nothing wrong, why don't  they want the case to be presented in broad daylight?   On something as important as impeachment, the McConnell resolution is  nothing short of a national disgrace. This will go down--this  resolution--as  [[Page S289]]  one of the darker moments in the Senate history, perhaps one of even  the darkest.   Leader McConnell has just said he wants to go by the Clinton rules.  Then why did he change them, in four important ways at minimum, to all  make the trial less transparent, less clear, and with less evidence? He  said he wanted to get started in exactly the same way. It turns out,  contrary to what the leader said--I am amazed he could say it with a  straight face--that the rules are the same as the Clinton rules. The  rules are not even close to the Clinton rules.    Unlike the Clinton rules, the McConnell resolution does not admit the  record of the House impeachment proceedings into evidence. Leader  McConnell wants a trial with no existing evidence and no new evidence.  A trial without evidence is not a trial; it is a coverup.   Second, unlike the Clinton rules, the McConnell resolution limits  presentation by the parties to 24 hours per side over only 2 days. We  start at 1, 12 hours a day, we are at 1 a.m., and that is without  breaks. It will be later. Leader McConnell wants to force the managers  to make important parts of their case in the dark of night.   No. 3, unlike the Clinton rules, the McConnell resolution places an  additional hurdle to get witnesses and documents by requiring a vote on  whether such motions are even in order. If that vote fails, then no  motions to subpoena witnesses and documents will be in order.   I don't want anyone on the other side to say: I am going to vote no  first on witnesses, but then later I will determine--if they vote for  McConnell's resolution, they are making it far more difficult to vote  in the future, later on in the trial.   And finally, unlike the Clinton rules, the McConnell resolution  allows a motion to dismiss at any time--any time--in the trial.   In short, contrary to what the leader has said, the McConnell rules  are not at all like the Clinton rules. The Republican leader's  resolution is based neither in precedent nor in principle. It is driven  by partisanship and the politics of the moment.   Today I will be offering amendments to fix the many flaws in Leader  McConnell's deeply unfair resolution and seek the witnesses and  documents we have requested, beginning with an amendment to have the  Senate subpoena White House documents.   Let me be clear. These amendments are not dilatory. They only seek  one thing: the truth. That means relevant documents. That means  relevant witnesses. That is the only way to get a fair trial, and  everyone in this body knows it.   Each Senate impeachment trial in our history, all 15 that were  brought to completion, feature witnesses--every single one.   The witnesses we request are not Democrats. They are the President's  own men. The documents are not Democratic documents. They are  documents, period. We don't know if the evidence of the witnesses or  the documents will be exculpatory to the President or incriminating,  but we have an obligation--a solemn obligation, particularly now during  this most deep and solemn part of our Constitution--to seek the truth  and then let the chips fall where they may.   My Republican colleagues have offered several explanations for  opposing witnesses and documents at the start of the trial. None of  them has much merit. Republicans have said we should deal with the  question of witnesses later in the trial. Of course, it makes no sense  to hear both sides present their case first and then afterward decide  if the Senate should hear evidence. The evidence is supposed to inform  arguments, not come after they are completed.   Some Republicans have said the Senate should not go beyond the House  record by calling any witnesses, but the Constitution gives the Senate  the sole power to try impeachments--not the sole power to review, not  the sole power to rehash but to try.   Republicans have called our request for witnesses and documents  political. If seeking the truth is political, then the Republican Party  is in serious trouble.   The White House has said that the Articles of Impeachment are brazen  and wrong. Well, if the President believes his impeachment is so brazen  and wrong, why won't he show us why? Why is the President so insistent  that no one come forward, that no documents be released? If the  President's case is so weak, that none of the President's men can  defend him under oath, shame on him and those who allow it to happen.  What is the President hiding? What are our Republican colleagues  hiding? If they weren't afraid of the truth, they would say: Go right  ahead, get at the truth, get witnesses, get documents.   In fact, at no point over the last few months have I heard a single,  solitary argument on the merits of why witnesses and documents should  not be part of the trial. No Republicans explained why less evidence is  better than more evidence.   Nevertheless, Leader McConnell is poised to ask the Senate to begin  the first impeachment trial of a President in history without  witnesses; that rushes through the arguments as quickly as possible;  that, in ways both shameless and subtle, will conceal the truth--the  truth--from the American people.   Leader McConnell claimed that the House ``ran the most rushed, least  thorough, and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern history.'' The  truth is, Leader McConnell is plotting the most rushed, least thorough,  and most unfair impeachment trial in modern history, and it begins  today.   The Senate has before it a very straightforward question. The  President is accused of coercing a foreign power to interfere in our  elections to help himself. It is the job of the Senate to determine if  these very serious charges are true. The very least we can do is  examine the facts, review the documents, hear the witnesses, try the  case, not run from it, not hide from it--try it.   If the President commits high crimes and misdemeanors and Congress  refuses to act, refuses even to conduct a fair trial of his conduct,  then Presidents--this President and future Presidents--can commit  impeachable crimes with impunity, and the order and rigor of our  democracy will dramatically decline.   The fail-safe--the final fail-safe of our democracy will be rendered  mute. The most powerful check on the Executive--the one designed to  protect the people from tyranny--will be erased.   In a short time, my colleagues, each of us, will face a choice about  whether to begin this trial in search of the truth or in service of the  President's desire to cover it up, whether the Senate will conduct a  fair trial and a full airing of the facts or rush to a predetermined  political outcome.   My colleagues, the eyes of the Nation, the eyes of history, the eyes  of the Founding Fathers are upon us. History will be our final judge.  Will Senators rise to the occasion?   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. Chief Justice, I send an amendment to the desk to  subpoena certain documents and records from the White House, and I ask  that it be read.

The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                                   Program     Mr. Chief Justice, I send an amendment to the desk to  issue a subpoena to John Michael ``Mick'' Mulvaney, and I ask that it  be read.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will report.   The legislative clerk read as follows:        The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an       amendment numbered 1287.           (Purpose: To subpoena John Michael ``Mick'' Mulvaney)         At the appropriate place in the resolving clause, insert       the following:        Sec. ___.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, pursuant to rules V and VI of the Rules of       Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on       Impeachment Trials, the Chief Justice of the United States,       through the Secretary of the Senate, shall issue a subpoena       for the taking of testimony of John Michael ``Mick''       Mulvaney, and the Sergeant at Arms is authorized to utilize       the services of the Deputy Sergeant at Arms or any other       employee of the Senate in serving the subpoena authorized to       be issued by this section.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The bottom line is very simple.   As has been clear to every Senator and the country, we believe  witnesses and documents are extremely important and that a compelling  case has been made for them. We will have votes on all of those.   Also, the leader, without consulting us, made a number of significant  changes that significantly deviated from the 1999 Clinton resolution.  We want to change those, so there will be a good number of votes. We  are willing to do some of those votes tomorrow. There is no reason we  have to do them all tonight and inconvenience the Senate and the Chief  Justice, but we will not back off on getting votes on all of these  amendments, which we regard as extremely significant and important to  the country.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.    Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Democratic leader is recognized.                              Amendment No. 1288     Mr. Chief Justice, I send an amendment to the desk to  subpoena certain documents and records from the Department of Defense,  and I ask that it be read.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the document.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an       amendment numbered 1288.         At the appropriate place in the resolving clause, insert       the following:        Sec. ___.

The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amendment is arguable by the parties for 2  hours.   Mr. Manager Schiff, are you a proponent or opponent?   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. We are a proponent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone?   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, we are an opponent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, the House managers can proceed first  and reserve their time for rebuttal.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, the House managers will be  reserving the balance of our time to respond to the argument of the  counsel for the President.   Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel for the President, and the  American people, I would like to begin by getting something off of my  chest, something that has been bothering me for a little while.   Counsel for the President and some other folks in this room have been  talking a lot about how late it is getting, how long this debate is  taking. It is almost 10 p.m. in Washington, DC. They say: Let's get the  show on the road. Let's get moving.   The whole time, the only thing I can think about is how late it is in  other places because right now, it is the middle of the night in  Europe, where we have over 60,000 U.S. troops. There are helicopter  pilots flying training missions, tankers maneuvering across fields,  infantrymen walking with 100-pound packs, and, yes, Ukrainian soldiers  getting ready to wake up in their trenches facing off against Russian  tanks rights now. I don't think any of those folks want to hear us talk  about how tired we are or how late it is. We have time to have this  debate.   That is why the House managers strongly support this amendment to  subpoena key documents from the Department of Defense, because just  like the subpoena for OMB, these documents from DOD speak directly to  one of President Trump's abuses--his withholding of critical military  aid from our partner Ukraine to further his personal political  campaign.   In fact, $250 million of taxpayer-funded military aid for Ukraine was  managed by the Department of Defense as part of the Ukraine Security  Assistance Initiative. These funds, approved by 87 Senators in this  very room, would purchase additional training, equipment, and advising  to strengthen the capacity of Ukraine's Armed Forces.   The equipment approved for Ukraine included sniper rifles, rocket- propelled grenade launchers, counter-artillery radar, night vision  goggles, and medical supplies. This equipment was to be purchased  almost exclusively from American businesses. This equipment, along with  the training and advising provided by DOD, was intended to protect our  national security by helping our friend Ukraine fight against Vladimir  Putin's Russia.   Earlier, counsel for the President tried to make the argument: Well,  it made it there. The aid eventually made it there. The delay doesn't  really matter.   You heard me talk about why the delay does matter, but what counsel  for the President didn't say is that all of their aid has not made it  there. Congress had to pass another law so that $35.2 million of that  aid wouldn't expire and lapse. We did, but to this day, $18.5 million  of that money remains outstanding and hasn't made its way to the  battlefield.   It was DOD that repeatedly advised the White House and OMB of the  importance of security assistance not only to Ukraine but also U.S.  national security. It was DOD in August of 2019 that warned OMB that  the freeze was unlawful and that the funds could be lost as a result.  It was DOD that scrambled, after the hold was lifted without  explanation on September 11, to spend the funds before they expired at  the end of the month.   Without a doubt, DOD has key documents that the President has refused  to turn over to Congress--key documents that go to the heart of the  ways in which the President abused his power. It is time to subpoena  those documents.   DOD documents would provide insight into critical aspects of this  hold. They would show the decisionmaking process and motivations behind  President Trump's freeze. They would reveal the concerns expressed by  DOD and OMB officials that the hold was violating the law. They would  reveal our defense officials' grave concerns about the impact of the  freeze on Ukraine and U.S. national security. They would show that  senior Defense Department officials repeatedly attempted to convince  President Trump to release the aid. In short, they would further  establish the President's scheme to use our national defense funds to  benefit his personal political campaign.   We are not speculating about the existence of these documents, and we  are not guessing about what they might show because during the course  of the investigation in the House, witnesses who testified before the  committees identified multiple documents directly relevant to the  impeachment inquiry that DOD continues to withhold. We know these  documents exist, and we know that the only reason we do not have them  is because the President himself directed the Pentagon not to produce  them because he knows what they would show.   To demonstrate the significance of the DOD documents and the value  they would provide in this trial, I would like to walk you through some  of what we know exists but that the Trump administration continues to  refuse to turn over. Again, based on what is known from the testimony  and the few documents that have been obtained from public reporting and  lawsuits, it is clear that the President is trying to hide this  evidence because he is afraid of what it would show the American  people.   We know that DOD has documents that reveal that as early as June, the  President was considering withholding military aid for Ukraine. As I  mentioned earlier, the President began  [[Page S414]]  questioning military aid to Ukraine in June of last year. The  President's questions came days after DOD issued a press release on  June 18 announcing it would provide its $250 million portion of the aid  to Ukraine.   According to public reporting, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense  Elaine McCusker, who manages the DOD's budget, learned about the  President's questions. We know this email exists because in response to  a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, the Trump administration was  forced to release a redacted email. But DOD provided none of those  documents to the House.   Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper and her team were  tasked by the Secretary of Defense with responding to the President's  questions about Ukraine assistance. Ms. Cooper testified that she put  those answers in an email and described those emails during her  deposition. She testified that DOD advised that the security assistance  was crucial for both Ukraine and U.S. national security and had strong  bipartisan support in Congress. But DOD provided none of those  documents to the House.   With this proposed amendment, the Senate has an opportunity to obtain  and review the full record that can further demonstrate how and why the  President was holding the aid.   Laura Cooper also testified about the interagency meetings that  occurred in late 2019--the meetings at which DOD was shocked to learn  that President Trump had placed a mysterious hold on the security  assistance. We know what happened at several of those meetings because  Ms. Cooper participated in them, in some cases with other senior  Defense Department officials. However, we don't have Laura Cooper's  notes from those meetings. We don't have the emails she sent to senior  DOD officials reporting the stunning news about the President's hold.  We don't have the emails that show the response from the Secretary of  Defense and other senior defense officials because DOD has refused to  provide them.   Separately, Laura Cooper testified about when the Ukraine first  learned of the President's secret hold on the military assistance. The  same day as the President's July 25 call with President Zelensky, DOD  officials received two emails from the State Department indicating that  officials from the Ukrainian Embassy and congressional staff had become  aware of the hold and were starting to ask questions.   Ms. Cooper testified that she was informed that ``the Ukrainian  embassy and House Foreign Affairs Committee are asking about the  military aid'' and that ``The Hill'' knows about the FMS situation to  an extent, and so does the Ukrainian Embassy. All of this shows that  people were starting to get very worried.   Again, this amendment for a subpoena to DOD would compel the  production of these important documents, but, again, there is more. DOD  documents would also reveal key facts about what happened on July 25  after OMB directed DOD to ``hold off'' on any additional DOD  obligations for the assistance to Ukraine. How did DOD officials react  to OMB's directive to keep this order quiet? Did DOD officials raise  immediate concerns about the legality of the hold--concerns that they  would eventually vocally articulate to OMB in August? Did DOD officials  hear from the American businesses that were on tap to provide the  equipment for Ukraine? Was DOD informed that the President's hold would  undermine American jobs? Answers to those questions may be found in DOD  emails--emails that we can all see if you issue the subpoena.   Earlier, I mentioned that by late July, officials in our government  had raised significant concerns about the impact and the legality of  President's Trump's hold on the military aid. We know this from witness  testimony, public reporting, and documents produced in the Freedom of  Information Act lawsuits. For example, at an interagency meeting on  July 31, Laura Cooper, one of the officials at DOD, announced that  because there were two legally available options to continue the hold  and they did not have direction to pursue either of those legal  options, DOD would have to start spending the funds on August 6. Cooper  explained that if they did not start spending the funds, they would  risk violating the Impoundment Control Act. It was a fateful warning  because that is exactly what happened.    Throughout August, Pentagon officials grew increasingly concerned as  the hold dragged on. According to public reporting, DOD wrote to OMB on  August 9 to say that it could no longer claim the delay would have no  effect on the Defense Department's ability to spend the funds. We only  know this through recent reporting about the contents of the email.   President Trump certainly hasn't made this information public. In  response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the Trump  administration released this August 9 email from Elaine McCusker, the  Pentagon's chief budget officer. As you can see from the slide in front  of you, it is almost entirely blacked out.   According to public reporting, the email said:         As we discussed, as of 12 AUG, we don't think we can agree       that the pause ``will not preclude timely execution.'' We       hope it won't and will do all we can to execute once the       policy decision is made, but can no longer make that       declarative statement.    Let me interpret what is actually being said here. What is actually  being said is: We are in trouble. We can't spend the money in the time  that we have left, and we are not going to cover your tracks anymore  and say that we can. The extensive redactions in the Freedom of  Information Act productions highlight the administration's efforts to  conceal the President's wrongdoing. They also underscore why the Senate  must subpoena DOD documents to ensure that all of the relevant facts  come to light, and, yes, there is more.   Based on the concerns expressed by McCusker and others at DOD, OMB  eventually dropped from the documents the statement that the hold would  not preclude timely execution of the funds. But OMB also circulated  talking points claiming: ``No action has been taken by OMB that would  preclude the obligation of these funds before the end of the fiscal  year.''   Let me just explain what is going on here. Everybody is getting  worried. Everybody knows that something bad is about to happen. Nobody  has a good explanation, and nobody wants to be left holding the bag. So  they are sending the emails, and they are sending the memos to say: I  told you so, and I am not going to be held responsible.   DOD's McCusker took issue with OMB's talking point. She did so in  writing. Ms. McCusker emailed Mr. Duffey to tell him that OMB's talking  points were ``just not accurate'' and that DOD had been consistently  conveying that point for weeks. Again, we know this from a press  report--not from documents produced to Congress by the Trump  administration.   Now, President Trump did release some documents in response to a  lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act, but here is what Ms.  McCusker's email looked like when it was released by the Trump  administration.   Her concern that OMB's talking point was ``just not accurate'' was,  again, entirely blacked out. What else is being hidden from the  American people? The Senate should issue the subpoena.   DOD documents would also shed light on OMB's actions as the  President's scheme unraveled. On September 9, Ms. McCusker informed  Duffey that DOD could fall short of spending $120 million or more  because of the hold. Duffey responded by suggesting that it would be  DOD's fault if they ended up violating the Impoundment Control Act.   McCusker responded: ``You can't be serious. I am speechless.''   It will come as no surprise, then, that the administration entirely  redacted this email, too, when it produced the documents in connection  with the Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. Thanks to public  reporting, though, we do know its contents, but what else is being  hidden from the American people? What other reactions did this exchange  set off within DOD? And were those concerns brought back to the White  House?   The Department of Defense's documents would shed light on these  questions. The American people deserve answers.   Make no mistake, the record before the House fully supports the  conclusion that President Trump froze vital military aid to pressure  Ukraine into helping the President's political campaign. The DOD  documents would provide further evidence of this scheme. They  [[Page S415]]  would expose the full extent of the truth to Congress and the American  people and would firmly rebut any notion that President Trump was  acting based on concerns about corruption or other countries'  contributions, and the President knows it. If there was any doubt,  recent events prove that DOD has documents that are directly relevant  to this trial.   As I spoke about earlier, before I was a Member of Congress, I was a  soldier in Iraq and Afghanistan. I do know what it feels like to not  have the equipment that you need. The men and women who work at the  Department of Defense and administer this vital aid understand that  reality too. That is why they repeatedly made the case to President  Trump that military assistance to Ukraine is important and that it  would not only help Ukraine but also bolster our deterrence against  further Russian aggression in Europe. Every time we have these  discussions, that might seem abstract to people around the country. I  do think about those 60,000 U.S. troops we have in Europe, many of  whom, by the way, are stationed there with their families, their  spouses, their children, and how they are training and working every  day to hold the line and fight for freedom and liberty in Europe. And  if the war in Ukraine spills over outside of Ukraine, it is those men  and women who will have to get into their tanks and their helicopters  and do their job.   The United States Senate cannot let this information remain hidden.  It goes directly to one of President Trump's abuses of power--again,  withholding aid that 87 people in this room already voted for. The  President, the Senate, and the American people deserve a fair trial.  Let's see the documents and let's see them now and let the facts speak  for themselves.   I would like to end by reading a short transcript, something that I  was thinking about earlier this evening. This is a transcript from  Ambassador Taylor's testimony. I just want to take a minute to read it  to you. He was talking about a trip that he made to visit our friends  in Ukraine.         We had a meeting with the defense minister. It was the       first meeting of the day. We went over there. They invited us       to a ceremony that they have in front of their ministry every       day. Every day they have this ceremony, and it is about a       half-an-hour ceremony where soldiers are in formation, the       defense minister, and families of soldiers who have been       killed are all there. The selection of which soldiers who       have been killed are honored is on the date of it.    So whatever today's date is, you know if we were there today, on the  22nd of October, the families of those soldiers who were killed on any  22nd of October in the previous 5 years would be there.   Ambassador Taylor was talking about our friends. At least 13,000 of  them have given their lives in the last 5 years in the fight for  liberty in Europe. This, ladies and gentleman, is a national disgrace,  and only the people in this room can fix it. It is time to issue the  subpoenas.   Mr. Chief Justice, the House managers reserve the balance of our time  for an opportunity to respond to the President's argument.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone?   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Philbin will address  the argument.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Philbin.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, I will  be brief. This may seem like some deja vu all over again because we  have been arguing about the same issues, really, over and over and over  for a long time. I think something that Americans don't really  understand about Washington is how could the House Democrats think that  it is the best use of time for this body to spend an entire day  deciding simply the issue of when this body should decide about whether  or not there should be witnesses and documents subpoenaed? That is the  issue before the body now. It is not the question, finally, of whether  there should be witnesses or documents.   As the majority leader has made clear multiple times, the underlying  resolution simply allows that issue to be addressed a week from now.  The only question at issue now--and the House managers keep saying: How  can you have a trial without witnesses? How can you have a trial  without documents? That is not even the issue. The only issue now is  whether you have to decide that issue to subpoena documents or  witnesses now or decide it in a week after you hear the presentations.  Why are they so eager to have you buy a pig in a poke? Why is it  necessary to make that decision without having more information?   In the Clinton trial, this body agreed 100 to 0 that it made more  sense to have more information and then decide how to proceed and that  it was rational to have more information to hear the presentations and  then decide what more was necessary. Why is it so important that you  have to make that decision now without that information? That doesn't  make any sense.   The rational thing to do is to hear what sort of case they present  and, importantly, to hear the President's defense because the President  had no opportunity in the House to present any defense.   We have heard a lot about the rule of law and about precedent. What  was unprecedented was the process that was used in the House, a process  that began with an impeachment inquiry that started without any vote by  the House.   This is the point I made earlier. The Constitution assigns the sole  power of impeachment to the House, not to any single Member of the  House. So the press conference that Speaker Pelosi held on September 24  did not validly initiate an impeachment inquiry, nor did it validly  give power to committees to issue subpoenas.   We are talking now about the DOD documents. What efforts did they  make in their proceeding to get these documents? They issued one  invalid subpoena totally unauthorized under the Constitution. It was  unprecedented because it was issued in an impeachment inquiry  reportedly without any vote from the House. It had never happened  before in our history in a Presidential impeachment. It was unlawful.  It was unauthorized. That is why no documents were produced, and they  made no other efforts to pursue that.   We have heard a lot about the rule of law. The rule of law applies to  House Democrats, as well, and they didn't abide by it. It was  unprecedented to have a process in which the President had no  opportunity to present his defense, no opportunity to present  witnesses, no opportunity to be represented by counsel, and no  opportunity to present evidence whatsoever in three rounds of hearings.   They will mention: Oh, in the Judiciary Committee, they were willing  to give the President rights. But in the Judiciary Committee, after one  hearing, the Speaker announced the conclusion that articles were going  to be drafted and the committee had already decided it would hear no  fact witnesses. There were no rights for the President.   So it makes sense, what is rational--what 100 Senators 21 years ago  thought was rational was to hear the case that can be presented on the  record established so far and then decide if something else needs to be  done. Let the President make his case. We are ready to get this  started. The House managers should be as well.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, we yield the balance of our  time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The House managers have 38 minutes remaining.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, I will be brief.   Counsel for the President continues to say a lot of things that just  really rubs me the wrong way. When he says: You know, we are talking  and saying the same argument over and over and over again, well, I am  ready to keep going because this is an important debate, and we need to  have it now.   He also said something about what the American people don't  understand about Washington. Well, I haven't been here very long, but I  can tell you that I don't think the American people care very much  about whether or not people in Washington are sitting around debating  all the time and thinking about what you are concerned about right now.  What they are concerned about is whether or not their government is  working for them and whether or not there is corruption in their  government. That is what they understand, and that is what this debate  is about.   Counsel for the President said: Why now? Why the information now?   The better question is: Why not now? This trial has started. Let's  have the facts and information now.   Ladies and gentlemen, the time is right. There is no reason why we  [[Page S416]]  shouldn't issue those subpoenas, get the facts, get the testimony, have  the debate, and let the American people see what is really going on.   Mr. Chief Justice, I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Schiff.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, I will be brief, but I do want to  respond to a couple of points my colleagues have made.   First is the argument that you heard before--and I have no doubt you  will hear again--that the subpoenas issued by the House are invalid.  Well, that is really wonderful. I imagine when you issue subpoenas,  they will declare yours invalid as well.   What is the basis of the claim that they are invalid? It is because  they weren't issued the way the President wants.   Part of the argument is that you have to issue the subpoenas the way  we say, and that can only be done after there is a resolution that we  approve of adopted by the full House. First, they complained there was  no resolution, no formal resolution of the impeachment inquiry, and  then when we passed the formal resolution, they complained about that.  They complained when we didn't have one, and they complained when we  did have one.   They made that argument already in court, and they lost. In the  McGahn case, they similarly argued that this subpoena for Mr. McGahn is  invalid. Do you know what the judge said? The judge essentially said:  That is nonsense.   The President doesn't get to decide how the House conducts an  impeachment proceeding. The President doesn't get to decide whether a  subpoena at issue is valid or invalid. No, the House gets to decide  because the House is given the sole power of impeachment, not the  President of the United States.   Counsel says: Why are we going through all of these documents? Aren't  all of these motions the same? The fact is, we are not talking about  the same documents here. They would like nothing better than for you to  know nothing about the documents we seek. They don't want you to know  what Defense Department documents they are withholding. Of course, they  don't want you to hear that. They don't want you to know what State  Department documents are there because if it is just abstract, if it is  just your argument for documents, well, they can say: Well, that is  really not that important, right? It is just some generic thing.   But when you learn, as you have learned today and tonight, what those  documents are, when you have seen the efforts to conceal those Freedom  of Information Act emails that my colleague Mr. Crow just referred to,  and when you see what was released to the public, and it is all  redacted, and we find out what is under those redactions, wow,  surprise. It is incriminating information they have redacted out. That  is not supposed to be the basis for redaction under the Freedom of  Information Act. That is what we call a coverup.   They don't want you to see that today. They don't want you to see the  before and the after, the redacted and the nonredacted. They don't want  you to hear from these witnesses about the detailed personal notes they  took. Ambassador Taylor took detailed personal notes.   They want to try to contest what Ambassador Sondland said about his  conversations with the President because Sondland, after he talked with  the President, talked directly with Ambassador Taylor and talked  directly with Mr. Morrison and explained his conversation to the  President. Guess what. Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor took detailed  notes. If there is a dispute about what the President told Mr.  Sondland, wouldn't you like to see the notes? They don't want you to  know the notes exist.   They don't want to have this debate. They would rather just argue:  No, it is just about the documents. It is just about when. We want the  Senators to have their 16 hours of questions before they can see any of  this stuff. And do you know what? Then we are going to move to dismiss  the case. As I said earlier, the ``when'' means never.   Finally, the Clinton precedent. President Clinton turned over 90,000  pages of documents before the trial. I agree. Let's follow the Clinton  precedent. It is not going to take 90,000 documents. The documents are  already collected.   You heard the testimony on the screen of Ambassador Taylor saying:  Oh, they are going to turn them over shortly. But we are still waiting.  They are still sitting there at the State Department.   We even played a video for you of Secretary Esper on one of the  Sunday shows saying, we are going to comply with these subpoenas.   That was one week. Then somebody got to him and all of a sudden he  was singing a different tune.   They don't want you to know what these documents hold. And, yes, we  are showing you what these witnesses can tell you. We are showing you  what Mulvaney can tell you. And, yes, we are making it hard for you. We  are making it hard for you to say no. We are making it hard for you to  say: I don't want to hear from these people. I don't want to see these  documents.   We are making it hard. It is not our job to make it easy for you. It  is our job to make it hard to deprive the American people of a fair  trial, and that is why we are taking the time to do it.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                               Motion to Table     Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Democratic leader is recognized.                              Amendment No. 1289     Mr. Chief Justice, I send an amendment to the desk to  issue subpoenas to Robert B. Blair and Michael P. Duffey, and I ask  that it be read.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will report the amendment.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:        The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an       amendment numbered 1289.         At the appropriate place in the resolving clause, insert       the following:        Sec. ___.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, pursuant to rules V and VI of the Rules of       Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on       Impeachment Trials--        (1) the Chief Justice of the United States, through the       Secretary of the Senate, shall--        (A) issue a subpoena for the taking of testimony of Robert       B. Blair; and        (B) issue a subpoena for the taking of testimony of Michael       P. Duffey; and        (2) the Sergeant at Arms is authorized to utilize the       services of the Deputy Sergeant at Arms or any other employee       of the Senate in serving the subpoena authorized to be issued       by this section.    The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amendment is arguable by the parties for 2  hours, equally divided.   Mr. Manager Schiff, are you a proponent or opponent?  [[Page S417]]        Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, we are a proponent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone?   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, we are an opponent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff and the House managers will proceed and  reserve time for rebuttal.   Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel for  the President, my name is Sylvia Garcia, and I am a Congresswoman from  Texas in the Houston region.   I have been sitting for some time, as well as you, and it brought to  mind the many years I spent as a judge, just as all of you today are  judges in this hearing.   It is important that I say a few words before I start our argument  for this amendment because, in the scheme of things, it is really not  that very complicated. The American people, everyday Americans, know  what a trial looks like, whether they have seen it on ``Perry Mason''  or ``Law & Order,'' or maybe they have been in court themselves. They  know what a trial is. It is about making sure that people have an  opportunity to be heard--both sides. It is about witnesses. It is about  documents. It is about getting a fair shot.   That is all we are asking for today, is to make sure we give the  American people the trial they expect, to make sure the American people  know that this President needs to be held accountable, because if it  were they who were accused or alleged to have done something, they  would want the same thing.   So, for me, it is about making sure we get a fair trial, which is why  I am here representing the House managers to strongly support this  amendment to subpoena Robert Blair and Michael Duffey. Blair and Duffey  are the two officials who carried out President Trump's order to freeze  vital military aid to Ukraine. Their testimony would shed light on  central facts the House uncovered in our impeachment inquiry. Their  testimony will further affirm that President Trump had no legitimate  policy reason for the order.   Blair works in the White House as a senior adviser to the Acting  Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney. Duffey is a political appointee. He  works in the Office of Management and Budget. There, he serves as the  Associate Director for National Security Programs. Both were subpoenaed  by the House investigative committees. Both were ordered not to appear,  so both failed to appear for the scheduled depositions despite repeated  outreach and despite their legal subpoenas to comply.   Blair and Duffey are not household names. Many Americans have never  heard of them. But they operated the machinery of the executive branch.  They implemented President Trump's instruction to freeze military aid  to Ukraine. They communicated about the freeze with each other, with  Mulvaney, with OMB's Acting Director, Russell Vought, and with numerous  officials of the State Department and the Department of Defense. They  stood at the center of this tangled web.   Some of their communications are known to us from the testimony of  other witnesses before House committees. Other communications have been  revealed through public reporting and the Freedom of Information Act  releases. But these communications only partly penetrate the secrecy in  which President Trump sought to cloak his instruction to freeze  military aid to a vulnerable strategic partner. As plentiful evidence  confirms, officials throughout the government were stumped--literally  stumped--about why the freeze was happening. They were thwarted when  they tried to get explanations from Blair and Duffey. Consistent with  President Trump's effort to hide all evidence, Blair and Duffey have  defied the House's subpoenas at the President's direction.   To explain why this amendment should be passed, I would like to walk  you through some key events in which Blair and Duffey participated.   To start, Blair and Duffey were directly involved in the initial  stages of President Trump's freeze of the military aid.   On June 18, the Department of Defense issued a statement that it  would be providing its $250 million portion of the assistance to  Ukraine and that Ukraine had met all the required preconditions for  receiving the money. The very next day, on June 19, Blair, in his role  as assistant to the President, called Vought, the Acting Director of  OMB. The call was to talk about the military aid to Ukraine. According  to public reports, Blair told Vought: ``We need to hold it up.''   That same day, Duffey, who reports to Vought, emailed Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense Elaine McCusker about the military aid. Although  the administration refused to produce that email to the House--and all  other documents--a copy of that email was recently produced in response  to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. In the email, Duffey informed  DOD that ``the President has asked about this funding release.''   Duffey copied Mark Sandy, a career official who reports to him and  who testified before the House about this email. Sandy testified that  McCusker provided the requested information to him, which he shared  with Duffey.   These communications raised many questions about Blair and Duffey,  and they are in the best position to provide answers. For example, who  or what prompted Blair to tell Vought that OMB needed to freeze the  aid? Who? What reason was Blair given? Who instructed Duffey to reach  out to the Department of Defense? Who told him the President had  questions, and what were those questions? Did Duffey and Blair have  communications about the military aid to Ukraine with the President?  with Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney? between themselves? What  about the funding release and the President's so-called questions?  Blair and Duffey could provide the answers. They could explain what  directions they received, when they were provided, and who provided  them. The American people deserve to know these facts.   The next significant event in our timeline happened at the end of  June. On June 27, Blair got an email from his boss, Mulvaney. Mulvaney  was on Air Force One with President Trump. According to public reports,  Mulvaney asked Blair: ``Did we ever find out about the money for  Ukraine and whether we can hold it back?'' Blair responded it would be  possible, but he said they should ``expect Congress to become  unhinged.''   When did Mulvaney and Blair first discuss the President's freeze on  military aid? Was there further discussion about the issue in this  email? Did Mulvaney explain why it was so important to freeze the  money, even if it would cause Congress ``becoming unhinged''? Did they  discuss why Congress would have such a strong reaction and whether it  would be justified? Did Blair raise any objections to this seemingly  unexplained decision to freeze the funds? The Senate could obtain these  answers by hearing from these witnesses directly.    Now let's move on to the implementation of the freeze. Despite  Blair's warning about how Congress would react, President Trump ordered  a freeze on military aid to Ukraine in July. Blair and Duffey were  directly involved in executing the President's order. To be clear,  decisions remain shrouded in secrecy, but key actions have been  revealed.   On July 3, the State Department told various officials that OMB was  blocking it from spending its $141 million portion of the aid. More  specifically, OMB directed the State Department not to send a  notification to Congress about spending the aid. Without that  notification, the aid was effectively frozen.   Who from OMB ordered the State Department not to send its  congressional notification? Did they give a reason? We just don't know.  Remember, at President Trump's instruction, OMB and the State  Department refused to produce a single document to the House, but the  direction almost certainly came from Duffey or one of his subordinates,  acting on behalf of President Trump.   We also know that on July 12, Blair sent an email to Duffey. Duffey's  subordinate, Mark Sandy, saw the email and described it in his  testimony before the House. As Sandy testified, it was Blair who  conveyed that ``the President is directing a hold on military support  funding for Ukraine.'' And that email only addressed Ukraine.   Blair's email raises several questions. What other discussions took  place about the President's decision to freeze  [[Page S418]]  the aid? Did the President or Mulvaney give Blair a reason for the  freeze? Did Blair know that the President was holding the aid to  pressure Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rival?   We also know that 2 days before Blair sent his email to Duffey,  Ambassador Sondland told Ukrainian officials that he had a deal with  Mulvaney. The deal consisted of a White House visit for President  Zelensky on Ukraine conducting the political investigations that  President Trump sought. That is what prompted Ambassador Bolton to say  he was ``not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are  cooking up.''   Blair is Mulvaney's senior adviser. Did Blair know about the  Sondland/Mulvaney deal? Did he know that they were leveraging an  official White House visit for the President to get Ukraine to  investigate his political rival? The White House was unable to provide  any reason for the hold.   Throughout this period, officials across the executive branch started  asking questions--questions about the freeze on the military aid.  Around July 17 or 18, Duffey emailed Blair. He asked about the reason  for the freeze, but he got no explanation. Instead, Blair insisted: We  need to let the hold take place and they could revisit the issue with  the President later.   In the House, we heard testimony from multiple officials, including  Ambassador Taylor, who was until very recently our top diplomat in  Ukraine, our numero uno. We also heard from several other officials  from the Department of Defense, the NSC staff, and OMB, but no one--no  one--heard any credible evidence, any credible explanation for the  freeze at the time. No one. Nada. Senators, think about it. Not even  our top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine had any idea as to why the President  had ordered the funds frozen. That is shocking. That should worry every  single one of us here.   Here are some of those witnesses. They are up on the slide. Again, no  one tells why--why this decision was made so secretly and without any  explanation. Why was the President compromising the safety of his  strategic ally in the region? Why was he harming our national security  interests in the process?   On July 26, Duffey attended a meeting of high-level executive branch  officials. Duffey made clear that the freeze on military aid was based  on President Trump's express direction.   But, apparently, he could not clearly explain whether it was a freeze  beyond a vague reference to concerns about corruption.   Witnesses who testified before the House all provided the same  consistent recounting of what happened. As you can see from the  statements on the slide, officials were not provided a clear  explanation for such a dramatic step.   As we have already discussed earlier and will explain in more depth  during the trial, these facts contradict the White House's recent  claims of why President Trump froze the Ukraine aid. Those facts  clearly show efforts by this President and those around him to  fabricate explanations after the President's illegal scheme came to  light.   In fact, the White House Counsel's own review of the freeze  reportedly found that Mulvaney and OMB attempted to create an after- the-fact justification for the President's decision. That is a polite  way of saying Mulvaney's team led an effort to cover up the President's  conduct and to manufacture misleading pretextual explanations to hide  the corruption.   Senators, there is still more. Blair and Duffey were also involved in  the events surrounding President's July 25 phone call with President  Zelensky. On July 19, Blair, along with other officials, received an  email from Ambassador Sondland. The email described a conversation he  had just had with President Zelensky. Ambassador Sondland stated that  Zelensky was ``prepared to receive POTUS' call,'' and ``will assure him  that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation'' and will  ``turn over every stone.''   As reflected in this email and confirmed by his testimony, Ambassador  Sondland had helped President Zelensky prepare for his July 25 phone  call with President Trump, telling him it was necessary to assure  President Trump that he would conduct the investigations. Ambassador  Sondland then reported back to Blair and others that President Zelensky  was prepared to do just that.   Blair knew the plan. As Ambassador Sondland put it, he was in the  loop on the scheme.   Why was Blair part of this group? What was his involvement in setting  up the call? What did he understand Sondland's message to mean? What  did he know about the investigations sought by the President? Did he  have any conversations with the President or Mulvaney about the  President's request for the investigations? We need Blair's testimony  to answer these questions.   And then, 6 days later, Blair was in the Situation Room, listening  in--listening in--on President Trump's July 25 call with President  Zelensky. He heard President Zelensky raise the issue of U.S. aid to  Ukraine. He heard President Trump respond but asked him for ``a favor,  though''--namely, investigations of the 2016 election and of Vice  President Biden.   The House heard the testimony of three of the other officials who  listened into the President's July 25 call--directly listened in.  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, Tim Morrison, and Jennifer Williams--each  of them expressed concerns about the call. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman  and Tim Morrison immediately reported the call to NSC lawyers. Jennifer  Williams said the call ``struck her as unusual and inappropriate,'' and  further, ``more political in nature.''   Senators, the American people deserve to hear if Blair shared the  concerns of the other officials who listened to the President's call.  What was his reaction to the call? Did he take notes? Was he at all  concerned like the other officials? Did he know exactly what was  happening and why? Did the evidence we have suggest he did know? But  the Senate should have the opportunity to ask him directly.   Just 90 minutes after that July 25 call, Blair's contact at OMB,  Michael Duffey, sent officials of the Department of Defense an email to  make sure that DOD continued to freeze the military aid that Ukraine so  desperately needed. This email, like all others, was not produced to  the House. However, it was produced pursuant to court order in a  Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.   As the email reflects, Duffey told the DOD officials that based on  the guidance he had received, they should ``hold off any additional DOD  obligations of these funds.''   Duffey added that the request was sensitive and that they should keep  this information closely held. This email, too, raises questions that  Duffey should answer. What exactly was the guidance Duffey received?  Who gave it to him? Was it connected to President Trump's phone call?  And why was it so sensitive that he directed DOD to keep it closely  held? The Senate should demand the answers to these questions.   The Senate should also hear from Duffey as to why he abruptly removed  a career OMB official who questioned the freeze on military aid to  Ukraine and whether he did so at the direction of the White House or  President Trump. Throughout July, Mark Sandy, the OMB career official  who handled military aid to Ukraine, repeatedly tried to get Duffey to  provide an explanation for the freeze. He was unsuccessful.   Sandy and other officials from OMB and the Pentagon also raised  questions about the freeze violating the Empowerment Control Act, the  Federal law that limits the President's ability to withhold funds that  have been allocated by Congress.   In fact, two career OMB officials ultimately resigned, in part, based  on concerns about the handling of the Ukraine military aid freeze.  These concerns were not unfounded.   Just last week, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office  issued a detailed legal opinion finding that OMB had violated Federal  law by executing the President's order to freeze military aid to  Ukraine. Remarkably, on July 29, after Sandy had expressed his concerns  about the legality of the freeze, Duffey removed Sandy from  responsibility for Ukraine military aid. Instead, Duffey took over  responsibility for withholding the aid himself. He was a political  appointee. He had no relevant experience. He had no demonstration of  interest in such matters. His last job had been as a State-level  Republican Party official.  [[Page S419]]    He is the one who took over responsibility for withholding the aid?  He gave no credible explanation for his decision. He only said that he  wanted to become ``more involved in daily operations.''   Sandy, who has decades of experience, testified that nothing like  this had ever happened in his career. His boss, a political appointee,  just happened to have a sudden interest in being more hands-on and was  now laser-focused exclusively on Ukraine.   The Senate should ask Duffey why he took over the handling of the  Ukraine military aid. Was he directed to? Why was Sandy removed from  his responsibility over Ukraine aid? Was it because he expressed  concerns about the legality of the freeze?   These questions are those that Duffey would be able to answer.   Now we move on to warnings from DOD. Around this period, in late July  and early August, Duffey also ignored warnings from DOD about the  legality of the freeze. The Senate should hear from him and judge what  he has to say. Throughout July and August, Duffey executed President  Trump's freeze of the military aid through a series of funding  documents from OMB.   In carefully worded footnotes, OMB tried to claim that this ``was a  brief pause and it would not affect DOD's ability to spend the money on  time.''   As we now know from public reporting, as a freeze continued, DOD  officials grew more and more alarmed. They knew the freeze would impact  DOD's ability to spend the funds before the end of the fiscal year. DOD  officials, including Deputy Under Secretary McCusker, voiced these  concerns to Duffey on multiple occasions.   First, in an email on August 9, McCusker told Duffey DOD could no  longer support OMB's claim that the freeze would not preclude timely  execution of the aid for Ukraine. Her email read:         As we discussed, as of 12 August, I don't think we can       agree that the pause will not preclude timely execution. We       hope it won't, and we will do all we can to execute once the       policy decision is made but can no longer make that       declarative statement.    Then, again, on August 12, McCusker warned Duffey in an email: The  footnotes needed to include a caveat that ``execution risk increases  continued delays.''   The House never received these documents from OMB or DOD. We know  what they contain because of public reporting, despite persistent  efforts by the Trump administration to keep them from Congress and the  public.   The Pentagon's alarm should have raised concerns for Duffey. Did he  share DOD's concerns with anyone else? Did he agree with those concerns  or take any actions in response? Did he take direction from Blair, the  White House, or President Trump? These are questions that Duffey should  answer.   Despite his actions executing the President's freeze, Duffey  internally expressed reservations about it. In August, he signed off on  a memorandum to Acting Director Vought that recommended releasing the  aid. That memo stated that the military aid was consistent with the  United States' national security strategy in the region, that it served  to counter Russian aggression, and that the aid was rooted in  bipartisan support in Congress. This is contrary to Duffey's actions  leading up to the memo. What changed? What caused Duffey to disagree  with the President's direction to continue to withhold the aid? Duffey  should be called to explain why he recommended that the President  release the aid, what other steps he took to advocate for the  release. Does he know why Vought and the White House apparently  disregarded the recommendation?    Based on public reporting, we know, after the press reported the  freeze in late August, OMB circulated talking points falsely claiming  ``no action has been taken by OMB that would preclude the obligation of  these funds before the end of the fiscal year.''   According to public reporting, McCusker responded with an email to  Duffey to tell him that this was ``just not accurate'' and that DOD had  been ``consistently conveying'' that for weeks. Due to the public  release of these emails and recent reporting, we also know that Duffey  emailed McCusker on August 30 and told her there was a ``clear  direction from POTUS'' to continue the freeze.   McCusker continued to warn that the freeze was having real effects on  DOD's ability to spend the military aid, and the impact would keep  growing if the freeze continued. According to recent reports, around  September 9, after the President's scheme had been exposed and the  House had launched its investigations, Duffey responded to McCusker's  warnings with a formal and lengthy email. He asserted it would be DOD's  fault, not OMB's, if DOD was unable to spend funds in time. Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense Elaine McCusker reportedly responded: ``I am  speechless.''   We now know that DOD's concerns were well-founded. The President's  freeze on the security aid was illegal. Duffey should be called to  testify about why DOD's repeated warnings went unheeded. What prompted  his email that attempted to shift blame to DOD about the fact that the  President released the aid only after his scheme was exposed?   Senators, make no mistake. We have a detailed factual record showing  the freeze was President Trump's decision and that he did it to  pressure Ukraine to announce the political investigations he wanted.   But President Trump's decisions also set off a cascade of confusion  and misdirection within the executive branch. As the President's  political appointees carried out his orders, career officials tried to  do their jobs--or, at the very least, not break the law. Blair and  Duffey would help shed more light on how the President's orders were  carried out. That is why committees of the House issued subpoenas for  both of their testimony, but Blair and Duffey, as I said earlier, like  many other Trump officials, refused to appear because the President  ordered them not to appear. I might add, as a former judge, I have  never seen anything like this before, where someone is ordered not to  appear by one party and the witnesses just don't appear.   The Senate should not allow the President and his administration to  continue to evade accountability based on these ever-shifting and ever- meritless excuses. We need to hold him accountable because no one is  above the law.   (English translation of statement made in Spanish is as follows:)   No one is above the law.   Blair and Duffey have valuable testimony to offer. The Senate should  call upon them to do their duty by issuing this subpoena.   Mr. Chief Justice, the House managers reserve the balance of our time  for an opportunity to respond to the President's argument.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, Pam Bondi, Special Advisor  to the President, former attorney general of Florida.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Ms. Bondi.   Ms. Counsel BONDI. Honorable Senators, just to fact-correct, please,  a few things. Mr. Duffey didn't come from a State job. Mr. Duffey came  from Deputy Chief of Staff at DOD before he went to OMB. There is a big  difference there.   Manager Garcia said he failed to appear. Well, the House committee  would not allow agency counsel to appear with Mr. Duffey or Mr. Blair.  They would not let agency counsel appear with either of them.   Office of Legal Counsel determined, of course, that the exclusion of  agency counsel from House proceedings is unconstitutional. It is a  pretty basic right. So what did they do? They took no action on the  subpoenas, but now they want you to take action on them.   What the House managers have been telling you all day is that the  White House is trying to hide from American people what witnesses had  to say. They have been saying we want to bury evidence; we want to hide  evidence. That hypocrisy is astounding. They have been saying: Let's  not forget why we are here.   Well, we are here tonight because they threw due process, fundamental  fairness, and our Constitution out the window in the House proceedings.  That is why we are here--because they started in the secret bunker  hearings where the President and his counsel weren't even allowed to  participate when they were trying to impeach him.   Intel and Judiciary Committee was a one-sided circus. Ranking Member  [[Page S420]]  Nunes asked to call witnesses. He explained why in detail. It was  denied by Manager Schiff. Ranking Member Collins asked to call  witnesses, which was denied by Manager Nadler. And that is what they  call fairness? That is not how our American justice system works, and  it is certainly not how our impeachment process is designed by our  Constitution.   The House took no action on the subpoenas issued to Mr. Duffey and  Mr. Blair because they didn't want a court to tell them that they were  trampling on their constitutional rights. Now they want this Chamber to  do it for them.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, we yield the remainder of  our time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. House managers have 24 minutes remaining.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, a couple of fact checks, once  again.   First of all, the complaint is made that, well, the House wouldn't  allow agency counsel. Why wouldn't the House allow agency counsel to be  present in those secret depositions that you have been hearing so much  about? As I mentioned earlier, those secret depositions allowed 100  Members of the House to participate. There are 100 Members of the  Senate. We could have had that secret deposition right here on the  Senate floor. During those depositions, Members of both parties were  given equal time to ask questions of these witnesses.   By the way, where did Democrats get that rule of no agency counsel  during these depositions? We got it from the Republicans. This was the  Republican deposition rule, and we can cite you adamant explanations by  Trey Gowdy and others about how these rules are so important that the  depositions not be public, that agency counsel be excluded.   And why? Well, you get a good sense of it when you see the testimony  of Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent. Kent describes how he is at  a meeting with some of the State Department lawyers and others, and  they are talking about the document request from Congress and what are  they going to do about these and what documents are responsive and what  documents aren't responsive. The issue comes up in a letter the State  Department sent to Congress saying: You are intimidating the witnesses.  Secretary Kent testified: No, no, no. The Congress wasn't intimidating  witnesses; it was the State Department that was intimidating witnesses  to try to prevent them from testifying.   My colleagues at the other table say: Why aren't you allowing the  Members from the State Department to sit next to those witnesses and  hear what they have to say in the depositions? We have seen all too  much witness intimidation in this investigation, to begin with, without  having an agency minder sitting in on the deposition.   By the way, those agency minders don't get to sit in on grand jury  interviews either. There is a very good investigative reason that has  been used by Republicans and Democrats who have been adamant about the  policy of excluding agency counsel.   It was also represented that the Intelligence Committee and the  Judiciary Committee wouldn't allow the minority to call any witnesses.  That is just not true. In fact, fully one-third of the witnesses who  appeared in open hearing in our committee were minority-chosen  witnesses. What they ended up having to say was pretty darn  incriminating of the President, but, nonetheless, they chose them.   So about this idea that, well, we had no due process, the fact of the  matter is, we followed the procedures in the Clinton and Nixon  impeachments. They can continue to say we didn't, but we did. In some  respects, we gave even greater due process opportunities here than  there. The fact that the President would take no advantage of them  doesn't change the fact that they had that opportunity.   Finally, the claim is made that we trampled on the constitutional  rights by daring to subpoena these witnesses. How dare we subpoena  administration officials--right?--because Congress never does that. How  dare we do that. How dare we subpoena them. Well, the court heard that  argument in the case of Don McGahn, and you should read the judge's  opinion in finding that this claim of absolute immunity has no support,  no substance; it would have resulted in a monarchy. It is essentially  the judicial equivalent of: Don't let the door hit you in the backside  on the way out, Counsel. There is no merit there.   Counsel can repeat that argument as often as they like, but there is  no support in the courts for it. There should be no support for it in  this body, not if you want any of your subpoenas in the future to mean  anything at all.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                               Motion To Table     Mr. Chief Justice, I send an amendment to the desk to  prevent the selective admission of evidence and provide for the  appropriate handling of classified and confidential materials, and I  ask that it be read. It is short.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the amendment.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an       amendment numbered 1290.         On page 2, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:        If, during the impeachment trial of Donald John Trump, any       party seeks to admit evidence that has not been submitted as       part of the record of the House of Representatives and that       was subject to a duly authorized subpoena, that party shall       also provide the opposing party all other documents       responsive to that subpoena. For the purposes of this       paragraph, the term ``duly authorized subpoena'' includes any       subpoena issued pursuant to the impeachment inquiry of the       House of Representatives.        The Senate shall take all necessary measures to ensure the       proper handling of confidential and classified information in       the record.    The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send an amendment to the desk to  issue a subpoena to John Robert Bolton, and I ask that it be read.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the amendment.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an       amendment numbered 1291.        At the appropriate place in the resolving clause, insert       the following:        Sec. ___.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, pursuant to  [[Page S423]]       rules V and VI of the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the       Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials, the Chief Justice       of the United States, through the Secretary of the Senate,       shall issue a subpoena for the taking of testimony of John       Robert Bolton, and the Sergeant at Arms is authorized to       utilize the services of the Deputy Sergeant at Arms or any       other employee of the Senate in serving the subpoena       authorized to be issued by this section.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amendment is arguable by the parties with 2  hours equally divided.   Mr. Manager Schiff, are you a proponent?   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Yes, I am.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, are you an opponent?   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, you may proceed, and you may reserve  time for rebuttal.   Mr. Manager NADLER. Before I begin, Mr. Chief Justice, the House  managers will be reserving the balance of our time to respond to the  arguments of the counsel for the President.   Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel for the President, the House  managers strongly support this amendment to subpoena John Bolton. I am  struck by what we have heard from the President's counsel so far  tonight. They complain about process, but they do not seriously contest  any of the allegations against the President. They insist that the  President has done nothing wrong, but they refuse to allow the evidence  and hear from the witnesses. They will not permit the American people  to hear from the witnesses, and they lie and lie and lie and lie.   For example, for months, President Trump has repeatedly complained  that the House denied them the right to call witnesses, to cross- examine witnesses, and so forth. You heard Mr. Cipollone repeat this  lie today. Well, I have with me the letter that I sent as Chairman of  the House Judiciary Committee last November 26, inviting the President  and his counsel to attend our hearings, to cross-examine the witnesses,  to call witnesses of his own, and so forth. I also have the White House  letter signed by Mr. Cipollone, rejecting that offer. We should expect  at least a little regard for the truth from the White House, but that  is apparently too much to expect.   Ladies and gentlemen, this is a trial. At a trial, the lawyers  present evidence. The American people know that. Most 10-year-olds know  that. If you vote to block this witness or any of the evidence that  should be presented here, it can only be because you do not want the  American people to hear the evidence, that you do not want a fair  trial, and that you are complicit in President Trump's efforts to hide  his misconduct and hide the truth from the American people.   Ambassador Bolton was appointed by President Trump. He has stated his  willingness to testify in this trial. He is prepared to testify. He  says that he has relevant evidence not yet disclosed to the public. His  comments reaffirm what is obvious from the testimony and documents  obtained by the House, which highlight Ambassador Bolton's role in the  repeated criticism of the President's misconduct.   In fact, extensive evidence collected by the House makes clear that  Ambassador Bolton not only had firsthand knowledge of the Ukraine  scheme but that he was deeply concerned with it. He described the  scheme as a ``drug deal'' to a senior member of the staff. He warned  that President Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, would ``blow  everybody up.'' Indeed, in advance of the July 25, 2019, call,  Ambassador Bolton expressed concern that President Trump would ask the  Ukrainian President to announce these political investigations, which  is, of course, exactly what happened. Of course, there weren't to be  any investigations. All he cared about was an announcement to smear a  political rival in the United States. He repeatedly urged his staff to  report their own concerns about the President's conduct to legal  counsel--that is, Ambassador Bolton did, not the President--as the  scheme was unfolding.   Finally, as National Security Advisor, he also objected to the  President's freezing of military aid to Ukraine and advocated for the  release of that aid, including directly with President Trump. Of  course, as we all know, the Impoundment Control Act makes illegal the  President's withholding of that aid after Congress had voted for it,  but the President ignored the warnings about that because all he cared  about was smearing a political rival. The law meant nothing to him.   Ambassador Bolton has made clear that he is ready, willing, and able  to testify about everything he witnessed, but President Trump does not  want you to hear from Ambassador Bolton, and the reason has nothing to  do with executive privilege or this other nonsense. The reason has  nothing to do with national security. If the President cared about  national security, he would not have blocked military assistance to a  vulnerable strategic ally in the attempt to secure a personal political  favor for himself.   No, the President does not want you to hear from Ambassador Bolton  because the President does not want the American people to hear  firsthand testimony about the misconduct at the heart of this trial.  The question is whether the Senate will be complicit in the President's  crimes by covering them up. Any Senator who votes against Ambassador  Bolton's testimony or any relevant testimony shows that he or she  wants to be part of the coverup. What other possible reason is there to  prohibit a relevant witness from testifying here? Unfortunately, so  far, I have seen every Republican Senator has shown that they want to  be part of the coverup by voting against every document and witness  proposed.    Ambassador Bolton is a firsthand witness to President Trump's abuse  of power. As the National Security Advisor, he reported directly to the  President and supervised the entire National Security Council. That  included three key witnesses with responsibility for Ukraine matters  who testified in great detail before the House--Dr. Fiona Hill, Tim  Morrison, and LTC Alexander Vindman.   Moreover, in his role, John Bolton was the tip of the spear for  President Trump on national security. It was his responsibility to  oversee everything happening in the Trump administration regarding  foreign policy and national security. By virtue of his unique position  appointed by the President, Bolton had knowledge of the latest  intelligence and developments in our relationship with Ukraine,  including our support of the country and its new President, and that is  why the President and some Members of this body are afraid to hear from  Ambassador Bolton--because they know he knows too much.   There is also substantial evidence that Ambassador Bolton kept a keen  eye on Rudy Giuliani, who was acting on behalf of the President in  connection with Ukraine. As we will describe, Ambassador Bolton  communicated directly with Mr. Giuliani at key moments. He knows the  details of the so-called drug deal he would later warn against.   Perhaps most importantly, Ambassador Bolton has said both that he  will testify and that he has relevant information that has not yet been  disclosed. A key witness has come forward and confirmed not only that  he participated in critically important events but that he has new  evidence we have not yet heard. That is precisely what Ambassador  Bolton has done. His lawyer tells us that Ambassador Bolton was  ``personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and  conversations about which the House heard testimony, as well as many  relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in  the testimony thus far.''   Ambassador Bolton was requested as a witness in the House inquiry,  but he refused to appear voluntarily. His lawyers informed the House  Intelligence Committee that Ambassador Bolton would take the matter to  court if issued a subpoena, as his subordinate did, but the Ambassador  changed his tune. He recently issued a statement confirming that ``if  the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to  testify.''   So the question presented as to Ambassador Bolton is clear. It comes  down to this: Will the Senate do its duty and hear all the evidence? Or  will it slam this door shut and show it is participating in a coverup  because it fears to hear testimony from the former National Security  Advisor of the President, because it fears what he might say or it  fears he knows too much?  [[Page S424]]    Consider this as well: Why is President Trump so intent on preventing  us from hearing Ambassador Bolton, his own appointee, his formerly  trusted confidant? Because he knows--he knows--his guilt and he knows  that he doesn't want people who know about it to testify. The question  is whether Republican Senators here today will participate in that  coverup.   The reasons seem clear. President Trump wants to block this witness  because Ambassador Bolton has direct knowledge of the Ukraine scheme,  which he called a drug deal. Let's start with the key meeting that took  place on July 10.   Just 2 weeks before President Trump's now famous July 25 call with  President Zelensky, Ambassador Bolton hosted senior Ukrainian officials  in his West Wing office. That meeting included Dr. Hill, Lieutenant  Colonel Vindman, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, and Energy Secretary  Rick Perry. As they did in every meeting they took with U.S. officials,  Ukrainian officials asked when President Trump would schedule a White  House meeting for the newly elected Ukrainian President because it was  very important for the Ukrainian President, a new President of an  embattled democracy being invaded by Russia, to show that he had  legitimacy by a meeting with the United States.   Dr. Hill testified that Ambassador Sondland blurted out that he had a  deal with Mr. Mulvaney for a White House visit, provided that Ukraine  first announce investigations into the President's political rivals.  Ambassador Bolton immediately stiffened and ended the meeting. Dr.  Hill's testimony is on the screen.   In other words, Ambassador Bolton and others at the meeting were  interested in the national security of the United States. They were  interested in protecting an American ally against Russian invasion.  They couldn't understand why this sudden order was coming from the  President to abandon that ally because they didn't yet know--they  didn't yet know--of the President's plot to try to extort the Ukrainian  Government into doing him a political favor by announcing an  investigation of a political rival.   When Dr. Hill reported back to Ambassador Bolton about the second  conversation, Ambassador Bolton told Dr. Hill to go to the National  Security Council's legal advisor, John Eisenberg, and tell him: ``I am  not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on  this.''   Here is an excerpt of her hearing testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   I send an amendment to the desk to provide for a vote of the Senate  on any motion to subpoena witnesses or documents after the question  period, and I waive its reading.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there any objection to the waiving of the  reading?   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. I object.    I withdraw my request for a waiver.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Does any Senator have an objection to the waiving  of the reading?    Mr. Chief Justice, I send an amendment to the desk to  allow adequate time for written responses to any motions by the  parties, and I ask that it be read.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the amendment.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an       amendment numbered 1293.        On page 2, beginning on line 10, strike ``11:00 a.m. on       Wednesday, January 22, 2020'' and insert ``9:00 a.m. on       Thursday, January 23, 2020''.        On page 2, line 15, strike ``Wednesday, January 22, 2020''       and insert ``Thursday, January 23, 2020''.    The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amendment is arguable by the parties for 2  hours, equally divided.   Mr. Manager Schiff, are you a proponent of this amendment?   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, I am a proponent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, are you a proponent or an opponent  of this amendment?   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, I am an opponent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Okay.   Mr. Schiff, you may proceed and reserve time for rebuttal if you  wish.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   This amendment is quite simple. Under the McConnell resolution, the  parties file motions tomorrow at 9 a.m.--written motions, that is--and  the responding party has to file their reply 2 hours later. That really  doesn't give anybody enough time to respond to a written motion.   When the President's team filed, for example, their trial brief, it  was over 100 pages. We at least had 24 hours to file our reply, and  that is all we would ask for. In the Clinton trial--again, if we are  interested in the Clinton case--they had 41 hours to respond to written  motions. We are not asking for 41 hours, but we are asking for enough  time to write a decent response to a motion.   That is essentially it, and I would hope that we could agree at least  on this.   I reserve the balance of my time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the  Senate.   So it seems like tomorrow is a day off according to your procedure;  is that correct, Mr. Schiff?   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I forgot the time.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Today is tomorrow, and tomorrow is today. The  answer is that we are ready to proceed. We will respond to any motions.  We would ask the Chamber to reject this amendment.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, there are 59 minutes remaining.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I yield back our time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.  [[Page S430]]                                    Motion to Table     Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of Senator Van Hollen, I  send an amendment to the desk to help ensure impartial justice by  requiring the Chief Justice of the United States to rule on motions to  subpoena witnesses and documents. I ask that it be read. This is our  last amendment of the evening.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the amendment.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for Mr. Van       Hollen, proposes an amendment numbered 1294.        On page 3, line 20, insert ``The Presiding Officer shall       rule to authorize the subpoena of any witness or any document       that a Senator or a party moves to subpoena if the Presiding       Officer determines that the witness or document is likely to       have probative evidence relevant to either article of       impeachment before the Senate.'' after ``order.''.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amendment is arguable by the parties for 2  hours, equally divided.   Mr. Manager Schiff, are you a proponent or an opponent of the motion?   Mr. Manager Schiff. Mr. Chief Justice, I am a proponent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, are you a proponent or an opponent  of the motion?   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, I am an opponent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, you may proceed and reserve time for  rebuttal.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, this amendment would provide that the  Presiding Officer shall rule to authorize the subpoena of any witness  or any document that a Senator or a party moves to subpoena if the  Presiding Officer determines that that witness is likely to have  probative evidence relevant to either Article of Impeachment.   It is quite simple. It would allow the Chief Justice and it would  allow Senators, the House managers, and the President's counsel to make  use of the experience of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to  decide the questions of the relevance of witnesses. Either party can  call the witnesses, and if we can't come to an agreement on witnesses  ourselves, we will pick a neutral arbiter, that being the Chief Justice  of the Supreme Court. If the Chief Justice finds that a witness would  be probative, that witness would be allowed to testify. If the Chief  Justice finds the testimony would be immaterial, that witness would not  be allowed to testify.   Now, it still maintains the Senate's tradition that if you don't  agree with the Chief Justice, you can overrule him. If you have the  votes, you can overrule the Chief Justice and say you disagree with  what the Chief Justice has decided.   But it would give this decision to a neutral party. That right is  extended to both parties, who will be done in line with the schedule  that the majority leader has set out. It is not the schedule we want.  We still don't think it makes any sense to have the trial and then  decide our witnesses. But if we are going to have to do it that way,  and it looks like we are, at least let's have a neutral arbiter  decide--much as he may loathe the task--whether a witness is relevant  or a witness is not.   We would hope that if there is nothing else we can agree on tonight,  that we could agree to allow the Chief Justice to give us the benefit  of his experience in deciding which witnesses are relevant to this  inquiry and which witnesses are not.   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, and  with no disrespect to the Chief Justice, this is not an appellate  court. This is the U.S. Senate. There is not an arbitration clause in  the U.S. Constitution. The Senate shall have the sole power to try all  impeachments. We oppose the amendment.   We yield our time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, you have 57 minutes remaining.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Well, this is a good note to conclude on because  don't let it be said we haven't made progress today.   The President's counsel has just acknowledged for the first time that  this is not an appellate court. I am glad we have established that.  This is the trial, not the appeal, and the trial ought to have  witnesses and the trial should be based on the cold record from the  court below, but there is no court below, because, as the counsel has  just admitted, you are not the appellate court.   But I think what we have also seen here tonight is, they not only  don't want you to hear these witnesses, they don't want to hear them  live. They don't want even really to hear them deposed. They don't want  a neutral Justice to weigh in because if the neutral Justice weighs in  and says: You know, pretty hard to argue that John Bolton is not  relevant here, pretty hard to argue that Mick Mulvaney is not relevant  here--I just watched that videotape where he said he discussed this  with the President. They are contesting it. Pretty relevant.   What about Hunter Biden? Hunter Biden is probably the real reason  they don't want the Chief Justice to have to rule on the materiality of  a witness, right? What can Hunter Biden tell us about why the President  withheld hundreds of millions of dollars from Ukraine? I can tell you  what he can tell us--nothing. What does Hunter Biden know about why the  President wouldn't meet with President Zelensky? He can't tell us  anything about that. What can he tell us about these Defense Department  documents or OMB documents? What can he tell us about the violation of  the law, withholding this money? Of course he can't tell us anything  about that because his testimony is immaterial and irrelevant. The only  purpose in calling him is to succeed at what they failed to do earlier  in this whole scheme, and that is to smear Joe Biden by going after his  son.   We trust the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to make that decision  that he is not a material witness. This isn't like fantasy football  here. We are not making trades--or we shouldn't be. We will trade you  one completely irrelevant, immaterial witness who allows us to smear  the President's opponent in exchange for ones who are really relevant  whom you should hear. Is that a fair trial?   If you can't trust the Chief Justice, appointed by a Republican  President, to make a fair decision about materiality, I think it  betrays the weakness of your case.   Look, I will be honest. There has been some apprehension on our side  about this idea, but we have confidence that the Chief Justice would  make a fair and impartial decision and that he would do impartial  justice, and it is something that my colleagues representing the  President don't. They don't. They don't want a fair judicial  [[Page S431]]  ruling about this. They don't want one that you could overturn because  they don't want a fair trial.   And so we end where we started--with one party wanting a fair trial  and one party that doesn't; one party that doesn't fear a fair trial  and one party that is terrified of a fair trial.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                               Motion to Table
