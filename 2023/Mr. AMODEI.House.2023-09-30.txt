 Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Legislative Branch  Subcommittee in the Appropriations Committee which has very specific  jurisdiction over Member pay, I want to say plainly and unambiguously,  in the 70 pages in this thing, directly or indirectly, there is nothing  that will lead to a Member pay raise. That will be next week when it is  appropriately considered on the floor in terms of cost of living or  other things.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time. With all due respect,  the definition of a CR is you go forward. There is nothing to block in  going forward with last year's language. That language still applies.  Thank you, good morning, and God bless America.    Mr. Speaker, there has been some indication of concern  because the bill on the floor lacks language to prohibit a cost-of- living increase that doesn't exist, that was not given, and which has  no appropriation in the existing fiscal year budget.   Normally, that would be the end of the discussion. However, I guess,  being generous here, out of an abundance of caution and respect for  those bill-drafting experts in the Senate, fixing that to include the  Senate's genius language in this measure is something that is eminently  doable in short order unless it becomes midnight because we have to  have a couple more September State of the Unions.   Therefore, even though it was not included in our legislation, even  though there is no existing COLA or appropriation for it, if that is  the only thing--I am going to say that real slowly--if that is the only  thing that is wrong, then it is eminently fixable for that belt-and- suspenders insurance policy for those who would support the bill but  for the lack of that language.   We shall see.
