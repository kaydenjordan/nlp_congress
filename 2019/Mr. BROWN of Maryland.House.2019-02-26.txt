 Mr. Speaker, there is no national emergency on  our southern border. There are no terrorists who are being apprehended.  There is no invading hostile force, and border crossings remain at a  40-year low.   Pulling resources from military construction projects, as President  Trump would do, projects meant to improve readiness and support our  servicemembers, impacts our national security. It will hurt military  families who are already dealing with military housing with mold and  lead poisoning, and outdated schools and medical facilities.   This declaration of national emergency will keep thousands of Active- Duty troops needlessly deployed at the southern border and away from  their scheduled training activities and operational readiness.   This is a fake emergency; and for President Trump to claim we need to  build a wall to support our Armed Forces, it is absurd and ridiculous.  This emergency declaration is just an overreaching and dangerous power  grab to push forward the President's anti-immigrant agenda and  supposedly boost his re-election chances.   There is no national emergency; only a crisis in the Oval Office.
