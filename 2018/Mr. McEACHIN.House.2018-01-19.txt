 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Nadler for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4712.   This act is a continuation of the House Republicans' decadelong  attempt to rob women of their constitutional right to safe, legal  abortion care. The bill we are considering today, however, takes these  attacks on women a step further.   H.R. 4712 seeks to supersede doctors' professional judgments,  imposing unnecessary, and potentially harmful, new standards of care.  Violation of these extreme standards will result in harsh criminal  penalties.   This bill seeks to intimidate doctors. If passed, it will discourage  them from providing care and make it harder for patients to receive the  help they need.   That is why it is opposed by respected medical organizations, such as  the American College of Obstetricians  [[Page H568]]  and Gynecologists, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, the  National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, and many  others.   It is simple: healthcare decisions should be between a woman and her  doctor.    Madam Speaker, again, it is simple: healthcare  decisions should be between a woman and her doctor.   Politicians are not medical experts and have no place interfering  with the provision of compassionate, evidence-based care.   Madam Speaker, I am an attorney and you can trust me with a lot of  things, but a medical decision on someone else's behalf is not one of  them.   As we mark the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we should be  advancing policies that help women and families, rather than  restricting access to healthcare they need and deserve.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 4712.
