 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding to me.   Before I came to Congress, I was an elected district attorney for 12  years in Staten Island, New York. Prior to that, I spent 8 years in the  Manhattan DA's office as a prosecutor.   Very few things disturb me after all of those 20 years of prosecuting  cases, but then it came to my attention about sex dolls being shipped  from foreign lands to the United States for only one purpose: to be  used as sex objects that simulate a young child.   As the chairman spoke earlier, these dolls can be formed. They can be  created. They can be designed to appear in any shape or form that the  abuser wants them to be. They have realistic eyelashes, realistic hair,  warming devices, and cleaning apparatuses. They are totally, as my good  friend from Texas said, disgusting.                                time  1430    They appear to be lifelike replicas of young children. A fully  customized doll can cost up to $10,000. But the dolls that the chairman  was referring to on Amazon were as low as $409 with free shipping. That  is less than the cost of an iPhone.   The good news is, as the chairman brought out, Amazon no longer sells  these products. The bad news is the dolls are still available for sale  on other websites. The dolls when they are shipped are purposely  labeled as mannequins to disguise what their true purpose is.   Science has shown that dolls normalize pedophilic behavior rather  than discourage pedophiles from acting out on their urges or  aggression.   The bill is supported by the Stop Abuse Campaign, the Stop Child  Predators, and the Foundation for Responsible Robotics. Over 166,000  signatures have been written on a petition by Change.org. This  demonstrates that this bill is something that the American people want.   In the first year of its ban, the United Kingdom found that 85  percent of the men who possessed these dolls also possessed child  pornography.   We are trying to get ahead of this problem. We are trying to protect  children. I believe this legislation will protect countless children  from pedophiles throughout our Nation.  [[Page H5121]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his support, and I urge all of  my colleagues in the House to pass H.R. 4655, the CREEPER Act.
