 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent to start the regularly  scheduled vote.    Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to speak  as if in morning business.    Mr. President, in the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico,  there is a stunning 13-mile-wide crater that was created by a collapsed  supervolcano. What is now known as the Valles Caldera National Preserve  is home to a deep grassy valley, volcanic cinder cones, crystal-clear  trout streams, and some of the best elk habitat in North America. The  Valles Caldera National Preserve is one of the most beautiful places on  the planet, but for many, many decades most New Mexicans could only  peer into its edge from the side of a road. The entire Caldera was  privately owned. That has since changed.   In 2000, we used the Land and Water Conservation Fund to purchase the  Valles Caldera, but it took nearly a decade and a half after that to  see truly meaningful public access.   One New Mexican deserves an enormous amount of credit for unlocking  the Valles Caldera and its scenic hiking trails, elk hunting, and its  trout fishing. That New Mexican is Kent Salazar.   As a member of the New Mexico Game Commission, Kent sought to undo a  system that allowed wealthy and out-of-state hunters to purchase  greater access to elk hunting than everyday New Mexicans or Americans.  In the face of big money opposition, Kent pushed to establish a fair  and equal lottery system that honored the principle of ``one person,  one chance,'' and he succeeded.   I have personally harvested two elk in the Caldera thanks in part to  the changes that Kent made. Then, after President Obama appointed Kent  to lead the Valles Caldera Board of Trustees, he quickly became a  champion for transitioning the Valles Caldera to a National Park  Service managed preserve.   This change has expanded public access and made it possible for many  more New Mexicans--and for visitors from around the world--to  experience this incredible landscape. It also protected the public's  fair access to both hunting and fishing, and none of this would have  been possible without the determination, leadership, and vision of my  friend, Kent Salazar.   A lifelong New Mexican, Kent has dedicated himself to the idea that  the outdoors are for everyone, not just for those with wealth or family  connections. And from an early age, Kent found that time spent outdoors  brought him a sense of renewal. And ever since, he has worked to make  sure that all New Mexicans and all Americans can build a connection  with nature.   For 20 years as a public administrator, Kent worked to make our land  and air and water safer and healthier at the city of Albuquerque's  Environmental Health Department.   An avid hunter, angler, and outdoorsman, Kent also breathed new life  into the New Mexico Wildlife Federation.    The legendary conservationist Aldo Leopold founded the organization  that became the New Mexico Wildlife Federation more than a century ago.  But when Kent took the reins, the organization had no staff and no real  driving mission. Even so, Kent saw the incredible potential if he could  reinvigorate the organization; and, that, he did.   Under Kent's leadership, the New Mexico Wildlife Federation grew its  membership dramatically and hired professional staff. Today, the New  Mexico Wildlife Federation is one of the most influential grassroots  organizations in our State. The organization has become much more  active and much more effective in protecting iconic New Mexico  landscapes, including the Valle Vidal, the Sabinoso Wilderness, and the  Rio Grande del Norte National Monument.   The impact of Kent's leadership has also grown nationally. Three  years ago, Kent was elected unanimously to serve as the chairman of the  National Wildlife Federation's Board of Directors. With the National  Wildlife Federation, Kent helped to lead the charge to secure permanent  and dedicated funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and pass  historic investments in landscape restoration as part of the Inflation  Reduction Act.   And he is still helping us today as we work to pass the bipartisan  Recovering America's Wildlife Act.   Kent also helped to found the Green Leadership Trust and Hispanics  Enjoying Camping, Hunting, and the Outdoors, or HECHO. Through all of  this, I have especially appreciated Kent's kindness and passion, his  pragmatism and knowledge, his devoted focus on making the conservation  movement more inclusive and mentoring the next generation of  conservation leaders, the way he keeps an open mind, listens to others,  and always seems to drive the whole room in a more productive  direction.   Kent's name might not make it to the newspaper that often, but it  should. He is one of the most effective conservation leaders of our  time. Kent once said:         [I]f we get the right people involved, we can accomplish a       lot, and help our communities and our future, our children.    He is absolutely right. We are all better off because Kent is  involved, serving our communities, our future, and our children.   I am extraordinarily grateful to have worked with and learned from  Kent for all these years, and I am honored to call him a friend.   Kent, we cannot thank you enough for everything that you have done to  inspire New Mexicans and to care for our Land of Enchantment.
