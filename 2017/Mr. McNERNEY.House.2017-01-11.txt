 Mr. Speaker, I rise to continue a series of cool 1- minute science topics.   Today, I will speak about science-based innovations in the field of  water rights. Previously, conflicts over water resource management have  reduced agricultural productivity and distracted farmers with lawsuits  and litigation. But researchers at the University of Illinois at  Urbana-Champaign have developed an online system for farmers to trade  groundwater pumping rights.   The National Science Foundation funded research that resulted in the  creation of a new company, Mammoth Trading, which allows farmers to  manage their lands and water rights to improve environmental  conditions, improve resource allocation, and increase efficiency.   These innovations demonstrate the power of science to increase  productivity and positively influence the market. Congress should  continue to encourage this type of ingenuity and innovation through R&D  science funding.                            ____________________
