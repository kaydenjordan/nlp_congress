 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. And I want to acknowledge Mr. Smith from New Jersey for  taking such courageous leadership on this very important issue. We as a  body thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, 47 years of the amoral destruction of life is 47 years  too long. As a physician, my pro-life conviction is rooted in the  Hippocratic oath's commitment to protecting human life. In the medical  community, each of us is called to do everything in our power to  protect the patients to whom we are assigned. Each of us pledges to do  no harm.   Mr. Speaker, Roe v. Wade directly contradicts this oath. Each life is  a precious gift that is truly worthy of our protection.   As our Nation marks another tragic anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I  remain committed to serving as a steadfast voice for the voiceless. As  we continue this fight, I remain eternally hopeful that our Nation will  someday value all human life for its inherent worth and its dignity.
