 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the consent  with respect to H.R. 88 be amended to reflect that the Murkowski  amendment was an amendment to the committee-reported amendment and the  committee substitute, as amended, be agreed to and the bill, as  amended, passed.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to consideration of S. Res. 536, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motionS to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I want to talk about some new  information regarding the Iran nuclear deal  [[Page S3267]]  negotiated by the Obama administration. This agreement is known  sometimes as the JCPOA, or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. This  is an agreement that was reached by the Obama administration. It was  voted on after the fact by this body. Actually, a majority of Members  of the House and Senate chose to oppose the agreement, but not enough  to be able to stop it. So it went into effect, and, as my colleagues  know, it has gotten some play recently as the administration has pulled  out the involvement of the United States in that agreement.   What I want to talk about this evening is new information that has  come from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair.  We began an investigation into one aspect of this agreement nearly 2  years ago, and it was based on information that we received that  despite the Obama administration's claims to the contrary, there may  have been some undisclosed arrangement with Iran to grant them access  to the U.S. financial system.   Recall that the basic deal with Iran went like this: In exchange for  Iran agreeing to certain limitations regarding its nuclear arsenal,  including limiting the new production of enriched uranium for 15 years,  the United States and other members of the United Nations Security  Council would agree to lift some economic sanctions on Iran. It was the  basic construct of the agreement.   As part of that agreement, which included ongoing deadlines that  needed to be met over a period of years, the United States lifted what  are often referred to as ``secondary sanctions.'' So these weren't  direct sanctions on the United States, but these were sanctions on  foreign companies, foreign entities, and foreign countries that do  business with those under U.S. sanctions--in this case, Iran.   Under the Iran deal, other countries were now allowed, for the first  time, to freely do business with Iran without the risk of the United  States imposing sanctions on them. That was something that was very  important to Iran. Iran was also allowed to access money that had been  frozen abroad in other countries because the threat of U.S. sanctions  against cooperating foreign partners no longer existed.   At the same time, really because of the nonnuclear concerns regarding  Iran, including supporting terrorism, human rights violations,  ballistic missile development, and basic destabilization of the region,  U.S. sanctions against Iran remained in place. So our primary sanctions  stayed in place. This means Iran was banned from directly accessing the  U.S. financial system, and banks and other private institutions were  still banned from accessing the U.S. financial systems on behalf of  Iran.   This is a big deal. Any country that is sanctioned really wants  access to our financial system because it is so intertwined with the  rest of the world, and they were still banned from directly accessing  our U.S. financial system.   This was a key point that the Obama administration made clear  throughout the negotiations with Iran. They repeatedly provided  assurances to the American people that Iran would not be granted access  to the U.S. financial system. They made the same claims publicly before  congressional committees and in testimony here on the Hill.   On July 23, 2015, before the deal was implemented, a senior Treasury  official, as an example, said: ``Iranian banks will not be able to  clear U.S. dollars through New York, hold correspondent account  relationships with U.S. financial institutions, or enter into financing  arrangements with U.S. banks.'' This testimony further stated: ``Iran,  in other words, will continue to be denied access to the world's  largest financial and commercial market.''   That is us. That is what they said.   On August 5, 2015, the then-Acting Under Secretary of Treasury for  Terrorism and Financial Intelligence testified before the U.S. Senate  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs that ``Iran will be  denied access to the world's most important market and unable to deal  in the world's most important currency''--that being the dollar.   He also stated: ``Iranian banks will not be able to clear U.S.  dollars through New York, hold correspondent account relationships with  U.S. financial institutions, or enter into financing arrangements with  U.S. banks.''   These claims were very clear: The U.S. financial system was not to be  used.   Despite these claims, the very next year, just after implementation  of the deal had begun, we started hearing reports that the Obama  administration was considering changing course on this policy.   This obviously raised a lot of concerns from Members of Congress on  both sides of the aisle because the Iranian regime remained a state  sponsor of terrorism--the No. 1 state sponsor of terror. It continued  to threaten ballistic missile activities, and it continued to commit  egregious violations of human rights, as it still does today. In fact,  in July of 2016, a bipartisan group of 35 Senators sent a letter to  President Obama expressing deep concern over these rumors that Iran  might be granted access to the U.S. dollar and to the U.S. financial  system.   It was about that time when we started our investigation in the  Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Again, we did so because we  were hearing rumors that this might be happening.   Today, after a nearly 2-year investigation, we unveiled a report that  detailed for the first time how, despite their claims to the contrary,  the Obama administration secretly granted a specific license  authorizing the conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of dollars  using the U.S. financial system.   Remember that this happened despite repeated assurances to the public  and Congress that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S.  financial system. Specifically, the Obama administration asked two  banks--U.S. banks--to execute the transactions. Fortunately, these two  big U.S. multinational banks refused to do so. The report outlines key  findings and recommendations designed to prevent this from happening in  the future.   What funds are we talking about? Well, before the Iran deal was  implemented, Iran transferred approximately $13 billion in oil revenue  assets to bank accounts overseas. They deposited $8.8 billion of that  oil revenue in one bank account at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman.   Three days after implementation of the agreement on January 19, 2016,  Bank Muscat contacted the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC,  which is the agency within the Treasury Department responsible for  enforcing U.S. sanctions. They did this on behalf of the Central Bank  of Iran. This is the Oman bank contacting the U.S. Treasury Department  saying: We need your help.   Bank Muscat sought to convert $5.7 billion in Omani money--the rial-- into euros on behalf of Iran. Because the rial is pegged to the U.S.  dollar, the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step  through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars, so that is what they asked for.  Iran was eager to convert this money into a more universal currency and  was adamant about getting this done quickly.   Despite its public stance that it would not provide Iran access to  the U.S. financial system and U.S. banks, on February 24, 2016, OFAC  again--this Department of the Treasury agency--issued a specific  license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth nearly $5.7  billion to flow through the U.S. financial system.   Today I heard some say that this specific license was just a narrow  exemption or just a minor fix. To that I direct my colleagues to an  email from a Bank Muscat official, which said that the license was ``a  gigantic breakthrough which has assured Iran of almost full global  financial inclusion.'' That doesn't sound like a narrow fix to me.   Anyone suggesting that the specific license didn't grant access to  the U.S. financial system hasn't read the report from the Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations. I would encourage them to do that. But  they also haven't read the Obama administration's emails that we cite  in this report.   Don't take my word for it, though. As one State Department official  wrote to his Iranian counterpart: ``OFAC informed Bank Muscat and the  Central Bank of Oman today that they have a license to convert Iranian  assets in its  [[Page S3268]]  account to euros through the U.S. financial system.''   That is from the State Department at the time.   Members of the Obama administration clearly understood that something  was wrong here; this was not part of the Iran deal. A senior State  Department official wrote at the time in 2016 that the transaction was  ``prohibited by U.S. sanctions that are still in place and which we  were clear we would not be removing as part of the JCPOA.'' That same  official wrote that granting the transaction ``exceeded'' the JCPOA  commitments because it authorized the use of the U.S. financial system.   Let me repeat that so it is crystal clear. The Obama administration  State Department completely understood this concession--that giving  Iran access to the U.S. financial system was ``prohibited by U.S.  sanctions'' that ``we were clear we would not be removing.''   Those aren't my words. They aren't the words of the subcommittee.  Those are the words of the senior State Department official at the  time. There was no confusion about this as far as we can tell.   Shortly after issuing the specific license to use the U.S. financial  system to convert the rials, a Treasury official wrote in an email on  the matter: ``I think we earned the right to never discuss this  matter ever again.''    I disagree. I think we have to talk about this and to talk about how  before, during, and after the Treasury Department and the State  Department officials testified in front of Congress that Iran would not  have access to the U.S. financial system, they worked behind the scenes  to allow exactly that. We have to talk about this to be sure it doesn't  happen again.   Following the issuance of the specific license, OFAC contacted these  two U.S. banks urging them to convert Iran's rials to U.S. dollars. It  appears the administration was becoming desperate. Iran was making both  public and private claims that they were not getting the benefit of the  deal they expected and asserting that the deal could fall apart. You  all may remember that time period, when there were threats by Iran to  pull out of the deal.   We discovered an email where a State Department official even  suggested that the Secretary of State or the Secretary of the Treasury  should contact these U.S. banks themselves and encourage them to  facilitate this conversion. By the way, we have no evidence that those  calls were made, and I am not suggesting that.   Both U.S. banks declined to complete the transaction. According to  the banks, they refused to do so due to compliance, reputational, and  legal risks associated with doing business with Iran. They did the  right thing.   Because U.S. banks were unwilling to convert the funds despite  requests from the Obama administration, ultimately, Bank Muscat was  unable to effectuate the conversion using the U.S. dollar. The State  Department has now told us that Iran, over time, converted the funds  into euros in small increments using European banks.   The only reason the transaction wasn't executed through the U.S.  financial system was that these two U.S. banks refused, despite  pressure, even though the administration asked them to help convert the  money.   After the Iran deal was implemented--and after the Treasury  Department had issued a specific license--the Obama administration  continued to maintain the false notion that it had not provided Iran  access to the U.S. financial system.   On April 5, 2016, Ambassador Thomas Shannon said: ``There is no  exchange of dollars inside the U.S. financial system, and we have not  allowed an access to our larger financial system.''   On May 25, 2016, the Acting Under Secretary of Treasury for Terrorism  and Financial Intelligence said: ``But Secretary Lew has said exactly  what I have said here today, and I know he was looking forward to me  being here to be able to relay his views on this. Iran will not have  access to our financial system.''   On June 7, 2016, Treasury wrote a letter to Senators Kirk and Rubio  saying: ``The administration has not been and is not planning to grant  Iran access to the U.S. financial system.''   Time after time--before, during, and after the Iran deal--the Obama  administration misled the American people and misled Congress on this  point. I believe it was because the administration was so eager to make  sure this deal was going to work. They wanted to keep Iran in the deal.   Our report also shows that the State Department and Treasury  Department held at least 200 meetings, or ``road shows,'' around the  world to encourage other countries to do business with Iran. In the  road shows, Treasury Department officials also downplayed any potential  future penalties or fines that might result from sanctions.   During one road show, the head of OFAC reportedly told the audience  that ``95 percent of the time OFAC sees an apparent violation it  results in a simple warning letter or no enforcement action.''   So this is the head of the agency at Treasury responsible for  enforcing sanctions saying that 95 percent of the time it results in a  simple warning letter or no enforcement action. We shouldn't be telling  anyone that we enforce sanctions--one of our most important foreign  policy tools--only 5 percent of the time.   One European regulator who attended an OFAC road show commented that  foreign financial institutions felt, in his words, ``political  pressure'' to conduct business with Iran and Iranian companies.  Sanctions are a vital foreign policy tool, yet, in this case, the Obama  administration seemed to be sending the wrong message about their  enforcement and effectiveness.   The PSI report released today outlines key transparency  recommendations to ensure that undisclosed side deals like this never  happen again, including requiring the current administration to keep  congressional committees of jurisdiction up to date on the status of  any future negotiations with Iran, disclosing to Congress any specific  licenses that are proposed, and putting in place stronger enforcement  of U.S. sanctions. Going forward, this report also underscores how  important the U.S. financial system is to global finance markets, and  it gives us a substantial amount of leverage in negotiations. We should  choose to use it.    We now have an opportunity to fix the fundamental flaws in the Iran  deal and put in place a stronger agreement that truly protects  America's national security interests and the interests of our allies  in the region. Recall that the Iran deal was opposed again by a  bipartisan majority of this body.   I support our efforts to work with our European allies to put in  place a better deal that truly represents our own national security  interests and those of our allies in the region. I hope this report  helps us to avoid the kinds of problems that occurred last time the  next time around.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
