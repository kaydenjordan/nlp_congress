 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding to me  on this important Special Order on National Police Week.   Mr. Speaker, it is National Police Week, and I rise today to join my  colleagues in support of the men and women of law enforcement.   We ask law enforcement to do an impossible job, and they do it with  professionalism, compassion, and grace. Their days are spent putting  themselves in harm's way to keep us safe, and they are always on call.  For that alone, they deserve our gratitude.   But the men and women of law enforcement do so much more, and I want  them to know that there are many of us who are not afraid to stand up  and say that we support you. We see the sacrifices you make and the  good that you do. We see the time that you spend away from your family  and the emotional toll the job takes on you.   I think of my many friends and family who are police officers and the  hard work that they do. They will always have a special place in my  heart.   Even as the profession faces unprecedented scrutiny, the men and  women of law enforcement still do their jobs with pride because, for  them, it is about more than just a paycheck. It is about serving their  neighbors.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting, not defunding, law  enforcement. Let's take care of those who take care of us. Together,  let's work on making our communities better.   To the men and women of law enforcement in Minnesota and around the  country, thank you.
