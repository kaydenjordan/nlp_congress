 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1733) to direct the Secretary of Energy to review and update a  report on the energy and environmental benefits of the re-refining of  used lubricating oil.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1733         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ENERGY SAVINGS FROM LUBRICATING OIL.         Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with the       Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the       Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall--        (1) review and update the report prepared pursuant to       section 1838 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005;        (2) after consultation with relevant Federal, State, and       local agencies and affected industry and stakeholder groups,       update data that was used in preparing that report; and        (3) prepare and submit to Congress a coordinated Federal       strategy to increase the beneficial reuse of used lubricating       oil, that--        (A) is consistent with national policy as established       pursuant to section 2 of the Used Oil Recycling Act of 1980       (Public Law 96-463); and        (B) addresses measures needed to--        (i) increase the responsible collection of used oil;        (ii) disseminate public information concerning sustainable       reuse options for used oil; and        (iii) promote sustainable reuse of used oil by Federal       agencies, recipients of Federal grant funds, entities       contracting with the Federal Government, and the general       public.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 1733, was introduced by Energy and  Commerce Committee member Susan Brooks from Indiana on March 27 of this  year. The legislation went through regular order, and it was reported  by the full committee, without amendment, by a voice vote.   This bill, H.R. 1733, requires the Secretary of Energy to review and  update a report on the energy and environmental benefits of re-refining  used lubricating oil. The bill reauthorizes a study that was previously  directed under the Energy Policy Act of 2005.   We know that recycling used lubricating oil provides environmental  benefits. It does, in fact, reduce energy consumption, and, yes, it  produces high-quality products for consumers.   H.R. 1733 is a good bipartisan bill. I want to thank Mrs. Brooks for  her hard work on this important issue and the other side of the aisle  for working with us to bring the bill to the floor this afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1733,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), who is a member of the committee and the author  of this bill.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I would remind my  colleagues that this is a bipartisan bill. I would like to think we can  pass this on a voice vote. I, again, commend the gentlewoman from  Indiana, our committee, and the staff for getting this done. We hope  that the Senate will take it up soon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2872) to amend the Federal Power Act to promote hydropower  development at existing nonpowered dams, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2872, was introduced by Energy and  Commerce Committee member Larry Bucshon in June of this year. The  legislation went through regular order and was reported by the full  committee with a bipartisan amendment by a voice vote.   This bill promotes hydropower by development at existing nonpowered  dams by establishing an expedited licensing process that will result in  a final decision on an application in 2 years or less. We know  hydropower is a clean, renewable, and reliable source of energy that  provides low-cost electricity to millions of Americans.   As we have learned through hearings at the Energy and Commerce  Committee, the current regulatory process places new hydropower  projects at existing nonpowered dams at a significant disadvantage. The  current process takes way too long and it creates too much uncertainty,  burdening consumers with additional unnecessary costs and preventing  jobs and economic opportunities.   This bill, H.R. 2872, makes important changes to the process to  enable FERC to issue a decision in 2 years or less. The legislation  also requires that FERC, as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  and the Department of the  [[Page H9810]]  Interior, to develop a list of existing nonpowered Federal dams that  have the greatest potential for non-Federal hydropower development.   This is a good bipartisan bill. I thank Dr. Bucshon for his hard work  on this important issue and for working with our colleagues across the  aisle to bring the bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

I will place a copy of your letter and this response into       the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure       on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                  Washington, DC, December 12, 2017.

Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I appreciate the  gentleman's willingness to work on these bills together. I really  appreciate his hard work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Bucshon), the sponsor of this legislation, in support of this bill.  [[Page H9811]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, have no further speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I again commend members on both sides of the aisle for  getting this bill to the floor, and the staff. I appreciate the  leadership for scheduling this, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2880) to amend the Federal Power Act to promote closed-loop  pumped storage hydropower, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The fees shall, subject to       annual appropriations Acts, be transferred to such agencies       by the Commission for use solely for purposes of carrying out       such studies and shall remain available until expended.        ``(d) Transfers.--Notwithstanding section 5, and regardless       of whether the holder of a preliminary permit for a closed-      loop pumped storage project claimed municipal preference       under section 7(a) when obtaining the permit, the Commission       may, to facilitate development of a closed-loop pumped       storage project--        ``(1) add entities as joint permittees following issuance       of a preliminary permit; and        ``(2) transfer a license in part to one or more       nonmunicipal entities as co-licensees with a municipality, if       the municipality retains majority ownership of the project       for which the license was issued.        ``(e) Interagency Communications.--Interagency cooperation       in the preparation of environmental documents under the       National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et       seq.) with respect to an application for a license for a       closed-loop pumped storage project submitted pursuant to this       section, and interagency communications relating to licensing       process coordination pursuant to this section, shall not--        ``(1) be considered to be ex parte communications under       Commission rules; or        ``(2) preclude an agency from participating in a licensing       proceeding under this part.        ``(f) Developing Abandoned Mines for Pumped Storage.--        ``(1) Workshop.--Not later than 6 months after the date of       enactment of this section, the Commission shall hold a       workshop to explore potential opportunities for development       of closed-loop pumped storage projects at abandoned mine       sites.        ``(2) Guidance.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this section, the Commission shall issue       guidance to assist applicants for licenses or preliminary       permits for closed-loop pumped storage projects at abandoned       mine sites.        ``(g) Qualifying Criteria for Closed-loop Pumped Storage       Projects.--        ``(1) In general.--The Commission shall establish criteria       that a pumped storage project shall meet in order to qualify       as a closed-loop pumped storage project eligible for the       expedited process established under this section.        ``(2) Inclusions.--In establishing the criteria under       paragraph (1), the Commission shall include criteria       requiring that the pumped storage project--        ``(A) cause little to no change to existing surface and       groundwater flows and uses; and        ``(B) is unlikely to adversely affect species listed as a       threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered       Species Act of 1973.''.       SEC. 3. OBLIGATION FOR PAYMENT OF ANNUAL CHARGES.         Section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 803(e))       is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(5) Any obligation of a licensee for payment of annual       charges under this subsection shall commence when the       construction of the applicable facility commences.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2880, was introduced by Energy and  Commerce Committee member Morgan Griffith in June of this year. The  legislation went through regular order, and it was reported by the full  committee with a bipartisan amendment by a voice vote.   The bill promotes closed-loop pumped storage hydropower projects by  establishing an expedited licensing process that is going to result in  a final decision on an application in 2 years or less.   We know that hydropower is a clean, renewable, and reliable source of  energy that provides low-cost electricity to millions of Americans  across the country. Closed-loop pumped storage is different than  conventional hydro. These types of projects move water between two  reservoirs located at different elevations in order to store energy and  then generate that electricity.  [[Page H9813]]    As we have learned through hearings at the Energy and Commerce  Committee, the complete regulatory process places new pumped storage  hydropower projects at a significant disadvantage.   Pumped storage hydro has been around for almost 100 years, but with  more intermittent renewables coming online, the need for grid-scale  storage is more important than ever. The current process to license  pumped storage takes way too long and creates too much uncertainty,  burdening consumers with additional unnecessary costs and preventing  jobs and economic opportunities.   This bill makes important changes to the process to enable FERC to  issue a decision in 2 years or less. The legislation also requires FERC  to hold a workshop to explore potential opportunities for development  of closed-loop pumped storage projects at abandoned mine sites.   This bill is a good, bipartisan bill. I thank Mr. Griffith for his  hard work on this important issue and for working with our colleagues  across the aisle to bring this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Griffith), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers either.   Again, I want to commend my colleagues for pushing this legislation,  for working with both sides of the aisle. Again, my congrats to my  counterpart, my ranking member on the Energy Subcommittee, and all my  colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield  back the balance of my time.
