 Mr. President, I am glad to have been here to hear the  distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee talk about the  oversight and the responsiveness that the executive branch agencies owe  to the U.S. Senate and its committees.   In doing so, I am having a similar problem with the State Department  as it relates to getting information about actions that have taken  place with reference to political reprisals and firings at the State  Department and subject to being investigated right now by the inspector  general of the State Department and special counsel. So I can share in  his concerns about the inability to get information from the executive  branch as a legitimate exercise of oversight.   I rise today, as I have so many times in my career, to be the voice  for the people of Puerto Rico in the U.S. Senate.   On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria--a powerful category 5 storm-- ripped through the center of the island of Puerto Rico, wiping out its  electrical grid and leaving millions of American citizens disconnected  and in the dark. This was preceded by Hurricane Irma, which also struck  the island--a double body blow. What ensued were months of absolute  darkness, hunger, despair, and death.   While the President played golf in Mar-a-Lago, thousands of our  fellow Americans were dying due to the lack of electricity to power  oxygen tanks, dialysis centers, or refrigerated medications--problems  that, as I said at the time, could not be solved with paper towels.   I will never forget this moment, one of the most insulting moments to  the people of Puerto Rico--a people who are a part of the United  States, 3.5 million U.S. citizens who have served and worn the uniform  of this Nation, whose names on the Vietnam Memorial here in Washington  are disproportionate to the number of their population. The President  said:         [They] want everything to be done for them. . . . I hate to       tell you, Puerto Rico, but you are throwing our budget out of       whack.    No other American citizen in any other of the areas of disaster heard  anything--anything--near to that.   Today we know that nearly 3,000 Americans perished in what is now  known as one of the worst natural disasters to strike our Nation in all  of American history.   Now, let me be clear. We know that a President cannot prevent a  natural disaster, but when the lives of Americans are on the line, we  expect our Commander in Chief to do everything in their power to come  to their aid. These are the moments that are supposed to reveal the  very best of America. In the face of disasters of this magnitude, we do  not turn our backs on our fellow citizens. We face the challenge head- on. We save as many lives as we can. We strive to stem suffering, and  we lend a helping hand. That is the American way.   Just imagine how many lives could have been saved had President Trump  directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to give Puerto Rico  ``the A Plus treatment'' he called for, for our fellow citizens in  Alabama. For the majority Latino, Spanish-speaking island of Puerto  Rico, there was no A-plus treatment. They got the F-minus treatment.   The painful reality is, nothing can ever bring the thousands of  Americans who died in Hurricane Maria back, but that doesn't mean the  President shouldn't try to make things right. He has many opportunities  to atone for his cruel and unfair treatment of the Puerto Rican people.  Instead, President Trump seems intent on kicking Puerto Ricans when  they are down.   Just last week, he hosted a group of my Republican colleagues at the  White House and proceeded to complain about how much Puerto Rico has  received. What is so disappointing is that none of my colleagues even  dared to check the President on this issue. They didn't receive what he  said. They received a fraction of what he said.   This President continues to behave as if the people who call Puerto  Rico home are not real Americans. It is almost as if he views himself  as the real victim here, not the 3,000 American mothers and fathers and  brothers and sisters who perished in Hurricane Maria's wake.   We in the Senate have an obligation to do what is right with this  disaster supplemental.   So let me say first that I am glad everyone here agrees Puerto Rico  needs a fully funded Nutrition Assistance Program for the next fiscal  year. Still, it is appalling to hear the White House call the House of  Representatives bill's inclusion of an additional $600 million for  nutrition assistance as ``excessive and unnecessary.''   There is nothing excessive or unnecessary about helping 1.35 million  struggling, low-income Americans in Puerto Rico--many of them with  small children--avoid going hungry. We are talking about $649 a month  for a family of four, just $160 or so a week for the people who need it  the most.   Let's turn for a moment to what is missing from the Senate  legislation.   First, Hurricane Maria created 6 million cubic yards of debris for  the island. A year and a half later, the island still has approximately  168,000 cubic yards of debris stored in temporary sites waiting to be  removed.   To put that in perspective, a large dump truck can carry 10 cubic  yards. That means it would take 16,800 dump trucks to remove all the  garbage created by the hurricane on a small island that barely measures  100 miles long by 35 miles wide.   Make no mistake, Puerto Rico has made significant progress, but the  crippled economy has made everything that much harder. This legislation  should help them get the job done, not set them back.   Second, there remains hundreds of open FEMA projects for emergency  protective measures. We are talking about short-term locations for  government Agencies to provide vital services as they await the  completion of permanent reconstruction.   We should also allow for the continued use of generators to power  critical facilities on the island. This would help keep the public safe  and provide stability to Puerto Rico's power grid while it is repaired.  We can do this by increasing the Federal cost waivers for categories A  and B to 100 percent, just as the House of Representatives' bill does.   Congress has done this many times before--this is not new--after  Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Dennis, and Rita, and Puerto Rico deserves  no less.   In the bipartisan Budget Act we passed last year, we specifically  authorized FEMA to waive Stafford Act requirements so they could  replace and repair facilities in a way that reflects today's industry  standards, not their previous subpar condition. Yet I keep hearing of  FEMA's nickel-and-diming over what it may fix and what Puerto Rico may  not fix.   So let's end the ambiguity. Let's fix this language. Let's send a  clear message that it was always Congress's intent to rebuild Puerto  Rico stronger and more resilient than ever.   No one wants to face the same kind of damage next hurricane season.  As it is said, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.   So let's properly fund the Army Corps of Engineers so they can help  rebuild the Cano Martin Pena, which continues to flood over with raw  sewage, imperiling 26,000 American lives with unsanitary conditions and  breeding grounds for mosquito-transmitted diseases like Zika.   These are the kind of measures that would be stripped from the House  bill by the pending substitute. It is just not right. It is just not  right. These 3.5 million U.S. citizens have worn the uniform of the  United States, have defended this Nation, going back to when Congress  gave the all-Puerto Rican regiment, the ``Borinqueneers,'' the highest  commendation it can, the Congressional Gold Medal, but that doesn't  mean anything if you turn your back on 3.5 million U.S. citizens. It  doesn't mean anything if you treat them as second-class citizens. It is  just fundamentally biased and wrong.   Come September, we will have to congregate once again to talk about  the island's crumbling medical infrastructure and the need to provide  Puerto Rico with additional Medicaid funding. We can solve that problem  today by adding critical Medicaid funding for the territories.   Puerto Rico is clearly a subject of angst and resentment for the  President. I don't know why, but it is clearly so. So I suggest we do  him a favor,  [[Page S2071]]  spare him the worry, and get the job done ourselves today. Let's do  what is right.   I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture on the substitute, let  the underlying bill stand, and let us move forward so we act in the  name of our Nation. It is the United States of America. We leave no  American behind, and we should leave none of the 3.5 million Americans  in Puerto Rico behind.   I yield the floor.
