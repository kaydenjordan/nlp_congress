 Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  motion to proceed.    Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to  congratulate the ``Voice of the Eagles,'' Chuck Mraz, who is retiring  from his position as the news director at Morehead State Public Radio.  Serving communities in eastern Kentucky, southern Ohio, and western  West Virginia for more than 30 years, Chuck's reporting has been a  staple for countless listeners. As he prepares to sign off, I would  like to take a brief look back at his remarkable career.   I have had the privilege of joining Chuck's program many times over  the years. While I have enjoyed our conversations about important  issues to Kentucky, we found a shared passion that has nothing to do  with my role in the Senate: our love of sports.   At the outset of his career, Chuck wanted to be a sportscaster.  According to him, sports have ``always been a part of my life ever  since I realized that I could pick up a bat and hit a ball.'' He joined  MSPR in 1986 as the station's sports director and special events  director. Even when he took on a new challenge in 2005 as the news  director, Chuck kept his part time role as the play-by-play voice of  the MSU football and men's basketball teams.   Throughout his time on the air at MSPR, Chuck has called more than  1,000 Eagles athletic events. According to the school, that is more  than any other announcer in the athletic department's history. He has  been a constant presence for coaches, players, and fans and has been an  integral part of the Eagles' community. He still says the highlight of  his career was MSU's 2011 Men's NCAA basketball tournament win at the  buzzer over my alma mater, the University of Louisville Cardinals.   For his impressive career, Chuck has won local, State, and regional  acclaim from his peers. Among his many accolades are more than 40  Kentucky Associated Press awards, the Eastern Kentucky Leadership  Conference Award for Media and Technology, and the Ohio Valley  Conference Media Award.   Even more important to Chuck than his honors are the relationships he  built with the next generation of broadcasters. He recognized many  inspirational teachers and advisers in his own life, and as a result,  Chuck has mentored hundreds of students while at MSU. Many of them have  begun their own notable careers around the State. As they continue to  prosper in their work, Chuck's impact on the broadcasting community  will continue to be felt for years to come.   Looking back on his long and successful career, Chuck said, ``I've  always believed that hard work can overcome a lack of ability in some  areas.'' His drive has led to many late nights, many 3:30 a.m. alarms,  and a lot of time away from his family, but it is that commitment that  has also brought Chuck great success in his profession and in the  Morehead community.   In retirement, Chuck looks forward to spending more time with his  family, especially his wife, Joni, and his daughters, Megan and  Elizabeth. Just because he is leaving his role as news director,  however, doesn't mean that MSPR listeners won't hear Chuck on the  radio. Even in retirement, he plans to call Eagles football and  basketball games. At the end of this month, the community will gather  to celebrate Chuck's career and to thank him for his contributions to  the school, its students, and to the Eagles. I would like to add my  voice to the MSU community in wishing him a restful and happy  retirement.                            ____________________
