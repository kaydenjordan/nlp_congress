 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of my  constituents at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, Kentucky.   Established as an ammunition and general supply storage depot in  1941, the Blue Grass Army Depot is now one of two remaining Army  installations in the United States that stores and destroys chemical  weapons.   The important work of the employees at the depot ensures America's  worthy task of destroying our chemical weapons stockpiles and making  good on our commitment to the Chemical Weapons Convention.   I am proud that operations to get rid of these stockpiles began  earlier this month, a process that will result in the destruction of  thousands of chemical rockets and projectiles over the next several  years.   This vital task could not be achieved without the support and input  of members of the Madison County community who serve on the Kentucky  Chemical Demilitarization Citizens' Advisory Commission.   I want to personally thank community leaders like Craig Williams--who  has literally worked for decades on the safe destruction of these  chemical weapons--and County Judge Executive Reagan Taylor, who have  continually advocated for the safety of their community and have made  an enormous impact on the operations of the depot.   I look forward to seeing my district continue to set the  international standard for chemical demilitarization.                            ____________________
