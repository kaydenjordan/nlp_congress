 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last fall, there was a concern among many  around the country, many Republican voters, that if elected--Democrats  in the House, the Senate, and the White House--if they had the whole of  government, they would try to implement massive change, transformative  change, as it was described. There was a consistent view articulated by  Democrats in other places around the country that it would never happen  because Joe Biden, after all, is a moderate. These ideas are crazy  ideas. Nobody would ever do some of the things that are being talked  about.   Well, I have to say that pretty much everything that was predicted is  now coming true, at least as it pertains to legislation that is being  advanced by Democrats here in the Congress and by the White House,  starting, of course, with the massive amount of spending, the massive  expansion of the government.   We saw that with the coronavirus relief bill, which ended up being  about $2 trillion. That was on top of the $4 trillion that Congress, in  a bipartisan way last year, had put toward coronavirus relief. Much of  that $2 trillion--in fact, most of it, about 90 percent of it--didn't  have anything to do with coronavirus. Only about 10 percent of all that  spending of nearly $2 trillion was actually related to the coronavirus.  Most of it was other things that Democrats had wanted to fund, that had  been on their wish list, if you will, for some time, and expansion of  government.   Well, if that weren't enough, there is now talk of an  ``infrastructure'' bill that would spend on the order of another $2.5  to $3 trillion--again, much of which is unrelated to infrastructure. If  you define ``infrastructure'' simply as roads and bridges, things that  most people think of as infrastructure, the number that has been used  is 6 percent of that entire bill is about infrastructure. If you add in  broadband and a few other things, it gets slightly higher than that.   The point is that most of the spending in this bill is unrelated to  infrastructure. It is another $2.5 to $3 trillion expansion of  government, new spending financed--some with tax increases but a lot of  it just adding to the debt, just putting it on the credit card and  handing the bill to our children and grandchildren, something that has  been routinely done around here for a long time.   Mr. President, what I think people should find concerning is that the  worst fears predicted about what the left might do if in charge of this  country are, in fact, coming true. Much of this new spending--by the  way, the infrastructure bill is a first installment. There is another  bill to follow, we are told, that would include more trillions in  spending, dealing with other issues, including healthcare.   You have this massive expansion of government, massive amount of new  spending, unprecedented, truly unprecedented in history, coupled with  massive tax hikes, also unprecedented. What is being talked about just  in the first infrastructure bill is over $1 trillion in new taxes. The  taxing, spending, borrowing patterns that we predicted would happen  are, in fact, coming true. Add to that other things that were suggested  and proposed throughout the fall and the course of the campaigns.    Subsequent to that included adding DC as a State. So adding DC as a  State is going to pass the House of Representatives. I am not sure if  they are voting on it today, but it has either been voted on or will be  voted on. It will pass the House of Representatives. That is a very,  very serious, serious proposal which dramatically changes the U.S.  Senate and, I believe, what the Founders intended with respect to the  District of Columbia.   Then you add to it legislation that has already passed the House and  is being contemplated being passed here in the Senate that would  federalize elections in this country, that would codify ballot  harvesting, and that would ban voter ID, photo ID, which is something  that, I think, most Americans think is a very wise thing to do when it  comes to election integrity, to make sure that the people who are  voting actually are who they say they are. Voter ID is a pretty  important part of that. It would have the taxpayers finance--publicly  fund--campaigns in this country. I can't imagine the American  taxpayers, among all of the other things that they have to finance in  the government, also want to finance the campaigns that they have to  sit through.   It would politicize the Federal Election Commission, which, in the  past, has been a balanced--three Republican, three Democrat--bipartisan  committee that has overseen and regulated elections in this country. So  it would politicize it and give the Democrats an advantage, a partisan  advantage, on the Federal Election Commission.   All of those things are in this elections bill, which would  transform--I mean, I am talking literally transform--the way we do  elections in this country, which historically and by way of the  Constitution and the law have been handled and administered at the  State level. States have been very involved.   What this would do is consolidate more power in Washington, DC, and  pull the regulation of elections up to the Federal Government, coupled  with all of the changes that I just mentioned. There is no way-- absolutely no way--that even if passed they could be done, could be  implemented, for the upcoming 2022 election, which secretaries of state  from across the country, including Democratic secretaries of state,  have indicated.   So that is another thing that is on the liberal wish list that I  mentioned: the federalizing of our elections--taking them away from the  States where, historically, elections have been handled and  administered--and bringing them here, essentially nationalizing our  elections.   Then there is the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is, I believe,  being introduced again today by a number of Democratic Senators and  House Members--something, again, that would completely change the way  we fuel our country in ways that would drive up dramatically the costs  that an average consumer in this country and an average family would  have to pay for energy. It would be done through mandates, regulations,  and heavy-handed government requirements as opposed to incentivizing  some of these things that, I think, we all agree we should be doing  when it comes to cleaning up our environment. The Green New Deal is the  opposite of that. The Green New Deal is a government, Washington, DC,  mandate, requirement, heavy-handed regulatory approach to that issue  and something that has struck fear in the hearts of literally tens of  millions of Americans since it began being talked about only a few  years ago.   Those are just a handful on the list of what I would call horribles  for which the left has been advocating for some time in this country.  All of these things could be accomplished if the Democrats are able to  follow through with another thing that they said they would never do  and are now talking about and if they have the votes would do, and that  is to do away with the legislative filibuster, which is a feature of  our democracy that goes back literally 200 years to our Nation's  founding and has ensured through those years that the minority has a  voice in our policymaking process; that there is an opportunity for  both sides to collaborate, compromise, and to ensure that there isn't  majoritarian rule. The Founders  [[Page S2047]]  were very firm about that idea. They thought there needed to be checks  and balances against that, and the legislative filibuster has provided  that for 200 years.   It is something that we refused to do--even though the Republicans  were asked repeatedly during the last 4 years of the Trump Presidency,  by the President himself, to get rid of the legislative filibuster-- because we believe it is essential as a feature of our democracy and  something that protects the minority in this country, the minority  rights, the voice of the minority, in our policymaking process. It  ensures that we get solutions that, ultimately, are durable over time  because they have been negotiated in a way that requires the input from  both sides of the political equation.   That is something that has been sacred, so sacred, even despite the  fact that President Trump, on 34 different occasions, asked the  Republicans--or probably more; I would say ``ask'' would be a gentle  word--and essentially said that the Republicans in the Senate needed to  get rid of the legislative filibuster. He either did that by tweet or  by public statement. It was clearly something that he believed was a  priority in order to implement his agenda. We resisted that. We  resisted that even though we would have benefited from it on numerous  occasions when it came to moving legislation through the Senate.   For the past 6 years, we had the majority, and for the past 4 years,  we had the Presidency up until January of this year, and  notwithstanding the constant barrage of suggestions--again, putting it  mildly--to get rid of the legislative filibuster by a President from  our own party, we resisted that simply because we believed the  legislative filibuster is such an essential and critical part of our  democracy.   So here we go. The Democrats get elected. They have, on countless  occasions, told me privately--individual Senators on their side of the  aisle--that there is no way. We would never do that. We will never get  rid of the legislative filibuster. It is too important. We are not  going to do that. In fact, 33 Democrats signed a letter as recently as  3 years ago, basically, essentially ratifying their support for the  legislative filibuster and, as to the suggestion that it could possibly  be done away with, suggesting that it would be a terrible, wrong thing  to do for this country--essentially coming out strongly, strongly  supporting the legislative filibuster. These are 33 Democratic Senators  here in the U.S. Senate coming out in support of the legislative  filibuster.   Now, the shoe is on the other foot. They are in the majority. They  have been in the majority for about 2 months, and they are already  talking about it openly, and many have come out and endorsed the idea.  Frankly, to be honest with you, I think it would have been done already  had it not been for a couple of Democrats who, I think, are thoughtful  enough, contemplative enough, and revering enough of our institutions  in this country not to be run over by the majority on their side and do  away with something that is just so critical and so important to our  Nation's not only heritage and history but to our future. If it were  not for that, I think it would have been done already. I think the  Senator from New York, the Democratic leader, in a New York minute  would get rid of the legislative filibuster if he had the votes to do  it, partly out of fear that he would be savaged by his ``woke'' left if  he wouldn't do it.   Obviously, the President, President Biden, whom, as I mentioned  earlier, man people thought would govern as a moderate and a unifier  and as someone who fiercely defended the legislative filibuster as a  U.S. Senator and made speeches on this very floor in defending fiercely  the legislative filibuster, is now also talking about getting rid of it  in order to implement massive tax hikes, massive spending increases,  and a massive growth in government--an expansion of government unlike  anything we have seen in history, including the 1930s, the New Deal.  This would dwarf that by comparison.    DC statehood, federalizing our elections, and passing the Green New  Deal, all of that could be done with 51 votes if they could blow up and  get rid of the legislative filibuster, and all of those are very real,  not hypotheticals--real. These are things that have already passed or  are going to pass the House of Representatives and are being considered  here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, including today when, I think,  the Green New Deal is being reintroduced. These are legislative  proposals that are so far out of the political mainstream in the things  that they are contemplating that it is hard to believe.   Just as an example of the impact that these tax increases could have,  look at what the tax cuts that were passed--the reform act that was  passed in 2017--were doing in terms of the economy and the benefits  that they were having across all demographic sectors in this country.  Up until the pandemic, we had the best economy probably in 50 years. We  had the lowest unemployment rate, for sure. We had the biggest gain in  income wage levels among particularly minority groups.   In fact, this is census data from 2019 that shows that the real  median household income hit its highest level ever for African- American, Hispanic, and Asian-American workers and retirees. The 2019  poverty rate was the lowest in more than 50 years for children at 14.4  percent, the lowest ever for individuals at 10.5 percent, for families  at 8.5 percent, and for households headed by unmarried women at 22.2  percent. More impressive is that, even after 10 years of economic  expansion, the 2019 gains shattered all records as real household  income leapt by $4,379 in 2019 alone, 13 times the average annual gain  since data were first collected.   So the tax policies we had in place were working, and there have been  record income gains, especially among lower income Americans. The  poverty rate, as I mentioned, plummeted 11 percent in 2019, the most in  53 years. Things were moving in the right direction. So the question  is, If it isn't broke, why fix it? Why would we go and increase taxes  in a massive way at a time when the economy is growing and expanding  and creating better paying jobs?   What I would argue for those in any income group and across any  ethnic group is that the best solution for improving their standard of  living and their quality of life is to have a growing, expanding  economy that is throwing off better paying jobs and higher wages. That  is what raises the income level. That is what lifts the boat for every  American, and that is what we ought to be looking for, not how much  government can we pull back to Washington, DC, and how much government  can do for you but how we can put the right policies in place that put  the conditions in place for economic growth that will stimulate the  kind of investment that will create those good-paying jobs and start  lifting wages across this country.   It is about growth in our economy, I would argue. It is about good- paying jobs. It is about higher wages. That is what our arguments here  ought to be about. Instead, right now, we are talking about growing  government and increasing taxes and reversing what, I would argue, is a  lot of progress that I just mentioned, that being from the 2019 U.S.  Census Bureau's data.   Why would we go back on the great progress that has been made? Why  would we start to contemplate some of these suggestions that I  mentioned, from the tax hikes, the spending increases, the federalizing  of our elections, the Green New Deal, and repealing the filibuster  which, again, would consolidate more control, more power, in the hands  of a few people here rather than keeping it distributed? It would  consolidate more and more power in Washington, DC.   That kind of brings me to the topic for today that is on that list of  horribles and things that would undermine the integrity of our  political institutions in a way that these other things would as well  but, I would say, on a much, much higher, much expanded level, and that  is packing the Supreme Court which, again, people thought was a  hypothetical. That was one of those things to which people said: Now,  those guys down there, those Democrats, are not that crazy. There are  some moderate Democrats out there. There are some people who would  stand up in the way of that and keep something that crazy from  happening.   Well, it didn't take very long. It only took a week--just 1 week  after President Biden established his Commission  [[Page S2048]]  to study Court packing, which is another ostensible Supreme Court  reform, for the Democratic Members of Congress in both Houses to  introduce legislation that would actually pack the Court. This is no  longer a hypothetical. This is colleagues on this side of the aisle and  the Democrats in the House of Representatives who are openly advocating  for packing the Supreme Court in the form of legislation and not just  adding a couple of members but adding enough members to give them a  majority, to give them a majority on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Now, many people are probably wondering what the crisis was that  precipitated this legislation, a crisis so grave that these Democrats  couldn't even wait for the results of the President's stacked  Commission. President Biden's Commission, which is stacked with  Democrats to give them the result that they want, is supposed to report  back in the timeframe of, I believe, about 6 months. They couldn't even  wait for that. They had to introduce a bill that would pack the Court.  So why did they have to do that? Well, I will tell you.   The crisis that requires us to immediately add four additional  Justices to the Supreme Court after 150 years of having the Court at  its current size is that a duly elected Republican President was able  to get three Supreme Court nominees approved. Apparently, by confirming  a duly elected President's Supreme Court nominees, the Republicans  stole the Court's majority which, I guess, apparently, rightfully,  belongs to the Democrats, and in doing so, it ``politicized the Supreme  Court'' and ``threatened the rights of millions of Americans.''   This legislation, the bill's Senate sponsor says, will ``restore the  Court's balance and public standing'' and ``begin to repair the damage  done to our judiciary and democracy.'' That is from the Democrat  sponsor's statements with respect to this legislation--necessary to  ``restore the Court's balance and public standing'' and ``repair the  damage done to our judiciary and democracy.''   Well, there is only one problem, of course, and that is that this  supposed crisis of confidence in the Supreme Court doesn't actually  exist. A majority of Americans approve of the job the Supreme Court is  doing. The Supreme Court's approval rating actually increased-- increased--over the course of the Trump administration.   If the junior Senator from Massachusetts, who is one of the sponsors  of this legislation, is looking to address a crisis of confidence,  perhaps he should take a look at Congress, whose approval rating is  consistently far lower than that of the Supreme Court.   The real crisis--the real crisis we are facing--is not a crisis of  confidence in the Court. It is that Democrats are apparently willing to  do long-term damage to our democracy for partisan gain.   Yes, Democrats are being hypocritical, and, yes, their Court-packing  proposal is outrageously and transparently partisan. But, more than  that, it is dangerous because Democrats' Court packing would eliminate  public confidence in the nonpartisan character of the Court.   Right now, the Supreme Court is generally seen as being at least  somewhat above the partisan fray, as the Founders intended--a fact that  I think is reflected in the Court's positive approval rating.   And while some Justices are regarded as more conservative and some as  more liberal, Americans don't see Justices as partisan in the way that  we see politicians as partisan, and rightly so.   I can think of more than one significant case where supposedly  conservative Justices have sided with the Court's liberals, and there  are plenty of cases where all of the Supreme Court's Justices have  ruled unanimously.   As Justice Breyer pointed out in his recent speech condemning Court  packing, Supreme Court Justices do not fit neatly into conservative or  liberal categories.   But that perception of Supreme Court Justices as above partisanship  would not last long if Democrats succeeded in packing the Court.   Just think about it. We have had the same number of Supreme Court  Justices, nine--nine Justices--for more than 150 years. One hundred and  fifty years, and then Democrats sweep in, announce that the makeup of  the Supreme Court isn't to their liking, and propose adding four  Justices, all of them appointed in one fell swoop by a Democratic  President. And that is in addition to any nominations the President  might make in the ordinary course of things.   Does any Democrat sincerely think that after that any Republican  would regard the Supreme Court as nonpartisan? Or, for that matter, how  many Democrats would regard the Supreme Court as nonpartisan?   Just imagine if the roles were reversed. Imagine that Republicans  were proposing to expand the Supreme Court and add four Republican- nominated Justices. Imagine the howls of outrage that would ensue, and  rightly so. Democrats, the media, the far left--all would rightfully  decry the politicization of the Supreme Court.   Yet Democrats expect us to believe that if it is Democrats who do  this, if it is Democrats who pack the Supreme Court, somehow this move  is not a partisan and self-serving one?   As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, ``If anything would make the  court look partisan, it would be that--one side saying, `When we're in  power, we're going to enlarge the number of judges, so we would have  more people who would vote the way we want them to.'''   That is from the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   Or, in the words of Justice Breyer, ``I hope and expect that the  court will retain its authority, an authority that . . . was hard won.  But that authority, like the rule of law, depends on trust--a trust  that the court is guided by legal principle, not politics.'' That is  from Justice Breyer.   And Justice Breyer noted: ``Structural alteration motivated by the  perception of political influence can only feed that latter perception,  further eroding that trust.''   As these two reliably liberal Justices make clear, Democrats' Court- packing plan would do the very thing Democrats claim to oppose, and  that is to politicize the court. The Supreme Court would quickly lose  its nonpartisan standing and quickly become a joke.   Democrats cannot possibly think that Court packing would begin and  end with their move under the Biden administration. I can guarantee-- guarantee--that the next time there is a Republican President and a  Republican Congress, Republicans would be moving to ``balance'' the  Democrats' power grab by adding a few seats of their own. Then the next  Democrat administration would do the same thing. It wouldn't be long  before the Supreme Court had expanded to ludicrous proportions. Twenty  Justices? Thirty Justices? Maybe more?   Instead of a respected and separate branch of government, the Supreme  Court would be co-opted by the legislative and executive branches. The  separation of powers, upon which our entire Federal Government is  built, would be destroyed. The consequences of politicizing and  trivializing the Court, as packing the Court would do, would be grave.  If Americans don't respect the Court, they will have little reason to  respect the Court's decisions or regard them as either definitive or  binding.   There has been a lot of concern, rightfully so, about the  increasingly partisan and contentious nature of our politics.  Politicizing the Court by packing the Court would further inflame  partisan division and lead to increasingly bitter and dangerous  friction in our society.   It is deeply, deeply disappointing that Democrat leaders--and others  in their caucus who wish to be seen as serious and responsible  policymakers--haven't condemned this dangerous proposal to upend a  bedrock institution of our democracy.   I understand that it may be difficult for them to stand up to the  unhinged and far-left fringes of their party, and it is possible that  some of them are reluctant to condemn this proposal because of the  partisan advantage it would provide. But anyone who cares about the  health of our democracy and the stability of our country should be  loudly and clearly opposing any discussion of Court packing.   I hope that at least some of my Democrat colleagues will find the  courage to speak up and consign the idea of Court packing to the ash  heap of history, where it should have remained.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S2049]]    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Scott).
