 Mr. Speaker, 53 percent of Americans disapprove of  President Trump's service to this Nation in this first 100 days. I  didn't say Members of Congress. I didn't say party. I said 53 percent  of Americans disagree, and I understand why: a healthcare promise that  did not come to fruition; families are now looking, with his potential  bill, to higher healthcare costs for our working families; 24 million  more Americans are off of insurance.   What about the age tax for hardworking Americans? Americans 50 to 64  years old will be paying upwards of $12,000 to $14,000 for their  premium.   The last insult is to those hardworking Americans who now receive  Medicare by deleting, depleting, taking away, and destroying $100  million from the Medicare trust fund.   There is no other answer. There is no other answer than disapproval,  because why would anyone who leads this Nation destroy the very health  care, the very arm of opportunity and rest that Americans have when  they become sick?   I think the disapproval is probably too low. Let us fix the  healthcare system. Let us not destroy it.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, let me thank the gentleman from Michigan  and all of my colleagues that have spoken on this job-creating  legislation and recognition of how great America is with all of the  creative talent that  [[Page H2872]]  we have mustered, the music that you enjoy, the songwriters and others  who created both the visual and musical arts. This is what this is  about.    Now, I have listened to some of my colleagues from California. I am  not from California. I am from Houston, Texas. But we know that  creative artists and writers and those who invent and those who write  wonderful stories are all part of the arena of what America is great  about. They generate genius and they create jobs. The Copyright Office  is that protector that ensures that those jobs will be protected.   We, over a series of years in the Judiciary Committee, have looked at  reforming the copyright system. We have had hearings even with the  former Copyright Register, who indicated that putting her position in a  Senate confirmation would be the right thing to do. But it has taken 4  years.   So today we have come not to be out of order and not doing other  major aspects of reform. In fact, I want to congratulate the Librarian  of Congress who, now, is engaged in modernization. I applaud her. Her  appointment has been significant. She is innovative and is already  working to make sure that the Library and the creative arts and assets  and property of those of great talent is protected.                                time  1430    Today we address an aspect of that work, and that is we want to  continue to see the progress that our Librarian has made. We want to be  able to make on an equal status that individual that is dealing with  copyright just as the director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  status as a Presidential appointee does not compromise that person's  ability to execute their duties as head of the USPTO, nor should it  compromise or interfere with the responsibilities of cooperation,  collaboration, jurisdictional compromise, and work between the  Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights.   To the Librarian of Congress, my view is keep working, keep doing the  modernization work. I believe that as we move forward, regardless of  who at this point is in the Office of President, that we can ensure  that Congress has insight and oversight over this important position.   Let me also suggest to my colleagues that the Library of Congress is  an important part of the work of Congress, and I think all of us should  be interested stakeholders in the work that it does and should be  supporters of that.   We encourage the Library of Congress to work with America's  constituency by having programs and letting them know of the wonderful  artifacts that are there, that are held, that tell the history of this  great Nation. It is always important to be able to do research there  and to see the storied history.   Now, we come to this bill that does nothing to undermine that storied  history or the Librarian of Congress. What it does, as I have  indicated, is it helps us create jobs.   Now, in order to recognize the importance of the Librarian of  Congress, in this instance, Dr. Carla Hayden, I am very grateful that  my colleagues accepted an amendment that I have that, in fact, does do  something, and it does a very important action. It respects and  recognizes the value of Congress' insight on putting forth nominees or  names that will be selected from to become the Register of Copyrights,  not to have limited input, but to actually produce the names.   Ultimately, I hope that an amendment going forward after this bill,  working with the Senate, can be that there is a limit to the names  being put forward and that those names are the names that are put  forward to the President of the United States. I think that is an  element that should be included.    In the amendment, it has that the Speaker of the  House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the  majority leader of the House of Representatives, the majority leader of  the Senate, minority leader of the House of Representatives, and the  Librarian of Congress will be, in fact, the deciders of who gets  nominated to be the Register of Copyrights.   As we well know, the AFL-CIO has provided a letter of support, along  with the American Federation of Musicians, the Authors Guild, the  Directors Guild of America, the Graphic Artists Guild, the  International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, and Screen Actors  Guild. All of these create jobs and all of these unions have  representatives all around the Nation.   Finally, I would say it is extremely important that the musicians and  artists of color have indicated that they see no bias in this  particular legislation against the present Librarian and have written a  letter indicating that they believe that there is no bias.    So I ask my colleagues to work together and to pass  H.R. 1695 to continue the process of modernization of the Copyright  Office and continue the collaborative work between the Librarian of  Congress and the Register of Copyrights. There is no difference in the  cooperation of decades before and, as well, there is no indication that  that will not occur in the future. Both of them will have 10-year  terms, and I believe that we will move forward on behalf of the  American people.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the rule under consideration for H.R.  1695, the ``Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act of  2017,'' as amended to include the Jackson Lee Amendment.   H.R. 1695, the ``Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability  Act of 2017,'' if enacted, would change the selection process for the  Register of Copyrights, who is the Director of the United States  Copyright Office, which is housed in the Library of Congress.   The Librarian of Congress, an appointed position subject to Senate  confirmation since 1987, is currently tasked with modernizing the  Library of Congress.   This legislation is not about taking power away from any individual.   In fact, Dr. Carla Hayden, the current Librarian of Congress, is by  all accounts serving the various needs of the Library of Congress very  well.   This legislation and the Jackson Lee Amendment only further the  Library's efforts to effectively modernize its copyright selection and  approval process.   Just as the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's status  as a Presidential appointee does not compromise her ability execute her  duties as head of the USPTO, the Copyright Register will not be  compromised by the fact he or she is a Presidential appointee.   Dr. Hayden is an exceptional administrator and the bill before us in  no way reflects adversely upon her.   The Jackson Lee Amendment, accepted during markup with bipartisan  support by the members of the Judiciary Committee to improve the bill,  recognizes the dual role of the Library of Congress as both a  legislative and a national institution, militating against giving  President carte blanche in nominating the Register of Copyrights.   Specifically, the bill's amended provision establishes a 7-person  panel to recommend a list of at least three (3) individuals to the  President for appointment as the Register of Copyrights.   The amendment provides that the panel membership shall be as follows:   1. Speaker of the House of Representatives;   2. President pro tempore of the Senate;   3. Majority Leader of the House of Representatives;   4. Majority Leader of the Senate;   5. Minority Leader of the House of Representatives;   6. Minority Leader of the Senate; and the   7. Librarian of Congress.   This bill is the product of years of bipartisan deliberation, and  reflects the collective and considered judgment of Members of Congress  that the Copyright Office would be strengthened as an institution were  the Register to be selected through the advise and consent process,  regardless of which political party occupied the Oval Office or  controlled majorities in Congress.   The essential role of government is to protect life, liberty and  property.   That is why a fundamental bulwark of the core values demonstrated by  our constitution is property rights--a notion understood by the  Founders at the dawn of the Republic.   For precisely that reason, the Founding Fathers recognized the  importance of IP in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution: ``To  promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.''  [[Page H2873]]    This clause, articulated by the Founders, is rooted in the notion  that the best way to encourage creation and dissemination of new  inventions and creative works to the benefit of both the public good  and individual liberty is to recognize one's right to his or her  intellectual property.   On November 12, 1975, at the investiture of Daniel J. Boorstin as the  12th Librarian of Congress, Congressman Lucien N. Nedzi of Michigan,  the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, stated:         As its name reveals, the Library is the Library of       Congress--a fact in which the Congress of the United States       takes great pride--and, of equal importance, if not more so,       it is a national library that serves all of the people of the       United States.    H.R. 1695, balanced by the Jackson Lee Amendment, strikes the proper  balance and harmonizes these dual interests.   The national interest and character of the institution is preserved  by elevating the office of the Register of Copyrights and vesting in  the President the authority to nominate the Register of Copyrights.   The legislative interest is protected by constraining the President  to select for appointment 1 of 3 persons recommended by panel that  represents the institutional interests of Congress in the Library and  its subdivisions--the joint congressional leadership and the Librarian  of Congress.   The panel only possesses the power to recommend candidates to the  President; it cannot dictate the President's choice.   Moreover, this arrangement complies with Article II, Section 2,  Clause 2 of the Constitution, which provides:         [The President] shall . . . nominate, and by and with the       advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors,       other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme       Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose       appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which       shall be established by law[.]    The Founder's wisdom is manifest in today's creative economy, which  contributes more than $1.2 trillion to GDP and supports 5.5 million  jobs.   Yet in a quirk of history, without this legislation, Congress has no  role in the selection of the Register of Copyrights, even though the  Register is Congress' statutorily designated expert advisor on  copyright policy and the head of the Copyright Office.   What is no accident is that Congress can fix this problem by passing  H.R. 1695, on World IP Day, Wednesday, April 26, 2017.   This would increase accountability to Congress as well as  transparency by giving all Americans a voice in the selection of the  Register through their elected representatives.   We can think of no better way to recognize the contributions of  copyright to the economy than by finally ascribing to the position of  Register an importance commensurate with the sector it oversees.   I urge my support for the rule, as well as the underlying legislation  as amended.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from the  Content Creators Coalition, dated April 25, 2017, in support of this  legislation.                                                     April 25, 2017.        Congressional Black Caucus Member: On behalf of the Content       Creators Coalition, we write in support of H.R. 1695, the       Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act,       which would modernize and provide greater transparency to the       process of selecting the Register of the Copyright Office.        This is vital legislation that will strengthen the       Copyright Office. We believe this selection process should be       granted a similar import, rigor, and transparency as the       processes of selecting other organizations, such as the U.S.       Patent and Trademark office, that oversee large industries:       Presidential nomination and Senate confirmation. In light of       the specialized knowledge required to lead this office, we       also support the appointment of an advisory group to suggest       candidates for consideration.        This legislation would place the Copyright Office on equal       footing as other economically and culturally vital agencies.       It has wide bipartisan support and was passed out of the       typically polarized House Judiciary Committee on a vote of       27-1.        As artists of color, we find it deeply offensive that       opponents of this bill have attempted to recast their anti-      creators' rights goals into a smear campaign against its       sponsors and supporters, insinuating that the legislation is       about the race and gender of the current Librarian of       Congress. The Register of Copyrights Selection and       Accountability Act is co-authored by the Dean of the House       and the Congressional Black Caucus, Judiciary Ranking Member       John Conyers, and supported by Congressman John Lewis. Their       lifelong and unshakeable commitment to civil rights is a       historical fact and should be honored and respected, not       opportunistically and baselessly questioned just to score a       few empty political points.        We would be the first to speak out against prejudice or       bias anywhere--in business, culture, the arts, or politics.       But here, we know these charges are false. The bill has       nothing to do with the current Librarian at all--in fact,       these reform proposals pre-date her appointment.        Nor does this bill have anything to do with the former       Register of Copyrights. We are grateful for her tireless       efforts and advocacy on behalf of working musicians and find       it appalling that some have engaged in efforts to drag her       record through the mud to defeat these reforms.        And certainly the bill has nothing to do with the current       President--once again, these proposals to modernize the       Copyright Office long pre-date his election. It is the height       of cynicism for bill opponents to attempt to ride on the       powerful coattails of the ``RESIST'' movement by falsely       wrapping this bipartisan pro-artist, pro-creator legislation       in the controversies surrounding the President, especially in       light of his proposal for massive cuts to funding for the       arts. In our view, misleading the President's critics by       leveraging fear into opposition for a non-controversial       proposal like this ultimately undermines and disrespects our       movement.        The need for this legislation is plain. The current system       in which the Librarian of Congress selects the Register is       the result of a unique moment in history and outdated       concerns: in 1870, the Librarian of Congress asked Congress       to give him the authority to appoint the Register in order to       deal with a massive influx of new works and the need to       quickly grow the Library's collection.        Nearly 150 years later, the functions of the Copyright       Office have changed. It is no mere registry of creative       works, but has become the most trusted advisor on Copyright       law and its interpretation for the United States Congress.       The process of selecting a leader to this office should       reflect the importance of copyright to the U.S. economy.        Congress is reviewing and revising copyright laws to ensure       they continue to protect all music creators in a time of       rapid transition online. It deserves the best advice it can       get, and reform of the Register selection process is long       overdue.        Thank you for consideration of our views,      Melvin Gibbs.
