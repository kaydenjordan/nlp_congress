 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate is currently debating the  Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act. These are  issues that we need to deal with, and it is really an important time to  be talking about these issues.   Really, there are four different things that this bill does.   The first thing this bill does is to go further in providing security  for Israel. I think virtually everybody in the Senate--there may be an  exception or two--understands that Israel is our greatest ally in the  Middle East, that Israel is a great source of intelligence for us as we  try to work our way through problems in the Middle East, and that we  rely on Israel for the partnership we have there in the things that  Israel has done to study and test. Unfortunately, it has gotten to test  in real situations military defense systems that will intercept things  that are coming at us. As for the whole concept of a bullet that can  hit a bullet, which some people thought was such a farfetched idea when  President Reagan talked about it in the 1980s, Israel has proven one  can do it with our help with regard to some of the technology. It is a  partnership. Israel, unfortunately, is in a place that actually uses it  to really intercept things that are coming at its citizens, and we  found out it works.   Security for Israel is security for the United States. In 2016, the  United States and Israel signed a 10-year agreement on security  assistance. This bill makes sure that the agreement will continue to  have the full force of law. This legislation makes sure that we are  giving some concrete aid to help Israel protect itself and to protect  its own security.   It also states very clearly that the policy of the United States is  to ensure that Israel can counter and defeat threats when it faces its  enemies. These are countries and other groups that don't like Israel.  It is in their schools, their propaganda, and their commitments as  nations to talk about the importance of Israel's not existing. In fact,  some of them use maps on which Israel doesn't exist. If you were to  look at the educational structures of some of Israel's neighbors, you  would have to find something outside of what you learn in school to  understand that there even is an Israel. Of course, there is Iran,  Hezbollah, and Hamas. There are plenty of threats to Israel and to what  Israel and the United States stand for.   This part of the bill has previously passed both Houses of the  Congress in slightly different forms. Now it is time for both Houses to  pass it in the same form, to put it on the President's desk  [[Page S758]]  so as to further defend and define the things that are there. This is  an important thing to do.   The second part of the bill extends our cooperation between us and  Jordan. We have no more faithful partner outside of Israel than Jordan.  Frankly, that Israeli-Jordan border is critically important in how that  cooperation works. We saw what happened when the Syrians looked for a  safe place to go, and they went to Jordan. So we have done our best to  ensure that Jordan can meet its humanitarian crisis based on what has  happened in Syria. The economic stability of Jordan--believe me--is  critical to the economic stability of the region. This bill also comes  up with new ways to assist our allies when they face these  unanticipated situations, and some of these situations last for a long  time once they start.   The third part of the legislation imposes sanctions on anyone who  does business with the Government of Syria. The tragedy of Syria--the  tragedy of the Syrian people, the chemical warfare of Bashar Assad, the  barrel bombs that have been dropped in neighborhoods where innocent  people live, those being children and senior citizens, and where people  are trying to work every day--makes it clear that this is not a country  that we should support.   Actually, this portion of the legislation already passed the House by  voice vote. We need to join the House with its commitment to continue  to put pressure on Syria for Syria to meet the standards that  civilization should require of those we deal with. We can't deal with  Syria as long as it continues to act in the way it has been acting. It  is something we know needs to be done. Hopefully, we will have a vote  that will move this further toward reality.   The fourth part of the package we are talking about is another thing  that we can do in our support for Israel. There are groups of people  who seek to target Israel through a series of boycotts and  disinvestments and sanctions. These are usually not governments. They  are individuals and institutions that are trying to harm Israel by  boycotting any kind of business there.   This anti-Israel activity is shameful. Those who promote it should be  penalized. If they want to find out what it is like to not be able to  trade, we should show them what it is like not to be able to trade.  There are 26 States that have already passed legislation that allows  them to deal in different ways with people who have either disinvested  in or boycotted Israel. This bill provides some further definition of  how they can move forward. Boycotting Israel is unacceptable. That is  an important part of this package.   All of these things need to be done, and this is an important time to  send that message around the world--that not only our allies inside  world can count on us but that our enemies in the world--our  adversaries--can also expect us to do what we should do to support our  allies, to defend freedom, to look forward as one amendment that has  been offered will do that I have cosponsored to meet our commitments to  NATO, to understand the continued dangerous nature of terrorist  threats, to be thoughtful as we make decisions that move us further  away from the safe havens that those threats have used in the past.  This is an important time for us to send the very message that this  bill and the proposed amendment do send. I look forward to seeing that  message sent first by the Senate and then by the House, with then,  hopefully, a signature from the President of the United States.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor the work  and career of Mr. Robert Cardillo. On February 7, 2019, Robert Cardillo  will conclude nearly 36 years of service with the U.S. intelligence  community, ending as Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency, or NGA.   In 1983, Robert began his career at the Defense Intelligence Agency,  or DIA, as an imagery analyst. He served in a multitude of positions  for DIA and NGA, to include Acting Director of Intelligence for the  Joint Staff, in which he supported the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, which is the first time a civilian has ever held that position.  He was then selected by the Director of National Intelligence, the DNI,  to be the first ever Deputy Director for Intelligence Integration. In  that capacity, he was responsible for vastly improving intelligence  integration, the principal mission of the DNI as established under the  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. As a critical  additional duty, Robert also served as the primary briefer for the  President's daily brief at the White House.   From 2014 to 2019, Mr. Cardillo then led NGA as its Director. Under  his guidance and direction, NGA provided much lauded geospatial  intelligence support to U.S. and allied combat operations in Southwest  Asia and around the globe, assisting in the fight against militant  extremists. NGA also conveyed key indications and warning during crises  in Northeast Asia, the Middle East, North and Central Africa, Eastern  Europe, and elsewhere.   Highlighting the need to get unclassified data to the warfighter and  our allies, Director Cardillo pushed hard for unclassified geospatial  intelligence, or GEOINT, to exist in the open. He urged NGA to work in  tandem with commercial satellite imagery providers and other  unclassified industry partners. His support of innovation in artificial  intelligence, automation and augmentation, and his focus on activity- based intelligence set NGA on a course to improve the speed and quality  of geospatial and imagery analysis. His attention to the ebola crisis  in West Africa and other humanitarian assistance and disaster response  initiatives showed the value of human geography to the world.   Director Cardillo was equally successful at forging new multinational  partnerships in Europe and Asia, and his outreach to industry,  academia, think tanks, and other international partners led to an  informal but increasingly thriving global GEOINT enterprise.   Mr. Cardillo was also the first NGA director to emphasize the  importance of the Arctic and Antarctica and the first to take on the  security, quality, and pedigree of imagery pixels and data, so that the  GEOINT enterprise can continue to serve as a safe foundational frame of  reference for the entire intelligence community.   Robert led NGA with integrity for more than 4 highly challenging and  demanding years, to include the selection of a future headquarters site  in St. Louis, MO. He laid the groundwork for a world-class building  that will be designed to endure well into the 22nd century and to serve  as the modern workplace that his workforce so richly deserves.   Director Cardillo will long be remembered as a relentless visionary  who restructured the future of his field to embrace public and private  partnerships, data science, and machine learning. His far-sighted  vision will continue to drive requirements and ensure that NGA shows  the way to a safer United States and a more secure world.   We thank him for his years of service to the intelligence community  and to this country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today to  support the posthumous promotion of U.S. Marine Corps SSgt Roger David  Marsh to gunnery sergeant. Today I would like to recognize the  distinguished service of Mr. Marsh, who passed away at the age of 72 on  June 17th, 2008.   Mr. Marsh served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps for 20 years with  a superior record, including combat actions against enemy forces  throughout his career in both Korea and Vietnam. Throughout his time in  the Marine Corps, he received numerous awards and citations to include  the bronze star with valor. Additionally, he made significant  contributions to his community after his retirement from the Marine  Corps by actively participating in the Veterans of Foreign Wars and  American Legion, as well as his 30 years of exceptional service as  chief of policy for Webb City, MO.   Prior to Staff Sergeant Marsh's retirement from the Marine Corps, he  was selected for promotion to gunnery sergeant. He worked diligently  for 8 years to get that promotion. Due to personal reasons, he chose to  leave the Marine Corps prior to the 2-year obligation of service and  therefore was not promoted. Forty-five years after his retirement, we  can finally honor his service and legacy through a posthumous  promotion.   The State of Missouri and our Nation were very lucky to have such a  dedicated member to the community. Mr. Marsh's extraordinary service to  the Marine Corps and time after his retirement were remarkable. His  actions rise to the level of service that warrants this unique honor.  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Roger David  Marsh's life and legacy with the distinction of gunnery  sergeant.                            ____________________
