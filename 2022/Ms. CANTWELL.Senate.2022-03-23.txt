 I come to the floor to talk about the underlying bill  that we are trying to get passed. That is the United States Innovation  and Competition Act that we passed here in the U.S. Senate about 280  days ago.   One aspect of that bill is a provision that we just had a hearing on  in the Commerce Committee today, and that is the funding of what are  called semiconductors, the key technology enabling so much of the  technology sectors today--from your phones to your smart devices, to  automobiles, to the transition we want to make on clean energy, to just  about everything that we see that is essential to be smarter, more  connected, and to play off some of the advances in technology that  allow us to be more efficient.   But we are here to talk about how chips are also a supply chain  issue. And the supply chain of this product has definitely been  impacted over the last few years, both by the fact that there has been  a higher demand for them and because of what has happened during COVID.   In fact, 90 percent of the chips that are most advanced today come  from Taiwan. Today's hearing was about how the United States of America  needs to do more to produce the next generation of advanced chips for  artificial intelligence, automation, and advanced manufacturing, here  in the United States, and that an overreliance on the global supply  chain--which every American can tell you about the supply chain now  because there are products that they are not getting because of the  supply chain or the price has gone up because of the supply chain--but  we know that this issue of getting this Innovation and Competition Act  and getting the funding for more production to be done in the United  States on something as critical as semiconductors is a very key issue.  So I hope our colleagues will help us get to conference and resolve  this issue with our colleagues.   But I would like to talk about a few of those sectors that are really  impacting and hurting Americans. First of all, in the automotive  sector, thousands of American workers have endured layoffs due to the  shortage. The global automobile industry suffered over 200 billion in  losses, and Ford was forced to halt or cut production at eight plants  as recently as last month.   The cost of a used car has gone up 41 percent, and the price of new  cars 12  [[Page S1734]]  percent. A lot of this is due to the semiconductor shortage. Let me  repeat those numbers: The price of a used car has gone up 41 percent;  the price of a new car over here, 12 percent. And this is the price of  a 12-percent increase on new equipment.   Well, if you think about it, right now, for most of those people  trying to buy the new cars, they might be on a waiting list. But people  who can easily afford a new car and need one but can't get it due to  the shortage, they are buying used cars instead, and that is what is  driving up the price.   So who feels the pain at the pump? It is not the person who has to  wait a few extra months for that new car that they wanted. It is the  person whose radiator blew out last week who just needs anything to  drive to work--anything to get them to and from their job. But now that  used car is 41 percent more expensive. That basic used car might have  cost $5,000 last year, but if you add the 41 percent to that, it is now  costing $7,000.   So where is the extra $2,000 coming from? For that American consumer  who has to delay a family trip or do without things for their children  or maybe not even be able to pay next month's rent, all of this is due  to the impacts that we are seeing from this shortage.   So chips and the semiconductor effort that we are trying to address  in the underlying bill are really the ultimate supply chain issue; that  is, that some of the networking equipment that I mentioned here--a 12- percent increase--sometimes people are selling chips for a hundred  times their regular price just so that people will compete for them to  build out the broadband access.   We also are seeing issues of security, now that the source of the  chips are so concentrated in Taiwan, that at least 7 different chip  manufacturers, people have tried to hack them to steal the designs of  these chips. So these are all the reasons why we, today, here need to  advance this bill and say to the House: We want to go to conference. We  want to move forward on this legislation.   This legislation also supports $2 billion for, specifically, Defense  Department efforts to secure the supply chain, as well, and to help us  face this increase in demand.   I just want to say this to my colleagues. I know some people think:  Well, this issue will be over. It will be down the road. It is not  going to be over until we act. Right now, the world needs 1 trillion  chips per year. You need 1 trillion chips per year. In 2021, that went  up to 1.2 trillion chips per year. In 2031, it is going to be 2  trillion chips per year.   And this is driven by--you can see the demand. So there is a 200- percent increase in what is going to be needed from the automotive  sector, a 60-percent increase from the wireless sector, and an 80- percent increase in the consumer electronics sector.   So the question is, Are we just going to wait and see what happens in  Taiwan? Or are we going to make an investment here in the United States  to jump from that 1.2 trillion a year to 2 trillion a year and make it  be leading-edge U.S. technology?   So I am thankful for this underlying bill today, and I thank the  witnesses who testified at today's hearing.   One particular industry that was there was PACCAR, a company based in  Washington that is leading the way on transportation, automotive, and  driverless trucks, and they explained what this has done to impact  their business, why we need advanced chips, and why we need to continue  as a nation to promote them.   So I definitely hope our colleagues will see forth to move forward on  this kind of investment, get the underlying R&D bill onto the  President's desk so we can do what we do best in the United States of  America and that is invent, make our manufacturers competitive, and  grow jobs.                          Ocean Shipping Reform Act    Madam President, with that, I would like to turn to another issue. I  have been joined here on the floor by my colleague Senator Klobuchar.  We very much appreciate her and Senator Thune's efforts on trying to  tackle some of the supply chain issues that are at the ports.   Our ports are seeing record amounts of traffic--a 20-some-percent  increase in the amount of traffic coming into the United States--and  that congestion has caused lots of problems at our ports.   Senators Klobuchar and Thune announced legislation that we marked up  in committee earlier this week that I hope will see action on the  Senate floor as early as next week. That legislation puts new tools  into the hands of the Federal Maritime Commission, whose job it is to  make sure that there aren't unreasonable rates or practices that impact  negatively shippers in the United States.   And right now, what is happening is particularly our agricultural  sector is getting very hard-hit; that is, that literally some of these  foreign shippers that were at record profits and record millions have  basically been leaving without the U.S. exports. They literally are  coming to the United States, dropping product off, leaving less than  full, and hurrying back to pick up more product and deliver it to the  United States.   And our growers haven't been able to get their products onto those  ships, and the result of that is they are left on the docks, without  the ability to deliver the product to the customers that they would  like to see.   So our farmers need help and solutions on this. One solution by the  Biden-Harris administration that Secretary Vilsack has implemented is a  popup space at our ports to help defray the cost of freight that has  been caused.   I just want our colleagues to know that more needs to be done with  the Klobuchar-Thune bill because the container cost has gone from  $1,300 per container to $11,000 per container. This is part of data  that has been provided to us.   And what has happened is not only the costs that they are facing, as  I said, sometimes they are called, and it is said: If your product  isn't here, then we are leaving without it. And that is a big problem  if you are talking about Washington apples, seafood, any of the other  products that are big from our State.   One individual who testified--or came to a press event that we had in  Seattle last week said that the dairy industry and supply chain last  year and the problems cost U.S. dairy over $1.5 billion. And it means  that more containers are leaving the port empty.   We believe that the loss of revenue to the ag sector may be as much  as 22 percent; that is, that our ag sector isn't being able to get  their product out.   So I want to thank the President for his infrastructure package and  putting more money into ports and port development, as we did in a  bipartisan way with our colleagues in the Commerce Committee, and also  for getting this project up and running here at Terminal 46 in Seattle.   This popup storage helped facilitate and pre-position our  agricultural products so that they could be ready to get on those ships  and not face a penalty because of the congestion we are seeing.   USDA is providing our exporters with $200 to $400 per container to  help with the storage cost, but it is literally getting them in  position so that they can be right around the corner and get picked up  quickly. So I want to thank the Biden administration for that.   But I also want to encourage our colleagues to move ahead, as I  mentioned, on the Klobuchar-Thune bill, which is saying to the major  Federal entity whose day job it is to oversee reasonable rates as it  relates to shipping in the United States, please, let's get this  legislation on the Senate floor. If we care about supply chain issues,  if we care about the prices that are impacting consumers, then let's  get this legislation on the floor.   Obviously, the amount of costs that we are seeing per container and  the amount of increase in those container costs are impacting everyone.   So if those costs are on every container, whether they are coming in  or leaving, then we are seeing increased costs to consumers and  consumer products all across the board.   So let's get these supply chain issues, like USICA--the United States  Innovation and Competition Act--let's get that supply chain moving.  Let's get that supply chain of us making legislation with the House  moving so we can fix real supply chain problems with our  semiconductors. And let's get this Federal Maritime Commission bill on  the  [[Page S1735]]  floor next week so we can address the supply chain problems that are  costing us more with ag and costing us more with imports.   I yield the floor.
