 Madam Speaker, yesterday the Supreme Court  heard oral arguments in the Texas heartbeat case.   I pray that the Justices find wisdom and compassion to defend the  rights of the unborn.   So many of my constituents were horrified to learn that the FDA was  actually purchasing fetal tissue to surgically implant baby skulls into  mice. Thank God President Trump defended life and stopped this horrific  practice.   We opened this session with a prayer to ``Creator God.'' God is the  creator of human life, which begins at conception. Abortion is an  offense to God, and we are bringing the wrath of God down upon our  Nation.   Madam Speaker, I urge us as lawmakers and Americans to repent and  change course. Every child is made in the image of God, and every child  is precious.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and submit extraneous materials.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, I do have to say that this is  not a Republican or Democrat issue. This is an issue that affects all  American children.   But where are the Democrat leaders?   Why are they not speaking out on this?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Florida ( Madam Speaker, I want to take this  opportunity to commend the Governor of Florida for the great example he  has been to the rest of the States and how he is leading the way in  education. We appreciate it.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    To conclude, Madam Speaker, I want to say  that we want our children to be smart; we want them to master the core  subjects; and we want them to love their neighbor and their country.   Please do not underestimate the power of regular people to defend  their children and their country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
