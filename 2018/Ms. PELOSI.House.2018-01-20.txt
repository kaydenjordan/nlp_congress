 Mr. Speaker, last night, on the eve of the first  anniversary of President Trump's inauguration, President Trump earned  an F for leadership.   President Trump and congressional Republicans' obsession with passing  a tax scam to benefit the wealthiest in our country and corporations  has blinded them to their responsibilities to the American people.   Despite controlling the House, the Senate, and the White House, the  Republicans were so incompetent, so negligent, that they couldn't get  it together to keep the government open.   They could get it together to pass a tax credit, 83 percent of which  benefits the top 1 percent, but they couldn't get it together to pass  CHIP and its fuller complement to meet the needs of America's children  and families and seniors.   President Trump said about President Obama at the time of the 2013  GOP government shutdown: ``I mean, problems start from the top, and  they have to get solved from the top. And the President is the leader.  And he's got to get everybody in a room, and he's got to lead.''  President Trump then.   President Trump now, as President, President Trump tweets: ``Our  country needs a good `shutdown.'''   Your wish has come true for your 1-year anniversary because of all- around incompetence, inefficiency, and prioritizing with all your heart  and soul that 1 percent at the expense of the rest of the country.   Now, there is no such thing, as we know, as a good shutdown of the  government. Republicans' total inability  [[Page H587]]  to govern is once again threatening our economy, weakening our  communities, and dangerously depriving the military of the certainty  they need to keep our Nation safe.   I say the economy because a shutdown hurts the economy. The facts are  there from their previous shutdown.   I am proud the House and Senate Democrats' unity is insisting on a  budget that supports our military and the domestic investments that  keep our Nation strong and honors our values by protecting our  DREAMers.   I hope that we can now conduct bipartisan negotiations--bipartisan  negotiations--in a transparent way that unifies the country, where we  can find common ground to honor our responsibility to meet the needs of  the American people.   It is important to note that this is the fifth Republican shutdown.  They don't believe in governance, so shutting down the government is  sort of a means to an end for them.   I just want to note that in 2013, when the Republicans last shut down  the government--it is really important--that 231 Republicans voted to  shut down the government to zero on their side--231--and that included  Speaker Ryan, Leader McCarthy, Whip Scalise, and Chairwoman McMorris  Rodgers.   Later, on October 16, when it was time to open up the government, it  was just a kind of a remarkable thing.   I said 231. It was 229. Let me be fair, 229.   When it was time to open up the government, it was remarkable because  the Republicans still did not want to do that.   On October 16, 144 Republicans voted to keep the government shut  down--144. 198 Democrats voted to open up the government to zero.  Nobody voted to keep the government shut down.   So what is this? What are they taking about? Do people not think that  people have a record to see what their votes have been?    This is their fifth shutdown since the nineties. This is their fourth  CR since September. Get it together. Wipe the tears of joy from your  eye about passing a tax cut that benefits the wealthiest in our  country. Get down to business for everyday people in America and stop  using children as a shield to cover up what you are not doing for the  American people.   When we had the majority and President Obama was President, one of  the first bills we sent to his desk was CHIP. That has always been our  priority. But it must be accompanied by legislation to support  community health centers, which serve 27 million Americans, including  those CHIP kids, medical education for primary care doctors who serve  the needs of those children, Medicare extenders. The list goes on and  on of what that package is but what the Republicans did not want to pay  for in their ill-founded CR that they put forth.   A CR weakens the government. A CR weakens our national defense.  Secretary Mattis has said that over and over.   This action shuts down the government. The CRs debilitate government.  Let's get serious. Get it together. Stop romancing yourselves about  that tax bill and start getting serious about meeting the needs of the  American people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for  her leadership. I also thank all of the members of the Rules Committee  for the time that they put in bringing rules to the floor that relate  to a vast array of legislation that we deal with here.   Today, we are talking about martial law so that we will be prepared  to take up something that will open up the government and meet the  needs of the American people.   It is interesting to see the enthusiasm on both sides on these  subjects because we have a long history on some of these issues. We  have a long history and a commitment to CHIP. When we brought it to the  floor when I was Speaker, when we first had a Democratic President who  would sign the bill, 144 Republicans voted against that bill. But that  is then. This is now.   I think that now we are closer than the debate here would indicate. I  think there is a path forward. I think that is how we have to be  thinking about what is next.   We all have our, shall we say, reputations for where we have been on  certain votes about CHIP, about shutting down the government, and the  rest, but let's put that aside. The challenge that we have right now is  what is that path.   That path has four corners to it. One of them is the caps parity. We  have talked about parity. Other Members have talked about it. I am sure  Mr. Hoyer did again today. It is about parity. If you are going to have  increases in defense, we need the same increases in domestic. If that  is what the Defense Department decides its missions require, then we  want to be respectful of that.   But we also know that in the domestic budget, one-third of the  budget--34 percent--are security functions: Homeland Security,  antiterrorism activities at the Department of Justice, Veterans  Affairs, the Department of State. That is 34 percent of the domestic  budget.   We are saying that the strength of our country is not measured just  in our military might--as important as that is and respectful of it  that we are--but also in these security functions in the domestic  budget. In addition to that, in the health, education, and well-being  of the American people, which are also on the domestic side.   So I think on the caps, we just have to get in a room and make those  decisions. The challenge that I see is that it has been reported to me  that there are those on the Republican side who have some unease in  increasing the domestic budget because they know that they already had  a big increase in the deficit in the tax bill and are reluctant to add  any more investments for fear that it would increase the deficit.   However, these investments in research and development, in education,  and in infrastructure, really bring revenue to the Treasury, so they  help decrease the deficit. In fact, I think most economists will tell  you that nothing brings more money to the Treasury than the investments  in education, early childhood, K-12, higher education, postgrad, and  lifetime learning for our workers.   So in that spirit of saying they want more in defense, and we are  respectful of that, we need more in domestic, and hopefully you will be  respectful of that. I think that we can come to terms on that.   And then there is the question of pay-fors: How is that--or is it-- paid for?   So that is one thing. That is just you sit down, you negotiate, and  you get it done.   I am not an appropriator. Mr. Hoyer is an appropriator; Mr. Clyburn  is an appropriator; Mrs. Lowey, as our ranking member with such  distinction; and Mr. Frelinghuysen on your side. Appropriators know how  to get it done. They know the numbers. They can do the math, left to  their own devices. It is when other factors weigh in that it becomes  more challenging.   Let's just say: let's see if we can get that done, because that will  be more dispositive of shortening the time between where we are now and  if we get a solution.   The DREAMers are a value to us. We told the President right from the  start that it is not an issue, it is not a bill, it is a value of who  we are as America. I think that we can come to terms on that subject as  well.   But make no mistake, if there never were one DREAMer in our country,  we still would have this challenge on the money side of the debate.  Let's not try to assign responsibility to the DREAMers for the fact  that we don't have the increase in defense. We are willing to go to  that place as we go, honoring parity. That is what we agreed to in the  budget agreement. That is what the Speaker agreed to as chair of the  Budget Committee.   Why are we departing from that and then blaming it on the DREAMers?   And the security, we all believe in securing our borders, North and  South. We can come to terms on that, if we really believe that we  should.   None of us believes in a--well, I can only speak for our side of the  aisle--shutting down the government. We believe in a government role in  meeting the needs of the American people. We subject any initiatives to  do that to the harshest scrutiny because we know that the American  people need effective initiatives to meet their needs.   Let's take a deep breath. Let's calm down.   Now, for example, Mr. Welch led the way with a large number--100-some  Members of the House--signing a letter to the President.   I think it is really important for you to realize this. When we said  we wanted more domestic investment, here is what we were talking about.  We were very clear to choose only those initiatives that are bipartisan  that would pass on the floor with strong bipartisan support.   That means preserving the Bipartisan Budget Act, as I discussed, and  delivering urgently needed resources to communities fighting the opioid  epidemic. That is what we said to the President. This is one of the  increases on the domestic side: addressing the opioid epidemic.   Rescuing heroic veterans, who are facing a dire shortfall at the VA.   Opioids. Veterans.   Supporting access by funding CHIP, community health centers, medical  education for primary care doctors--the package that always went  together.   Preserving America's endangered pensions. We had bipartisan support  for that. That needs more discussion, but we want to do it.   Providing additional disaster recovery for Puerto Rico, the U.S.  Virgin Islands, Texas, Florida, California--States impacted by  wildfires.    There is nothing partisan about this, in addition to protecting our  DREAMers, which, again, has bipartisan support in the House and in the  Senate. We would want to pass the Dream Act, as well as then engage in  the discussion on the borders, which we are completely open to.   This is not a: Just give us some money. It is shared values-- Democrats and Republicans--and we are saying to the President: Help us  on this money side of the debate because it is so very important.   We can talk all day about who said what about what and all the rest  of that. I don't think shutting down the government is cool, as Mr.  Mulvaney said, but let's leave him to that.   We do know that government by CR is not the best way to go.   I think that we could take one day--take this evening--sit down: Caps  parity; pay-fors--probably easy; there is not a whole lot of  opportunity there, but whatever it is--and DACA, the DREAMers.   Again, if there never were one DREAMer, we would still be having this  discussion about the money side of it.   My view--and correct me if I am wrong--is that there is a resistance  on the Republican side of the House--I can't speak for the Senate, and  I haven't seen evidence of the Senate--to resist parity when it comes  to increasing funding, even for these priorities that we spelled out,  because it will increase the deficit, which has been greatly increased  by the tax bill.                                time  1815    So I would see, for some remaining, if existing, deficit hawks, that  you might have that concern.   Let me just also add that if there were not one DREAMer in America,  [[Page H599]]  America would be at a loss. These young people have come to this  country with their parents. They have made us so proud with their  diligence, with their attendance at school, service in the military,  working. I have heard from champions of industries, many of whom  celebrated the passage of the tax bill, saying: The people who work in  our firms are exemplary. They are stars in our company.   So why don't we not use them as an excuse not to face the reality  that we have domestic responsibilities that we must deal with.   But there is a path. Our appropriators are used to working together.  The leadership has to make these decisions. There is no reason we  shouldn't be able to do this by tomorrow and then give the  appropriators the time to write it up, but to come to those terms.   So let's all take a deep breath, let's understand our  responsibilities to the American people. Let us withhold, as I have  done, some of the--I have curbed my enthusiasm about certain other  things I have heard said and done here. I haven't even brought the  President's picture out saying, on his one-year anniversary: ``What  this country needs is a good `shutdown.'''   He said it earlier, but now he got one for his anniversary. Well, it  didn't completely curb my enthusiasm in that regard, but I do say that  we have more common ground than is reflected in how this has proceeded.   Let us find a better course so that we can stay on that course as we  meet other challenges that face our country.   God has blessed us with the privilege to serve here. We respect each  other. If we don't respect each other, respect the people who sent us  here. We owe them a lot more than the government being shut down.   So let's take a path to open it up, understanding that it will  involve compromise. It is going to involve bipartisanship,  transparency, and openness in how we get it done, but in a way that  brings unity to our country. I think that that is something we all  subscribe to. I certainly hope so.   I call upon my colleagues to join us in sitting down and getting it  done. I call upon the Speaker to be willing to bring some legislation  to the floor that will do this and which would have bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their attention.
