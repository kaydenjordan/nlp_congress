 Madam Chair, I would like to thank Ranking Member Lowey  as well as the full committee chair for their work, but I would like to  give a special thanks to Chairman Calvert and his staff, whom he  mentioned by name, and of course my wonderful staff, including my  personal staff, for working together using a collaborative approach to  help us move forward.   The subcommittee has a challenging portfolio of issues, and I commend  the chairman's efforts to maintain many of the fiscal year 2018  investments, such as addressing the backlog of deferred maintenance on  Federal lands and investing in Indian Country. I want to express how  sincerely proud I am of this subcommittee's nonpartisan approach to  addressing the issues facing our Native American brothers and sisters.   I am pleased that the bill recommends an increase of $410 million  over the fiscal year 2018 enacted level for programs critical to Indian  Country.   The health, education, and safety of our Tribal communities is a  Federal responsibility that our subcommittee takes very seriously, and  that is the one bright spot in this bill; but, unfortunately, other  important priorities for the American public did not fare as well.   Even though the fiscal year 2019 Interior, Environment, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee allocation is equal to the fiscal year 2018  enacted level, the majority is proposing a $100 million cut from the  Environmental Protection Agency, which is just untenable.   The cuts in this bill would target air and water quality programs,  reduce Federal funding to enforce the law against polluters, and, if  enacted, they will undermine the EPA's ability to keep our families and  communities healthy and to protect our environment for future  generations.   We are at a defining moment in history. The Interior bill has an  opportunity to make a global difference in the quality of life for  generations to come, but, sadly, this bill is a mirror of the Trump  administration's actions and disregard for the environment.   We cannot afford to ignore the overwhelming scientific evidence the  planet is warming, sea levels are rising, and glaciers are melting. We  must do more, not less, to pursue policies and programs that will put  us on the right path to conserve and protect our natural resources and  the planet we call home.   The bill before us also reduces funding for the Land and Water  Conservation Fund by $65 million from the fiscal year 2018 enacted  level. This program has strong bipartisan support. It conserves natural  areas and provides recreational opportunities in all 50 States.   The American people expect us to be good stewards of our public lands  and wildlife, but this bill falls short on that commitment.   In addition to the irresponsible cuts to the EPA, I must express my  concern and my disappointment to the 18 partisan riders in this bill  that pander to special interests at the expense of the public good.  These riders undermine clean water and clean air safeguards, jeopardize  protection and recovery for vulnerable species, and even intercede in  California water issues outside of the jurisdiction of the  subcommittee.   The Senate has committed to work in a bipartisan manner to keep  controversial policy riders out of their appropriations bills. I agree  with that strategy and believe these policy issues should receive a  full and transparent debate in the authorizing committees of  jurisdiction. Congress must stop holding the government hostage over  these ideological policy riders.   And, finally, it is impossible to talk about the bill that funds the  Environmental Protection Agency without addressing the ethical problems  that have plagued this administration and were embodied by the former  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. There is ample evidence that the former  Administrator was misusing Federal dollars for lavish expenses and  prioritizing the interest of corporations over protecting America's  families. Mr. Pruitt may be gone from the Agency, but Congress should  be doing considerable oversight to ensure that a culture of  transparency and accountability is restored at the EPA.   We should also be doing our best to ensure that every agency we fund  is not abusing taxpayers' dollars. So I am deeply disappointed that my  Republican colleagues voted down multiple amendments in our committee  markup that would have held up our responsibility for oversight and  adequately funded ongoing investigations. They also denied several more  Democratic oversight amendments a chance to come to this floor for  debate today.   Madam Chair, this bill fails the American people. It cuts  environmental protections. It removes safeguards for our air and water  and endangered species and allows rampant corruption in the executive  branch to go unchecked. I know we can do better than this, and it is my  hope we will do better after conference.    Madam Chair, I thank Mrs. Lowey for yielding.   So despite my current opposition, I intend to continue to work with  the chairman through this year's appropriations process to produce a  responsible bill that I know we can have both parties support in the  end.     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Madam Chair, investments in the Land and Water  Conservation Fund support public land conservation and ensure access to  all the outdoors for all Americans. As I mentioned in my opening  remarks, all 50 States enjoy and appreciate access to this fund.   The House bill provides $360 million which is $65 million below the  fiscal year 2018 level. So this account has already seen a cut.   So I think that the committee made it very clear. We are very  concerned about deferred maintenance in the national parks. The FY18  budget provides a $40 million increase over the FY18 enacted levels for  facility operations and maintenance.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time    I believe I have the right to close, Madam Chair, so I  reserve the balance of my time until closing.    Madam Chair, to the gentleman who is offering the  amendment, I appreciate his goal of wanting to address backlog. I would  love to address more of our national park's backlog. But as I pointed  out, the Land and Water Conservation Fund also has broad bipartisan  support and has already taken a cut of $65 million below the FY18  budget level. So increasing access to our public lands for hunting,  fishing, and other recreational activities has bipartisan support, just  as addressing the deferred maintenance.   So if we can see an increase in the 302(b) as we move forward in  committee, I am sure the chairman would consider that, and I would be  very much in support of working something out.   But at this point, I am adamantly opposed to cutting the Land and  Water Conservation Fund any further.   With that, I would tell my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I think what the gentleman from New Jersey  is talking about is something that I am supportive of, but I am not  supportive of the offset.   As the gentleman is aware, our 302(b) allocation was level-funded,  and the 2018 omnibus bill provided $5 million to implement the Delaware  Basin Conservation Act in FY19. An additional $5 million is provided,  so it is a total of $10 million.   The offset to the amendment is what I have an objection to, not the  gentleman's goals. The offset the gentleman  [[Page H6436]]  uses does not require a one-for-one match. The offset that he is using  in order to move forward would reduce Fish and Wildlife Service  construction by $3.85 million, and it has already been cut by $6  million. So the total cut to Fish and Wildlife construction would be  $10 million at the end of the gentleman's amendment.   At this time, I am going to object to the amendment, but I would work  with the gentleman and the chair to not only get a higher 302(b)  allocation, but to find a different offset.     Madam Chair, I am honored to stand up and support  Historically Black Colleges and Universities and, as has been pointed  out, the important role that they play in our education system. Adding  additional resources to preserve these structures on these campuses is  necessary to maintain them.   Madam Chair, I am very honored to represent many people from the  Oromo community who are proud alumni from HBCUs. I stand with the  gentleman to make sure that we have the resources needed for African  American preservation and history, not only to have passed along our  appreciation of our Nation's history to future generations, but to give  the next generation great buildings to be educated in.                                time  2030     Point of parliamentary inquiry. Could our side have an  opportunity to look at the amendment? We haven't had an opportunity to  see it. We do not know whether or not we would object. It might be a  friendly amendment to us.   Permission to Consider Amendment Nos. 16 and 17 Offered by Mr. Johnson                              of Ohio En Bloc     Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment that takes  more money from an already starved EPA account. This bill already  severely cuts the Environmental Protection Agency's operating account  by more than $100 million. The air we breathe and the water we drink  are endangered by the funding and policy decisions that are made in  this bill, and the consequences will be negatively felt in communities  across this Nation.   It is unfortunate that our 302(b) allocation was level funded, and I  am sorry to hear that the gentleman's account in which he is trying to  restore funding also received a cut. I often know that cutting the EPA  is an easy target for many of my colleagues across the aisle, Mr.  Chair, but I want my colleagues to understand what this amendment would  cut, if adopted.   This account funds programs that are important to both sides of the  aisle: permitting construction projects across the country, toxic risk  prevention, and a successful brownfields program, and even pesticide  licensing.   I understand that the amendment would direct more funds to States in  Appalachia who have suffered ravaging environmental costs caused by  coal mining, and, once again, I want to stress that it is unfortunate  that you are trying to restore funding that had been cut, but our  allocation was very short.   Unfortunately, I cannot support any deeper cuts to the EPA because  they will have consequences that will be felt by people all across the  country, so I must oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to  close.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to  close.    Mr. Chairman, I want to be clear. I understand that  this amendment would direct more funding to States in Appalachia who  have suffered from the ravaging environment caused by coal mining, and  that is a very noble goal, as I said before.   But at this time I have to oppose this amendment. Once again, I want  to point out, we were level funded in our allocation in the Interior  bill that we are debating today with amendments, and I cannot support  any further deeper cuts to the EPA.   But as the chairman moves forward and as we go to conference, if we  can start restoring some of the funds to the EPA, I would like to work  with the gentleman to restore some of the funds to this also important  program; but at this time I have to oppose.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. This  amendment highlights the very need for more funding in the EPA's  Environmental Justice Program.   As a Member of Congress, we should be appropriating adequate  resources to ensure everyone--everyone--in this country enjoys the same  degree of protection from environmental health hazards.   This is clearly another example of why the interior bill should not  have received flat funding and 302(b) allocation and the impact of not  having a more transparent process.   We should be standing up for our communities of color and for the  children of color who are impacted by these hazardous pollutants to  which they are subjected.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in great support of this  amendment. Just last year, I dealt with a frightening situation in my  district where a company abandoned its facility, leaving dozens of vats  of drums of cyanide and various assorted other toxic chemicals. This  facility was in the middle of a residential neighborhood with some  neighbors only living 15 feet from the facility.   There is a legacy of abandoned waste sites that must be dealt with,  and the cost far exceeds what we can fund in our bill. This flat  funding that we have with the 302(b) allocation is something that the  chairman knows I feel very strongly about, and I want to be on record  of supporting this, and maybe we also need to include the reinstating  of a Superfund tax.   I thank the gentlewoman for the time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would increase that  reduction and transfer $5 million to the National Forest System  account, and as the gentleman explained, the funding would be used for  the purpose of eradicating illegal marijuana growing operations in the  national forests, and that is something that I support.   I know we work on it in Minnesota, and we have worked on it in our  State forests. So I agree that this work is very important. I worked to  ensure this funding was included in the fiscal year 2018 omnibus bill,  so the funding is already provided, and now it is part of the program's  base.   So the amendment, to me, is unnecessary because the program is  already funded, but the offset is also problematic. The Forest and  Rangeland Research account fund does scientific research that informs  policy and land management decisions regarding such issues as I know we  all care about: wildfire, fuels research, invasive species, which also  can, especially in our forests, lead to the forest being less healthy  so they have less resilience to wildfire, and new, innovative ways to  harvest forest products, which in my State and many States is very  important.   This amendment, I don't think is intended to, but I do believe it  could negatively impact bipartisan programs like the Forest Products  Laboratory and the Forest Inventory Analysis program.   So, as I mentioned, I am opposing this not because I don't think we  need to work on eradicating illegally grown marijuana in our public  lands, but because this program is already in part of the base, and the  offset is problematic for many of the shared goals I think many of us  in this body have.   So with that, I oppose this amendment, and I currently don't plan on  speaking on it again.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
