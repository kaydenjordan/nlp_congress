 Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to be an original  cosponsor, along with Chairman Royce and our wonderful ranking member,  Mr. Engel, of the PEPFAR Extension Act, which has been led by our  colleague Chris Smith of New Jersey and my friend Ms. Barbara Lee of  California.   This bill will build upon the success of PEPFAR, which has been a  transformative program in fighting HIV/AIDS, this epidemic, worldwide.   PEPFAR has supported lifesaving antiretroviral treatments for close  to 14 million people, a nearly fivefold increase over the last 10  years. Since the program's inception, nearly 2 million HIV-free babies  have been born to HIV-infected mothers.   This program has also contributed directly to the stability, to the  security, and to the economic growth of countries around the globe.   When President George W. Bush called on Congress to take action in  responding to the global crisis of HIV 15 years ago, Republicans and  Democrats stood together, just as we are standing together tonight, to  authorize this program. Time and time again, PEPFAR has been  reauthorized with overwhelming bipartisan support.    I will forever cherish, Mr. Speaker, standing in the Oval Office as  President George W. Bush signed this essential program into law. I am  so proud of what we as a Nation have accomplished  [[Page H9491]]  through this incredible program. With the help of our global partners,  every day, we are closer to achieving an AIDS-free generation.   I urge all my colleagues to give it their full support. I thank the  Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, Ms. Lee, and Mr. Smith.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking  Member Engel for their leadership, for their bipartisan spirit, for  everything that they are doing to bring our Congress together. We need  more of them around here. I thank them for bringing Mr. McCaul's bill  to the floor today. I thank my esteemed Foreign Affairs Committee  colleague,  Michael McCaul, for his authorship of this important bill.   The Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Act codifies an  important program, the program after which the bill is named, and helps  build partner capacity in a critical region of the world.   Thanks to Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel, I recently had the  privilege of leading a delegation to one of those partner countries,  Morocco, where I met with the Moroccan equivalent of the FBI. On the  front lines of terrorism in north Africa and the Sahel, Morocco has  successfully thwarted plot after plot that was threatening U.S.  interests, and is positioned to play an even bigger role in our joint  counterterrorism efforts.   Programs like the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership help  bring law enforcement services in places like Morocco even closer  together, allowing us to share information about terrorist groups like  ISIS, al-Qaida, Hezbollah, and helps to protect our homeland.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support Mr. McCaul's  important bill, and I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce)  for yielding me time.    Mr. Speaker, Damon Nelson, the staff director of  our House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, passed away a few  days ago, and this has left us shocked and saddened.   It was my honor to have been selected by the Speaker to serve on this  coveted committee, and we all came to know Damon as a kind and gracious  gentleman. Always armed with a smile, Damon was there to lend a hand to  staffers and Members alike.   A veteran of the Persian Gulf war, Damon took pride in his military  service, which also afforded him the opportunity to meet his lovely  wife, Dana.   My heart goes out to you, Dana; to Damon's family; to our  congressional colleague Devin; and to all the wonderful folks who had  the privilege of calling Damon a friend.   Although Damon will no longer walk these hallowed halls, his spirit  will forever be forged in the mission of this institution: To serve our  citizens with honor and distinction.   I was privileged to know such a patriot and fine individual who  embodied the characteristics of a public servant.   Thank you, Damon, for all you did, and rest easy, my friend.                            ____________________
