 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Lee for her  leadership on repealing the 2002 AUMF. That was the authorization that  sent me and hundreds of thousands of servicemen and -women to Iraq  since the invasion in 2003. The justification for that war was  fundamentally flawed.   But to be certain, the purpose of the 2002 AUMF established a broad  military mission in Iraq. Yet, I have no doubt that that mission that  we were given has been completed. And, sadly, the Nation has lost more  than 4,400 brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who were  engaged in Operation Iraqi Freedom.    It is time for us, for Congress and the American people, to formally  recognize the end of America's 2002 mission in Iraq. This is an  important first step. As Congress, once again, reasserts its  responsibility in the use of our military forces by authorizing  frameworks that address current threats to our Nation and that we  authorize the use of military force only as the last resort.
