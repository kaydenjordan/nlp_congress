 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Correa for  yielding.  [[Page H5149]]    I think as Americans learned, mostly over the last few weeks, that  young children were being separated from their mothers and fathers at  the U.S.-Mexico border, and now have heard that the Trump  administration is proposing to put these young children who have been  separated from their parents in tent camps on military bases in Texas  and in other places, it makes people wonder whether the Nation has lost  its moral compass under this administration.   Just because somebody crosses a border or presents themselves at a  border, does not make them nonhuman.                                time  1830    The United States is a nation, if anything, that stands for and has  stood for freedom, for human rights, and for democracy.   How can we carry that mantle when we refuse to treat people like  human beings, especially young children?   This has become standard government policy under the Trump  administration. It is leaving lasting trauma--emotional, mental, and  physical trauma--to these young kids.   We should be able to enforce our immigration laws and still respect  people's humanity. So I have been encouraged to see so many Americans  speak up against this abhorrent policy. So many Americans from every  corner of this Nation, every city and every part, have spoken up  against this policy.   Because this Nation has stood as a moral beacon around the world, it  was quite remarkable recently when the United Nations, which the United  States hosts in New York City and for which the United States is the  largest funder, condemned our Nation for separating kids from their  families and their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. I ask us to think  about that and its significance.   If we can't stop these kinds of things from happening in the United  States, then I don't know that we can stop them from happening anywhere  in the world. This is not only a call to conscience, it is a call to  respect our Constitution, and it is a call that is not Republican or  Democrat or liberal or conservative but American. It is a call for  respect of human dignity.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Correa for organizing this  discussion today and for all of his work on this issue.
