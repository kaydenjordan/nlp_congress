 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to complete the  vote series on July 12 as I needed to return to my district to support  preparations ahead of Tropical Storm Barry. Had I been present, I would  have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 468, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 469,  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 470, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 471, ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 472, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 473, and ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 474.                            ____________________
