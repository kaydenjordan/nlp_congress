 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Lone Star  State, my classmate, Congressman Veasey, for hosting tonight's Special  Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this  position where the lines are being so blurred that Gold Star families  have come into this political discussion and are being dragged into  this, unwillingly, over the past several days.   I have great respect for General Kelly and was very delighted to see  him get the job as Chief of Staff so that he could maybe bring some  semblance of calm and normalcy to the White House, but it seems like he  has been infected by the disease that is the scourge in the White  House.   There is no reason for him to fabricate what one of our colleagues  said. The videotape is there. She never did one thing that General  Kelly said she did on that fateful day in the dedication to that FBI  building.   I don't understand what is going on with people these days, but these  are the times we find ourselves in.   Mr. Speaker, as much as we would like to live in a colorblind  society, in an America where people should be judged by the content of  their character and not the color of their skin,  [[Page H8070]]  we aren't there yet. Race, unfortunately, still matters.   Juries devalue Black lives by punishing offenders more harshly when  their victims are White than when their victims are Black. Police are  more likely to use force when interacting with Black people than when  interacting with White people. Emergency room doctors are less likely  to prescribe pain medication to Black patients than to Whites.   Results from psychological studies of racial bias have shown that  nearly 90 percent of the White people in the United States who have  taken the implicit-association test have an inherent racial preference  for White people over Black people. Oh, yes, race matters in America,  and we have got to talk about it.   It should not take a crisis for the United States to discuss race and  the effects of stereotypes that are baked into our national cultural.  We should not have to wait for a police officer to shoot an unarmed  Black man before we discuss how negative stereotypes about Black people  affect snap judgments.                                time  2000    It should not take mass murder in a Bible study to get us talking  about how negative stereotypes of Black people in social media help  White supremacists rationalize their racism.   Back in 1997, Professor Jody David Armour warned us that bad actors  would try to make racism seem reasonable. Professor Armour wrote a book  called ``Negrophobia.'' In it, he predicted that ``perhaps the gravest  threat today to progress toward racial justice comes from the right- wing ideologues bent on convincing White people of good faith that  negative stereotypes about Blacks are justified.''   Professor Armour told us to look out for people trying ``to prove  that Blacks are inherently less intelligent and more violent than  Whites.'' And he explained that these people would try to make racism  seem rational by using discredited studies, unscientific experiments,  and cooked statistics.   What have we seen on our social media over the past few years? We  have seen that negrophobia is alive and well in the United States, and  social media is its enabler.   People like the President have used social media to spread cooked  statistics and outright lies to rationalize the racist stereotypes that  Black people are inherently violent.    Mr. Speaker, countries like Russia have used social media  to fuel racial tensions in America's communities, and White  supremacists have used social media to organize their hate.   We must not be afraid to ask: What role has Facebook played in  fueling negrophobia in America?   Facebook was born in an age of diversity, but it was not born with a  commitment to diversity. Only 3 in every 100 Facebook employees are  African American.   The company has no Black executives, and it has no Black board  members. The company's global director of diversity has said that  hiring women and people of color is complicated. Its chief executive  officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has promised that Facebook would hire a Black  board member sometime soon.   Why has it taken so long? Why have minority voices been left out of  the essential media development? Has Facebook's failure to value  minority voices inside the company made Facebook an online megaphone  for racist voices outside the company?   Facebook's algorithms have the power to affect the way Americans  think about Black people, for better or worse. When Facebook accepts  money from foreign actors who want to exploit racial tensions in the  United States, Facebook perpetuates negrophobia.   By the same token, Facebook's algorithms could weaken negrophobia by  enhancing positive messages that challenge people to reexamine and  resist discriminatory responses, but that will require Facebook to  fully commit to diversity right now, not sometime in the future.   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus met with Facebook a week  ago in terms of these negative ads that were found out to be bought by  Russian actors and spending $100,000 in doing so, and buying fake  ``Black Lives Matter'' responses and ads and ``anti-Black Lives  Matter'' ads to continue to fuel this division in our country.   If countries are able to see a weakness in our fabric in this Nation,  then they will exploit it. We have to come together as Americans and  understand that our issues are something that we have to deal with and  look each other in the face and have an honest discussion about.   No one is perfect. No one is saying that one side is worse than the  other, but we need to come together as a unit, as this great experiment  called the United States was meant to be, that all men are created  equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights--all Americans, not  just some--and we continue to strive towards that goal, towards that  utopia in this country.   This is the greatest country in the world, and we all know it here  because we benefit from it, but we have a long way to go in terms of  reaching the ultimate goal.
