 Madam Speaker, don't you love that, when we take a  few minutes getting organized because sometimes we walk around with so  many moving parts?   This is sort of the continuing conversation that we have been doing  on a theme for well over a year now, in the last Congress and now into  this one. It is a combination of a couple things:   One, our office works very hard on actually looking at solutions, but  first you have got to understand some of the problems. And I want to  say this very nicely--and maybe in the next couple weeks we will come  back and do it again, we have already done it a half a dozen times here  on the floor--and that is: The miracles of technology are about to do  amazing things in environmental protection.   So to our brothers and sisters on the left who were sharing their  heartfelt concerns over global warming and greenhouse gases, well, what  is so disappointing is the lack of optimism in the incredible  technology breakthroughs that have happened.   Think of this: Outside Houston, they are burning coal, they are  burning natural gas. And there is no smokestack. They are capturing  every bit of this ACO2.   There is just a litany of these types of technologies that--sort of  the old Malthusian view of the way you save the planet is we live much  poorer.   Well, that has been wrong now for centuries.   And once again, we are going to prove that the 1968 book, The  Population Bomb, which predicted that the world was going to starve by  the late 1970s has been wrong over and over and over.   We, as policymakers, have an obligation to make sure we are moving  those technologies forward, just like the Ways and Means Committee last  year actually updated the tax credit for carbon sequestration. And if  you follow the literature, there are amazing things that have happened  just in that 1 year with that technology and now efficient, good things  are happening.   But that is not my reason for being behind this microphone tonight.  We are going to continue the theme and I will fulfill my obligation  from last week when I said I would bring in the new revenue numbers for  the first 11 months of the year on what is actually happening in the  economy; what is the greatest threat to our future.   Let's start with the threat and then let's talk a little bit about  the good things and the solutions.   Almost every Member at some point has walked behind these microphones  and shown this slide. But this is so important to understand what the  actual conversation is that drives almost every policy on this floor.  It is called demographics. It is the reality of the math.   You see this red? That is 1965. I accept that is--what?--55 years  ago. But 34 percent of the government spending was what we called  mandatory, earned and unearned benefits. Social Security, you earn it.  Medicare--this is prior to Medicare--but you earn those things.   Today, it is no longer 34 percent of our spending. Today, it has  actually crossed over 70 percent of our spending we don't even vote for  on this floor.   It is a formula:   You turn a certain age, you get a benefit.   You fall under a certain income, you get a benefit.   You are part of a certain group, you get a benefit.  [[Page H7827]]    The blue, 15 percent of our spending, that is defense. The green  here, 15 percent is what we call the other part of discretionary. And  that is what we sit here and debate. And that number is going to  continue to shrink because we have 74 million of our brothers and  sisters who are baby boomers who are moving into retirement.   Madam Speaker, 10,300 Americans every single day turn 65. It is not  Republican or Democrat. It is math.   But as I have joked many times--even though it is a little bit of a  dark humor--welcome to a math-free zone.   So let's actually continue to talk about what is the greatest threat  to our society and also the fact that we have some amazing  opportunities to actually deal with it.   Here is the math. Take a look at the chart behind me.   If I could sit in front of you and say the next 30 years--we are  going to remove Social Security, we are going to remove Medicare from  the conversation--your government, your Federal Government has, $23  trillion in the bank. But if we roll Social Security and Medicare back  into the math, we are $103 trillion upside down--$103 trillion  negative--so we are a couple 100 percent of GDP. And that is the 30- year window.   Because remember the math, every 5 years, just the growth in Social  Security, Medicare, and healthcare entitlements, just the growth, equal  the Defense Department--every 5 years. So every 10 years it is as if we  added two Defense Departments, just the growth of Social Security and  Medicare.   Is that Republican or Democrat? It is demographics. Somehow, this  place completely forgot there was a baby boom 50 years ago-plus--60  years ago over an 18-year period of time, and we have 74 million of us  who are baby boomers moving into our earned retirement and we have not  set aside a fraction of the resources necessary.   So this is the great fragility for my little soon to be 4-year-old  little girl. This is a threat to her economic life, her economic  future. But I will argue the future of our country, and actually the  economic vitality of the entire world, because when the United States  runs into crushing headwinds, the rest of the world also suffers.   And once again, look at the chart. The reality of it is--Social  Security is huge--but it is an easier fix. It is Medicare. Medicare is  what our great fragility is.   So let's actually talk about some of the positives because--and it is  my very last slide that we typically start with.   We come here and talk about, hey, there is sort of five pillars,  economic expansion, Tax Code, trade, regulatory that you do those  policies to maximize economic growth, incentives to join the labor  force.   As you know, we still have a math problem. Millennial men into the  labor force--even though the August numbers were stunning--now we have  broken over--what is it?--63.2 percent labor force participation. I  know that is geeky, but when tax reform was done, the modelers all  said, Well, we are fearful that capital stock and labor will be the  headwinds that keep us from being able to grow.   Well, it turns out, that thing they call capital stock has worked in  our favor. It is working great. The amount of resources coming back  in--we call repatriation, that was part of the Tax Code--have exceeded  the models. Americans saving have exceeded the models, and now that we  are, in many ways, still the healthiest economy in the world, the  amount of resources that are flowing into our economy from around the  world have exceeded what any one modeled. Capital stock is in great  shape. Look at our interest rates.   It turns out labor is our fragility. But think about this: If I had  come to people in this room, Republicans, Democrats, and said, Hey, 3  years ago--we are having this conversation 3 years ago--you are going  to live in a country in 2019 with substantially more jobs than  available workers, that in the last--like we saw in the August data, in  the last 3 months for--we will call it our brothers and sisters--and I  hate this term, but there is not a better way to talk about it--who are  in some of the lower income quartiles, they will be having wages  growing faster than 4 percent. You would have thought I was out of my  mind. Yet, it is happening. You would think there would be just joy  from our friends on the left and a little more talking about how  wonderful that economic growth being moral, because it helps so many of  our brothers and sisters who have had some really rough decades.   The math is still early, and it is going to be hard to do, but there  are a couple modelers out there that I had these conversations with  that are saying this may be the year, that because of income growth in  those--our brothers and sisters who didn't finish high school, who had  those types of equivalent of moderate-to-lower-skilled jobs, but their  wages are growing so fast, this may be the first year where income  inequality actually shrinks a bit.   And our friends on the left say that is one of the biggest moral  imperatives in their vision. Guess what? Something we are doing is  working in the economy.   Look at our brothers and sisters, the Hispanic population, African  American population, handicap population--all these different  subcategories we do to do our U6 math--either at or bypassing some of  the best employment numbers in modern history.   You would think there would almost be joy. And you would think  actually the debates around here would be, how do we keep it going?  Instead of who we intend to punish next.   So part of the amusement I have had so far this year, particularly-- and it is sometimes hard, but never do it, come up here behind the  microphone, and we have this whole binder of some of the crazy things  that were said a couple years ago when we were doing tax reform:  Revenues are going to collapse. The economy is going to be thrown into  a recession; all of this sort of darkness. And it was wrong.   So think about this: The chart behind me is the yellow--I think that  is yellow--is the, what we call receipts for the first 11 months of  this fiscal year.   Remember, your Federal Government's fiscal year begins October 1. The  blue is 18; the green is 17. Receipts for the first 11 months of 2019  in hard dollars, in inflation-adjusted dollars, are the largest revenue  receipts in U.S. history. And I was doing the math off the top of my  head. I need to grab it and sit in front of a calculator, but off the  top of my head, I believe that is a 4 percent growth rate in revenues.  Yet, the argument around here is the tax cuts are these horrible--and  they are going to crack--they are wrong. And the math is here.   Do you think we are going to get an apology? That number is also--if  I inflation-adjust it so I do constant dollars over the last few  decades, it is the second-highest revenue in U.S. history.   And think about what is happening in our economy. How many of our  brothers and sisters are working? How many of our brothers and sisters  are seeing the value of their homes, the value of their paychecks--the  best they have been in decades.   I don't know how we come here to the floor, we claim we care about  working men and women in the country, and then don't take joy in the  fact that the math is actually stunningly positive, and how we don't  engage in a debate and discussion on how we keep it going.    But politics, as you know, in D.C., have become absolutely perverse,  where the weaponization of everything--the rage is now a business plan  of certain media outlets to, God forbid, you say something positive  about the economy, because you will lose viewership. But the math is  the math.   So let's even take it a bit farther: Because we live in a society  that is so honest about what is actually happening in the economy, you  all saw industrial production numbers a couple days ago. I know I am  geeking out a bit, but, remember, wasn't it on this very floor just a  couple months ago we were all talking--well, one side was talking about  we are going into recession, things are crashing, you know, the sugar  high is over. Except for the fact that industrial production last month  had a .6, which is a nice, big spike and revision of previous months.  It is working. The United States is working. Our economy is working,  and compare it to the rest of the world.   Where is the joy? Where is the excitement?   If you say you care about people, these are people not only working,  but  [[Page H7828]]  why do we fixate on industrial production? What are the two factors  that allow a business concern to pay their workers more? Well, it is  traditionally inflation, which doesn't mean a bigger paycheck buys you  anything more. It is productivity.   When productivity goes up, people get paid more. And the purchasing  power is more. Industrial production is linked to productivity. It  means this is part of the reason our brothers and sisters out there,  who are out there working their hearts out, are getting paid more, and  their purchasing power is better.   I know this is geeky. I know I come behind this microphone and  sometimes sound like an accountant on steroids, but these things are  important because it is real. It is not some emotional blaring of, you  know, we hate this person, we like this person.   We made the math work. And we are seeing the results of good things  for hardworking Americans. Growth is moral.   And where I want to take that is my experience in Phoenix of visiting  the homeless campus, and St. Joseph the Worker there having jobs  because we are so desperate for workers in our market that employers  are trying to recruit workers from the homeless campus.                                time  1930    And we actually brought someone last year to testify in front of the  Ways and Means Committee. We are so desperate for carpenters and  plumbers and electricians, they brought a young man to come testify in  front of the Ways and Means Committee who wasn't like our typical  witness. He wasn't wearing a suit. He had a number of facial tattoos.  As a matter of fact, he had a number of facial piercings.   He opened up his testimony to the Ways and Means Committee saying: I  am a three-time convicted felon. I am an addict.   But because of a private group that was so desperate for workers,  they took a chance. They were doing training--in his case, electrical  training--in the prison before he got probation, and they guaranteed  him a job when he got out. It didn't mean they were going to keep him.   He had Republicans and Democrats and everyone in the room, as well as  the staff, crying because he told the story: I am a three-time  convicted felon.   He was an addict, and he was saying he had not touched drugs or  alcohol for a year. He gets to see his family again. He gets to see his  child again. And he is now up to $22 an hour, and he is so busy working  that he hasn't had the chance to relapse.   It is stories like that that need to be part of our lexicon. It is  part of the joy that economic growth is moral because it helps and  solves so many problems, and particularly in our earlier slides where I  had this absolute fixation on retirement security and our discussion of  growing the economy and labor force participation and technology and  incentives, bringing that package all together so we keep our promises  around Social Security and Medicare.   But we have the first pillar that we are living in right now, and  that is a proof that policy--policy--can work, whether it be the tax  policy we did a couple of years ago or whether it be some of the  regulatory changes we have embraced.   Madam Speaker, could you imagine if we could actually get that extra  half a point of GDP growth by finishing the NAFTA replacement, the  USMCA?   How many of our brothers and sisters in this place will drop their  politics or their terror of giving this White House a victory and  actually do what is good for the workers in this country--actually, the  workers for all of North America, because, as supply chains are moving  away from China, wouldn't we like to have them here in our hemisphere?  Or do politics blind people to the point that basic economics in math  and opportunity don't count?   So, back to one of the other things, and I put up this slide.  Partially, it is one of my Democrat friends here who brought this to my  attention, because we have been working on this concept that there is a  disruptive revolution coming in healthcare.   We have done the presentations here on the floor many times of the  thing you can blow into and it instantly tells you you have the flu,  and the algorithm, if we could just legalize it, could actually order  your antivirals, except for the fact that that technology is illegal  under current law.   But, also, the concept of, in just a few months, there is going to be  a drug that cures hemophilia. It is going to be really expensive, but,  for our brothers and sisters who have one of the most expensive  diseases in our society, they are cured.   So what would happen to those numbers I was showing you on Medicare  if I came to you and said: Hey, there is one disease group that is 30  percent of Medicare spending in the model for the next three decades?  It turns out it is diabetes.   It is one of the reasons this body has been investing in things like  the Cures Act and other miracles that are now happening in what we call  synthetic biology, in the new types of biological drugs--you have all  seen the stories, and it is still a bit of optimism--that we may be  able to start growing pancreatic cells again.   Could you imagine if we cured just diabetes? It is not only the noble  thing of curing a disease that is part of our chronic population; we  often don't think about what is the economic cascade that it has to,  actually, retirement security.   It turns out, if 30 percent of Medicare future costs are just somehow  related to first-degree or second-degree or third-degree effects of  diabetes, it is part of the reason so many of us in this body have  worked so hard to say: Put the money in. Let's invest in the  disruptions.   Because I do believe, if we could buy a calculator for our Members  here and help them understand the technology disruptions that are going  to make the environment and healthcare and so many other things just  amazing--and, then, if we could legalize many of the technologies that,  oddly enough, are illegal under our reimbursements and under our rules  today, there are some really amazing things.   These next few decades could be just amazing, particularly for my  little 4-year-old girl. But these amazing things don't happen when  everything is political and everything is weaponized and, if it is not  a melodrama, we don't do it.   So we typically start with this, but I am going to close with it this  time.   We have been trying to help our brothers and sisters in here  understand, the old discussions of, well, we can do this little bit of  entitlement reform or raise taxes over here or do this and that fixes  the fragility that is the future of, particularly, Medicare, but those  days are over. We lost that mathematical opportunity a decade and a  half ago.   But there is a way to survive the debt bomb that is coming at us if  we do the things that are necessary for economic expansion, do the  things that are necessary to encourage our brothers and sisters to be  in the labor force, actually embrace the disruptive technologies  instead of being fearful of them and being fearful of sort of telling  many of our incumbent business models that they are going to have to  adopt.   And we are going to have to tell the truth that, within the benefits,  we need incentives for you to think about, if you are healthy and can  do it, staying in the labor force.    And the other thing is we are going to have to actually talk about,  just as Mr. Yoho before me, things we do in immigration and population  stability, of an immigration system that maximizes economic vitality,  sort of the talent-based system the President talks about.   But, even in a country where our birthrates have collapsed, how we  encourage family formation, if you mix all these things together and  with a couple good lucks, like with the technology we are talking about  that cures diabetes, we can make the math work that the $103 trillion  of debt that we expect over the next 30 years, substantially because of  our demographics, does not have to destroy this country, because we can  cut that in half. If we do that, we have some amazing decades ahead of  us.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
