 Mr. Speaker, last night, in this very Chamber, we heard  a lot about what has made America the strong country it is: the ideals,  the founding ideals, and the strength of which, when the people are  able to put their will, their way behind it, has made us the greatest  country in the world.   What the President outlined were many important things. We have to  keep coming back to the situation at our border.   Now, interestingly, polls taken last night by CBS and CNN--not the  bastions of conservatism or the supporters of President Trump that you  would expect--both of these polls, the people's voice across this  country added up to 76 percent somewhat support or strongly support the  measures the President had talked about in securing our border.   We can get into the semantics, if you want to call it a wall or call  it a fence, whatever it is. ``A strong fence makes for good  neighbors''--an old cowboy saying.   The President laid out a plan that he wants to work with this  Congress to get to a resolution on that, not an executive order. But in  the time since we came up with this temporary solution here for 3  weeks, the negotiations from that side of the aisle have been zip.   Is that what people see as this Chamber, that this process is  supposed to be? No. They want us at the table coming up with solutions.   The President has reached out with an olive branch, saying: We will  give you 3 more weeks on this. Let's get the government reopened and  get a solution on this.   Instead, gridlock.   What the President talked about was greatness instead of gridlock.  That is what this Nation is about. That is what we need.   Instead, we hear around here that the crisis isn't something at our  border, isn't something with the immigration problem we have. We hear  about climate change. Climate change, climate change--a manufactured  problem, a manufactured crisis.   Indeed, the United States is leading the way of all the westernized  countries, all the industrialized countries, of lowering its  CO2 numbers, leading the way by things we are already doing  and innovating. Yet that is the first thing, that the religion of  climate change can be tapped around here to stop the progress we have  when we can make more progress by being a thriving, strong economy. The  crisis isn't that. It would be much more so our crushing national debt  and our border situation.   If we don't provide for our own security as a nation, then we don't  really have much. So let's solve these issues. As we prosper, as we do  better, we can even improve more on doing things environmentally more  strongly.   I come from northern California, where the climate has been pretty  tough with the drought. The climate is pretty tough where our forest  burns around us and amongst us, like in the town of Paradise, the town  of Redding, and other areas of the district that are so negatively  affected by that.   The crisis doesn't lie in the religion of climate change. The crisis  lies in us doing whatever we can to protect our citizens at the border,  from the crushing national debt, and from the threatened export of our  jobs that we should be employing our own people here.   Mr. Speaker, there is room for a lot of optimism. We heard that  message of optimism last night from the President, again, right in this  Chamber, when he mentioned our great heroes from World War II who were  here last night and one of the people he liberated from those camps  where the Germans held the Jewish people and executed so many of them  and abused so many more.   What a great story of optimism and what America is about, liberating  and preserving freedom in this country and around the world, and one of  the highlights in my time here in this U.S. House of Representatives to  see those people come together so many years later and celebrating what  is great about America and how it exports that freedom and opportunity  to the rest of the world.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize President  Trump's effort last night and to congratulate him on his State of the  Union Address.   The President's message was indeed clear. America has unlimited  potential; we just have to unlock it.   Under the 2 years of this administration, the economy has  consistently added jobs at record rates while simultaneously growing  wages.   According to a CBS poll last night, 76 percent of Americans approved  of what they heard the President say. Even more telling, 72 percent  said they approve of the President's ideas on immigration and our  border. It shouldn't be a surprise, either, that most Americans agree  we need increased border security and we need it now.   Since a physical barrier was constructed in San Diego, California, 23  years ago, illegal immigration has plummeted in that region by 92  percent. That is just one of many examples.   We have a limited window of time with our current 3-week agreement,  and what with more caravan hordes amassing below our southern border,  we need to take action.                            ____________________
