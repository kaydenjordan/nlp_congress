 Madam Speaker, I rise today not only for Half  Moon Bay and Monterey Park, but for Oakland, Goshen, and San Francisco;  for Dallas and for Houston; for Red Springs, High Point, and Durham;  for Chicago and Rockford; for Tunica Resorts; for Baton Rouge,  Shreveport, and New Orleans; for Fort Pierce, Sanford, Homestead,  Ocala, and Miami Gardens; for Phoenix; for St. Louis; for Cleveland and  Columbus; for Allentown, Philadelphia; for Minneapolis; for Denver; for  Albany, Georgia; for Huntsville; for Enoch; for Baltimore; for  Dumfries; and for Washington, D.C.   We are 26 days into the new year, and in those 26 days, there have  been 40 mass shootings in our country. That is 40 mass shootings--73  innocent Americans killed. These were mothers, fathers, sons, and  daughters who should still be with us today. My heart is broken for  every single, solitary one of them.   How much more heartbreak must our Nation endure?   How many more lives must we lose?   How many more times must we watch as another safe space, another  sanctuary, another school, or another celebration becomes a site for a  shooting?   How many times must I come to the floor and make this plea?   Our moments of silence won't save a single, solitary soul.   We have seen more mass shootings in the first month of 2023 than in  any other January on record. The new year should mark new beginnings,  new progress, and new hope. Instead, we find ourselves moving backward.  In less than a month, this year has become one defined by shock and  sorrow.   Every other country in the developed world has managed to rein in gun  violence. In 1996, Australia enacted commonsense firearm regulations  following a mass shooting, and gun deaths were cut in half. In the  U.K., just one school shooting pushed the government to pass lifesaving  gun violence prevention measures. New Zealand banned assault weapons  almost immediately after the Christchurch massacre.   Where our peer nations choose to act, America chooses to stand by in  the face of tragedy after tragedy after tragedy.   A safer America is possible. We can end the gun violence epidemic. We  can build a culture of rational, reasonable, and responsible firearm  ownership. We can ban the weapons of war used in so many mass  shootings. In fact, we have done it in the past.   From 1994 to 2004, the United States banned assault weapons. During  that time, gun deaths plummeted, but they shot right back up as soon as  the ban was lifted.   We have the resources and the precedent to do that again. What we  need is the political will. Ending gun violence is not an issue of  can't. It is an issue of won't.   My Republican colleagues won't ban assault weapons, they won't ban  large magazines, and they won't pass universal background checks.   The gun violence epidemic is a stain upon the fabric of our Nation,  and that stain grows deeper every second that Congress chooses not to  pass substantial gun violence prevention legislation.  [[Page H345]]    Last year, we did take a key step in the right direction by passing  the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. But make no mistake, Madam  Speaker. That was the beginning, and we cannot allow it to end there.   I am grateful that my colleague,   David Cicilline, plans to  reintroduce an assault weapons ban. I, too, am choosing to act. I will  soon reintroduce my bill to stop online ammunition sales.   Madam Speaker, I stand here confident that my Democratic colleagues  will stand behind this commonsense legislation.   From Sandy Hook to Uvalde, from Monterey Park to Trenton, New Jersey,  every mass shooting is a policy choice. Democrats are prepared to  choose better, and I demand that my Republican colleagues do the same.                            ____________________
