 Madam Speaker, it is wrong that Republicans continue to  pursue policies that clearly benefit only the wealthiest Americans and  large corporations, in particular, leaving middle class Americans  behind. They have undermined our healthcare system, raising premiums on  Americans and increasing the cost of prescription drugs. That is the  impact of what this Republican majority has done.   At a time when we see more Americans concerned about rising  healthcare costs, we really ought to be figuring out ways to work  together. I know Democrats and Republicans can do that. But instead,  the Republican majority is focused on tax cuts for the wealthiest  Americans and the biggest corporations, essentially passing huge  benefits--$250 billion--to CEOs and wealthy shareholders, mostly  through stock buybacks, which is money that does not go to America's  workers.   Now, Republicans are using their deficit-exploding tax plan to  justify huge cuts that could impact Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  Security. That is a raw deal.   Democrats are offering a better deal. We want to grow our economy and  create high-wage jobs that support a family, not just so they can just  get by, but so they can actually succeed. We have a plan for  opportunities.                            ____________________
