 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for the  nomination of Mr. David Bernhardt as the next Secretary of the  Interior.   Mr. Bernhardt is uniquely prepared to ascend to this position after a  career spent leading several of the Department's wings as chief of  staff to the Secretary, as director of congressional and legislative  affairs, and as a Senate-confirmed solicitor under President Bush.  These positions encompass the policy, managerial, intergovernmental,  and oversight roles any sitting Secretary needs to master.   He is ready to hit the ground running as one of the most  knowledgeable and upstanding Secretaries in the Department's history.   As a Colorado native, Mr. Bernhardt has repeatedly demonstrated a  capacity to translate his vast knowledge of water, public lands, and  other Western resources into policies that work in our home State and  throughout the West. He understands our issues, and I know  [[Page H3243]]  he will continue to fight for what is best for Colorado and the whole  country.                            ____________________
