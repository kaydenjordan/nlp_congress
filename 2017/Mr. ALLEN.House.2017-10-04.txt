 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman for her work on this  incredible budget that we are talking about here today.   I rise today in support of the FY18 budget entitled ``Building a  Better America.'' Never has a budget had a more fitting title. The  budget set forth by the House Budget Committee will balance the budget  within 10 years, provide our military with the resources they need for  national defense, and cut more than $200 billion in mandatory spending.    Picture this: $6.5 trillion in total deficit reduction over 10 years.  On that fact alone, I would hope my colleagues would support this  legislation.   This budget also paves the way for the recently released Unified  Framework for Fixing Our Broken Tax Code.   On a telephone townhall with thousands of constituents on the phone  from my district, 53 percent of participants reported that their most  important priority for tax reform is a simpler, fairer Tax Code. The  framework does just that and more.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the budget, to reduce the  deficit, and take a huge step toward progrowth tax reform that will  increase paychecks, spur economic growth, and make our Tax Code simple,  affordable, and competitive.
