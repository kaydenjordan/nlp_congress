 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 2772, the  VA Senior Executive Accountability Act.   This bipartisan bill brings transparency and accountability to senior  VA leadership.   Mr. Speaker, my area has the fastest growing veterans population in  the Nation. Our OIF, our OEF, and our women's veterans population is  rapidly growing.   Recently, our main VA hospital was rated at a one-star out of a five- star rating. In making a change, the VA simply swapped out the  underperforming leadership with another VA hospital.   This, Mr. Speaker, is unacceptable.   My bill would require the VA to issue reports on any reassignment of  VA leadership and how much the cost is. Additionally, the Secretary of  the VA would have to personally sign off on the reassignment.   Mr. Speaker, veterans need to trust that they are getting the best  care possible. They need to trust that they will have transparency.  They need to trust that there will be accountability.   I want to thank the chairman, the ranking member, and all those on  the committee for their work, their dedication, and their commitment to  upholding our sacred responsibility of care for those who upheld their  own sacred responsibility to our Nation.
