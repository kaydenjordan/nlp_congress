 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me start off by being very clear on this issue: Our military  forces aim for zero civilian casualties--zero--and one civilian  casualty during a military operation is one too many. No one  understands this better than our men and women in uniform who go  through extreme efforts to continually avoid civilian casualties, and  no committee understands this better than the House Armed Services  Committee.   So this amendment that we are discussing now is one of several that  we have seen this year that unnecessarily expand and increase reporting  on civilian casualties and allegations of civilian casualties caused by  our men and women in uniform.   I am disappointed that, once again, the majority chose to give up  Defense Committee jurisdiction to another outside committee. So this  amendment would, in effect, give an outside committee additional  reporting on what amounts to ongoing and current military operations.   To date, this has been the exclusive jurisdiction of the Defense  Committee's. In fact, the civilian casualty frameworks that we are  discussing today were put in place in previous NDAAs under the previous  Republican majority on a bipartisan basis. We tried to work in  additional edits to this amendment, given the importance of this issue,  but those edits were refused by the majority, which is why we are  debating this today.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H5603]]         Mr. Chair, in closing, again, I think it is important  to note that as a matter of practice on the ground, we want zero  civilian casualties, not only for law of war and ethical reasons but  because our troops are often there to work alongside and protect  civilian populations, so any unnecessary force creates additional  enemies. One civilian casualty is one too many.   But this amendment is unnecessary because there are already  considerable policies in place and reporting that occurs to minimize  any and all civilian casualties.   This amendment is also unnecessary because there is, in addition,  substantial and continued coordination that occurs between the DOD and  the State Department, starting at the country team level and extending  back to the Pentagon and Foggy Bottom, which also includes coordination  with the National Security Council and the intelligence community.   Again, we don't want to give up our jurisdiction on the House Armed  Services Committee when we are talking about military operations and  knowing that our troops do anything and everything they can to ensure  there are zero civilian casualties.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
