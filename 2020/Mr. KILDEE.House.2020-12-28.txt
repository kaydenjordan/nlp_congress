 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on  this and for recognizing me.   Madam Speaker, I stand in strong support of this legislation. The  American people are struggling. We hear from them every single day, and  they need this additional relief now. The recent coronavirus relief  bill passed by Congress obviously is long overdue. The House wanted to  pass relief last May, but Republicans refused. Then, the pandemic has  only gotten worse, and the pain has been worse for so many families and  small businesses.   While the relief bill does supply short-term relief, it was  regrettable to see President Trump delay signing this legislation. That  decision, that delay, had consequences. It hurt families with greater  uncertainty and, in some cases, caused people to lapse their benefits.   I did support the legislation that included the $600 stimulus checks  because that was all we could get the other side to agree to. But it is  obviously not enough. That is why I support this legislation, $2,000 in  direct payments for Americans who are struggling.   I, along with my Democratic colleagues, have pushed for these higher  payments for some time, and now, President Trump agrees. The leader of  the Republican Party stands in support of this effort.   These $2,000 payments, every Member of Congress should support them.  This would make a difference in the lives of Americans who are facing  the greatest uncertainty that they have experienced, for many of them,  in their lifetimes, putting money in their hands, allowing them to pay  their bills, which will help them support those small businesses.  Probably more importantly, it can give them some of the financial  support they need in order to make the decisions that they have to make  to protect their families.   President Trump changed his mind and supports this legislation. That  is why we acted. We would have included much larger payments in the  legislation had he spoken up sooner, but it is never too late to do the  right thing.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   This is a moment we can all come together, Democrats and Republicans,  including the President of the United States, and do something big and  bold that would help American families get through this most difficult  time.   Madam Speaker, I commend the chairman for his work in moving quickly  and putting this legislation together. I commend those on the other  side who will stand with us today and support this.   It is my hope that this legislation will quickly go over to the  Senate. They will get the message and send this legislation on to the  President, wherever he may be. He will sign the bill, and we can get  this help to the American people.                                time  1615
