 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Protecting  the Right to Organize Act.   The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for workers to  have the right to negotiate for better wages, stronger benefits, and  safer working conditions.   To keep our communities going, nurses, grocery store workers,  firefighters, childcare workers, educators, healthcare workers, and  more have been showing up to work every day, despite the risks. We have  the opportunity to honor their work and to help restore fairness to our  economy by making it easier for workers to form unions and collectively  bargain.   The PRO Act will establish substantive and enforceable penalties for  unlawful tactics employers take to interfere with workers' organizing a  union. The legislation closes loopholes in labor laws that allow  workers to be misclassified, provides them with protections of the  National Labor Relations Act, bans captive audience meetings, and  prohibits employers from interfering in union elections. It is the most  significant workers' rights legislation in years and an important step  in restoring the middle class.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the BlueGreen  Alliance in support of the PRO Act.                                                     March 8, 2021.        Dear Representative: As a coalition of some of the nation's       largest labor unions and environmental organizations,       collectively representing millions of members and supporters,       the BlueGreen Alliance and its partners write to express our       support for the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of       2021, H.R. 842.        In the United States, we face a critical juncture for the       rights of employees to organize. Workers have faced wage       stagnation, difficult working conditions, and a wholesale       effort to decimate their ability to organize for the past       several decades. Exploitation by employers of labor laws that       have been made toothless has caused union membership to fall       dramatically from 33 percent in 1956 to ten percent in 2018.       As it stands, no meaningful penalties exist for corporations       using illegal tactics to eliminate the option to organize.       Workers, already facing record income inequality, now face       job losses due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. And       we know the reality is that we went into this pandemic with       three ongoing interconnected crises: economic inequality,       racial inequality, and climate change.        Based on the National Bureau of Economic Research's       statistics, we know that unions consistently provide working       Americans with ten to twenty percent higher wages than non-      unionized workers. Workers who are union members fare better       in crises--whether the crisis is COVID-19 or climate change.       During crises, unionized workers have better access to       enhanced safety measures, unemployment insurance, additional       pay, paid sick time, and input in the terms of furloughs or       other job-saving arrangements. Empowering workers, whether       they are in the private sector or in the public sector, to       band together to negotiate better wages and safer working       conditions is the best path forward to protecting our workers       and rebuilding America's middle class.        Organizing does not just affect job quality, though:       unionized workers are better equipped to handle potentially       hazardous workplace situations, and have more freedom to blow       the whistle in dangerous situations. This can avert       industrial accidents and result in safer communities, as well       as cleaner air and water. Many unions also take firm       positions on environmental issues because they understand the       impact that clean air and water have on workers. Unions have       supported the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other       actions designed to both reduce the carbon pollution driving       climate change and grow good-paying jobs in the clean       economy. This bill can also help us close the gap in union       density and job quality in our growing clean energy sectors.        The PRO Act empowers employees by strengthening workers'       rights to bargain and to organize. It does so by ending       prohibitions on collective and class-action litigation,       prohibiting employers from permanently replacing striking       employees, amending how employees are defined so that no one       is misclassified as an independent contractor, strengthening       remedies and enforcement for employees who are exercising       their rights, creating a mediation and arbitration process       for new unions, protecting against coercive captive audience       meetings, and streamlining the National Labor Relations       Board's procedures.        The PRO Act would take tangible steps to stem the tide of       continued violations of the rights of working people to       organize and would provide real consequences for those who       violate the rights of workers. We must restore fairness to       our economy so that workers no longer get a raw deal, and       strengthen the right of workers all over the country to       unionize and bargain for better working conditions. For these       reasons, we urge you to vote yes on the PRO Act. Thank you       for your consideration.            Sincerely,        BlueGreen Alliance, American Federation of Teachers,       International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers,       International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, League of       Conservation Voters, National Wildlife Federation, Natural       Resources Defense Council, Service Employees International       Union, Sierra Club, United Steelworkers Union, Utility       Workers Union of American.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with workers  and support this bill.
