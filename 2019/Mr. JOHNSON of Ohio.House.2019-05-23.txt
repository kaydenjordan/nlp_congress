 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 10- year anniversary of the end of Sri Lanka's decades-long civil war, a  conflict that is estimated to have left over 100,000 people dead.   Today, I wish I could also rise in celebration of a now-unified Sri  Lanka, where war crimes for this bloody conflict had been accounted for  and transitional justice had occurred; where land used by Sri Lanka's  military had been fully returned to its citizens and the government was  a true democracy, operating with transparency and representative of all  its people, regardless of ethnicity or religious beliefs. However, 10  years later, these essential rights have yet to be fully recognized.   Mr. Speaker, while it is true that the Sirisena government has made  some progress towards fulfilling its commitments at the U.N. Human  Rights Council, I rise to urge the Sri Lankan Government to make  meaningful progress on all fronts to restore democratic principles for  all Sri Lankans and ensure the country can move forward as a unified,  prosperous nation.                            ____________________
