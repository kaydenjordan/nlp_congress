 Mr. Speaker, we are here to honor Congressman  John Robert Lewis, our hero, our colleague, our brother, our friend.   Having known John for 52 years, I can tell you honestly that even in  his humanity, he lived his life in the image of Jesus.   John was a voice of the voiceless--African Americans, for women, for  LGBTQ people, for the least and the left out, for anyone mistreated by  society.   His unwavering sense of right and wrong was a North Star for this  Nation, which is why we called him the conscience of the Congress.   People as good as John don't come our way very often. Despite all of  the accolades and recognition he received, John remained humble,  unfailingly kind, and always fueled the capacity of people to be  better, despite their past transgressions.   Where would America be today if it were not for John Lewis? Without  his activism, without his courage, without his perseverance for voting  rights, I doubt if I would be here today.   Thank you, John, for your lifetime of advocacy, for sacrifice of  friendship and counsel.   And thank you, God, for the life of John Robert Lewis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson).    Mr. Speaker, we make our living by what we  get. We make a life by what we give. John Lewis certainly made a life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    George Washington Carver once said: How far  you go in life depends on your being tender with the young,  compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and  tolerant of the weak and strong, because someday in your life you will  have been all of these. That was our friend, John Lewis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Mr. Speaker, may I request the amount of time  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Mfume).    Mr. Speaker, it has been said that service is  the rent  [[Page H3677]]  we pay for the space we occupy on this Earth. John Lewis paid his rent,  and he paid it well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, as we come to the close of this  first hour of tribute to our friend and our colleague and our hero,  John Robert Lewis, I leave you with the words of Douglas Malloch, who  wrote:       The tree that never had to fight      For Sun and sky and air and light,      But stood out in the open plain      And always got its share of rain,      Never became a forest king      But lived and died a scrubby thing.      The man who never had to toil      To gain and farm his patch of soil,      Who never had to win his share      Of Sun and sky and light and air,      Never became a manly man      But lived and died as he began.      Good timber does not grow in ease;      The stronger wind, the stronger trees;      The further sky, the greater length;      The more the storm, the more the strength.      By Sun and cold, by rain and snow,      In trees and men, good timbers grow.      Where thickest lies the forest growth,      We find the patriarchs of both.      And they hold counsel with the stars      Whose broken branches show the scars      Of many winds and much of strife,      This is the common law of life.    John Robert Lewis was indeed good timber. God bless his soul. May he  rest in peace and in power.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
