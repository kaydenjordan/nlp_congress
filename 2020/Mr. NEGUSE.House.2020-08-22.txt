 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney for her  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to speak in strong support of the  Delivering for America Act.   I have been here on the floor listening to this debate, and I have  heard several of my Republican colleagues describe this as a  manufactured crisis. Tell that to my constituents.   Tell that to Kelsey, a small business owner in Loveland, Colorado,  who is worried about her ability to get packages delivered on time to  her customers because of delays at the Postal Service.   Manufactured crisis? Tell that to Marsha, my constituent in Boulder,  who depends on mail-order prescriptions, which this month took nearly 2  weeks to arrive.   This is not a manufactured crisis. There is a real crisis at the  Postal Service under this Postmaster General, and we, here in the  House, strive to fix it.   That is why I am a strong supporter of the bill that is before the  House today, ultimately to ensure that the current standards of the  Postal Service are protected and provide $25 billion in emergency  funding.   Let us get this done for the American people.                                time  1630
