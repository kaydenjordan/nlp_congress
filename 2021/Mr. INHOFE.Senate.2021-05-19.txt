 Mr. President, before the Senator from Texas leaves the  floor, I want to acknowledge that in Oklahoma, last Sunday, I was with  a group of people, and, independent of each other, they asked the same  question: Where is America, and what is happening over there right now?  Our best friend and most loyal ally in that part of the world, Israel,  is being hit by terrorists, and we are sitting back and not doing  anything. It is just not thinkable that that could happen.   I think one of the most meaningful things that I had not heard  before, stated this way, that the Senator from Texas stated was, if  Hamas were to stop the attacks on Israel, Israel would do nothing, but  if Israel were to stop responding, there would be no Israel left.   That is the situation we have there. It is something that is not  understandable. It is something that we are going to do everything we  can to reverse.   That is not why I am here on the floor, but I just wanted to mention  that                                   S. 1260    Mr. President, on this legislation that we are working on right now,  we have an amendment. Senator Shelby and I, jointly, have an amendment.   Now, we did this initially because I chaired the Senate Armed  Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee, and it is an  agreement that we had 10 years ago. We agreed on parity, that anything  that we do that is going to be defense-related is going to be equaled  by nondefense.   Now, that has been our pattern, Democrats and Republicans, for 10  years, but now the situation has changed, the way it is structured now  in this bill, so that there is nothing in there for defense.   Here we are in the most threatened position we have ever been in with  China. Yet the China bill is doing all these things with China, but it  is not doing anything in terms of the military that we are suffering  under right now.   We have to remember--a lot of people have forgotten this--that two  administrations ago, in the Obama administration, we had a situation  where, during the last 5 years--that would have been from 2010 to  2015--the President at that time, President Obama, had reduced the  budget for defense by 25 percent. During the same timeframe, China had  increased theirs by 83 percent.   Now, just look at that. That is what was happening. That was back in  2015, and now the situation is really getting worse because, since that  time, China has increased its capabilities in hypersonics and other  areas, so that they are actually ahead of us in many areas.   So what we want to do is just to be sure that, whatever product we  come out with, we end up having parity between defense spending and  nondefense spending. It is something we have been doing for a long  period of time.   So the threat has not improved over the last 3 years but has only  gotten worse. I think that any bill that really seeks to address the  threat from China--the whole threat from China--must also address  China's very real military and its broader military-civil fusion that  is taking place right now. That is why any response can't separate out  military and economic competition. It must be whole of government. And  this bill is only focused on economic competition, not military.   Our amendment, Shelby's amendment and mine, will make sure that any  increase in nondefense, discretionary spending will be matched by the  same level of increase to the defense spending. Now, this is not  something that is just Republican. This is something that was agreed  upon some 10 years ago by Democrats and Republicans. Yet that is not  what we are looking at with this. So this would merely be going back  and agreeing with what we all agreed to, Democrats and Republicans.   In fact, in this document right here--we often refer to this  document. This is the NDAA document that was put together, to remind my  fellow Members here, this was six Democrats and six Republicans, all  recognized in their skills in military planning, coming up with this  document. This was 2018. Yet, today, it is just as applicable as it was  back then. And that is what they talk about--what is necessary this  year to spend on military to try to keep some type of a parity with  China.   Now, this has to be our top priority. Our security underwrites  everything else we do as a nation. That is why America is viewed as the  leader of the free world. It can't be either one or the other. It has  got to be both.   The Chinese are competing against us in every area, and this bill  currently does nothing to bolster our national defense to confront this  threat or to leverage our military and intelligence community's  significant research and development expertise in this area. It doesn't  establish the sort of cooperation between our defense and commercial  sectors on technology and technological development that we need.   China isn't just investing in technology, manufacturing, and  research; they are also investing in military. They are putting more  money into modernizing their military than ever before. China is on a  modernization sprint. They have been channeling money into building  weapons that we don't even have yet, like hypersonics.   I was embarrassed about a year ago when China came out and in China,  in their parade, they were displaying hypersonics, things we don't even  have yet. That didn't used to be that way. It used to be, following the  Second World War, that we always kept ahead at that time. We recognized  that there was a risk there and that the risk was something we had to  meet.   So they are on track to dominate in new capabilities like artificial  intelligence and hypersonics and other areas. So, meanwhile, we are  crawling forward because we aren't giving our military the resources  they need to stay competitive with China.   We know what that looks like. It is at least 3 to 5 percent in real  growth. Now, that is actually what is in this document right now. They  have updated this to show that right now we should, in order to stay  even with China, be upgrading somewhere between 3 and 5 percent, this  year, in this budget. And we are reducing the amount. It doesn't even  meet the cost of living.   So in the military advantage--that is what we use to deter China from  moving from economic aggression to military aggression--we have already  lost our edge in some areas. So, to maintain our military advantage, it  is going to take investment, but President Biden is not willing to make  the investment  [[Page S2775]]  we need. He is proposing to cut our defense budget, and that doesn't  even keep pace with inflation.   So, meanwhile, he is proposing to increase all other spending almost  20 percent, and in this bill here it spends as much on microchips for  the auto industry as it does on microelectronics for our national  defense. Can you believe that?   If we don't invest in our military deterrent, it is hard to see how  any of our other efforts--diplomacy, innovation, economic growth--will  succeed either.   So we will continue to work in a bipartisan fashion to address these  needs. I really believe that this should be the first amendment to come  up. I don't know. I am not in charge of that. But it should be. It is  one that should be easy to pass because it was agreed to 10 years ago-- that we didn't need to be in a position where we are not keeping up  with China.   So our amendment does one simple thing. It is parity. It says any  change that you make in the nondefense spending you have to have in  defense spending at the same time. I believe that should happen. It  should take place. I am hoping that we will have an opportunity to vote  on that tomorrow.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, it's my honor to recognize Roger  Beverage, a distinguished Oklahoman and dear friend, who recently  retired from his role as president and chief executive officer of the  Oklahoma Bankers Association. While Roger is a native of Plattsmouth,  NE, he has called Oklahoma home for decades. He began his career as a  trial lawyer, where he transitioned to a leading role with the Nebraska  Bankers Association and later as the director of the Nebraska  Department of Banking and Finance. For the past 33 years, Roger has led  the Oklahoma Bankers Association. He devoted much of his life to  advocating for the banking community across Oklahoma and Washington,  DC. There is no question his tireless work has left a lasting impact on  our State. While it is sad to see him retire, I have great confidence  that his successor and son, Adrian, will carry forward the influential  legacy of his father in the years ahead.                            ____________________
