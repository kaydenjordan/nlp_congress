 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 4986, the RAY BAUM'S Act.  This bill is the product of extensive bipartisan collaboration. After  exhaustive negotiations, we were able to reach a deal that includes  bills introduced by Democrats and Republicans in both the House and in  the Senate. That does not happen often, and I would like to thank my  colleagues for working with me so closely.   This bill is a real tribute to its namesake, Ray Baum. Ray had a  passion for telecommunications policy and a special place in his heart  for broadcasting. Ray was also an eternal optimist. He never faltered  in his belief that we could find a way to work together to find a  solution, and he was right.   We were able to incorporate proposals from Members on both sides of  the aisle, just the way Ray would have liked it, and we were able to  produce this legislation that will reauthorize the FCC for the first  time in 28 years.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to briefly mention some aspects of this  bill that I am most proud of. First, we were able to include the SANDy  Act, which is named to honor those affected by Superstorm Sandy, a  storm that ripped through the Northeast, including my district, over 5  years ago. During that  [[Page H1410]]  superstorm, we saw firsthand how important communications were for  survival. From television and radio broadcasters to wireless providers  and cable networks, each played its own role in making sure people knew  how to find help, look for loved ones, and stay out of harm's way.                                time  1445    I used the lessons we learned from Sandy in writing this legislation.  When this bill is signed into law, our networks will be stronger, more  resilient, and more capable to serve in an emergency.   This FCC reauthorization bill also includes the Viewer Protection  Act. I introduced the Viewer Protection Act to make sure no viewer  loses signal as a result of the FCC's incentive auction. Access to  local information has become even more important as the number of  natural disasters has increased over the past few years.   Not only does this bill help ensure consumers' broadcast stations  don't go dark, as part of this bipartisan, bicameral deal, we have  agreed to provide $50 million in funding to help educate consumers  about the transition. This funding is critical to make sure that people  have access to information about how to get their televisions to work.   My colleagues will discuss other important aspects of this deal. But  before they do, I would like to point out two important provisions that  we included as part of the reauthorization. First, we included a  provision that makes the FCC's inspector general independent of the  Commission's chairman. The IG is currently conducting a number of  critical investigations, including one into whether the chairman of the  agency has been improperly favoring Sinclair Broadcast Group. But under  current law, these investigations are being conducted under a cloud-- the very chairman who is under investigation can obstruct the review by  firing the inspector general or his or her staff at any time. So by  passing this bill, we are ensuring that these important investigations  can conclude without any interference.   Finally, I do not normally support unnecessarily cutting the budget  of our agencies. But in this case, I would like to thank my colleagues  for agreeing to limit this cut to the length of this administration.  The current leadership of the FCC, in my opinion, has proven that it  cannot be trusted to serve the public interest. Most notably, the  agency has ignored its statutory duty and the call of the American  people by destroying our net neutrality protections. Net neutrality  safeguards our American values by empowering small businesses, creating  new jobs, and ensuring free speech online.   By limiting the resources that we provide for the next 3 years, this  reauthorization will limit this Commission's power, in my opinion, to  do more harm.   For these reasons and many more, I urge my colleagues to support the  bipartisan and bicameral agreement embodied by the RAY BAUM'S Act.   I would like to also thank the Democratic committee staff--David  Goldman, Gerald Leverich, and Dan Miller--for all of their hard work in  getting this bill to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle), who is the ranking member of the  Communications and Technology Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. Loebsack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to say, again, that  this bill is a bipartisan bill. There has been a lot of work done on  both sides of the aisle. I appreciate the fact that we are able to  accomplish this and also include a lot of initiatives from Members on  both sides of the aisle. And, again, as a tribute to Ray Baum and all  that he did for us over the many years, I am proud to say that we  enthusiastically support the bill and urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
