 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for yielding me  time, and I rise in strong support of this resolution condemning the  terror attacks in the United Kingdom.   Mr. Speaker, the senseless acts of terror that took place in  Manchester and London are stark reminders of the threat our allies and  our Nation face together. These horrific attacks require strong and  coordinated response to not only bring the perpetrators and their  enablers to justice but also to combat global terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, Congress stands ready to support our colleagues in  Parliament with any assistance necessary. The special relationship that  bonds our two nations and peoples is unlike any other relationship that  we enjoy.   I am reminded of the events 73 years ago today when the United States  stood with Great Britain to execute the largest amphibious landing ever  assembled in order to liberate Europe. Our task in fighting terrorism  is no less daunting.   I appreciate the efforts here today by the House to condemn these  acts of terror and reaffirm our unwavering support for the special  relationship that we enjoy with the United Kingdom.
