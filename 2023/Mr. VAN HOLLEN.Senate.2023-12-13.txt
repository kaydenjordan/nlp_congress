 Madam President, with regards to the motion to waive  the point of order against the FISA section 702 provision in the  conference report, I share the sponsor's concerns on the potential  expiration of section 702 authorities, which are critical to foreign  intelligence collection efforts and protecting the homeland. However, I  am also deeply concerned that Section 7902 of the NDAA extends section  702 authorities without much-needed reforms to better protect the civil  liberties of Americans.   Despite the fact that surveillance under this section is supposed to  be limited to certain foreign nationals abroad, a FISA Court opinion  released in July 2023 stated that the FBI conducted approximately  40,000-50,000 warrantless ``back door'' search queries of section 702  communications data targeting U.S. persons per quarter in 2022. I  support the FBI's initiative to voluntarily adopt stricter internal  compliance rules to address this problem, but the administration and  Congress must work together to do more to balance the need for  intelligence collection and the protection of civil rights.   Due to the FISA Court's certification process, the administration has  acknowledged that, even in the absence of a formal 4-month extension,  the government is able to conduct surveillance authorized under section  702 until April 11, 2024. I also understand that a formal extension of  FISA authorities through April 2024, would effectively reset the clock  and allow the administration to obtain a fresh certification from the  FISA Court, thereby effectively extending the authority for an  additional 12 months beyond the 4-month extension. That would only  further delay our opportunity to review the program and propose  necessary reforms. For the record, I would have supported an  alternative that extended the formal authorization through April 2024,  so long as it would have prevented the administration from obtaining a  fresh certification to extend the program for another year after that.  That alternative is not, however, before the Senate. The bottom line is  that I agree that the section 702 program is necessary for our national  security, but I also think it needs to be reviewed and reformed.   We should not short-circuit the robust, bipartisan discussions in  Congress on how to reform this authority with a lengthy extension. I am  voting against this motion to waive the point of order so we can pair  the extension of section 702 surveillance programs with a serious and  targeted reform effort that maintains critical national security  capabilities in a manner consistent with constitutionally protected  rights.    Madam President, I rise today to honor John  Noel, a man who has been instrumental in preserving Maryland's  historical sites at the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical  Park for over two decades. Throughout his tenure, he has established a  reputation as a dedicated leader and guardian of Maryland's treasured  landscapes.   Since assuming the role of deputy superintendent in 2014, Mr. Noel  has been vital to the C&O Canal's mission. He has ensured that the  Park's over 5 million annual visitors experience a page of history as  they walk through its grounds. Mr. Noel's charge at the C&O Canal-- overseeing the Park's maintenance, operations, and educational  programming--has touched the lives of many. His work, in collaboration  with his team, spans the Park's impressive 184.5-mile stretch.   Mr. Noel's leadership in preserving the history of the C&O Canal is  truly commendable. For nearly 100 years, the canal was a lifeline for  communities along the Potomac River, transporting coal, lumber, and  agricultural products to market. His journey at the National Park  Service has had a profound impact, shaping not only the terrain of the  park but also the hearts of all who had the pleasure of working  alongside him.   Mr. Noel's footprints along the C&O Canal and his impact will  continue to be remembered by all and serve as a source of strength.  Maryland's historical sites will continue to be honored and preserved  because of Mr. Noel's leadership, and I ask my colleagues to join me in  congratulating him and wishing him a well-earned, enjoyable, and  fulfilling retirement.                            ____________________
