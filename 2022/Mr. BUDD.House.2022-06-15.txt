 Mr. Speaker, in the month of June, I asked a poll question  on one of my telephone town halls. I asked: Has your family noticed a  sharp rise in prices? And 94 percent of them said: Yes. The crazy part  of this is that I am not talking about this June, I am talking about  last June.   The average family will be spending $5,200 more this year because of  Joe Biden's inflation. We are not debating solutions to this crisis  today, we are debating economic justice. But for most Americans, the  most economically just thing that we can do right now is to lower gas  prices for everyone, and to help seniors on fixed incomes afford their  groceries.   This crisis is real. It is not transitory. It is not a so-called  high-class problem. It is a tax and a burden on every citizen in our  country. And as long as the Democrat majority in this Congress remains  plagued by denial and distraction, the harder life will become for  American families.
