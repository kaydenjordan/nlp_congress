 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  a historical moment for the great State of Illinois. Two hundred years  ago today, in this very building, legislation was passed by the 15th  Congress and later signed by President James Monroe which allowed the  people of the Illinois territory to proceed with statehood.   This legislation paved the way for representatives in the territory  to form a convention from which a State government would later emerge.  At the time, in 1818, only 11 counties existed in the territory that  could send representatives to the convention to draft governing  documents.   Three of these 11 counties are within my congressional district. I  have often said how humble I am to represent a part of Illinois that  President Lincoln represented when he served in this Chamber, but I am  also immensely proud to represent the area that pioneered Illinois'  statehood.   In December of this year, Illinois will celebrate its bicentennial as  a State in our Union. I have called Illinois home for over 40 years,  and I am honored to stand here today and recognize the history that was  made in this building 200 years ago today.                            ____________________
