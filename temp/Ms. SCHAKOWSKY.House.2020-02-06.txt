 Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn the Trump  administration's cuts to Medicaid as yet another broken promise from  this President.   On May 7, 2015, then-candidate Trump tweeted: ``I was the first and  only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.'' He even said that these programs  were a part of what makes America great.   The President was right. Medicaid is a pillar of our society. Mr.  Speaker, 3.26 million people in my home State of Illinois receive their  healthcare through Medicaid. Since Illinois expanded Medicaid in 2013,  our uninsured rate has been cut nearly in half. One study found that  expanded Medicaid coverage reduced mortality in Illinois by 6 percent.   Mr. Speaker, 40 percent of kids in my State can see a doctor when  they are sick and get vaccinations and screenings that they need only  because of Medicaid, and over 275,000 Illinois seniors and almost  400,000 people with disabilities rely on Medicaid. In fact, Medicaid  pays for over half of all long-term services and supports across the  United States.                                time  1500    Despite all this, the administration is gutting Medicaid funding and  allowing States to cut benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voicing our  opposition to the Trump administration by voting ``yes'' on this  resolution. Medicaid matters, and we will protect your care.

Well, Mr. President--you were right: Medicaid is a pillar of our  society.   3.26 million people in my home state of Illinois receive their health  care through Medicaid.  [[Page H878]]    Since Illinois expanded Medicaid in 2013, our uninsured rate has been  nearly cut in half.   One study found that expanding Medicaid coverage reduced mortality by  6 percent.   40 percent of kids in my state can see a doctor when they are sick  and get the vaccinations and screenings they need to stay healthy only  because of Medicaid.   Over 275,000 of Illinois' seniors and almost 400,000 people with  disabilities rely on Medicaid to live independently, including nursing  home care and services that help them live at home.   In fact, Medicaid pays for over half of all longterm services and  supports a cross the United States.   Despite all this, the Administration is gutting Medicaid funding and  allowing states to cut benefits that people need to survive.   Why?   Maybe because they need to pay for the GOP Tax Scam, which created a  $1.5 trillion deficit in tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.   And because they want to continue their legacy of punishing low- income people and the most vulnerable among us.   Medicaid is critical to the health and financial security of people  across the United States.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting YES on this resolution so  that we can send a clear message: Medicaid matters, and we will Protect  Your Care.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in favor of the amendment and  also the underlying bill.   As a proud union member myself of Workers United, SEIU, I see the  importance of sticking with my union. Even though I am no longer active  on the job, I want to pay my dues.   Unions have brought us the middle class; they brought us the weekend;  they brought us the benefits that ordinary people have in order to have  a living wage and a successful life.   I also want to say that the amendment clarifies that the ABC test  included in the PRO Act does not preempt any State law governing the  wages, worker hours, et cetera, and so it is a very good amendment.   But I want to say, for three decades, we have seen corporations  trying to undermine workers' rights to gather together for their own  benefit. Finally, today, we are going to pass a bill that gives workers  those rights.
