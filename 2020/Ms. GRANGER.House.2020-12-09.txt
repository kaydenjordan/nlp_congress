 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8900, a  continuing resolution that will fund the government through December  18.   Members of the Appropriations Committee have been negotiating night  and day for weeks to reach agreement on a full-year appropriations  bill. At the same time, House and Senate leaders continue to discuss a  coronavirus relief package with the administration. It is my hope that  we can complete both of these important pieces of legislation as soon  as possible.   There is so much at stake: our national security, the health and  welfare of millions of Americans, and our economic recovery. Passing  this 1-week CR is simply a stopgap measure. I expect we will be back on  the floor next week to complete the year's work.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this continuing  resolution so that the Senate can pass it and send it to the President  for signature. Then, we must immediately get back to the important work  the American people expect us to finish.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I close, I want to take a minute to congratulate  Congresswoman DeLauro for being named chairwoman of the full committee  next Congress. I look forward to working with her in the coming years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill before  us today, and I yield back the balance of my time.
