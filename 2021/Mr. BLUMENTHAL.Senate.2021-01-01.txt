 Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart  to pay tribute to Edwin ``Ed'' Gomes, an exemplary public servant,  community leader, and advocate for equality and justice. Sadly, Ed  passed away on December 22, 2020, at the age of 84. He will be  remembered for his outstanding legacy of dedication to Connecticut as a  statesman and an activist.   Ed began his impressive career on behalf of our country in the U.S.  Army, serving for 5 years. A dedicated steelworkers' union  representative, he was first elected to the Bridgeport City Council in  1983. Throughout his decades on the council, Ed quickly earned the  respect of constituents and colleagues, alike.   In 2004, Ed was elected to the Connecticut Senate, where he served  for a total of 12 years. As State senator, Ed fought tirelessly for the  people of Connecticut, always going the extra mile to help his  constituents. He knew that government could instill positive change for  working families and constantly advocated on their behalf.   Committed to social reform and civil rights, Ed participated in the  March on Washington in 1963. His activism touched countless lives  across our State and was an inspiration for all of us. Known for his  passionate efforts to help others and strong principles, Ed was also  respected across the aisle and warmly recognized for his positive  spirit. Those who had the chance to work with him know well his  respected, straightforward style and readiness to bolster advocacy by  pulling from his personal experiences.   I had the privilege of attending the annual L'Ambiance memorial  ceremony, recognizing those workers who died in a horrific construction  accident, with Ed, who unstintingly continued his advocacy for  workplace safety. There was always an opportunity to do more and raise  greater awareness of issues facing Connecticut's working families. His  dedication to fighting injustice was a model across our State, and he  never hesitated to initiate change from the frontlines. I can attest  firsthand to Ed's unfailing attitude, which was equal parts joy and  determination. His commitment to bettering our State and loyalty to his  friends and family have left a lasting, positive mark on Connecticut's  legacy.   My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Ed's family  during this difficult time. May their many wonderful memories of Ed  provide them solace and comfort.                            ____________________
