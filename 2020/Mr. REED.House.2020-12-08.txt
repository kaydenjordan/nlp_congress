 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 578, the ALS Disability  Insurance Access Act of 2019.   As my colleague, Mr. Larson, has indicated, this legislation will  provide immediate access to disability insurance benefits for  individuals suffering from ALS, otherwise known as Lou Gehrig's  disease, by eliminating the 5-month waiting period for disability  insurance benefits.   Madam Speaker, it is only fair that we remove this waiting period to  ensure everyone with this disease will have immediate access to the  benefits they have earned.   It is only fair, also, that we help great Americans like a family in  our  [[Page H6989]]  district, the Palmesano family, Mike and Suzy, who are close, personal  friends of mine, who I have gotten to know over the years when their  son Mick was recently diagnosed with rapid progression ALS.   The Palmesano family has been strong advocates for this cause, and I  couldn't be prouder of their efforts. Their bravery in the face of  adversity represents hundreds of families in our district and thousands  of families across the country struggling with this terrible disease  day in and day out.   The disability insurance waiting period was designed to make sure a  condition wasn't temporary before benefits were paid, not to prevent  great Americans, like Mick and his family and others, from receiving  disability benefits.   The data, Madam Speaker, is clear. On average, ALS patients live 3 to  5 years. Once ALS starts, it almost always progresses, eventually  taking away the ability to walk, dress, write, speak, swallow, and  breathe.   Given the severity of ALS and that there is no current cure, people  diagnosed with this disease know this is not a temporary condition.  That is why ALS is one of two conditions that has an exemption to the  24-month waiting period for Medicare.   Again, that same logic should apply to waiving the waiting period for  disability insurance.   This legislation is supported by the ALS Association, I AM ALS, Les  Turner ALS Foundation, Muscular Dystrophy Association, Team Gleason,  and the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus.   I look forward to voting for this legislation, because we must stand  together and care for those struggling with ALS and also their families  as they battle this debilitating disease.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in  supporting this great piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our great whip, to express his thoughts on  this important bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. King), the dean of the New York delegation who has had a long  history of support for causes such as this.    Madam Speaker, at this time, I have no other speakers  seeking time, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, as we close this debate, I applaud my  colleague from Connecticut who is a true, good friend, Mr. Larson, and  I mean that from the bottom of my heart.   I am just proud to stand in full support of this commonsense  legislation that will make a difference, Madam Speaker, in the lives of  so many Americans suffering from ALS. I know it will make a difference  for Mick Palmesano. I know it will help alleviate and bring some  comfort to the entire Palmesano family in our home district of New  York.   But most importantly, I know we demonstrated to the folks in America  that Congress can work, that Democrats and Republicans can come  together on an important issue like this and pass important legislation  that will improve the lives of Americans.   Last week, the Senate overwhelmingly passed this legislation, Madam  Speaker. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in support of this fine  legislation so we can get it to the President's desk for signature  without delay.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the HOSPICE bill,  which is a part of the overall BENES Act we are debating today. And I  am proud to support the HOSPICE bill that I introduced and authored  with my good friend,   Jimmy Panetta, from California.   Madam Speaker, I can tell you, when loved ones, like my mother,  became sick, it is common to be left feeling helpless and for families  not having the resources to deal with that terrible situation. But I  thank God every day we were able to support my mother with a wonderful  team, not only of our family but of our hospice care providers. They  gave her, and they gave us, the needed companionship and resources to  have some sense of normalcy at the end of her illness. That experience  reaffirmed the critical importance of the quality-of-life care that  hospice care represents.   Madam Speaker, that is why I am a hospice volunteer in my personal  time here in Washington, D.C. I am a strong advocate for hospice care  across America.   However, while most hospice employees and volunteers and  compassionate caregivers are good, hardworking individuals, there are  some who neglect and potentially even abuse patients in that situation.  We must hold those bad actors accountable. We must demand additional  oversight of hospice providers. We must educate providers with  additional training to ensure patients receive the best and most proper  level of care they deserve.   We are confident this legislation would do just that by giving HHS  the tools it needs to penalize those that provide poor quality care.  Our legislation would also improve provider transparency by requiring  States to maintain a toll-free hotline where abuse and neglect can be  reported.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand in support of this legislation.  More importantly, I am proud to be a hospice volunteer myself, and I am  proud to stand with the hospice community that is giving so much great  quality care to those that need it most in their most precious time  that they have left.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and the  underlying legislation upon which it rides.
