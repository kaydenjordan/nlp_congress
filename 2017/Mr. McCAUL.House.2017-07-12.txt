 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden for including my  bill, the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity, or RACE, for  Children Act, in this FDA reauthorization. I introduced the bill with  my colleague, Mr. Butterfield, to strengthen the FDA's ability to  require pediatric studies of cancer drugs during development.   Despite current programs in place to require similar studies, they  have never been undertaken for cancer drugs. This bill will require a  study into any cancer drug that uses ``molecular targeting,'' which  attacks specific cancer cells rather than the part of the body where  the cancer resides. By requiring these studies, doctors can determine  whether a drug is safe and effective in children and, ultimately,  provide accurate labeling for pediatric use.   I founded the Childhood Cancer Caucus when I first entered Congress  to give a voice to the 15,000 children diagnosed with cancer every year  and the hundreds of thousands of survivors who face a lifetime of  medical challenges. Passing this bill will provide these children  access to the treatments they deserve.   I thank all those involved for their tireless work in bringing this  bill to the House floor. As my good friend, little Sadie Keller, who is  battling leukemia as I speak, once said: ``Together, we can make a  difference.''   To Sadie and all the children who are in the fight of their lives, I  want you to know that today we are making a difference.
