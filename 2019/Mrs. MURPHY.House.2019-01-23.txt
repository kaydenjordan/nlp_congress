 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  spiritual leader in my central Florida community, Dr. Ronald Merthie,  who recently passed away.   A proud son of Seminole County, Dr. Merthie attended what is now  known as Crooms Academy of Information Technology, where he was elected  class president. He went to Texas Southern University on an athletic  scholarship and, upon graduation, returned home to become an educator.   Dr. Merthie struggled with substance abuse for a period of time, but  he found strength through faith, overcoming personal hardship and  becoming a pillar of his community.   Dr. Merthie's life was filled with action and achievement. He  established the New Life Word Center Church, offered spiritual guidance  on a weekly broadcast, and founded a K-12 school.   It was Dr. King who said, ``Life's most persistent and urgent  question is, `What are you doing for others?' '' Dr. Merthie devoted  his life to serving others, and he will be deeply missed.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this  exceptional man and offer our condolences to his family and to all of  those whose lives he touched.                            ____________________
