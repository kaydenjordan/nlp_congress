 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, at this time last week, the Nation  did not know whom President Trump would be nominating to the Supreme  Court, but, amazingly, we did know what kinds of false attacks the far  left would deploy against whoever it was.   Democrats and special interests have been telling the country for 45  years--45 years--that every Supreme Court vacancy under a Republican  President was going to bring about the apocalypse. John Paul Stevens,  they said, was anti-woman. David Souter, they said, wanted to hurt  vulnerable people. John Roberts was out to get health insurance.   And wouldn't you know, the President had barely finished saying Judge  Amy Coney Barrett's name before the same old attacks began rolling in.  Our 77-year-old male former Vice President and our 69-year-old male  Senate Democratic leader have tried to inform  [[Page S6010]]  American women that this 48-year-old working mom wants to roll back her  own rights as a woman--roll back her own rights as a woman.   Democrats have tried to fearmonger around a 4-year-old academic paper  that reinforced one unfair penalty in ObamaCare, which Congress, by the  way, already eliminated 3 years ago.   As an aside, if the American people are interested in which Senators  are serious about protecting Americans with preexisting conditions,  they can simply look up the vote Senators took last night--just last  night. Every single Democrat voted against legislation from Senator  Tillis that would have cemented protections for these vulnerable  Americans.   Democrats voted to block protections for preexisting conditions just  like they voted to block hundreds of billions of dollars for  coronavirus relief and just like they voted to block police reform--and  a thousand other things they tell Americans they support but vote  against to block bipartisan progress.   So here is another one of the made-up attacks: Democrats are  demanding that Judge Barrett commit in advance--in advance--to recuse  herself from entire categories of cases for no reason. This is another  totally invented standard. Nobody has ever suggested that Supreme Court  Justices should categorically sit on the sidelines until the President  who nominated them has left office. What an absurd suggestion.   Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were confirmed during President  Clinton's very first term. Justices Sotomayor and Kagan were confirmed  during President Obama's first term. All four of these Justices went on  to participate in election-related proceedings while the President who  had nominated them was on the ballot.   Justices Breyer and Ginsburg participated actively in Clinton v.  Jones and other matters connected to President Clinton's eventual  impeachment. In fact, they urged and attempted to get the Supreme Court  even more involved.   This is a sideshow--a sideshow. If Judge Barrett is confirmed, she  will swear an oath. She will have a lifetime appointment. Nobody  seriously is suggesting she lacks any bit of the integrity which  everyone trusted Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor,  Justice Kagan, and countless others to exercise. In fact, her integrity  and independence are precisely what Judge Barrett's peers across the  political spectrum go out of their way to applaud.   Judge Barrett has no obligation to make any of the bizarre--bizarre-- prejudgments that our Democratic colleagues are demanding. Like I said,  much of the script has been entirely predictable.   I will tell you one thing I did not predict. I honestly did not  expect the Democratic leader to come to the Senate floor and say that  concerns about anti-religious discrimination are ``manufactured  hysterics.'' I didn't expect that.   I do not expect we will hear the leader of the Democratic conference  stand on the Senate floor and say that America's freedom of religion is  ``an imaginary issue.''   The Democratic leader claimed indignantly that his fellow Democrats  would never--never--make an issue out of a nominee's personal religious  beliefs. He took great offense that such a thing would even be  suggested.   But the whole country knows that, 3 years ago, when the Judiciary  Committee was considering this very nominee--this one--for her current  position, Senate Democrats did precisely that, exactly that. The senior  Senator from California literally implied in front of the entire  country that Judge Barrett was too Catholic--too Catholic--to be a  judge. Here was the quote: ``The dogma lives loudly within you,'' she  said. ``And that's of concern.''    The senior Senator from Illinois asked Judge Barrett in the official  record--listen to this--``Do you consider yourself an `orthodox  Catholic?' ''   The junior Senator from Hawaii felt compelled to tell the nominee-- listen to this--``You would be a Catholic judge.'' ``You would be a  Catholic judge.''   No one imagined these exchanges, but they happened on video before  the entire Nation. Multiple sitting Senators fretted in an open hearing  that Judge Barrett's religious views created doubts about her fitness  to serve.   Outside the Senate, it was not imaginary when one faith group in  which Judge Barrett and her family participate reportedly came under  cyber attack a few days ago. Their membership directory was reportedly  hacked, just as Judge Barrett emerged as a frontrunner.   Nobody had to imagine the ominous articles from AP, Reuters, the  Washington Post, and POLITICO, all implying there was something  questionable--questionable--or problematic about Judge Barrett's faith  practices.   Nobody had to imagine POLITICO sending a contributing editor to snoop  around the church buildings and report what a youth group had written  on their whiteboard.   So, no, Americans don't have to imagine this elite disdain. All they  have to do is read it.   It is not just this one nominee. Nobody imagined it when the junior  Senator from Vermont accused a different nominee of hatred and  Islamophobia because he had previously expressed a personal view that  Christianity gets things right, which Islam gets wrong.   It is not imaginary when the junior Senator from California cast  aspersions on yet another nominee for--listen to this--belonging to the  Knights of Columbus. And another Democrat implied he should quit this  mainstream Catholic group if he wanted to hold public office. Quit the  Knights of Columbus if you want to hold public office? In America?   The Democratic leader says these are manufactured hysterics. He says  people who call this out are hysterical. Frankly, it would be better  for our country if that were true, but that is not the case.   Just yesterday, 24 hours after the Democratic leader swore that  Democrats would not make this an issue, the junior Senator from Hawaii  tried to say Judge Barrett's faith is ``irrelevant'' but immediately  proceeded to question ``whether her closely held views can be separated  from her ability to make objective, fair decisions.'' No one--no one-- should be deceived by these thinly veiled euphemisms.   This is the exact form that religious discrimination had taken in  America for decades--for decades--especially when it comes to public  service.   We do not often hear people say they simply dislike a particular  religion altogether. Thank goodness we are mostly past that kind of  bigotry. No, going all the way back to Jack Kennedy, the more common  accusation has been something a little more subtle--that people of deep  faith or certain faiths are incapable of being fair or objective; that  they are incapable of doing certain jobs well; that such Americans are  torn between divided loyalties and not to be trusted.   Here is what the left is trying to say: Oh, we have no problems--no  problems--with Judge Barrett's faith in an abstract sense. We just  think it disqualifies her from this promotion.   Madam President, that is the definition of discrimination.   About a century ago, openly anti-Catholic political cartoons pictured  the Pope or the Catholic Church as an octopus wrapping its tentacles  around the institutions of American Government. Thankfully those  displays are long gone, but the core attitude clearly is not.   Americans of faith are not imagining the increasingly hostile climate  that the political left and the media have spent literally years  sowing. And, no, there is no free pass, as some commentators have  suggested, because many prominent liberal voices or prominent Democrats  themselves identify as Catholic. You don't get a free pass just by  calling yourself a Catholic.   More than one-fifth of our country belongs to the same church as  Judge Barrett--one-fifth of our country. Tens and tens of millions of  Americans--all of them--like all Americans, must be free to live their  faiths in diverse and different ways without being barred--without  being barred--from public service. These kinds of aspersions do not  become any more acceptable if the call is coming from inside the house.   Sadly, none of these problems are imaginary. The American people's  concerns are not manufactured.   The Little Sisters of the Poor did not wake up thinking it would be  good fun if the Obama-Biden administration tried to force them to  violate their own  [[Page S6011]]  consciences. These nuns did not manufacture their lengthy legal battle  for the fun of it. It was the secularizing left that went on offense.   Churches all across America did not go looking for one of this  cycle's Democratic Presidential contenders to suggest places of  workshop should lose their tax exempt status if they preach or practice  traditional teaching. It was the secularizing left that went on  offense.   If parts of the elite American left have become this out of touch  with mainstream religious beliefs held by millions and millions of  their fellow citizens, it will take more than victim blaming to dig out  of it. They could start this week. They could start today.   They could commit to evaluating Judge Barrett on her credentials and  her qualifications, and they could stop gawking at deeply religious  Americans like they have encountered extraterrestrial life or bought a  ticket for a safari                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there are three bills at  the desk due for a second reading, en bloc.
