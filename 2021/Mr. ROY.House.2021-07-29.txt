 Mr. Speaker, I object.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I object.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H4271]]     Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object.    Mr. Speaker, today there have been a number of items that  people on our side have been concerned about with respect to the  Speaker's order with respect to masks.   We all understand the importance of safety and keeping people  healthy, but the orders that came out today put some concern into our  staff members about what they can choose to do and empowering and  putting our police in a tough spot of figuring out what to do to  enforce these orders.   So part of the question here is an important one, and we don't want  to head out into August with this hanging over the head of the police  and our staff. That is why I have been objecting and forcing some more  time.   At this point, I am going to go ahead and move on and withdraw my  reservation.
