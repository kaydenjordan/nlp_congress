 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the $1.2 trillion Transportation and Infrastructure bill  is 100 percent coupled, linked, dependent upon the $3.5 trillion  partisan reconciliation bill.   As our colleagues in the Democratic Party continue to remind us and  affirm, investing in our Nation's transportation and infrastructure is  a core function of government, and this bill is something I and many  other Republicans and Members have tried hard to support.   Unfortunately, the Democrat leadership has made it patently clear  that to pass this infrastructure bill, we must pass a completely  partisan $5 trillion budget reconciliation bill with the largest tax  hike and government expansion in the history of our Nation. That I  cannot support.                                time  2000
