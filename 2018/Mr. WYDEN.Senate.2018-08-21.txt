 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Broadband  Internet for Small Ports Act to help small ports access broadband loans  and grants, which will increase internet service in rural coastal  communities nationwide.   Nearly a third of Americans lack access to high-speed internet, and  there is a considerable digital divide between rural and urban America.  Rural communities must be brought up to speed so that all Americans can  compete online in a global economy.   In rural coastal areas people congregate near inland and small ports,  and these harbors act as hubs for commerce and tourism. This bill  recognizes the importance of small ports to their rural economies. This  bill will help small ports nationwide get Federal loans and grants and  improve their broadband coverage, thereby enabling working-waterfronts  to order inventory and coordinate deliveries, access real-time weather  updates, and grow economically.   Broadband loan and grant applications submitted to the Department of  Agriculture's Rural Utility Service are assigned different levels of  priority before they are awarded. This bill recognizes the importance  of small ports, and elevates the priority of applications seeking to  boost internet capacity. This bill states that broadband loan and grant  applications from small ports will be considered equal in priority to  applications that are developed with the participation of a non-profit  or philanthropic organization.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3360         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
