 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 6 weeks ago, I stood here as the Senate  prepared to begin deliberating historic conservation legislation--the  Great American Outdoors Act. I introduced this legislation with Senator  Manchin, of West Virginia, along with so many other bipartisan  champions for the outdoors and our public lands. Senators Daines,  Portman, Warner, Alexander, King, Cantwell, Burr, and Heinrich are just  a few of the champions who helped to shepherd this historic legislation  through this Chamber. I remarked on that day that it was not often the  Senate had a chance to make history, but, indeed, history we made.   The Senate came together in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion and  passed the Great American Outdoors Act 73 to 25, and just moments ago,  the U.S. House of Representatives joined us in making history by  passing the Great American Outdoors Act with a vote of 310 to 107.   This legislation is headed today to the desk of the President of the  United States for his signature. The President has already supported  the bill, noting the nature of this historic bill and the huge  conservation victory that it is.   In the weeks since Senate passage, I have traveled all over the great  State of Colorado and have visited with land management officials,  professionals, stakeholders, and constituents to discuss what the Great  American Outdoors Act will really mean on the ground on a personal,  local level for Colorado and Colorado's public lands. I would like to  share some of those stories with you today.   Here we have a picture of an amphitheater that is outside of the  Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. If you would just go a  little bit further to the right, you would actually be in the canyon.  [[Page S4402]]    This is an amphitheater that was built, basically, in the 1960s. The  park itself is now about 20 years old. It had over 430,000 people visit  it last year. It has a deferred maintenance backlog of $7.7 million,  and this South Rim Amphitheater facility is part of that backlog. It is  currently being used, but it needs significant upgrades. If you  actually sat on one of those benches, you probably wouldn't be able to  sit anywhere else for quite a long time because of the splinters and  the gouges that you would receive from the shards of wood that are on  those benches, and there are electrical outlets that are popping up  from an old projection system.   This is supposed to be used for education and educational  opportunities. With the right improvements, they will be able to  restore this and get it back to its original purpose. New park benches  and electrical work are among just a bit of this amphitheater's needs-- a $200,000 deferred maintenance project alone, this site for education  for experiential learning. Within the rest of the park, there are  millions more in maintenance projects like this one that need to be  performed and carried out.   Our lands are busy. People are loving them. This is one example, and  it is one example of a project that will be completed thanks to the  Great American Outdoors Act. Yet it is not just national parks that  have maintenance needs.   Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue joined me in Colorado in mid- June, and we toured the Mizpah Campground, which is in the Arapahoe and  Roosevelt National Forests, that has been closed for a decade. This is  a beautiful river, and the campground is back here. There is only one  problem: There is no bridge. This river wiped out the culvert and the  bridge a decade ago. This is a campground without access because, 10  years ago--a decade ago--a flood came through--high water came  through--and wiped out the access. You can't even use this public  facility because of a decades-long maintenance backlog at this facility  alone.   The Great American Outdoors Act will provide line-of-sight funding  for projects like these, which will no longer have to compete for a  small pool of funding with every other national forest in the country.   When I talk to these professionals--when I talk to the forest rangers  and the park superintendents--they talk about how they are able to  accomplish building structures in their parks, how they are able to  build campgrounds in their parks, and how they are able to keep up with  restroom facilities, but they have had no line-of-sight funding for  additional help down the road. This means that, as the facilities age,  they may just have to be closed or, in this case, as access gets wiped  out, you will just never regain that access. What a loss to the  American people that is, but what a benefit to the American people the  Great American Outdoors Act will become.   It is not just the national parks or the national forests or the  Bureau of Land Management that will benefit from the Great American  Outdoors Act. This is a picture of the Runyon Sports Complex in Pueblo,  CO. This area has a number of ballparks from little leagues to adult  leagues. In fact, they just had their first pitch of the season last  week--a day that I was actually at the Runyon Sports Complex in Pueblo,  CO, to kick off a tournament to celebrate the beginning of a season  that had been much delayed thanks to COVID-19.   This area saw people like Pee Wee Reese play baseball and Babe Ruth  visit this same area to play baseball. Now Coloradans of every  generation are able to go to the Runyon Sports Complex and enjoy it. It  has become a regional draw to help benefit the city economically and to  teach kids about sports and teamwork. That is what this means.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund, yes, helps forests and parks,  but 40 percent of the Land and Water Conservation Fund's funding is  dedicated to projects at the State and local levels. If you grew up on  the Front Range of Colorado and played baseball, the odds are good that  you will have spent some time on the field at Runyon or at any other  number of places that have been funded by a Land and Water Conservation  Fund project. Runyon has received over $100,000 in LWCF funding over  the years, and the complex continues to be a vital part of the  community today.   The LWCF is not just about our public lands; it is about your local  ballpark, about your local swimming pool, about playground facilities,  and urban parks that otherwise wouldn't give minority communities  access to recreation. That is what it is about.   Just up the road from Runyon Field, in El Paso County, CO, and the  communities within them, they have benefited greatly from the LWCF. We  visited a project in El Paso County that received hundreds of thousands  of dollars. It is a county that has received $5 million in funding over  the years and has provided benefits for everything from building parks  to tennis courts and trails. The State has received over $2 million in  funding to improve the Cheyenne Mountain State Park facilities within  El Paso County, CO.   Local, regional, and State outdoor recreation projects will only  further benefit when the Great American Outdoors Act is signed into  law. With the Great American Outdoors Act, Congress is finally  fulfilling its commitment to fully and permanently fund the LWCF, which  will benefit every State in the Nation.   The passage of this historic legislation could not come at a more  critical time. Our economy has suffered during the coronavirus  pandemic, and stay-at-home orders have kept Americans cooped up indoors  for the last several months. Millions of people and families are facing  uncertain futures. Will school return in the fall? Will my business  survive this challenging time? Will I receive my next paycheck?   When the first waves of the virus hit and shutdown orders went into  place, some of Colorado's mountain towns and rural areas were the  hardest and first hit. Community restaurants closed; hotels emptied;  and their stores' doors were closed to visitors. These are challenging  times, no doubt, but one glimmer of hope will always be our public  lands and the great outdoors   This Nation does not have Republican or Democratic public lands. This  is not a partisan issue. Preserving and taking care of our public lands  provides a benefit to the entire country, and it will provide a benefit  for generations to come.   Yet, not only is this legislation about preserving and protecting our  lands, it is also about job creation and economic recovery--more hope  for the people of this country. Passing the Great American Outdoors Act  will create over 100,000 jobs by addressing the park maintenance  backlog alone. In my home State of Colorado, it will create thousands  of jobs across the State as the mission of the Great American Outdoors  Act is fulfilled. There will be more jobs created as the work begins to  address maintenance projects on other Federal lands. The Forest  Service, the Bureau of Land Management, our National Wildlife Refuges,  and the Bureau of Indian Education's schools all have needs that will  be addressed by this legislation. These will be important opportunities  to create jobs when the projects are finally and fully funded.   I mentioned this statistic quite a bit during the consideration of  the Great American Outdoors Act here in the Senate. For every $1  million we spend on the Land and Water Conservation Fund, it supports  between 16 and 30 jobs. That is a figure above and beyond the 100,000  jobs that we created by the parks' provisions of the legislation alone.  This is a bill that will put people to work. It is a bill that will put  people to work by building playgrounds, fixing trails, cleaning up  ballparks, and protecting our iconic landscapes for generations to  come.   This is a bill that reminds us that our communities and our shared,  public outdoor spaces are worth investing in. It is a bill that reminds  people that we have hope for America. It is a bill that reminds people  that your public lands are waiting for you and that Congress was able  to come together, during these trying times, in a bipartisan fashion  that was so strong and so great that you will be able to enjoy the  great American outdoors the way they were meant to be enjoyed.   I am pleased that the House of Representatives affirmed all of this  by passing the Great American Outdoors  [[Page S4403]]  Act today with such a strong, bipartisan vote. I thank my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers for their hard work and  dedication to passing this historic conservation legislation.   I look forward to the President's signing this bill in the days  ahead. I look forward to getting out into the great outdoors, and I  look forward to these lands as they continue to inspire the hopes and  dreams of kids and adults alike for generations to come.   I yield the floor.    Without objection, it is so ordered                            ____________________
