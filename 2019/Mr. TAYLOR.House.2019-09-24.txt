 Madam Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Baylor, Scott  & White The Heart Hospital for being named Physician Hospital of the  Year by Physician Hospitals of America.   Located in my hometown of Plano, Texas, The Heart Hospital ranks as  one of the top-performing cardiac surgical programs in the entire  country and provides Collin County with the highest level of cardiac  healthcare.   Since opening in 2007, The Heart Hospital has worked day in and day  out to save lives and ensure compassion to everyone who enters there.   Our community is proud to be the home of this state-of-the-art  facility and its many astounding healthcare providers and staff.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating The  Heart Hospital of Plano on their recent success and thanking them for  all their hard work.                            ____________________
