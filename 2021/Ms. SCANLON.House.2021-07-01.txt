 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share how the INVEST in  America Act, which we just passed, will benefit residents of my  district, as well as communities across the country.   Year after year, the U.S. Congress has failed to muster the political  will to properly fund American infrastructure. State and local  authorities don't have enough money to meet basic maintenance needs,  much less to make investments in modernization, expansion, or other  improvements.   Thankfully, the INVEST in America Act can change that. It provides  $715 billion to repair and improve our Nation's infrastructure, create  good-paying jobs, and lay the foundation for robust economic growth in  the 21st century.   I am proud to say that this package includes almost $21 million for  projects to help communities in my district, small businesses,  commuters, and residents. These projects include the redesign of  dangerous rail crossings, upgrades to commuter transit stations, bike  lanes, and safety improvements to areas like the Cobbs Creek Parkway,  which is the site of hundreds of accidents--many of them fatal.   We have more work to do to get an infrastructure package to President  Biden's desk and signed into law, but passing the INVEST in America Act  is an important step towards that goal.                            ____________________
