 Madam President, I rise today to urge this body to pass  H.R. 1773, the Rosie the Riveter Congressional Gold Medal Act. This  bill would honor the American women who joined the workforce in support  of the war effort during World War II.   Millions of women dedicated themselves to strengthening our Nation  and answered the call to action by joining the workforce and learning  new jobs. Many of these women built the vehicles, the weaponry, and the  ammunition that were critical to the war effort. Whether they worked on  assembly lines, addressed the troops' medical needs, or tended to ships  and farms, Rosies ensured the country continued functioning during the  war while often serving as the primary caretakers for their children.   These Rosie the Riveters rose to the challenge and set a powerful  example both to working women and for all Americans. Rosies not only  faced gender-based discrimination, but Rosies of color fought racial  discrimination, all while manufacturing planes, ships, tanks, weapons,  jeeps, and everything else that was needed to defeat the enemy in World  War II.   Today, their example continues to inspire generations to embody the  ``We can do it'' spirit. The Rosies are among our Nation's greatest  living heroines. They deserve recognition and formal commendation for  their service to our country while they are still with us.   The Rosies who are still alive are in their nineties, and we need to  honor them now. The House version of the Rosie the Riveter Gold Medal  Act passed a year ago on November 13, 2019, by unanimous consent and  with broad bipartisan cosponsorship. The Senate version, S. 892, which  I introduced last year, has 76 cosponsors, including 36 Republicans, as  well as all 26 women serving in the Senate of both parties.   This body has already made clear its overwhelming support for the  bill. Each State contributed to the war effort, and each State has  Rosies awaiting this award.   I would like to tell you about a Rosie the Riveter from my home State  of Pennsylvania. I will just put up a poster of a picture of her. As I  said, she is a Pennsylvanian. Her name is Mae Krier of Levittown, PA,  Bucks County, Southeastern Pennsylvania. Mae worked in a Boeing factory  where she helped make B-17 and B-29 warplanes as a teenager during  World War II. Mae is now 94 years old and has been working to recognize  and honor her fellow Rosies--not for years; she has been working on  this for decades.   Mae is a patriot. And Mae is now serving her country yet again during  another crisis. She has spent the better part of this year making face  masks for those who need them. These polka-dot masks are reminiscent of  the bandanna worn by the woman in the famous ``We Can Do It'' poster.   Mae is the embodiment of the ``We Can Do It'' spirit. For over 70  years, from the Boeing assembly line where she worked to her sewing  machine today, Mae has devoted herself to the betterment of the Nation.   She and her fellow Rosies have earned this Congressional Gold Medal.  Many of Mae's friends--her fellow Rosies--have passed away without the  recognition that they are worthy of. Thousands more are eagerly  awaiting the passage of this bill, in addition to the families of the  Rosies who have died.   This honor has already been delayed for far too long. I urge my  colleagues to pass this important, time-sensitive legislation.   So, Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be  discharged, and the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of  H.R. 1773.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Thank you                            ____________________     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
