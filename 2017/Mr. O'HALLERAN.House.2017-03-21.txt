 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of a  young boy who lives in my district named Cameron. Cameron was born with  a congenital heart defect, but a successful surgery at 5 weeks of age  has given him a shot at a vibrant life.   He is like most 8-year-olds, fearless, curious, and full of life, but  Cameron will live with this for the rest of his life.   His parents shared this story with me recently and expressed their  concerns, not just about Cameron, but about the children of America who  are under this type of a process. They have affordable  [[Page H2285]]  coverage under the Affordable Care Act, despite Cameron's preexisting  conditions.   But, Mr. Speaker, they are concerned that future coverage will be  unaffordable and unattainable as he grows up under the American Health  Care Act, also known as TrumpCare.   I share these concerns. I cannot support legislation that will  drastically raise premiums for families like Cameron's and  disproportionately impact rural communities in my district.                                time  1815    It is my hope that, moving forward, Congress can work on a bipartisan  solution to improve the health and well-being of Americans and their  children and protect those who need it most. We cannot continue to play  partisan politics with the lives of our constituents, our children, our  small businesses, and the people of America.
