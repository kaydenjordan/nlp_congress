 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment will restore $12 million in  cuts to the already underfunded Superfund Enforcement program, with an  equivalent cut to Bureau of Land Management's oil and gas leasing  program.  [[Page H7138]]    Superfund Enforcement is the epitome of Federal fiscal  responsibility. It ensures that polluters pay for the cleanup and the  mess they have caused.   For over 35 years, EPA's Superfund Enforcement program has enabled  thousands of site investigations at cleanups and has required viable  responsible parties to either conduct the work or pay for the cleanups  of these Superfund sites, in other words, hold parties accountable for  the action and correction of their activities.                                time  1730    Any cuts to these funds clearly places corporate interests over that  of the health and financial well-being of the American people.   According to the EPA, the Superfund Enforcement program's efforts to  negotiate settlement agreements and issue order for cleanup work  accounts for approximately 69 percent of all the cleanup work currently  underway at Superfund sites around this country.   For every dollar the Superfund Enforcement program spends, private  parties commit $8 toward cleanup work. The enforcement funding is  essential in saving taxpayer dollars and the scarce resources of the  Superfund trust fund to address truly abandoned and orphaned sites.   As of August 1, 2017, there were 1,845 Superfund sites in the  country. These sites include dangerous and toxic substances not just in  my backyard but in everybody's backyard.   Perhaps not surprisingly, Superfund sites tend to be located near  lower income communities and around communities of color. Approximately  53 million people live within 3 miles of a Superfund site in this  country, and 46 percent of them live in poorer communities and  communities of color. Fifteen percent of those residents live below the  poverty level.   According to a National Association of Clean Air Agencies report:  ``Without EPA's enforcement, companies could avoid reporting, or  minimize the reported amount of toxic materials released to the  environment.''   Following one of the most catastrophic hurricanes to hit Texas, the  EPA found that 13 Superfund sites have been flooded or could face  damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey.   Administrator Pruitt has repeatedly tried to justify his cuts to the  agency by claiming that he wants the agency to go ``back to the  basics.'' I can't think of anything more fundamental than cleaning up  the most toxic sites in the Nation to protect the health of the people  who live nearby in those communities.   Restoring the ability of the EPA to self-sustain its core mission  should be a no-brainer for those on both sides of the aisle. In order  to restore the funding, my amendment will make a modest cut to the  BLM's oil and gas program. This program is a massive giveaway to the  very polluters that have made the existence of the Superfund program a  necessity.   Currently, 7,950 drilling permits are approved and not being used.  There are 14.4 million acres of public land under lease and not  producing. There is no justification to dole out more taxpayer money in  order to expedite and speed up the permitting or leasing practices when  we have that amount not being used and over close to 15 million acres  under lease, as we speak.   A report by Oil Change International recently found that the U.S.  Government provided about $6 billion annually in financial support to  the oil, gas, and coal industries between 2013 and 2015. Meanwhile, oil  giant ExxonMobil's profits more than doubled in the first quarter of  this year, which equaled $4.1 billion in profits for just that one  quarter. They certainly did not need more taxpayer money while  communities across the United States continue to be exposed to toxic  and hazardous pollution.   My amendment restores, in part, EPA's core mission to protect the  public health of the American people and to hold all polluters  responsible and liable for the environmental and health risks they  cause.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this is a prudent, necessary protection  of public health and the environment. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment will restore $1 million in  cuts to the Environmental Justice program within the EPA, with an  equivalent cut to leadership and administration within the DOI Office  of the Secretary.   In 1992, the program was created and originally called the  Environmental Equity Office. It was created after a series of releases  of reports that revealed polluter sites were disproportionately located  in low-income communities and communities of color.                                time  1815    With minimal support, the program has provided communities with  leveraged resources to do things like revitalize neighborhoods, build  health centers, expand affordable housing, create green space and  recreation areas, and, more importantly, raise the awareness of the  disproportionate treatment in both affected communities and  decisionmakers.   Despite this success within the EPA for decades, we are not even  close to dealing with the issue of environmental justice.   In 2016, the United States Commission on Civil Rights found that  racial minorities and low-income communities are still  disproportionately affected by the siting of waste disposal facilities,  permitted emissions facilities, and that they often lack the political  and financial clout to properly bargain with polluters when fighting a  decision or seeking redress.   A report by the staff of the House Committee on Natural Resources  found that clean water access and sanitation infrastructure on numerous  reservations across the Nation more closely resemble developing  countries than they do the rest of the Nation. Nearly half of all homes  on Tribal land lack access to adequate drinking water, sewage, or solid  waste disposal facilities. As a result, Native families often end up  drinking unclean water that increases disease risks and impairs Tribal  economic development.   Additionally, low-income communities of color have been on the  frontline of Houston's petrochemical industry for decades, and when  Harvey struck, they were some of the first to feel the effects as  chemical plants caught fire, refineries began flaring toxins, and  polluted floodwater went into their neighborhoods.   The EPA Office of Environmental Justice helps integrate concerns of  these communities within the general activities of the agencies. This  is not a program that can afford to be scaled back, especially as  concerns of environmental justice continue to arise around Hurricane  Harvey and now in Irma's path. It is critical that we protect frontline  communities and communities of color from disparate impacts caused by  environmental pollution. One million dollars is not a lot of  [[Page H7144]]  money for this task, but it reaffirms the significance of the office  and our sense of equality.   Today I ask my colleagues to join in defense of these communities and  show them that Congress cares about their public health, their housing,  and their importance as people.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McEachin), a member of the  Natural Resources Committee, and ranking member of the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
