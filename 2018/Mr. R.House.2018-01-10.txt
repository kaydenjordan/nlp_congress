L. Trumka,      President, AFL-CIO,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Trumka: I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated       22 October 2015 requesting an informal opinion and guidance       from  [[Page H118]]       the International Labour Organization in respect of a Bill       being considered by the United States Congress.        In particular, you have raised concerns about the Tribal       Labor Sovereignty Act (H.R. 511) which you state would deny       protection under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of a       large number of workers employed by tribal-owned and tribal-      operated enterprises located on tribal territory and ask for       the informal opinion of the Office as to whether such an       exclusion of workers employed on tribal lands would be in       conformity with the principles of freedom of Association       which are at the core of the ILO Constitution and the ILO's       Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.        In conformity with the regular procedure concerning       requests for an informal opinion from the International       Labour Office in respect of draft legislation and its       possible impact on international labour standards and       principles, the views set out below should in no way be       considered as prejudging any comments or observations that       might be made by the ILO supervisory bodies within the       framework of their examination of the application of ratified       international labour standards or principles on freedom of       association.        Your links to committee reports of the congressional       majority and minority and other background information have       enabled the Office to consider the views of the parties both       for and against the proposed amendment and they all appear to       confirm recognition of the United States' obligation to       uphold freedom of association and collective bargaining.       While the proponents of the Bill assert that this can be       achieved through the labour relations' regimes autonomously       determined by the tribal nations, the opponents--and you       yourself in your request--maintain that excluding tribal       lands from the NLRA will in effect result in a loss (or at       the very least inadequate protection) of their trade union       rights. Not only do you refer to tribal labour relations       ordinances which in your view provide inadequate protections       in this regard, but you also refer to instances where there       are no tribal labour relations ordinances at all.        While elements of indigenous peoples' sovereignty have been       invoked by the proponents of this Bill, the central question       revolves around the manner in which the United States       Government can best assure throughout its territory the full       application of the fundamental principles of freedom of       association and collective bargaining. From an ILO       perspective, while the variety of mechanisms for ensuring       freedom of association and collective bargaining rights may       differ depending on distinct sectoral considerations or       devolution of labour competence, it is critical that the       State (the national authority) takes ultimate responsibility       for ensuring respect for freedom of association and       collective bargaining rights throughout its territory.        As you have indicated, the 2004 San Manuel Indian Bingo and       Casino decision assures possible recourse to the National       Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an overarching mechanism aimed       at ensuring the protection of freedom of association, while       also maintaining deference to the sovereign interests of the       tribal nations so as to avoid touching on exclusive rights of       self-governance.        Full abdication of review via an exclusion from the scope       of the NLRA for all workers employed on tribal lands as       described might make it very difficult for the United States       Government to assure the fundamental trade union rights of       workers. In cases like those mentioned where there are no       tribal labour relations ordinances, undue restrictions on       collective bargaining, excessive limitations on freedom of       association rights or lack of protection from unfair labour       practices, workers on tribal territories would be left       without any remedy for violation of their fundamental freedom       of association rights, short of a constitutional battle.       Furthermore, the exclusion proposed, with no avenue for       federal review or overarching mechanism for appeal should       there be an alleged violation of freedom of association,       would give rise to discrimination in relation to the       protection of trade union rights which would affect both       indigenous and non-indigenous workers simply on the basis of       their workplace location.        Given the concerns that you have raised, it would be       critically important that, at the very least, a complete       legal and comparative review be undertaken to support       assurances that all rights, mechanisms and remedies for the       full protection of internationally recognized freedom of       association rights are available to all workers on all tribal       lands. In the absence of such assurances, it would appear       likely that an exclusion of certain workers from the NLRA and       its mechanisms would give rise to a failure to ensure to       these workers their fundamental freedom of association       rights.        In accordance with ILO procedure concerning requests for       informal opinions on draft legislation, this communication       will also be brought to the attention of the United States       Government and the representative employers' organization,       the US Council for International Business.            Yours sincerely,                                                 Corinne Vargha,                                                     Director of the                         International Labour Standards Department.
