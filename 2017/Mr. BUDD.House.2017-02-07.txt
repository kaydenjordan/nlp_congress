 I thank the chairman.   Mr. Speaker, H.J. Res. 57, which we will be voting on today and  discussing and debating in a few moments, would overturn an  administration rule on school accountability standards that were  finalized back in November.   Congress passed a law last year with the intent of giving power back  to States and to local communities, but unelected bureaucrats at the  Department of Education finalized this rule last year which,  ultimately, could force Common Core standards on States that don't  comply.   We see this time and time again. Congress will create a law, and then  an agency that is filled with unelected officials disregards the will  of the people by writing regulations as it sees fit. Every American, in  putting aside one's personal ideology, can agree that an important  issue like how we educate our kids is not something that we should  decide here in Washington. In the months and the years to come, we  should welcome a continued debate about whether the fate of a child's  education should be decided in Washington or if a child's education  should be more personalized at the State and the community levels. In  my view, dictating specific accountability requirements from Washington  and punishing those who don't meet those standards is a losing  prescription.   It is my hope that every kid in my district, in North Carolina, and  around the country has a quality education. I think that is the hope of  my colleagues, too. The more we think that Washington has all of the  answers, the further we get away from our founding vision of a limited  Federal role in our lives, especially in something as personal as  education.   It will be debated in a few moments, but I do urge a ``yes'' vote on  H.J. Res. 57.
