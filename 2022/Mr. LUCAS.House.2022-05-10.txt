 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Oklahoma for  yielding and for introducing this legislation.   H.R. 5324, the NOAA Weather Radio Modernization Act of 2021, is a  straightforward, lifesaving bill introduced by my esteemed colleague  from Oklahoma, Representative Stephanie Bice, who is the ranking member  of the Environment Subcommittee.   Last week, nearly the entire State of Oklahoma experienced an  outbreak in severe weather and a number of confirmed tornadoes. That is  not uncommon for this time of year, and our citizens were well  prepared.   While there was significant damage and widespread power outages,  there have been no confirmed deaths at this point. That is because of  the lifesaving efforts of NOAA, the National Weather Service, and  warning capabilities like the NOAA Weather Radio, also known as NWR.   Day or night, power or no power, in a rural area or in the heart of  the city, an NWR device loudly alerts you and your family to severe  weather nearby. Most Oklahomans have grown up listening to these  announcements, and we know to act when we hear them. That saves lives.  But since NWR was designated as the sole government provider of direct  warnings to private homes in 1975, the system has gone through few  upgrades other than broadly expanding access across the country.   The NWR's aging infrastructure has led to increased maintenance costs  and more frequent outages. The copper wiring that connects broadcast  transmitters to Weather Service stations has become obsolete and  expensive. More powerful storms require backup options and stronger  signals in case of extensive damage to mission critical facilities.   The NWR Modernization Act addresses these challenges and gives NOAA  the authority and resources to ensure the NWR is as useful in the 21st  century as it has been for the last four decades. This legislation  continues to expand access to NWR, but does so while ensuring the  system does not become obsolete with out-of-date technology.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership of the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology's Environment Subcommittee, Ranking  Member Bice and Chairwoman Sherrill, for leading on this critical  issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   I would simply note that we pass lots of pieces of legislation in  this body every session. But every so often, we address a piece of  legislation that makes a real difference in the lives of people, a  piece of legislation that deserves to move as swiftly as possible  through the process to enable its implementation.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank all of my colleagues, and I urge a yes  vote.
