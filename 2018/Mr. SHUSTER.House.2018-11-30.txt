 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure be discharged from further  consideration of the bill (S. 2377) to designate the Federal building  and United States courthouse located at 200 West 2nd Street in Dayton,  Ohio, as the ``Walter H. Rice Federal Building and United States  Courthouse'', and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the achievements  of the Bedford High School girls soccer team of Bedford, Pennsylvania.   The Lady Bisons capped off an unbeaten season by bringing home the  PIAA Class AA State championship on Saturday, November 17.   This is a monumental accomplishment for the school. It is Bedford  High School's first State championship in any sport. It is the first  school from District 5 or 6 to win a State championship in their  history.   The Lady Bisons defeated the Lewisburg Green Dragons in overtime 1-0,  finishing their season with a perfect record of 22-0.   The Lady Bisons, coached by Jeff Thomas, were led to victory by their  five seniors--Jenna Brown, Bailey Donaldson, Brooke Lankey, Hallie  Sisk, and Amber Thomas--who scored the winning goal on a penalty kick  just 52 seconds into overtime at Hersheypark Stadium.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to congratulate the players, the coaches,  and the families of the Bedford High School girls soccer team on their  Pennsylvania State championship.   The passion, commitment, and teamwork shown by these young women will  surely follow them in their future endeavors as well as inspire the  Bedford community for years to come.                            ____________________
