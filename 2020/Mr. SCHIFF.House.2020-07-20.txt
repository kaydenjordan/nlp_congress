 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado for  yielding. I rise in strong support of amendment 659, the Protecting  America's Wilderness Act. This amendment includes the Rim of the Valley  Corridor Preservation Act legislation I have been working on for nearly  20 years.   I first took up the study bill when George W. Bush was President. We  got that passed in a Republican House and signed into law. During the  course of the Obama administration, we got the study funded and  conducted.   Thousands and thousands of people commented during the public survey  period overwhelmingly in favor of the most aggressive option of  tripling the size of the park. Ultimately, the Park Service recommended  doubling the acreage in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation  Area. This bill would make that law.   Twenty years is a long enough time to be pursuing this to finally  bring it to completion. This will help us preserve wildlife corridors,  rare ecosystems, hiking trails, and recreational opportunities.   As Los Angeles expands, this proximity to nature is what so many  people love about it. We love how we have lions roaming our hills. We  have beautiful bears coming into people's garages to eat Ikea  meatballs, all possible because we preserve this open space.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage.  [[Page H3363]]
