 Mr. President, I thank Senator Casey and Senator Stabenow  for their leadership. They are exactly right about this. They are right  about maternal health, CHIP, rural hospitals, and community health  centers that so many people depend upon, and I thank them very much for  their work. I thank the ranking member of the Finance Committee, Mr.  Wyden, for joining us. Mr. Carper, I believe, will be joining us too.   It has now been 112 days since funding expired for the Children's  Health Insurance Program. It has been 112 days of uncertainty for  families, 112 days of mothers worrying about being able to afford their  child's checkups, 112 days of fathers who will have to choose between  the heating bill and medicine for their kids, and for every one of  those 112 days, the Republican leaders in Congress have made a choice  about extending CHIP, and we know it is something that has been  bipartisan for two decades.   The chairman of the Finance Committee loves to brag about the fact  that he was there at its inception. He invented it with Senator Kennedy  or he invented it and Senator Kennedy came along afterward or whatever  actually happened 20 years ago, he loves to brag about it. In the  Finance Committee, with Senators Casey, Carper, Wyden, Stabenow and  others, we asked him about it repeatedly during the tax bill.   Again, they were willing to pass a tax cut in December, where 81  percent of the benefits in that tax bill went to the richest 1 percent.  That bill will encourage more companies to shut down in Erie, PA, and  Ashtabula, OH, or in Pittsburgh or in Cleveland and move overseas. They  were willing to do that. We asked them over and over--Senator Hatch and  others in the Finance Committee--let's pass CHIP. They just couldn't  get around to it. They made a choice. They made a choice to do tax cuts  for the rich. They made a choice to let CHIP expire. They made a choice  not to bring a bipartisan bill passed out of the Finance Committee to  the floor. They made a choice to spend their time and energy on other  things.   They have a choice today. I am calling on my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle--and I think Senator Stabenow will make a motion to do  this--to pass a permanent extension of CHIP, with no strings attached,  the policy we agree on, protecting health insurance for 9 million  children, with an added bonus of saving $6 million in savings for the  Federal Government because CHIP frankly doesn't cost very much.   Children don't get sick very often and don't require a lot of medical  care. Some children do, and that is the whole point of CHIP, so healthy  children can stay healthy and get regular checkups and, with an  occasional ear infection, go to the family doctor with an ear infection  on the first day, rather than the emergency room after the child might  experience intense pain or even, later in life, hearing loss, in some  cases. It is there for those like Crystal's child in Columbus, OH, whom  we talked about.   It is a policy that doesn't just make moral sense, it makes financial  sense. It is time for Republican leaders to stop holding CHIP hostage  and families hostage to their failed budget process. I know they broke  out a plan the other day, as their political talking point, to try to  use it to pass a bill that really wasn't all that good a bill. These  are not bargaining chips, these are kids.   In my State--the State where the Presiding Officer grew up--209,000  Ohio kids, and 9 million kids nationwide, roughly a number not much  higher than that in Pennsylvania and lower than that in Michigan, in  the 3 of our States, there are 600,000 kids who right now are getting  insurance from CHIP. Remember, these are kids whose parents generally  work making $8 to $10 to $12 an hour. They are not kids whose parents  have jobs that pay insurance. They are not Congressmen and  Congresswomen and Senators who have really good health insurance but  for some reason think it is OK to deny it from others, from working  families. These are working families. These are children whose parents  have jobs but don't have insurance.   Think about the families and the stress they are facing. Think about  the letters I get and Senator Casey gets about the stories we get from  Ohio and Pennsylvania families.   Josh from Cleveland said CHIP ``helped me arrange for my family to  get the health coverage they needed while I looked for a new job. As a  parent . . . that peace of mind, knowing that my family is secure  getting the  [[Page S376]]  medical help they need should something God forbid arise, is  priceless.''   The letter he sent to us underscores the fact that all kinds of  parents over the Christmas season, over the holiday season--low-income,  hard-working parents, in most cases, $8 to $12 an hour--they are not  buying a lot of stuff for their kids at Christmas anyway. They are  trying to figure out how this is going to work over the Christmas  season, but they are anxious. They have to worry about whether they are  going to have insurance in the new year while Congress passes the tax  cuts.   Tiffany from Cleveland wrote:         My son relied on CHIP. . . . Without CHIP, we would not       have been able to afford to get him intensive speech therapy       for his severe . . . diagnosis. Without this speech therapy,       he would not be able to speak today. CHIP gave him a voice.       Now I want to use my own voice to give other kids like him a       chance.    Linda from Johnstown wrote to me about her daughter and grandchild.         The CHIP Program is vital to my daughter and grandchild. My       daughter is a hard-working, tax-paying, 26-year-old, single       mother with a 4-year-old son. She works over 40 hours each       week as a chef. They do qualify for CHIP and it is a       tremendous help. . . . Without the CHIP program, she would be       forced to find other ways to make ends meet, or perhaps even       to quit working, so that she would qualify for full public       assistance.    So I remind my colleagues, all of whom have insurance paid for by  taxpayers, if we don't pass CHIP, people like this young woman--people  like Linda's daughter, who has a child--she might have to quit her job  as a chef, her more than 40-hour-a-week job, so she can then go on  Medicaid and get insurance for her child. Does that make any sense to  anybody?   Another grandmother--it is always the grandmothers; never  underestimate them--Suzanne from Columbus wrote to me:         As a pediatric nurse for 40 years, I have seen firsthand       how . . . CHIP . . . has provided essential healthcare and       saved lives.        As a grandmother, my grandchildren . . . benefited. Their       father is deceased and my daughter can't afford the high cost       of her company insurance but makes too much to qualify for       Medicaid. Without this program, my grandchildren would not       have had adequate healthcare.    So many of these families--think about them. As Pope Francis  admonished his priests: Go out and smell like the flock. Go out and  listen to your constituents around the country, I beg my colleagues. I  think, if you had, that we would have seen CHIP reauthorized months  ago, but that is the past.   So many of these families are just like Linda's and Suzanne's  daughters. They work full time. They just aren't lucky enough to work  for employers that offer health insurance. All of us are that lucky.  Again, I don't know how we can stand here with insurance paid by  taxpayers and not do anything about it. Make no mistake, that is what  Republican leaders did for 112 days.   I know that most of my colleagues wanted to pass CHIP in September  before it expired, then in October, then in November when we begged the  Finance chair to do it, then in December during the tax reform. I know  my colleagues wanted to that, but for whatever reason, Senator  McConnell, whose office, as we know, is down the hall and has lobbyists  running in and out--CHIP families didn't really have very good  lobbyists. I don't know why it works that way, but insurance companies  did, and I guess that is how this town works.   I asked Leader McConnell and Senator Hatch time and again to bring  this bill to the floor and allow a vote. Senator Casey asked them;  Senator Stabenow and all of us did. It was September, October,  November, and December, but they chose to do other things. They have a  chance to make a different choice today, a chance to stop using  children and families as bargaining chips, a chance to choose making  policy over playing politics. If this is really about children's  healthcare, I challenge Leader McConnell to bring a clean, permanent  CHIP bill to the floor right away. There is no reason to hold this up  while we continue to fight over the budget process. Pretending that the  two must pass together, of course, is a fallacy.   A permanent CHIP extension that provides certainty to families and $6  billion in savings to the Federal Government will pass overwhelmingly.  We will be the first enthusiastic votes cast.   Thank you.
