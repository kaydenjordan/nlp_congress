 Madam Speaker, I rise today in the spirit of  my predecessor, Congressman John Lewis.   Congressman Lewis taught us that when you see something that is not  fair, not just, not right, you have a moral obligation to find a way to  get in the way.   The voter suppression laws that have been enacted across the country  and what is happening in my home State of Georgia is the very  definition of the good trouble that John Lewis taught us to get into,  to push back against.   We might not be counting jelly beans in a jar but make no mistake,  they seek the same purpose: to stop people who look like me from  accessing their right to vote.   We all have an opportunity to get in the way today by voting ``yes''  on the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   If my colleagues ever wondered what they would have done during the  civil rights movement, this is your opportunity to find out. Our  democracy is on the line.
