 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  taking the lead on such an important issue.   Mr. Speaker, on the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, let's reflect on  the importance of standing up for every human being's right to realize  their full potential from the moment of conception.   In fact, Members of Congress have a solemn duty to defend those  incapable of defending themselves, the most innocent among us, the  unborn.   I will share a little bit of a personal story when my family chose  life. This was when my son was 3 years old. He  [[Page H280]]  was involved in an accident with a head injury, and he was on life  support. And many times the doctors told us he wasn't going to survive.  In fact, they said it is not an 80 percent chance, not a 95 percent  chance, but it was a 100 percent chance that he was going to pass. We  did not disconnect life support.   We chose life. We prayed. And Freddie started to recover.   Today Freddie is fully recovered, and though his accident was decades  ago, this is an opportunity to learn about the value of human life.   Our creator has a plan for each one of us, and I will continue to  support policies that ensure every life has the chance to realize its  fullest potential.
