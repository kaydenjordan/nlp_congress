 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address a crisis hurting  every household in America: skyrocketing prices.   If you listen to the Biden administration, they will tell you that  this is a ``high-class problem.'' This is a lie propagated by those who  have never had to do the mental math at the grocery store to make sure  the amount in their cart does not exceed the cash in their wallet.   For Democrat leaders, paying 42 percent more at the pump isn't a  problem. I suppose the price of gas isn't a concern if you are riding  government-funded high-speed rail in Silicon Valley.   More than 90 percent of my constituents reported that rising prices  are impacting their household budgets. Inflation is destroying  Americans' ability to save for retirement, buy a home, or build wealth.  This isn't a tax on the rich. It is an enormous burden for working  Americans.   It is not too late to change course. I have introduced legislation to  increase the transparency in government spending so that lawmakers will  be forced to answer for reckless spending sprees. Moreover, my  Retirement Inflation Protection Act will protect Americans from  inflation-driven tax burdens right when they enter retirement.   This crisis is already hitting home for millions of Americans. We  must act before it financially cripples generations of Americans to  come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous question so that we  can immediately consider H.R. 5586.   This bill would kill a Biden administration proposal that would allow  IRS agents to comb through the bank accounts of any American who spends  more than $10,000 a year.   To put that in perspective, $10,000 a year equates to just $28 a day,  $850 a month, or half of the average Minnesota mortgage payment. In  other words, the Biden administration wants the IRS to be able to spy  on tens of millions of Americans.   Don't be mistaken. This proposal does not just target the 1 percent,  as the President sometimes likes to claim. Instead, it is pointed  directly at working American families.   Today, I led a letter, with more than 200 of my colleagues, urging  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to scrap this proposal to spy on  American citizens.   This is not China. We must protect Americans' right to privacy and  stop this proposed intrusive, unnecessary Biden financial reporting  requirement.
