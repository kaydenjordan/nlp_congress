 Mr. Speaker, three of the goals of President Biden's agenda  and that of Congressional Democrats are to recover from this pandemic,  to create jobs, and to lower taxes. We have met all three.   Under President Biden's leadership, case rates and hospitalizations  from COVID are dropping across our country, unemployment rolls have  decreased, and since January 20, approximately 5 million jobs have been  created.   In addition, Democrats delivered a tax cut for families with  children. We greatly expanded this tax cut, and we sent payments on a  recurring monthly basis to American families. By the middle of this  month, in November, the overall majority of families with children will  get another round of payments directly deposited into their bank  accounts.   The Joint Economic Committee has shown that this creates $19 billion  worth of economic activity in the local jurisdictions and when you let  American families keep their hard-earned money, it creates economic  growth. We will try to extend this tax cut for working families in the  Build Back Better Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Republicans to join us.                            ____________________
