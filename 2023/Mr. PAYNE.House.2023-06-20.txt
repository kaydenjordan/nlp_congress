 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss how the Republicans  are helping the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans and how they are not  helping the rest of America.   They continue to focus on tax cuts for the richest Americans. They  continue to push for tax breaks for multi-billion dollar corporations,  and they want the rest of us to pay for them.   They want to slash investments in childcare, education, healthcare,  and public safety; and now, they want to attack Social Security,  Medicaid, and Medicare.   Democrats are putting people over politics. We are strengthening the  middle class and we are working for American families.   With President Biden's leadership, we are creating millions of jobs  and lowering the price of common consumer goods. Americans are driving  on new roads and bridges thanks to our work.   These successes are examples of why I am proud to be a Democrat.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, the gentleman from  Illinois and the gentlewoman from Florida, for their leadership in the  Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour this First Session of the  118th Congress.   They have demonstrated, even as freshmen, their leadership and  breadth of knowledge of the issues that are important to the members of  the Congressional Black Caucus. I thank both of them for their  outstanding leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss June as National Reunification  Month. It is a time to recognize the people who work daily to help  families stay together. I know this issue personally.   Last Wednesday, I had the honor of hosting a young constituent from  my district during Foster Youth Shadow Day. We spent the day discussing  legislative process and I showed her around Congress. I was impressed  with her questions and intelligence. She deserves to grow up in a  loving and supportive household. She is one reason we must do more to  help families stay together in healthy environments.   There are anywhere from 300,000 to 400,000 children in foster care  nationwide. Yet too many children are removed from households before  parents receive the services necessary to avoid such an action. This  situation is worse in Black communities.   Black families are more likely to be investigated by child protective  services and lose children than White families. Black children spend  more time in foster care, and they are less likely to be reunified with  their families.   Family reunification is better for these children overall. The youth  that shadowed me the other day talked about where her siblings were and  that they weren't together. Even though she is not with them, she tries  to keep track of them, being the eldest, and has worked to make sure  that she stays in their lives.   Research shows that children have better outcomes in life when they  grow up in families that nurture and care for them. There is hope for  children in traumatic households before they even enter foster care.  This year marks the 5th anniversary of the passage of the Family First  Prevention Services Act.   This law made funding available for resources and activities to make  families healthier and safer for children. These resources include  programs to address mental health and substance abuse issues in the  home. Also, these programs help fathers and mothers become better  parents.   We need to identify families at risk sooner so we can implement these  programs before child removal becomes necessary. We need to increase  funding for more preventative services, such as home visits. Studies  show that home visits lower the rate of child maltreatment, the leading  cause of child removal. In addition, there are kin placements.   Right now there are 2.5 million children who are being raised by  relatives or close family friends. Research has found that children  staying with a relative or a friend have better behavior, mental  health, and physical health than children in foster care. They are  allowed to grow up in their culture and stay connected to their  families. Children do best with their own families.   That is why we must provide more resources to families to prevent  children from being removed at all. Healthy families are better for  children, and they are better for America.   As I stated, my colleague prior to me, the Honorable Gwen Moore, has  picked up the mantle from one of our great colleagues that has moved on  to lead the metropolis of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, who did an  outstanding job with this program, the Foster Shadow Youth Day on  Capitol Hill. She was an outstanding leader in that, and Ms. Moore has  picked it up and not lost a beat.   Mr. Speaker, it is an opportunity for us to do the best that we can  to make sure that families stay unified and have a healthy outlook on  life.
