 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor George Beam of  Fort Ashby, West Virginia, who will be celebrating his 100th birthday  next month.   George Beam's life is one of exemplary service to his community and  his country. During the height of World War II, he enlisted and served  in the United States Army, leaving behind his wife and newborn baby.  Mr. Beam sensed the call of duty and he knew serving his country was  the right thing to do.   For his service, he received numerous recognitions, including a  Purple Heart for his injury at the infamous Battle of the Bulge.   After the war, Beam returned home to West Virginia where he operated  several businesses in Fort Ashby.   George Beam, we wish you a happy 100th birthday. You truly are a  great American.
