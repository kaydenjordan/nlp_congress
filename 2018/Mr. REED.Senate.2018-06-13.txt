 Mr. President, I believe Senator Markey of Massachusetts is  here to speak.    Mr. President, let me first thank Senator Markey and  Senator Warren for their comments and just state that this amendment is  very straightforward and simple. It ensures that Congress has an  oversight role in authorizing the development of new or modified  nuclear weapons, including low-yield nuclear weapons. It reiterates  what Congress does every year in the National Defense Authorization  Act. I consider the oversight role of this institution essential for  the Defense Department and, in particular, for nuclear weapons.   There are many devastating weapons of war in the world, but nuclear  weapons are different. Thankfully, it has been over 70 years since the  only time nuclear weapons have been used in war, but because it has  been so long, I think many are not fully aware of the awful power of  nuclear weapons. On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped a nuclear  bomb on Hiroshima. In the immediate aftermath, approximately 70,000  people--mostly civilians--were killed. Tens of thousands more would die  of radiation poisoning within weeks. Approximately 80 percent of the  city of 350,000 people was destroyed. The second nuclear weapon,  dropped on Nagasaki 3 days later, killed 40,000 immediately and  approximately 40,000 more people from radiation poisoning in the  following weeks. A weapon that can kill more people in an instant than  the United States lost in the entire Vietnam conflict deserves close  congressional scrutiny.   To provide perspective on the size of these weapons, the bomb dropped  on Hiroshima was 13 to 15 kilotons. The bomb dropped on Nagasaki was 18  to 20 kilotons. A low-yield nuclear weapon is defined as a nuclear  weapon whose yield is less than 5 kilotons of explosive yield. For  comparison, the Massive Ordinance Air Blast bomb, or MOAB, used on an  Afghanistan tunnel network in 2017--and featured all across the media  as a devastating explosion--is 11 tons, or 0.01 kilotons, about 500  times less powerful than a 5-kiloton, low-yield nuclear weapon. So we  are talking about an extremely powerful weapon that will result in  thousands of casualties if used.   Two weeks ago, I visited General Hyten, who is the commander of the  U.S. Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. We  participated in a classified exercise, involving the use of nuclear  weapons. Again, the loss of life and destruction was truly sobering. I  recommend that all of my colleagues participate in such a war game  because it truly brings home the complexity and the essential role the  Congress has in overseeing the development of nuclear weapons.   I would like to convey one point that General Hyten made to me at the  conclusion of the war game--that his No. 1 job is to ensure that  nuclear weapons never be used in the first place and that they act as a  deterrence to their use.   With that, let me make a few observations on the amendment before us  and why we are having this debate today.   The 2018 ``Nuclear Posture Review,'' released in February, recommends  that the United States undertake deployment of a submarine-based, low- yield nuclear weapon. At present, the United States has several low- yield nuclear weapons, but they are deployed from the air.   The principle reasons advanced for this recommendation in the  ``Nuclear Posture Review'' are, first, the development of the Russian  doctrine to use low-yield nuclear weapons to ``escalate to de- escalate''; second, the inclusion of this doctrine not only in Russian  plans but in repeated Russian war games; third, the significant  expansion of the number of Russian nonstrategic, low-yield nuclear  weapons that are not subject to arms control agreements, together with  the Russian deployment of a land-based intermediate cruise missile that  violates the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Agreement, or INF Agreement;  and, fourth, finally, the development of extensive air defense systems  over key Russian areas that could deny access to our current aircraft  that would deploy a low-yield nuclear weapon.   The ``escalates to de-escalate'' strategy presumes that Russia has  initiated hostilities in Europe and, after initial Russian success,  either NATO forces regain the momentum and the conventional fight is  turning decisively against Russia or Russia has secured its desired  limited objective and anticipates a decisive counterattack by NATO. In  either case, this Russian doctrine calls for a first strike with the  use of a low-yield nuclear device to freeze NATO forces. The Russian  logic  [[Page S3880]]  is that we will not respond with high-yield weapons for fear of  initiating an all-out nuclear exchange, and we lack the ability to  strike key targets with our airborne low-yield weapons because of their  area denial air defenses. Their doctrine assumes that we will accept  the existing status of Russian forces, even if they occupy NATO  territory, while nonmilitary measures are pursued. This conclusion is  contrary to our longstanding commitment to NATO expressed at the NATO  Summit in 2016. In the words of that summit, ``no one should doubt  NATO's resolve if the security of any of its members is threatened.  NATO will maintain the full range of capabilities necessary to deter  and defend against any threat to the safety and security of our  populations, wherever it should arise.''    Now, given this threat posed by the Russian doctrine, the Nuclear  Posture Review proposes that the development of a submarine-based, low- yield nuclear weapon will strengthen deterrence, raise the nuclear  threshold, and make Russia refrain from a first use of nuclear weapons  since we will be capable of responding in kind to hold all of their  critical targets at risk. In short, it will stabilize rather than  destabilize nuclear deterrence.   The inherent difficulty in evaluating this recommendation is the  realization that deterrence is based upon the perceptions of both  parties and the implicit and explicit communication between both  parties--in other words, what we are signaling with our words and  actions, and whether the adversary is accurately interpreting those  signals.   This is an extraordinarily difficult question. I and many of my  colleagues have struggled with it throughout our service in the Senate  and, in many cases, service in our previous careers. Indeed, experts in  the field of nuclear deterrence honestly disagree with respect to the  recommendation of this submarine launched, low-yield weapon. Some feel  it is needed; others do not.   I am increasingly skeptical that a response to a low-yield Russian  attack by an American low-yield counterattack will result in both sides  refraining from future use of nuclear weapons. In other words, I am  skeptical that we will avoid moving upward on the escalatory ladder  leading to a larger nuclear exchange.   One important issue is the selection of targets and how that affects  our interpretation of Russian objectives and, alternatively, how it  will affect Russian interpretations. If the initial Russian target is  integral to our military operations, will we see it as ``escalate to  de-escalate'' or ``escalate to prevail.'' And if we respond in a way  that is interpreted by the Russians as something more than a quid pro  quo, will the Russians respond again, assuming we are beginning a  nuclear campaign?   Moreover, will we cease conventional operations while allied  territory is being held by Russia? This is the logic behind the Russian  doctrine, but it contradicts our obligations under NATO. If we press  these conventional attacks, especially if we are gaining advantages,  the temptation to use additional nuclear weapons by the Russians may be  irresistible.   Proponents may suggest that the simple possession of this seaborne  low-yield weapon will be sufficient to deter the Russians, but that  assertion seems to ignore existing airborne weapons that may be  directed at critical targets that are accessible to our air attack and,  as such, would accomplish the limited counterresponse that seems to be  behind the current proposal. In addition, much of the investments we  are making in modernizing our triad--particularly with long-range  standoff weapons to replace our aging air-launched cruise missiles, the  B-21 and the F-35 with the life extended B61-12 gravity bomb--should by  2030 offset the increasingly complex anti-access/anti-denial  environment Russia is capable of.   There are no easy answers to these questions, and answers will change  over time as political, military, and economic factors change. That is  why I believe it is essential that Congress maintain a central role in  the development and deployment of nuclear weapons and why I strongly  urge this amendment. This is about Congress's role, not about a  particular nuclear weapon.   In this bill, the fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization  Act, the request for the development of the submarine-launched, low- yield nuclear weapon is authorized. An amendment, offered in the Armed  Services Committee, to require certain reports by the Defense  Department before its deployment failed. It was offered by one of our  colleagues on the Democratic side. Moreover, the funds are already  appropriated for this weapon in the recent Energy and Water  appropriations bill. An amendment to eliminate the funding at the full  Appropriations Committee failed. So we are on track this year to go  ahead with the development of this system, but the question is this: In  the future, will Congress retain the right to make critical decisions  about the development and the deployment of nuclear weapons?   So the debate today is not about whether the low-yield, submarine- launched ballistic missile will proceed. The debate today is about  congressional oversight of the steps ahead on this new nuclear weapon  and any other new or modified nuclear weapon.   Back in 1993, during consideration of the fiscal year 1994 National  Defense Authorization Act, Congressmen Spratt and Furse included a  provision that prohibited research and development that could lead to a  low-yield nuclear weapon. Then, in 2002, President George W. Bush  conducted a nuclear posture review, which concluded that the Spratt- Furse provision should be repealed because it purportedly had a  chilling effect on the science in the DOE weapons laboratories and  might be needed to destroy bunkers containing chemical or biological  weapons. As a result, the fiscal year 2004 National Defense  Authorization Act, reported out of committee by Chairman John Warner  with Ranking Member Carl Levin, included section 3116, which repealed  the Spratt-Furse provision.   When the fiscal year 2004 NDAA came to the floor for consideration in  May of 2003, there was an exhaustive debate on the issue of this  repeal, and several amendments were offered. The first amendment was an  amendment by Senator Feinstein and Senator Ted Kennedy that proposed to  strike the repeal, and it lost. I, then, offered the next amendment,  which allowed research and development to occur but prohibited the  final development and production of a low-yield nuclear weapon.   Senator John Warner then offered a second-degree to my amendment,  which allowed research and development to occur but required specific  authorization for final development and production, and that is the law  today. Senator Warner was very clear about the necessary role of  Congress. On the floor, John Warner stated:         In the second degree amendment, it is clear that the       Congress is fully in charge, working with the Executive       Branch. The Congress, and only the Congress, can authorize       and appropriate the funds necessary to go one step beyond       what the earlier [Reed] amendment has provided.    Well, now, while my amendment failed, the second-degree amendment  offered by Senator John Warner passed 96 to nothing. Indeed, there are  Members here today--our colleagues in the Chamber--who were there at  the time and who voted for the modified amendment, the Warner-Reed  amendment.   The John Warner amendment has been uncontested until this year in the  fiscal year 2019 Defense authorization bill. An amendment offered in  committee--and this is the amendment offered by the Presiding Officer-- eliminates the John Warner language requiring congressional  authorization for development and deployment of the low-yield nuclear  weapon.   Instead, now the administration simply has to submit funding in the  Department of Energy budget for new or modified nuclear weapons, not  the Department of Defense budget. As such, this could be done through  the Secretary of Energy, not necessarily through the Secretary of  Defense. Indeed, in a strictly legal interpretation, the Secretary of  Defense would have no role in this budget request. In addition, once  the information appears in the budget sent to Congress, the executive  branch can immediately begin using prior year's monies, subject to  reprogramming guidelines approved informally by the four defense  committees and not the full Senate, to begin work on a low-yield  nuclear weapon.   I think it is important to note this: Under the present language in  the bill  [[Page S3881]]  before us, it is the Secretary of Energy who could, at the request of  the White House, indeed, conceivably--not likely, but conceivably, even  over the objection of the Secretary of Defense--propose in his budget  that we begin to develop a new nuclear device. Simply submitting that  budget would authorize him to begin reprogramming funds, which would be  approved, at best, by a handful of Senators. That is not the kind of  consideration we must apply to develop a new nuclear weapon. It is the  role of the Senate--all of us--to stand up and to state where we  believe this country should be headed.   The threat and power of nuclear weapons has not changed. In fact, in  the complex and unstable times of present day, with so many more states  seeking nuclear weapons, I think it is imperative that Congress be more  involved, not less, in the development and deployment of our country's  nuclear arsenal.   Therefore, my amendment simply puts Congress back in the loop,  restoring the oversight put in place by the John Warner amendment in  2003.   It is our fundamental duty to review, authorize, and appropriate, if  necessary, the programs the executive branch will execute. I would  contend that this is especially true, given the nature of nuclear  weapons and their capability for destruction. Some may agree with the  need for a new, modified, or low-yield weapon and some may not, but  everyone in Congress should have a say on the issue.   My amendment simply ensures that Congress is involved every step of  the way in the development of any new or modified nuclear weapon. I  believe it is critical, considering the awesome destructive powers of  this weapon, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so we  can continue to exercise appropriate guidance on an issue that is  existential to the survival not only of the country but of the world.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from  Oklahoma for his graciousness in allowing me to respond.   As I read the language of the bill, the language we had in place  since 2004 was stricken. That language prohibited, essentially, the  production and development of a low-yield nuclear device without  congressional authorization. In addition to that, the language that was  inserted in the bill that is before us now creates a process, whereby  in order to begin work in production and development of a low-yield or  perhaps even any type of nuclear weapon, the Secretary of Energy simply  must submit the request in the budget, at which point they can begin  reprogramming funds that already had been appropriated to start moving  forward with the development of not only the low-yield nuclear weapons  we are talking about now but in the future, additional ones. The  essence of my amendment is clearly to get to the point where we are  considering going forward with any new proposal by the administration.  I will emphasize, too, the way this language is crafted in the bill, it  is the Secretary of Energy--it is not the Secretary of Defense--that  puts it in his budget. Once it is in his budget, then they can begin to  move money around. It could be for this submarine launch system or it  could be for a system we have had in the past. We had nuclear field  artillery in 1950s and 1960s. It might not be, frankly, the Secretary  of Defense or anyone else. It might be the President or the NSC that  decides to do that. I am simply saying we have had for a decade or more  the responsibility, the obligation, to authorize new nuclear weapons  and specifically low-yield weapons. That is why we have to include in  this bill a specific authorization for this proposed submarine low- yield nuclear weapon.   If the language existed as is in the bill now, next year I don't  think we would have that requirement. The Secretary of Energy could  simply put it in his budget and then say: It is ready to go. I am  moving money around. I am going to get ahead and create a new low-yield  device--maybe not a submarine device, maybe a short-range rocket for  the U.S. Army or a field artillery piece, which the chairman from  Oklahoma understands because we were both in the service when they had  those. This simply says, we as the Congress have the obligation and  responsibility to say the provide oversight and authorize any such  system. That is why we are on the floor today with respect to this low- yield submarine weapon system, because if we did not stand up and  authorize it, it could not be constructed.   As we go forward, I think we still would have to have that  congressional responsibility, particularly in a world that is becoming  increasingly complicated by nuclear weapons not just from the major  powers but by rising powers by many countries.   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. It simply maintains  the status quo and says, if we are going to develop a new weapons  system, come to us. We can debate it. We approve it or we don't approve  it, but the American people can rest assured that this is not something  that has been simply moved through the administrative channels of any  Executive, this President or any other President.   With that, I will ask for support.    I thank the Senator.
