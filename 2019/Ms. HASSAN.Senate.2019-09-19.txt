 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Brooke  Mills of Concord as September's Granite Stater of the Month for her  work advocating for concussion awareness and prevention in New  Hampshire and across the country.   In March of 2014, Brooke, then a freshman in high school, suffered a  severe concussion during a mandatory handball game in gym class. The  ramifications of this concussion went beyond the physical bruising in  her brain and affected everything from her social life to her  academics.   Brooke suffered from memory loss and had to wear sunglasses indoors  because the lighting in her school was too harsh, which led to teasing  and bullying from her classmates. She also had to strictly limit the  time she spent on her phone, which affected her ability to hang out  with friends and use social media, a difficult situation for someone  who just started high school.   However, instead of letting her concussion get the best of her,  Brooke turned her injury into a platform that she used to educate  people about the dangers of concussions, while also providing  reassurance for others who were going through similar trauma that they  too could overcome the lasting impacts of a concussion.   Brooke started a blog called Finding My Way, where she writes about  her concussion and how it impacts her day-to-day life in the hopes of  helping others suffering from concussions feel less alone. She also  launched an organization called Lessen the Impact, dedicated to sharing  her story and providing resources to help identify and prevent a  concussion.  [[Page S5598]]    Additionally, Brooke is a peer-to-peer speaker for the Brain Injury  Association of New Hampshire, where she gives presentations at high  schools and middle schools about how to identify a concussion and  stresses the importance of being kind and understanding to those who  suffer from this invisible injury.   As a result of Brooke's advocacy, as Governor of New Hampshire, I  declared the third Friday in September as Concussion Awareness Day in  New Hampshire. This week, with a bipartisan group of my colleagues, I  introduced a resolution in the U.S. Senate to recognize this day  nationally.   Concussion Awareness Day is also recognized by other States, as well  as by the National Brain Injury Association. There is also a companion  resolution recognizing this day that has been introduced in the U.S.  House of Representatives.   I want to thank Brooke for all that she has done and continues to do  to turn a challenging experience into an opportunity to educate and  bring awareness to Granite Staters and Americans about the dangers of  concussions. She has truly demonstrated the grit, resilience, and  empathy that reflects the best of our State.                            ____________________
