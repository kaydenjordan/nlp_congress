 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 681 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 681         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (S. 140) to amend       the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification       Act of 2010 to clarify the use of amounts in the WMAT       Settlement Fund. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       115-54 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided among and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and the       Workforce and the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Natural Resources; and (2) one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I  [[Page H97]]  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule for consideration of a very important measure. The  resolution provides for consideration of S. 140, to amend the White  Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010 to  clarify the use of amounts in the White Mountain Apache Tribe  Settlement Fund. This bill also includes the text of S. 249, a bill to  provide that the pueblo of Santa Clara may lease for 99 years certain  restricted land; and H.R. 986, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of  2017.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, 30 minutes of which will be  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the  Natural Resources Committee, and 30 minutes of which will be equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Education  and the Workforce Committee.   Mr. Speaker, the first two items are noncontroversial; however, I am  very pleased that within S. 140, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act is  included. This language would allow Tribal governments to be excluded  from requirements for employers under the National Labor Relations Act.  When President Franklin Roosevelt signed the NLRA into law in 1935,  Congress wisely excluded governments, all governments, from the  definition of ``employer.''   At the bill signing of the NLRA, President Roosevelt said: ``This Act  defines, as a part of our substantive law, the right of self- organization of employees in industry for the purpose of collective  bargaining, and provides methods by which the Government can safeguard  that legal right.''   The President made clear in his speech at that time that the intent  of the law is that it should apply only to workers in the private  sector. Tribes are governments and should be treated as such. The  intent of the law was and is clear: Tribal governments supervise the  employees within their governments and enterprises, not the Federal  Government.   From 1935 until 2003, nearly seven decades, the National Labor  Relations Board agreed and interpreted the statute in a way that did  not apply to Indian Tribes because they were governments. In 2004, the  NLRB abruptly changed course and, for the first time, held the act  applicable to Indian Tribes. The NLRB did this by highlighting the fact  that the act did not expressly include Tribal governments among those  excluded from the phrase ``employer.'' This is simply an egregious act  of bureaucratic overreach.   Let me be clear. In this case, acting on its own, the NLRB expanded  its jurisdiction. Neither the existing administration at the time nor  Congress asked or ordered the NLRB to take this action.   The impacts of labor strife on Tribal governments and economies are  more harmful than on other governments because there is no effective  tax base in Tribal communities. Indian lands are held in trust by the  United States and are not subject to taxation. The high unemployment  rates and legal restrictions make income taxation an unfeasible option.   As a result, the businesses operated by Tribal governments, gaming  operations, Tribal agriculture, energy and timber operations, and other  Tribal government enterprise constitute the sole source of revenue that  is used to fund essential government services for Tribes.   This bill has drawn bipartisan support in our effort to reverse the  decision of the NLRB. In the 114th Congress, the same language passed  the House of Representatives by a vote of 249-177.                                time  1400    This bill will strengthen Tribal sovereignty and correct this  overreach, directing the NLRB to enforce the NLRA, National Labor  Relations Act, as it was originally intended. In the end, Mr. Speaker,  all we are doing here today with this bill is affirming what was  Congress' original intent. The NLRA does not have jurisdiction over  Tribal governments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my good friend from Colorado covered a lot of ground, so  let me try to respond to some of that area because a lot of it doesn't  have a whole lot to do with the legislation until the final phase of  his remarks.   In terms of CHIP, we actually agree. I think that's something--and,  frankly, this House should be proud it passed a CHIP bill on a  bipartisan basis months ago. Our real problem is the United States  Senate simply hasn't produced legislation. It doesn't have to accept  our legislation. It just needs to pass a CHIP bill so we can go to  conference and bargain.    I am pleased that both sides, frankly, have worked to make sure that,  when we have done extensions of government spending as we work through  some of these knotty issues, we continue to fund CHIP. I think the  leadership on both sides of the aisle have been clear about that, and I  think we will. But, again, it will be great when the Senate finally  passes a bill or we make this part of a larger spending bill.  [[Page H99]]    In terms of my friend's points about the Dream Act, I am honestly  heartened at the discussion that took place at the White House  yesterday. I think there is a genuine desire to come to an agreement on  DACA. But the real issue there is border security in addition to legal  status.   These folks, obviously, I think, deserve legal status; but you also  have to fix the problem, and the problem is on the border. So the  outline of the deal is there if people approach it in good faith on  both sides of the aisle. I take the fact that we had leadership in both  parties meeting with the President yesterday as a good sign in that  regard.   In terms of the budget, we probably have at least some areas of  agreement. My friend didn't vote for it, but it is worth noting, the  House passed every single appropriations bill before the September 30  deadline. We have been waiting now for over 120 days for the United  States Senate to just pass a single appropriations bill.   We are in discussions with them now, and I think at some point, when  there is an agreement as to what the top line number is--and I think we  might not be too far away from that--then we will be able to proceed.  But again, this House has done its work. Just as it did on CHIP, it  produced legislation on time, and it is prepared to sit down and  negotiate with the Senate whenever the Senate decides it can get around  to getting its job done.   In terms of the National Labor Relations Act, the Tribal sovereignty  portion of this bill, let me point out a couple of things.   My friend does have an excellent record, honestly, in terms of  support on Native American issues. This is just an issue where we  disagree. There will be Republicans and Democrats who oppose this  legislation. There will be Republicans and Democrats who support this  legislation.   It is not really purely a partisan question at all, but it is worth  noting, the Indian community is united on this issue. The National  Congress of American Indians, over 150 Tribal organizations and  individual Tribes have come and asked the Congress to correct this  oversight.   The fact that this happened in the way it did, that is, the National  Labor Relations Board acted on its own to extend its jurisdiction, had  no instructions from Congress to do that, had no request from the  administration to do that, they just decided they would do it all, that  is my definition of a regulatory body run amuck.   For almost 70 years, the NLRB recognized that it did not have  jurisdiction in this area and did not try and do it. This is a very new  thing. It aroused opposition in Indian Country immediately.   Again, we don't apply these standards to any State government or any  local government. We have lots of State governments and lots of local  governments involved in activities that are not strictly governmental.  They run municipal golf courses. They do water parks. None of these  things are necessarily inherently government. They are not forced to  comply with this. So we should extend to Tribal government, which we  historically have done, the exact same status and rights in this regard  as we do to State and local governments.   We would all be pretty upset if the Federal Government decided it  would interject itself in this way into the affairs of any individual  State or any of the individual localities that we represent.                                time  1415    Working for a public entity is different. You certainly have rights,  but there are restrictions. You have certain rights, like the right to  strike, that in most States and most localities do not exist. Tribes  should have the same right to make those sorts of decisions for  themselves. Again, they resent and have resented historically the  violation of their sovereignty. In this case, a regulatory agency  without the authority of this body and without the authority of the  administration that existed at that time acted on its own.   What the Indian nations and Indian Country have come and asked is:  Restore us the sovereignty that you historically accorded us.   That is all this legislation does.   The last point, my friend says this is unlikely to become law. I beg  to disagree. Not only did this pass the House on a bipartisan vote in  the last Congress, but this Congress it has been reported out of the  Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on a bipartisan vote. There is every  reason to believe this. We will see what the administration does. But I  suspect views change over 25 years, and I would hope the administration  is supportive of this. As a matter of fact, as I recall, I think they  issued a statement to that effect.   So, regardless, let's do our job. Let's continue to do the job we did  in the last Congress when, on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and  Democrats alike decided Tribal sovereignty was an important issue. We  should work together to defend it and to expand it. In this case, we  are working to reclaim something that a Federal agency took away,  acting on its own, over a decade ago. So the solution to this is long  overdue.   Mr. Speaker, I would certainly urge my friends to support the rule  and, more importantly, the underlying legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I certainly respect my friend's right to bring up  a subject that they think is important and is important, and it is  appropriate that they use their time to do that.   I would remind them that there is a negotiation underway. I think the  issue here is less about DACA probably and more about border security.  The issues are naturally paired together. These young people came here  through no fault of their own. They are not responsible for any sort of  criminal act. But they were transported across a very porous border.   So to ensure that we are not here again doing the same thing again,  strengthening that border at the same time that we provide legal status  seems the appropriate thing to do. I suspect neither is achievable  without the other linked together.   So I take it that the two sides are negotiating. I am not involved in  those negotiations. I am not a member of the relevant committees, but I  think the two sides are involved in that negotiation. My hope is that  they come to an agreement and that we can have a large, bipartisan  victory and a piece of legislation that we are all proud of. But I  suspect it is going to take some give-and-take on each side to achieve  that.   I do want to go back, though, to the principal underlying legislation  here and ask my friends--many of whom, by the way, will support this  legislation. There will be considerable Democratic support for this.  But I would hope--and, again, I understand this is an issue of  competing goods, but sovereignty is not something we should grant to  States and localities and deny Indian Tribes.   We should not have a double standard here. If we need to make changes  across the entire Labor Relations Act, fair enough. I guess we should  consider that. But we should not single out Tribes and make them  subject to capricious, arbitrary, bureaucratic activity deciding on  what their legal status is, what their rights are, and interfere with  their ability to operate their own businesses, which are absolutely  indispensable to supporting their governmental activities.   We do not give Tribes the power to tax. They can't tax their own  land. They can't tax their own citizens. If they are not successful  economically, they have to rely on the limited resources given by the  Federal Government to do everything from protecting their citizens to  providing healthcare for their citizens and to making sure that there  is appropriate education for their citizens. They ought to be able to  do what other governments do and earn money and run their own affairs.   We allow States to do that. We allow localities to do that. For  almost 70 years, we allowed Indian Tribes to do that. Then we took it  away from them. They are not even asking for something new. They are  just asking for something that was taken from them, in terms of their  authority and sovereignty, to be restored to them.   Mr. Speaker, again, I go back to urging the passage of the underlying  legislation. I hope that we continue to work on these other issues that  my friends have brought up. We are working on them in areas like CHIP,  like the DACA question, and like the border security question.   But let's also take our time and pass this very important piece of  legislation and restore to Indian Tribes what the National Labor  Relations Board took away from them over a decade ago.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  respond to a couple of my friend's points.   Let me begin by disagreeing respectfully with my friend's assertion  that people are having their rights stripped away.   The only people losing their rights here are Indian Tribes. That is  what happened when the NLRB did what it did. Without the direction of  Congress or the administration, it decided on its own it would treat  Indian Tribal governments different than it treated other governments.  So it is those rights to the Tribal governments that we are busy trying  to restore.   My friend, who, again, is very good on Indian issues, as a rule, and  I understand the competing claims here. So I recognize the tension that  is involved in that. But it is not as if Tribal governments don't have  their own labor codes and their own standards. Frankly, those have to  comply with American law.   Under the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1965, there is absolutely  nothing that a Tribal government can do that would contravene the  guaranteed rights in the United States Constitution for all Americans.   So to suggest that they are somehow violating the rights of American  workers, I think, is to mischaracterize who they are and how they have  acted. What they have said is, if we are sovereign, if the Federal  Government says that State governments and local governments are  allowed to regulate their own workforces, then Tribal governments are  allowed to do the same.   I want to disagree also with my friend. There are lots of municipal  golf courses in the United States. There are lots of municipal water  slides. There are park systems. You can go to the State of Virginia and  it happens to own the liquor business in the State. It has decided it  is going to make that a State function. We don't regulate those  employees.   So the idea that just because it is a money-making activity, that we  then somehow treat it differently, we don't do that to any locality or  any State in the country.   We just had an unelected Federal agency decide on its own it was  going to do that to Indian Tribes. It is not doing it to anybody else,  just to Tribes. I would submit that that is fundamentally unfair.  Again, nobody's rights are taken away. Every American citizen has  exactly the same right.   But if you were to go to work for the Federal Government, you don't  have precisely the same rights you do in the private sector. The same  thing is true here. If you choose to go to work for a Tribal  government, you live within that regime. That regime has to comport  with the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and you have  not lost your action rights in Federal court if you think there is a  violation.    So I think, frankly, this is a case that is crystal clear. You treat  everybody the same way, every governmental unit the same way. That is  all the Tribes are asking for.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), a distinguished member of both the Rules Committee and the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, and I want to stress that, while we  disagree on this, I appreciate his efforts in Native American issues.  He has a record that, I think, is an excellent record overall. We just  disagree very profoundly in this case.   I will say this: if you happened to just casually turn on the  coverage of the debate at any point, you might wonder what we were  debating about. In the course of the debate, we have talked about CHIP,  we have talked about the DREAMers, we have talked about the budget, we  have talked about FISA. We have spent a lot of time talking about a lot  of different things other than the information at hand. I don't  begrudge my friend. He feels very passionately about those areas.    It is interesting to me that, on the FISA issue, for instance, we  will actually have a debate tomorrow. The amendment my friend supports  will be in order tomorrow. We will have an opportunity to do that.   I think there are good faith efforts underway on both sides on the  DACA issue and on the issue of FISA, particularly on the issue of the  budget as well. Again, I wish this place worked a little differently.  Sometimes deadlines are like alarm clocks here, but those things are  underway.   What we are talking about today is also an effort that has been waged  by Indian nations for over a dozen years to try and reclaim part of  their sovereignty that was unjustly taken away from them.   I am going to disagree with my friend very profoundly. Nobody's  rights have been taken away. Every American's rights are guaranteed by  the Constitution of the United States. The Indian Civil Rights Act of  1965 makes it abundantly clear no Tribe can do anything in  contravention and restrict the rights of Americans.   The only people who have lost rights in this whole discussion and  episode have been Tribal governments who had their right to regulate  their labor affairs, the same way we allow States and localities to do  it, taken away from them.   It wasn't taken away from them by an act of this Congress. We never  passed legislation. It wasn't taken away from this because the  administration ordered some agency of the executive branch to do  something. It was taken away because, acting in a rogue manner, the  National Labor Relations Board, on its own, decided it would expand its  legal authority.   Well, that is great. They may have a case to make. But that is not  what they are supposed to do. They are supposed to operate within the  authority Congress gives them. If they think they need a grant of  additional authority, they come to Congress and ask for that grant of  additional authority. They don't simply, on their own, decide they will  willy-nilly violate the rights of a sovereign Native American nation.  That is exactly what happened in this case. Frankly, the Tribes have  been extraordinarily patient in pursuing the remedy to this.   I think we ought to, today, take the opportunity to rectify a wrong  that an agency of the executive branch did without the consent of  Congress or even without the consent of the President of the United  States at the time and allow Tribes to reclaim the authority that they  exercised for over 70 years.   If we think we need to do something different in that regard, that is  a fair point to make. If we do, it needs to be the same for State  governments and local governments. You don't single Tribes out of  sovereign entities and impose something on them that doesn't apply to  everybody else that is a sovereign of the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I encourage all Members to support the rule,  but I recognize my friends probably will not, and that is fair enough.  That is normal partisan debate.   But with S. 140, the House is taking steps to strengthen Tribal  sovereignty. This body actually has a pretty good record. I worked with  my friends across the aisle when we passed the Violence  [[Page H103]]  Against Women Act, which had a very important component giving Tribes  back some of the jurisdiction that they needed to regulate domestic  abuse and sexual assault on their own territory.                                time  1445    My friends were overwhelmingly supportive and helpful in that  measure. It would not have happened without them, so I know in many  cases we do agree. But in this case, under this bill, Tribal  governments will be able to be excluded from the requirements for  employers under the NLRA, just like State and local governments.   This legislation will reverse the bureaucratic overreach of the NLRB  and clarify the law once and for all. This bill is a commonsense  solution that will clarify the original intent of Congress that the  NLRA does not have jurisdiction over Tribal governments.   I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this work. We  will actually have a split decision over this. There will certainly be  some Republicans supporting my friend's position, but by and large, I  think this House will do what it did the last time it considered this  legislation, and that is, on a bipartisan basis, pass the law.   This time, given the action of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee,  we have every reason to believe the legislation will be picked up and  sent to the President's desk, where I am confident it will be signed.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 681 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
