 Mr. Speaker, April is Mathematics and  Statistics Awareness Month.   President Ronald Reagan designated this month in 1986. He said, in  part:   ``Despite the increasing importance of mathematics to the progress of  our economy and society, enrollment in mathematics programs has been  declining at all levels of the American educational system.   ``Yet the application of mathematics is indispensable in such diverse  fields as medicine, computer sciences, space exploration, the skilled  trades, business, defense, and government. To help encourage the study  and utilization of mathematics, it is appropriate that all Americans be  reminded of the importance of this basic branch of science to our daily  lives.''   Mr. Speaker, these words still resonate today.   Math plays a significant role in addressing many real-world problems:  internet security, sustainability, disease, and much more.   Research in these and other areas is ongoing, revealing new results  and applications every day in fields such as medicine, manufacturing,  energy, biotechnology, and business.   In our growing technological world, the study of math and statistics  is one that will continue to be critically important. Happy Mathematics  and Statistics Awareness Month.                            ____________________
