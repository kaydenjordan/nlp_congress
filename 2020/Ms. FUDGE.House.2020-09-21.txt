 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5309, the  Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act--also known  as the C.R.O.W.N. Act.   Too often African Americans are required to meet unreasonable  standards of grooming in the workplace and in the classroom with  respect to our hair. Most of those standards are cultural norms that  coincide with the texture and style of Black hair.   In 2014, my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues and I successfully  pushed the U.S. military to reverse its rules classifying hairstyles  often worn by female soldiers of color as ``unauthorized''. The  military's regulation used words like ``unkempt'' and ``matted'' when  referring to traditional African American hairstyles.   To require anyone to change their natural appearance to further their  career or education is a clear violation of their civil rights.   A 2019 study by Dove found Black women are 30 percent more likely to  receive a formal grooming policy in the workplace. Black women are also  1.5 times more likely to report being forced to leave work or know of a  Black woman who was forced to leave work because of her hair.   This is unacceptable.   Seven states agree, including California, New York, New Jersey,  Virginia, Colorado, Washington, and Maryland. All have enacted laws  banning racial hair discrimination. It is past time we ban the practice  at the federal level.   The CROWN Act does that--by federally prohibiting discrimination  based on hair styles and hair textures commonly associated with a  particular race or national origin.   I was proud to introduce this bill with my friend Congressman  Richmond, which ensures African Americans no longer have to be afraid  to show up to work or the classroom as anything other than who they  are.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the CROWN Act.
