 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2214, the National Origin-Based  Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act, or the No BAN Act, is  critical legislation that will stop executive overreach, defend  Congress' role in establishing our Nation's immigration laws, and right  one of the original sins of the Trump administration: the Muslim ban.   When the Trump administration issued its first version of the ban in  January 2017, it was immediately apparent that it was unconstitutional,  discriminatory, and morally reprehensible. Its chaotic rollout only  magnified the cruelty underlying this policy.   When news first broke that people were being detained at the  airports, I immediately rushed to JFK Airport that morning along with  Congresswoman Velazquez. Within hours, we were joined by hundreds of  demonstrators demanding justice. What we found was chaos and  heartbreak. Refugees, people with valid visas, and even legal permanent  residents, people who had assisted American troops and saved their  lives in Iraq were prevented from entering the country or even speaking  with their attorneys.   We met people like Hameed Khalid Darweesh, an Iraqi who put his life  on the line for 10 years to work with American and coalition forces as  a translator. He underwent a years-long extensive vetting process to  secure a  [[Page H3630]]  Special Immigrant Visa granted to people who assist our military in  Iraq and Afghanistan. In return for his efforts, this hero was welcomed  to the United States with a door slammed in his face and a grueling  ordeal at the airport as he pleaded for his freedom.   I am pleased that Congresswoman Velazquez and I were able to work  with officials in New York and Washington to secure his release  eventually, but we should never have had to do that. That is not the  country we are proud to represent in Congress. We do not betray those  who save American troops.    Although the President's initial Muslim ban was ultimately blocked by  numerous courts, in 2018, after protracted litigation and several court  injunctions, the Supreme Court unfortunately upheld the third version  of the ban, Presidential Proclamation 9645.   The Court reached this decision based on its broad reading of section  212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which authorizes the  President to ``suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens''  when the President finds that such entry ``would be detrimental to the  interests of the United States.''   I strongly disagree with the Court's broad interpretation of that  provision. Section 212(f) was intended to give the President discretion  to quickly address emergent issues involving public health, national  security, public safety, or international stability. It was not  intended to provide carte blanche authority to the President to ban  large categories of individuals without justification or to rewrite  immigration laws with which he disagrees.   That is why this legislation is so important. H.R. 2214 will repeal  these shameful bans and stop executive overreach by amending 212(f) to  prevent any President from using it in a manner that is unlawful or  unconscionable.   The United States has always been and must continue to be a place  that welcomes and embraces people of all religions and all  nationalities. But as a result of the Muslim ban, our country's  reputation as a beacon of hope, tolerance, and inclusion for those  fleeing persecution, reuniting with their families, or simply seeking a  better life has been forever tarnished.   I would like to thank my friend and colleague Representative Chu for  introducing this legislation and for her leadership and commitment to  this issue.   I also want to thank the NO BAN coalition, led by Muslim Advocates,  and all of the many organizations whose support was vital to bringing  this bill to the floor today. It is long overdue.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the NO BAN Act,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1045     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu), the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Rose).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I find it extremely disingenuous to deny the nature of  the Muslim ban. You know why? Because the President told us so. He told  us he was going to institute a Muslim ban, and then he did it. And  every country he put on the list was Muslim. Every country he has added  to the list was Muslim.   Only Muslims and Muslim countries pose threats to the United States  of any nature; no one else in the world does? How stupid does he think  we are?   This is a Muslim ban. It has been. It is an abuse of his office. It  is an abuse of the law. It must be repealed. The honor of the United  States must be redeemed. And that is why this dishonorable, hateful  policy must be repealed. And that is why we must vote for this bill, to  redeem the honor of the United States from the disgusting religious  bigotry supported by the President and instituted by the President in  this ban.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5581, the Access to  Counsel Act of 2020.   Last September, the Judiciary Committee and the House Foreign Affairs  Committee held a hearing to explore the Muslim ban, including the chaos  that unfolded at airports across the country when it was first  announced.   I can personally attest to that chaos, based on my experience at JFK  Airport immediately after the ban was implemented. Refugees,  individuals with valid visas, and even lawful permanent residents of  the United States were detained for hours and prevented from speaking  with attorneys. Some even had their phones taken away and were unable  to call their family members.   Although the issue grabbed the headlines then, it is unfortunately a  problem that occurs daily. Due to the complexity of the U.S.  immigration law and the fact-intensive nature of questions regarding  admissibility, it is not uncommon for some people to spend hours  undergoing inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.   During this time, individuals are often prevented from communicating  with those on the outside. And if the individual is lucky enough to  have a lawyer, CBP will often refuse to speak with them, even if they  can provide critical information or correct a legal error.   Moreover, serious consequences can result from being refused  admission. For example, an individual who is given an expedited removal  order is barred from returning to the United States for 5 years.   H.R. 5581 will ensure that no one who presents themselves at a port  of entry with valid travel documents is completely cut off from the  world during inspection. H.R. 5581 allows such individuals, including  U.S. citizens, to communicate with counsel and other parties if they  are subjected to secondary inspection that lasts longer than one hour.   To be clear, this bill does not provide a right to counsel, nor does  it impose any obligation on the Federal Government to pay for or  otherwise provide counsel to individuals during CBP inspection  proceedings. I wish it did, but it doesn't. This is confirmed by the  fact that the Congressional Budget Office found that H.R. 5581 would  have no effect on direct spending or revenues.   I would like to extend a special thanks to my colleague,  Representative Jayapal, for her leadership on this issue and for  championing this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support it, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume again  to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.                                time  1200     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).    Madam Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I find it bizarre to suggest that you shouldn't vote  for a bill because some other bill may do something that you don't  like. This bill does not provide--I personally think maybe it would be  a good idea, but that is not this bill. This bill does not provide for  funded counsel in any way. It doesn't do that. Maybe I should introduce  a bill to do that. That is not this bill, so let's forget about that.   This bill simply says that if an individual is held--an individual  who may be an America citizen, who may be a green card holder, who if  improperly, by mistake, is sent out of the country and may be forbidden  from applying to come back in for 5 years, with all kinds of problems,  who may be a cancer researcher who is supposed to work at Rockefeller  Institute or Johns Hopkins or wherever and would be denied his or her  talents because of a mistake.   All this bill says is that if someone is held in secondary inspection  for at least an hour, they must be given an opportunity to call  counsel, to call other people, to call their brother-in-law, to call  whoever, and to communicate. That is all the bill says.   I fail to understand why it is at all controversial. It will prevent  the kind of tragic mistakes that have been made in the past. It will  prevent the kind of confusion that we saw, that I personally saw at the  airport when people were held for hours and hours and weren't permitted  to talk to counsel standing outside the door, when I physically had to  prevent the door from closing and dared them to arrest a Member of  Congress in order to allow an immigrant with valid papers to speak to  an attorney who was standing on the other side of the door.   That is what this bill is. It is simple. It is humane. It is  commonsensical and ought to be adopted. I urge everyone to vote for  this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
