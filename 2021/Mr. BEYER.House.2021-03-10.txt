 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, my vote today for the American Rescue Plan will be the  most consequential vote I have ever cast.   Today, we show that democracy works.   Today, we make available all the resources needed to end a pandemic  that has killed 527,000 Americans.   Today, we lift millions of American children out of poverty.   Today, we make the investment to get our children back to school  safely.   Today, we authorize economic income payments to millions of our  citizens behind on their rents and car payments and unable to buy  groceries.   Today, we extend unemployment insurance for the 10 percent of  Americans still out of work because of the virus.   Today, we send national help to those State and local governments who  employed the heroes who provide our quality of life: police,  firefighters, teachers, child protective service workers, sanitation  workers, and many others.   And, today, we reject the social Darwinism of our Republican friends.  We reject the ethic of every man, woman, and child for themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to vote for this bill today.
