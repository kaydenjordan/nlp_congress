 Mr. Speaker, when Bianca Ramirez left her  Massachusetts home one Sunday morning for a jog, she had no idea it  would be the worst morning of her life. Shortly after she began  running, she was blindsided by a strange man in broad daylight. He  choked her into unconsciousness and dragged her into the bushes,  brutally beating her.   When she came to nearly 30 minutes later, she realized the horror  that had happened to her. With the help of counseling and other victim  resources, Bianca is a survivor, and the criminal went to prison.   Mr. Speaker, this is National Crime Victims' Rights Week. During this  week, we remember the evil that victims like Bianca have endured.  Victims like Bianca are the reason that Congressman  Jim Costa and I  formed the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus, with the goal of  ending modern-day slavery and giving victims a voice on the national  level.   In honor of National Crime Victims' Rights Week, I ask Members to  join me to honor and be a voice for victims of crime in America.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
