 Madam President, before I make any remarks in the Senate,  I want to make remarks of a specific and personal nature to the  Presiding Officer. The last time we were together was election night.  And it was a wonderful night for you, for your family, and for the  State of Illinois. Your victory was an amazing achievement, but your  whole life has been an amazing achievement. And I particularly will  remember when Brian brought the girls up to the stage, and they jumped  all over their mom in her wheelchair. It was something that made the  news and should have. It was a wonderful moment for you and your  family. But it was a wonderful moment in American politics.   Your re-election in the State of Illinois was my No. 1 priority. And  I didn't have to work as hard as I thought I would because they love  you, and it showed in the vote. So congratulations to the Presiding  Officer.   Madam President, in the fall of 1862, President Abraham Lincoln sent  his second annual message to Congress. The Civil War was raging, and  our Nation was really uncertain as to its future.   In the midst of what Lincoln called this ``fiery trial,'' he called  on Congress to do something that was remarkable: to assure the freedom  of every American, including the nearly 4 million Black Americans  living in bondage. President Lincoln said this was the only way to  ``save . . . the last best hope of earth,'' American democracy.   Last Tuesday, 160 years later, Americans across the country stood up,  went to the polls, and did their part, in their time, to save the last  best hope of earth. They voted to protect our fundamental freedoms and  to preserve our democracy.   One of those voters was a young woman in our State named Lauren. She  is a student at the University of Illinois in Champaign. The students  at the university once again had to wait for hours in line. People were  bringing pizzas to sustain them during their trial of waiting to vote.  It worked. They voted in big numbers. And Lauren was one of them.   While she was waiting in line, a reporter with the Illinois Student  Newsroom asked her, ``Why, why did you come out here and vote?''   She said:         I was voting based on women's rights in terms of candidates       who were supporting women's choice. . . . It's important--as       a student--as a young person to come out and vote for issues       that I care about.    Thankfully, Lauren wasn't alone. In this year's election, young  voters continued a trend that began in 2018 and 2020: They turned out  in record numbers. They realized it is the responsibility of their  generation to do a better job than our generation and to keep democracy  alive.  [[Page S6638]]    So let's start off by thanking the young people: the sons and  daughters who were raised properly when it came to their civic duty,  who voted for the first time last week--and, for some, it was a repeat  performance--along with every other American. With their votes, they  sent a message to us and to the rest of America that was loud and  clear: It is time for the Big Lie to die.   Last week, in State after State, voters rejected MAGA Republicans who  ran on this Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen. This outrageous  assertion, with no proof, no evidence and nothing to back it up other  than the big liar, has become rampant among some corners of this  country. But thank the Lord that it did not prevail on election day.   In fact, every single election denier who ran for Secretary of State  in a swing State was defeated--every single one of them. So the  takeaway here isn't all that complicated. I hope it is one that our  Republican colleagues will finally take to heart: It is time to reject  that extremist lie.   The American people are sick and tired of false claims that the 2020  election was stolen--the same claims that generated the insurrectionist  mob, which on one of the saddest days in the history of this building  stormed this Capitol on January 6, 2021, injuring over 149 law  enforcement officials who were doing their duty to protect this  building and the people in it and, sadly, leading to six deaths. Now  the threats of violence continue.   After the election and the American people have spoken, can we  finally join together in a bipartisan fashion to condemn all forms of  violence, regardless of their political origin? It is inconsistent with  the democracy that we can be proud of. And, yes, the American people  are also sick and tired of rightwing assaults on our fundamental  freedoms.   That young voter in Champaign I mentioned, Lauren, she is just one of  millions of Americans motivated to vote after the Supreme Court's Dobbs  decision earlier this year. By erasing the constitutional right to  abortion--a right that millions of Americans have counted on for half a  century--the Court's radical rightwing majority lit a fire in the  hearts of voters across the country. And it wasn't just in the blue  States. In the minority leader's home State of Kentucky--Kentucky-- voters rejected an anti-abortion ballot measure.   The lesson here at this moment isn't that a Democratic or Republican  issue is at stake. This is about a basic constitutional right taken  away from the women of this country--the right to make their own  decisions about their own reproductive health choices. People don't  want politicians--Senators, Congressmen, you name it--sticking their  nose into the business of doctors in the hospitals and clinics across  America. We need to respect the will of the people and protect the  right to choose once and for all.    Let me also add something that happened over the weekend that bears  comment. There has been a lot of loose talk as to whether or not this  U.S. Supreme Court is too political. It has fallen in approval ratings  to record lows. The American people think it has been dominated by  political decisions and political choices.   So what did four of the nine Supreme Court Justices do over the  weekend? They attended the Federalist Society gala ball here in  Washington. The Federalist Society is an obvious political force which  chose many of them under President Trump and others, and they basically  fed the story line that this Supreme Court is enthralled with the  Federalist Society.   You could not become a Federal judge--and I know this from serving on  the Judiciary Committee--under Presidents of the Republican Party in  recent times without the stamp of approval from the Federalist Society.  In fact, their stamp of approval is even more important than being  judged ``qualified'' by the American Bar Association. Nine Federal  judges chosen by President Trump failed to be deemed qualified to serve  on the Federal courts of our land, but they have been stamped  ``approved'' by the Federalist Society.   This powerful political force had a party, and they invited members  of the Supreme Court. Four of the nine members of the Court came to  that party: Justice Alito, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and  Justice Barrett. How can they dispel the belief many people have that  they are too political when they attend such overtly political events?   That wasn't the only thing we learned. One of the top issues the  American people were concerned about was the state of the economy--and  rightly so. My wife does most of the shopping, but I get around to  grocery stores in Illinois, my hometown, once in a while and take a  look at the price of things. It is clear they have gone up for almost  anything. You can't miss the price of gasoline; it is right there in  front of you every single day. It must create--it does create--a  hardship for American families.   It makes sense to understand historically why we are facing this. We  are still recovering from a once-in-a-century pandemic. Like every  nation, inflation has hit working families the hardest. But the  American people also recognize that this Senate majority has made  steady, meaningful progress in working against inflation. We can't will  it away. We can't pass a law to ban it. We can't expect even the  Federal Reserve, by their monetary policy, to dispense with inflation  in a quick way. We have a large, complicated economy. It is part of the  global economy. We have to work together--and we have--to help working  families pay their bills and stay afloat.   Just a few months ago, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act on the  floor. I remember that well, and I am sure the Presiding Officer does  too. We had 41 rollcalls--41 rollcalls. It went all through the night.  I think it was at least 24 hours or more, maybe 36 hours. We went  straight through to finish it and get it done, and we did. In the end,  the bill passed with only Democratic support. Every Republican voted  against it. I am sorry that was the case because there are things in  there the Republicans should join us in supporting.   Telling people on Medicare that they are never going to have to pay  more than $2,000 out of pocket for prescription drugs is a great  relief. You and I both know that the cost of prescription drugs in some  cases ranges into the tens of thousands of dollars, breaking the backs  of a lot of families finding that they are basically disbursing all of  their savings for that purpose. Now we guarantee with that bill a  maximum charge out of pocket of $2,000 a year.   If you happen to be on Medicare and are diabetic, we capped the cost  of insulin each month to $35.   Insulin was discovered by Canadian researchers. When they discovered  it, the doctors who came up with this wonderful drug said: We are going  to surrender our patent rights for $1. We are finished. We don't  believe any life-or-death drug should be bargained away to  pharmaceutical companies.   Unfortunately, it has been. This changed for Medicare. Capping the  cost of insulin means that many people who are diabetic will be able to  take their medicine and afford it. That is a great thing for our  future.   Do you recall, Madam President, when we had this on the floor and we  tried to extend the same $35 insulin charge to all other diabetics in  the United States, not just Medicare? We needed 10 of the 50  Republicans to join us--10 of 50--to cap the cost of insulin for all  diabetics in America. We failed. Only 7 Republicans would join the 50  Democrats. We needed 60 votes; we got 57.   I heard this President say--and I am sure you have too--he is going  back to this issue, and he should. This is something that should be  bipartisan and pass very quickly.    In the Inflation Reduction Act, we started making changes when it  comes to energy policy in America.   I think the young people voting were really motivated by several  things. They were motivated by the threats of losing protections  against discrimination for sexual orientation. They were motivated by  the Dobbs decision on choice. But they were motivated as well because  we made it clear, at least on our side of the aisle, that we were going  to move forward with an energy policy which is going to address global  warming and give them an Earth they can live on. I think that is an  important part of the future.   I am not bragging, but I will tell you that several months ago, as  you know, I put solar panels on my home in Springfield. My wife and I  decided it  [[Page S6639]]  was the right thing to do even if it didn't pencil out economically.  Guess what. It is working great. The first bill we were able to compare  with the previous year, we ended up generating more electricity than we  purchased in the course of a month. I hope that continues. That  dramatic reduction in my energy costs is also an investment in  sustainable, renewable energy for the future. Those solar panels  enhance the value of the home we live in.   We estimate that 280,000 families in our home State of Illinois are  going to install solar panels. I am encouraging them to do that as  quickly as possible. They are going to find great savings, and they are  going to join us in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that  threaten our future.   We also understand that we have to do much more in these fields,  whether it is the cost of healthcare or whether it is the climate  crisis in our country.   We want to make sure as well that the burden of government's costs is  fairly shared. How can we possibly explain or rationalize that many of  the wealthiest corporations in America don't pay their fair share of  taxes? Families across America know they have to face their civic  responsibility and pay their taxes. Very few of those families are  applauding, but they are hoping that the basic social contract holds  and that every corporation as well as an individual will pay their fair  share. We moved in that direction with that bill.   These policies in terms of tax fairness are popular, and we saw that  proof last Tuesday in the vote. The American people reelected a  Democratic majority to the Senate because I believe they support the  work we are doing.   I want to just comment on the statements made earlier by the minority  leader from Kentucky. He really generalized the midterm election as if  it was something other than what I saw.   A midterm election is tough on the President's party. Historically,  every President has taken a beating. I can recall when my colleague  from Illinois was President, Barack Obama. His midterm election he  characterized as a shellacking, and he was right. I believe they lost  40 or 50 seats in that election. It happens, but it didn't happen last  Tuesday.   We have to ask ourselves a basic question: If the Senator from  Kentucky is right and everybody rejects what this President has done  and rejects what the Democratic majority did, why didn't he do better?  Why didn't his party do better? There is much more to the story.   We have the opportunity to build on the Senate's proud record of  accomplishments starting again this week, and we should. Listen to what  the American people told us. They told us: Roll up your sleeves, stop  bickering, ignore the Big Lie because it is a big lie, and do something  together. Show us cooperation. Can you do it?   Well, I will tell you, I reached out already to two of my Republican  colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee, asking them to think  about whether we can achieve anything in the next 3 or 4 weeks. I am  hoping that we can. It was a good-faith effort on my part to say: Yes,  we might have prevailed and we continue in the majority, but we can't  get anything done unless we work together. I think that is what the  American people are begging us to do now.   I will basically say that this bipartisanship is an easy task when  you have Members on the other side who are willing to join with you.  Our most basic duty, though, our most basic thing we can accomplish  between now and the end of the year is make sure we don't face a  government shutdown. Who can imagine that is good for the United  States, our reputation in the world, our economy, or the people who are  counting on us, to let the government shut down?   I am hopeful that in the coming weeks, before the first of the year,  we can negotiate and pass an Omnibus appropriations package with  bipartisan support. I am also hopeful that we can address that sword of  Damocles hanging over our heads called the debt ceiling. From where I  am sitting, the debt ceiling should be eliminated. It basically is a  promise that we are going to pay the bills we have already incurred.  Well, we wouldn't have voted for the bills if we didn't think we had to  pay for them.   So this debt ceiling has to be renewed on a regular basis and has  become a bargaining point for some extremists in Congress who argue  that shutting down the government won't even be noticed by the American  people. They are wrong. They have done it before, and we noticed. It  was not good for our country, and we don't need it at this moment in  history.   This week, we will also continue rebalancing the Federal judiciary by  confirming highly qualified, evenhanded judges who will bring diversity  to the Federal bench and who will defend our basic rights.   During this legislative session, we can do something Americans have  been waiting on for decades: reform our broken immigration system.  Everybody is talking about it. Now let's do something about it on a  bipartisan basis. We can, and we should.   For the people--and the exact number, I am not sure--but thousands,  tens of thousands protected by DACA are waiting to see if one judge in  Texas is going to force them into deportation. Think about that.  Thousands and thousands of young people were brought to the United  States by their parents, grew up here, went to our schools, pledged  allegiance to that flag every day in their classroom, and want to be  part of America, and we have been unable and unwilling to come to a  bipartisan agreement as to how to give them that chance.    I beg my Republican colleagues--particularly those who are leaving  and told me privately that they have always wanted to vote for the  Dream Act and this time they will--give us a chance to work together to  come up with a good, sensible approach to our border; a good, sensible  approach to the Dream Act; and to help bring in workers we desperately  need for agriculture and for some specialties in healthcare where we  are having severe shortages in this country. We can do this. There is  no reason we can't do it. We have the basic legislation.   Let's really do something we can be proud of in the closing days of  this year. I can think of no better way to show the American people  that we were listening on November 8. After years of obstruction, we  need bipartisanship. I know that means compromises by me as well as by  them, but that is the nature of the Senate.   Millions of voters turned out across America last week. They  challenged us in the Senate. They challenged us to continue making real  progress for working families in this country. Let's show them we can  get it done.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin),  the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper), the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) are  necessarily absent.
