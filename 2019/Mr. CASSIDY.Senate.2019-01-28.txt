 Mr. President, today I want to speak as a Senator  and a physician. Many know that I am a doctor, but specifically I am a  hepatologist. I studied and treated those with liver disease. One of my  colleagues, Dr. Louis Balart, just passed away; a friend who treated  many patients with liver disease and made an incredible impact upon the  lives of those whom he treated in the State of Louisiana and indeed  across the Nation. Dr. Balart has a remarkable story. His family came  to the United States from Cuba when he was a child. His father escaped  Cuba after his family was sent ahead to the States by drinking blood  that he had drained from his own body. He went to the Cuban captors and  said, ``I'm bleeding internally, I need to go to Miami to get  treated.'' As a doctor himself, he knew that this would happen. With  this remarkable story, he was able to rejoin his family that had moved  to the United States, fleeing Castro's Cuba. As is the case of many  such stories, the family succeeded tremendously, Louis Balart being  among them. I mentioned before that he was an influential physician,  but he was also a teacher with LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans  and Tulane School of Medicine. He also headed the liver transplant unit  at the Tulane Medical Center. He passed his gifts down and now his son,  Carter Balart, is a gastroenterologist in Baton Rouge, whom I have had  the pleasure of working on patients with. Today I honor Dr. Louis  Balart, a father, husband, and physician who contributed greatly to his  adopted country, the United States of America. He left it richer  because of his presence.                            ____________________
