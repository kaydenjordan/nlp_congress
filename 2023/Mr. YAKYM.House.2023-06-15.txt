 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the newest State  champions to come out of Indiana's Second District.   Last weekend, the Penn High School softball team won the 4A State  Championship for the second time in school history. The return of State  champs was 24 years in the making for the Lady Kingsmen.   It wasn't easy. To take home the trophy, the Kingsmen first had to go  through two-time defending champs Indianapolis Roncalli.   With the score tied 1-1 going into extra innings, Head Coach Beth  Zachary knew that her team was going to do whatever it took to pull out  a win. That is exactly what the Kingsmen did, eventually prevailing 2-1  after an exhilarating nine innings.   Congratulations to Coach Zachary and all the Lady Kingsmen on your  big win and an incredible season.   Thank you for making Hoosiers and north central Indiana and beyond so  incredibly proud.   God bless you, and Go Kingsmen.                            ____________________
