 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 440 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 440         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for further       consideration of the bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize       appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities       of the Department of Defense and for military construction,       to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal       year, and for other purposes.        Sec. 2. (a) No further amendment to the bill, as amended,       shall be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution and       amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution.        (b) Each further amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules shall be considered only in the order       printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole.        (c) All points of order against the further amendments       printed in the report of the Committee on Rules or amendments       en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution are waived.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time for the chair of       the Committee on Armed Services or his designee to offer       amendments en bloc consisting of amendments printed in the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution       not earlier disposed of. Amendments en bloc offered pursuant       to this section shall be considered as read, shall be       debatable for 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Armed Services or their designees, shall not be subject to       amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division       of the question in the House or in the Committee of the       Whole.        Sec. 4.  At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment pursuant to this resolution the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 440 provides for a complete  consideration of H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2018. The rule allows for consideration of 122 amendments  in addition to the amendments made in order by yesterday's rule.   This brings the total number of amendments made in order for full  consideration to 210. When you add in the 275 amendments offered during  the Armed Services Committee markup, we will, in total, have considered  485 amendments to this year's NDAA.   Just as important, there is a clear bipartisan split between the  number of majority and the number of minority amendments made in order.   Mr. Speaker, this has been an incredibly open process that allowed  Members of this body from both sides to have their input on this  critical national security legislation.   Like other years, the NDAA is a great example of the House working  through regular order in the authorizing process and getting the job  done.   Thanks to this rule and the one we passed yesterday, the House will  debate a number of issues where Members of this body have diverse  views. From the future of GTMO to the future of the New START, the two  NDAA rules provide for a robust debate on many important topics. That  is a good thing, and I look forward to the debate.  [[Page H5775]]    Before I continue, I want to briefly thank the staff in both the  Armed Services Committee and the Rules Committee for their hard work on  this rule. Dealing with this large number of amendments takes a  considerable amount of time, and I know I speak for the entire body,  both the majority and minority, in expressing our gratitude for their  time and work in helping the members of the Rules Committee come to  this product.   Yesterday, I outlined my strong support for this year's NDAA, which  will help keep the American people safe and secure, so I won't rehash  all those points. But I want to share some numbers that highlight the  readiness crisis facing our military. This crisis has been caused by  cuts to defense spending. This bill authorizes funding for the military  at $688.3 billion, which is 16.8 percent of total Federal outlays and  3.4 percent of projected gross domestic product.   As a guiding point, 30 years ago, the fiscal year 1988 NDAA  represented 27.3 percent of total Federal outlays. This year, 16  percent; back then, 27 percent. And 5.2 percent of projected GDP. This  year, 3.4 percent; back then, 5.2 percent.   We are spending less proportionately today on our military, despite  the fact that we face a wider range of threats across the globe. That  should be troubling to every American.   Let's think about the threat environment we faced 30 years ago: the  Soviet Union. That was about it. There was no ISIS or al-Qaida or other  radical Islamic terrorist organizations threatening the United States  30 years ago. Iran was not an existential threat to the American people  30 years ago. North Korea wasn't developing nuclear weapons and  ballistic missiles 30 years ago. China was not on the radar as it  relates to a military power 30 years ago. We weren't worried about  cyber attacks or cyber espionage 30 years ago.   It is safe to say the world was a lot different 30 years ago, yet we  were devoting a greater portion of our Federal budget to the military.  We must make that same or an even greater commitment today. For too  long, we, in Congress, have allowed our military to steadily atrophy,  bringing us to a readiness crisis. Providing for our national defense  is the most important job of this Congress, and this bill helps  rebuild, repair, and reform our military.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 440 and  the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, now that the gentleman's motion to adjourn has been  defeated by a wide, bipartisan majority, the House can get back to work  and do the people's business. I want to go back over some statistics we  talked about earlier. This rule makes in order for floor consideration  210 amendments which are on top of the 275 amendments that were offered  in the Armed Services Committee.   Now, let's go back to the days when the NDAA was considered on this  floor and this floor was under the majority's control on the other side  of the aisle. Let's start with 2007. 135 amendments were offered; only  50 were made in order.   In 2009, 129 amendments were offered; only 58 were made in order.   In 2010, 129 were offered; only 69 were made in order.   In 2011, 193 were offered; only 82 were made in order.   And we are making in order in this rule, and yesterday's rule, 210.  This has been an open process by any measure.   The gentleman also referred to the fact that there are other needs in  America that are not being met because we are spending money on  defending the United States of America.   Let me go back and remind what I said earlier. Only 16.8 percent of  next year's Federal outlay will go to defending America if we adopt the  National Defense Authorization Act as passed by the committee, less  than 20 percent. That means almost 85 percent of Federal outlays are  going to go to every other thing that we do in government. If there is  a problem with something not being paid for, it is not because of the  money we are spending on national defense.   Then finally, the gentleman's comments about the need for us to make  sure that we are properly authorized as we engage in military  activities abroad; I do agree with him. We have had some mission creep  over the last several years. We have gone from Iraq and Afghanistan,  under President Obama, to Syria, to Libya, to Yemen, and many of us on  both sides of the aisles decried the fact that we did that.   It is, indeed, our responsibility, not the President's  responsibility, to declare war, to authorize the use of military force.  That is why this rule makes in order an amendment by the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) that will set in place a process that will lead to  the consideration on this floor of the Authorization for Use of  Military Force.   So I believe this rule does exactly what the people of America expect  us to do, and that is to stay in this room, stay on this floor, and act  on the National Defense Authorization Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is right. Workforce training is  very important, and that is why we passed on this floor a few weeks ago  the reauthorization of the Perkins Act--not by a bipartisan majority,  by a 100 percent vote.   We have other bills that we are considering in the Education and the  Workforce Committee that will deal with that because it is important  that we build the workforce in America. But you don't do that in the  National Defense Authorization Act. That is what we are here today  about.   I am afraid my colleagues on the other side have forgotten what this  bill is about. It is about making the people of America safe and  secure. We will deal with those other issues, as important as they are,  in other legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I  think that his issue comes within the broader question about the  authorization of military force in various parts of the Middle East. I  think he raises an important point. There is an amendment made in order  under this rule that will put in place a process to get us to that  debate.   I appreciate what he just said. I hope that he will hold that idea,  and when we have that debate on the floor, will bring it back so we can  consider it among those other items we will consider at that time. I  appreciate what he just said. This is not the place or the time to take  that up.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I really believe very strongly we need to do  more in workforce training in America. I am a former chancellor of  postsecondary education, former chair of workforce development for the  State of Alabama. It is something that is very near and dear to me. I  know that we are working very hard on these issues and have already  produced this one bill, the Perkins bill that we passed in the  absolutely 100 percent vote here on the floor. There will be more  coming.   But the National Defense Authorization Act authorizes what our  military does and doesn't do and how it does it around the globe. This  is a separate, different vehicle designed to provide for the defense of  the American people.   I appreciate the gentleman's comments. We need to take those comments  up at another time as we take into consideration other bills that work  on our workforce development.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I remind all of us that the war in Afghanistan was authorized by an  AUMF that was passed by Congress in 2001. So while we can have a debate  about the other conflicts in other places, that conflict is, indeed,  authorized, and has been authorized from the very beginning. So I would  take exception to the gentleman's comments with regard to Afghanistan.   There are provisions in the underlying bill that this rule makes in  order and in those provisions that do things to help with that war  effort, help the men and women over there fighting that war effort for  us.  [[Page H5780]]    So I think that this rule and the bill that underlies it are doing  exactly what they should do with regard to Afghanistan, because  Afghanistan is authorized.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments. Most of those issues, if not  all of them, were brought up in committee when this bill was considered  as amendments, and they were defeated in virtually all cases by a  bipartisan vote.   I appreciate the fact that she voted for the overall bill, as did  everybody but one Member after you take it all into consideration,  because that is what this bill is about. We are authorizing a broad  swath of the defense of this country. There are a lot of moving parts  to it.   Not everything in a bill this big is going to be satisfactory to  everybody on the committee. I can pick out one or two things I don't  like about it. But as a whole, it does the job that needs to be done  for the people that we depend upon to defend America.   So I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments, but most of all, I  appreciated her vote at the end of the day when we approved that bill  after markup in committee.   Now, I do want to respond to one thing that the gentleman from  Massachusetts said. He talked about, we are still there fighting the  Taliban. The 2001 AUMF specifically references the Taliban.   So we can talk about how things in Syria that President Obama did,  things in Libya that President Obama did, things in Yemen that  President Obama did are outside the AUMF that was adopted in 2001 with  regard to Afghanistan, and I think that is a legitimate debate. But  there is no legitimate debate about whether or not the ongoing conflict  in Afghanistan and our involvement with it has been authorized, because  it has been authorized for 16 years.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman said we can't debate anything. The rule we passed  yesterday makes in order 210 different amendments to be debated on top  of the general debate of the bill itself. And that is on top of 275  amendments in the committee of jurisdiction, the Armed Services  Committee.   This is the most debated piece of legislation we have every year, and  it should be for the very reasons the gentleman from Massachusetts  itemized, because what we are doing here is of profound importance.   Now, I know that there are other issues that people try to stick into  this bill every year that, frankly, distract us from the underlying  importance of the bill; and that is, we are trying to do everything we  possibly can to protect the American people. The threats the American  people face today are more diverse, more profound than we have seen  since the end of World War II.   So, yes, this bill authorizes a lot of very important and expensive  things. I acknowledge they are expensive. But it is even more expensive  if we don't do them, or don't do them right, and we leave the American  people exposed.   Just take into account one of our threats, Kim Jong-un in North  Korea. That missile test he did recently was an ICBM, an  intercontinental ballistic missile. He does not need such a missile to  hit South Korea or Japan. He needs that missile to hit us, to hit  Alaska, to hit the West Coast of the United States, and ultimately to  hit the entirety of the United States.  [[Page H5782]]    It is a direct threat to the safety of the people of the United  States. This bill authorizes an increase in missile defense, just one  of the things that it does.   So I hope that all of us will take the many things that we are going  to debate here over the next several days very seriously and that we  will come to the bipartisan conclusion, as we did in the committee,  that when you take the totality of this bill together after you have  gone through all of these amendments, it does the most important thing  we are here to do, which is to defend the American people.                                time  1400    Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution  440 and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 440 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2933) to promote effective registered apprenticeships, for       skills, credentials, and employment, and for other purposes.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and       the Workforce. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2933.                                   ____           The Vote On The Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
