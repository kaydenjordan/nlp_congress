 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of amendment No. 30 to the Climate  Action Now Act.   We are already seeing the economic benefits of taking action on  climate change. In the United States, we have already created  millions--I say millions--of jobs in the clean economy, from installing  wind turbines and solar panels, to retrofitting buildings to make them  more energy efficient, to assembling fuel-efficient vehicles and  manufacturing the component parts for all of these clean energy  technologies that can help drive down emissions.   My amendment acknowledges the important role clean energy jobs play  in meeting the United States' commitment under the Paris Agreement.   There are currently more than 500,000 jobs in the renewable job  industry alone, just an example of the millions of jobs we are creating  in the clean economy as we work to meet our emissions reductions  target.   By taking a leadership role in global climate action, we can harness  these benefits and see even more economic growth and opportunities for  communities everywhere, including in southern Illinois. And we need to  make sure we do this in a way that not only creates jobs, but creates  good family-sustaining jobs for working families throughout the  country, including in my home State of Illinois and in the Eighth  District of Illinois.   Economic growth, workforce development, and climate leadership go  hand in hand. As cofounder and co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional  Solar Caucus, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Engel).    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York  for his excellent remarks.   I have no further comments, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H3421]]
