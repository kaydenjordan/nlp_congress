 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask for answers from  Pennsylvania's Governor Tom Wolf and his administration, answers as to  why his administration allowed COVID-19 to spread like wildfire in  Pennsylvania's nursing homes, long-term care and assisted living  facilities, and answers as to why he required these facilities to admit  patients who tested positive for COVID-19 but couldn't be quarantined  from healthy residents.   Far too many Pennsylvania seniors have died, tragically, to date,  4,476 from COVID-19. Sixty-eight percent of all deaths in Pennsylvania  have occurred in these facilities.   It didn't need to be this way. Forty-five States took a far different  approach.   To make matters worse, at the same time as the Pennsylvania  Department of Health was enforcing this order, the Secretary of Health,  Dr. Rachel Levine, had her mother removed from a personal care home and  had her checked into a hotel.   Now Governor Wolf and his administration are choosing to ignore my  colleagues who are members of the House of Representatives Select  Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. The committee sent a letter  asking for answers to these questions.   I ask the Governor to address this letter. It is important for the  residents of Pennsylvania, who deserve an answer.                            ____________________
