 Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the  well-deserved retirement of Nashville, Tennessee's own Roxie Gibson.   Roxie, or, ``Miss Roxie,'' as we all know her, dedicated her  professional life to the service and support of her church, community,  and the children who fill the halls each weekday at Oak Hill School in  Nashville.   In a time when acts of kindness are more often than not eclipsed by  the  [[Page S5745]]  drama and bustle of everyday life, Miss Roxie taught generations of  students--and their parents and neighbors, too--to value curiosity and  a loving spirit and to never take friendship for granted. Her smiling  face will be missed around the halls of Oak Hill School.   She is truly irreplaceable.   I ask my colleagues to join with me in wishing Miss Roxie a happy and  fulfilling retirement.                            ____________________
