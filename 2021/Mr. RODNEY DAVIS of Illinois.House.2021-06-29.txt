 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and  my friend on the Committee on House Administration for running this  debate for our side.   Madam Speaker, despite its flaws, I intend to vote for the underlying  bill. But, nevertheless, I rise to highlight several points the  majority has failed to address.   It has been 6 years--6 years--since the people of North Carolina,  through their elected State legislature, requested on a bipartisan  basis to replace the State statue of Charles Brantley Aycock, a former  Democrat Governor of that State, who supported segregation and white  supremacy.   The people of North Carolina have requested to replace the statue  with a sculpture of the late Reverend Billy Graham, a worthy North  Carolinian respected and beloved by millions.   Even the Speaker of the House has had many kind words for Reverend  Graham, only the fourth American ever to lie in honor in the U.S.  Capitol.                                time  1600    In a press release dated February 21, 2018, the Speaker said in part  the following: ``Reverend Graham's leadership and firm partnership with  the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., were vital in the fight for  civil rights in the South. His counsel to U.S. Presidents, regardless  of party, brought grace and humility into our politics.''   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the entire press release.        Pelosi Statement on the Passing of the Reverend Billy Graham                     (February 21, 2018, Press Release)         San Francisco--Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued this       statement today on the passing of the Reverend Billy Graham:        ``Today, millions around the world grieve the loss of the       Reverend Billy Graham. His clarion message of fellowship and       faith lifted and inspired countless members of the Christian       community.        ``Reverend Graham's leadership and firm partnership with       the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. were vital in the       fight for civil rights in the South. His counsel to U.S.       Presidents, regardless of party, brought grace and humility       into our politics. In moments of crisis, from terrorist       attacks to horrific natural disasters, Americans roiled by       tragedy and turmoil looked to Reverend Graham for solace.        ``May it bring comfort to William, Nelson, Virginia, Anne,       Ruth and the entire Graham family that so many around the       world share in their sorrow at this time.''    Madam Speaker, I agree with the  Speaker's remarks. Reverend Graham was vital in the fight for civil  rights in the South.   So, today, I ask: Why are we still having this conversation 6 years  later? Why do the Democrats continue to delay States' efforts, like  North Carolina and Arkansas, to replace the statues in question that  are currently at the Capitol? Why do Democrats delay action, keeping  these statues of known racist Democrats in this building?   Democrats have done nothing on any statue for the past 6 months,  leaving statues of segregationists, known racists, and other  Confederate Democrats in our Capitol.   As an aside, we know this process shouldn't take this long. Kansas,  which has no statues in question in the underlying bill, has been  waiting 22 years to put a statue of Amelia Earhart in the Capitol.   Just yesterday, the chair of the Joint Committee on the Library, a  Democrat, signed the paperwork in about 30 seconds when pressed on it,  despite waiting over 6 months to organize the Joint Committee on the  Library this Congress.   It is clear that the Democrats could move these requests along at any  time but instead are actively continuing to delay the process.   In an effort to speed up this process, I offered an amendment  yesterday at the Rules Committee that very reasonably would have  addressed these delays and would have required the Joint Committee on  the Library to act within 30 days of receiving any actionable items on  statue replacement. Thirty days, come on.   Democrats ruled it out of order. I believe that is because they  wanted to vote on this bill. Each of the statues in question represents  a known racist who was a Democrat from the past. The majority party is  anxious to erase their discriminatory history from the Capitol with  this action.   So, let's have the vote. Let's have a vote on this Democrat bill  intending to remove Democrat statues.   Madam Speaker, my constituent Abraham Lincoln is buried in my  district, the 13th District of Illinois, the first Republican President  of our great Nation. I am proud to represent that history. I stood on  this floor debating and supporting this bill in the last Congress, and  I will support it again.   But please, Madam Speaker, please, please encourage the Democratic  majority to help us reform this broken process that has delayed and  delayed and kept statues of known Confederates, known racists, who  happen to be Democrats in the past, in this Capitol.   Let's work together. Let's get this done. Let's stop playing games.   And let's actually open the Capitol again. It is kind of interesting  and ironic that no one can see these statues because the Capitol is  closed.   What are we doing to establish a plan to reopen our Capitol for our  Nation to actually share in this history, to share in the history of  Abraham Lincoln, to share in the history of our country, to share in  the special building that we get the chance to walk in and work in  while it remains closed?   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working in a bipartisan way to  reform this broken process. Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the  opportunity to speak today, and I intend to vote for this bill.
