 Mr. Speaker, I was here during the debates  that we had on Dodd-Frank and involved in much of the discussion. On  the Democratic side and on the Republican side, there were a number of  things we debated, but through all of that debate, there was a  bipartisan belief that auto dealers and lenders were certainly not at  the heart of the crisis and should not be the focus of new regulation.   With that in mind, as the chairman has noted, section 1029 of Dodd- Frank explicitly exempted auto dealers from CFPB supervision and  regulation. If that is the case, Mr. Speaker, why are we here today?   We are here because the auto dealers are the focus of a CFPB action  that ends the consumers' ability to receive discounted car loans.   Why are consumers facing higher, not lower, costs when going to buy a  car? The answer is regulatory overreach.   CFPB ignored the will of Congress, ignored the law as written. As The  Wall Street Journal noted, Congress' explicit exemption ``didn't stop  former CFPB chief Richard Cordray, who used the back door of auto  financing to regulate dealers.''   And while Mr. Cordray may have been able to suspend this belief, we  do not have the same luxury here. We are not here by choice, frankly.  We must act to pass this resolution today.   And, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share the bipartisan call for  enforcement of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and make this point:  let's work together to tackle discrimination where it exists--where it  exists--not where regulators ignore the law and employ algorithms to  guess that it might exist.
