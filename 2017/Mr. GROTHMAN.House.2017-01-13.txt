 I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Chairman, it is not a surprise, when you try to take over such a  sizable chunk of America's economy, that you have all sorts of  unintended bad consequences. I am going to focus on two consequences  that are true of so many programs that the government puts out there.   First of all, ObamaCare is one more program that discourages work. If  you talk to your accountants again and again, they will tell you  stories of people who are very conscious of the fact that, as they get  a raise, as they work more overtime, they lose big subsidies. If I were  to lose my next election, ObamaCare would continue. As my income would  go up from $49,000 to $50,000, I would get hammered with a $4,500 loss.  So it wouldn't be surprising that people in my position would be very  careful not to get a raise or not to work overtime.   Even worse, this is one more government program that discourages  marriage. If you have a single parent who is making $20,000 and if he  decided to marry somebody making $30,000 or $40,000, he would be  hammered with a $3,500 loss. Combined with the FoodShare program, the  low-income housing subsidies, Pell grants, and various TANF programs,  this is just one more step that the American Government has taken to  discourage work and to discourage marriage.
