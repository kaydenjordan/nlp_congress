 Mr. Speaker, last week in the Senate, a resolution was  introduced to censure Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for his  threatening comments directed at Supreme Court Justices on the steps of  the Court during an abortion-related case. These comments were not only  unbecoming of a Senator, but they were simply egregious. They crossed  the line.   As representative leaders, we are held to a higher standard of  conduct, and Senator Schumer failed to meet that standard. I call on my  colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to support this censure for  the preservation of this institution, for the preservation of the  constitutionally separate branches of government, and for the health of  our Republic.                                Feed Your Mind     Mr. Speaker, this week the USDA, EPA, and FDA have  partnered to announce a new public education campaign aimed at helping  consumers better understand what is in their food.   The Feed Your Mind initiative was developed to answer the most common  questions that consumers have about genetically modified foods,  commonly referred to as GMOs. This study will include what GMOs are,  how and why they are made, how they are regulated, and it will address  health and safety questions that consumers may have about these  products.    Biotechnology has allowed important advances in crop technologies and  improved our farmers' ability to continue to provide safe, nutritious,  and affordable food. Unfortunately, some consumers have fallen victim  to untrue or totally misleading rumors about what GMOs do for our food,  creating confusion and stifling innovation in the agriculture industry.   I want to applaud the Trump administration for taking on the  important task of providing factual information and important  information about the food we grow right here in Kansas and across the  United States. No consumer should have to fear their food or question  the technology that goes into making their meals possible.   The United States has the single safest, most reliable, and most  affordable food source in the entire world, and our farmers work daily  to inform the public about what they do in the field. These resources  will be an important supplement to their outreach efforts.                President Trump's Coronavirus Leadership Plan     Mr. Speaker, the Wuhan coronavirus is certainly on the  front of Americans' minds these days, but before I speak about the  virus, I would like to talk about leadership.   I often tell the kids I work with that leadership is doing the right  thing when it is not popular. Here in Washington, I have learned that  doing the right thing is when you know over 90 percent of the press and  90 percent of the media is going to disagree with you.   Leadership is when President Trump banned travel from China on  February 2. While some people went so low as to call this xenophobic,  as a physician, this early decision, I believe, has saved thousands of  American lives.  [[Page H1594]]    By now, we have millions of test kits distributed out across the  country. I want to just reassure Americans that this testing is covered  by Medicare, by Medicaid, and by most every one of their insurance  companies.   I also want to reassure Americans that antivirals and vaccines are in  early phases of trials, way ahead of development. We are very  optimistic that these antivirals may soon be available for those who  are impacted the most by this Wuhan virus. We are also optimistic that  these vaccines will be available by this next winter.   We have a plan. The President has given us a plan. Let's stick to  this plan. We are implementing this plan, and it is working.   Again, as a physician who has worked with health departments, I am  truly impressed by how we have contained this virus and how our local  health departments are working so hard to minimize the spread of this  virus. I am absolutely amazed that we only have approximately 1,000  Americans impacted by the Wuhan viruses at this time.   In the meantime, again, let's go back to our plan. It is not a time  to panic. This is a time to wash your hands, limit your travel, and, by  the way, open your windows and doors when you are at home and let some  of this fresh air come in which this virus does not like a bit.   So, thanks, Mr. President, for delivering on your plan. We are truly  impressed as physicians in Congress by the great job that you are doing  and the leadership you are showing.
