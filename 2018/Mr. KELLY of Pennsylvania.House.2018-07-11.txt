 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  80th anniversary of a reputable business headquartered in my hometown  of Butler, Pennsylvania: Hunter Truck Sales.   Hunter Truck Sales is a family owned and operated, authorized dealer  of Peterbilt and International heavy-duty trucks and is one of the  largest heavy-duty truck commercial providers in the Northeast.                                time  1045    Hunter Truck is a staple of the community, and their success over the  last 80 years confirms that the American Dream is alive and thriving in  Pennsylvania and throughout the whole United States.   Hunter Truck Sales is a name that has been synonymous with  reliability since its founding in 1938. The business was started by  Homer Hunter. Homer opened a small service station in the rural town of  Eau Claire, Pennsylvania, and quickly developed a reputation for his  unparalleled commitment to trucking solutions with personalized sales,  service, and parts.   With hard work and unwavering dedication, the company has  continuously grown and was eventually awarded a new truck sales  franchise from International Harvester, followed by earning a Peterbilt  heavy-duty truck franchise.   Homer, along with his brothers, created a customer-centric business  that focused on teamwork, trust, accountability, and integrity. These  very values led the company to its many achievements, and they remain  at the core of the Hunter Truck Sales today, which is now owned and  operated by the third generation of the Hunter family: Jeff Hunter,  Dave Hunter, William Hunter, and Nancy Hunter-Mycka.   Hunter Truck currently operates 20 locations in Pennsylvania, West  Virginia, New York, and New Jersey, and proudly employs nearly 1,000  people. Keep in mind all this started with a small service station and  a family with big dreams and great work ethic. It is families like the  Hunters who help local economies flourish by establishing successful  business practices that can be sustained for multiple generations.   While the services provided have evolved and the scope of the  business has expanded, Hunter Truck remains fully committed to both  their customers and the communities they call home.   As a leader in the heavy-duty truck industry, Hunter truck has  invested in its workforce and in unique technologies that align with  their mission, which is to build long-term relationships that reflect  value, integrity, and teamwork by providing their customers with  excellent parts, service, and products.   It is truly an honor to recognize the Hunter family and Hunter Truck  Sales for their pioneering spirit in the demonstration of core American  values. I encourage them to continue on what they have built with  absolute pride--not boastful pride, but pride in knowing what Mr.  Hunter started in 1938 has flourished and has provided so many jobs for  so many people for so long. It is an incredible tribute to the way  Americans think.   Small businesses are the backbone of this country, and Hunter Truck  Sales is truly an inspiration to entrepreneurs everywhere.                            ____________________
