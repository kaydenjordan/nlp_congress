 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement  from the National Sheriff's Association about border security and  immigration reform be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   National Sheriff's Association Position Statement on Border Security                           and Immigration Reform         The Government Affairs Committee of the National Sheriffs'       Association recommends to the Board that Sheriffs stand       together to affirm that securing of the borders of the United       States and reform of the Immigration System are the top       legislative issues for the Association.        Sheriffs pledge that they will commit their influence and       some financial resources of the Association to affecting a       resolution to these issues.        The Nationals Sheriffs' Association recognizes and supports       results-based solutions that address or solve the multitude       of challenges that ineffective border security has caused our       nation and our communities.        Further, the Committee recommends that the Association       vigorously supports any legislation that includes:        Support for following the Rule of Law for the legal       immigration process;        Makes the Nation's borders secure through use of physical       barriers, technology and increased manpower of the Customs &       Border Patrol and ICE;  [[Page S4502]]         Sheriffs be given the statutory authority to honor ICE       issued detainers for detaining illegal criminal aliens, as       well as being granted indemnification under civil law and       tort law for those detentions;        Have reasonable criminal background checks for all granted       citizenship; and        Support for equitable and fair cost sharing through the       allocation of funds to all non-federal agencies.                            ____________________
