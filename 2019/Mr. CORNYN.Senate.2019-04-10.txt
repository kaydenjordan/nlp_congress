 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I would like to start by sharing a story  about one of my personal heroes, Debbie Smith. Debbie Smith is living  proof that one person can change the world if they have the courage to  tell their story and fight for justice.   In 1989, Debbie was at home doing laundry. Her husband Rob, a police  officer, was asleep upstairs after working a night shift.   Suddenly a masked man entered her home and threatened to kill her if  she screamed. He blindfolded and abducted Debbie and took her outside  to a wooded area behind her home, where he robbed and repeatedly raped  her. The man threatened her over and over, saying: Remember, I know  where you live, and I will come back to kill you if you tell anyone.   After he finally left, Debbie ran upstairs to tell her husband. She  begged him not to make her go to the police. But he, as a police  officer, insisted that she report the crime and go to the emergency  room for a sexual assault forensic exam, sometimes called a rape kit  exam.   Debbie did go for that examination and did report the crime. But for  Debbie and millions of other survivors there are no immediate answers.  Because of the nationwide backlog of untested rape kits, it would be  years before she was able to identify her assailant and find any sort  of peace.   Although the exact numbers are hard to estimate, experts believe that  hundreds of thousands of rape kits remain untested in the United  States, and, of course, each one of them represents a unique story of a  sexual assault victim and holds the key to apprehending a violent  criminal.   Waiting for that evidence to be tested can be excruciating. Debbie  said that fear took over her life. She was haunted by the man's voice  threatening to kill her. She was terrified for herself and her family,  and she even became suicidal for a time.   It wasn't until 6\1/2\ years later that Debbie finally got the answer  she had been looking for when a DNA cold hit revealed the identity of  her rapist. She later said in an interview that DNA gave her back her  life.   Debbie chose to harness her pain and to use it to save others from  living through years of uncertainty as she did. She has become the  fiercest advocate in the Nation for eliminating the rape kit backlog.  She has devoted her life to making a difference for victims of sexual  violence.  [[Page S2354]]    The aptly named Debbie Smith Act was originally signed into law in  2004 to provide State and local crime labs the resources they need to  end the backlog of untested DNA evidence from unsolved crimes through  additional funding and increased capacity. Under this law, Congress has  provided more than $1 billion since then in vital funding to forensic  labs for analyzing crime scene DNA evidence, uploading the results into  the CODIS database, which is what happens to the test after it is  completed, and identifying violent fugitives and taking these violent  criminals off the street.   Not only does this sort of testing provide relief for victims like  Debbie and justice for their attackers, but the evidence is also  effective in assisting investigations for other crimes. This is  important because violent offenders will often commit many different  types of crimes in many different jurisdictions. For example, if a  criminal commits a burglary in one State, DNA evidence from that  burglary case can be used later to connect this offender to an unsolved  rape case in another State.   The States, thankfully, are following suit. Texas, I am proud to say,  has led the Nation in passing mandatory rape kit testing laws,  conducting audits of the backlog, and using Debbie Smith funds to  analyze untested sexual assault evidence. I am proud to report that  over the last 7 years we have reduced our statewide rape kit backlog  from more than 20,000 to just over 2,000. This is an astounding  achievement, and thankfully it is being replicated all across the  Nation because of this important legislation and because of the courage  of one woman, Debbie Smith.   By ensuring the Debbie Smith Act funds can be used to analyze  evidence from all types of crime scenes, we can help forensic labs  address their systemic backlogs and holistically target the cycle of  violence. The Debbie Smith Act of 2019 will reauthorize the Debbie  Smith Act program to continue the testing of DNA evidence from unsolved  crimes nationwide, including rape kits. It will also reauthorize DNA  training and education for law enforcement, correctional personnel, and  court officers, as well as forensic nurses who take this DNA evidence  during these rape kit collections to make sure that all of them are  prepared to gather the evidence and to test it. Since 2005, Debbie  Smith Act funding has led to the creation of 43 percent of all forensic  CODIS profiles. Again, this is the FBI database, where the rape kit  information can be entered to see if it matches previously entered DNA  profiles.   Let me say that again. Since 2005, Debbie Smith Act funding has led  to the creation of 43 percent of all forensic CODIS profiles as well as  20 percent of all offender samples in CODIS.   In total, Debbie Smith DNA grants are responsible for 45 percent of  all matches made in CODIS, which is truly remarkable. Reauthorizing  this legislation once again is a top priority for me as we work to  continue chipping away at the nationwide rape kit backlog and provide  these victims with the answers and relief they need.   Over the years, I have had the pleasure of meeting and working with  Debbie several times, and we have been fortunate to have her share her  perspective before the Judiciary Committee on multiple occasions.   I have also worked with two other inspiring victims from Texas-- Lavinia Masters and Carol Bart, who, like Debbie, had the courage to  come forward and talk about a very difficult event in their lives, but  to use their pain as a way to help others. Lavinia and Carol have also  lent their voices in advocating for reforms to reduce the rape kit  backlog.   I am grateful to these and countless other survivors who bravely  share their stories and ideas as we work together to eliminate the  backlog once and for all. I hope the Debbie Smith Act of 2019 will soon  be reported out of the Judiciary Committee and will quickly make its  way to the Senate floor, pass in Congress, and make its way to the  President for his signature without delay.                                  H.R. 1585    Mr. President, on another matter, earlier this week the House passed  a bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Our Democratic  colleagues keep saying how important it is to quickly pass this  legislation to restore funding to VAWA as it is known, but I think it  is important to back up for a moment and remember why that funding  lapsed in the first place.   Earlier this year our Democratic colleagues allowed VAWA to get  caught in the crosshairs of our funding debates, and they insisted we  should not fund this vital program because it was overdue for updates.  Their argument was this: We want to reform or update VAWA, so we are  going to let funding for it lapse. It just didn't make any sense at  all.   It is no secret that folks on the other side of the aisle think it is  time we made some changes to the program. It is something I support,  but we don't need to let the funding lapse in order to do it.   This is an issue that our friend and colleague Senator Ernst  continues to champion here in the Senate. But the approach taken by our  Democratic colleagues to get those changes is a head-scratcher, to say  the least.   There were, as I see it, two options on how to solve the problem. One  was to provide an extension for the previous funding to the end of the  fiscal year. That would have allowed us to work on the long-term  reauthorization under the regular processes in the Senate, which, in my  experience, is always the preferred action to take.   The second option our Democratic colleagues chose was to do nothing  and let this important legislation expire without a plan to replace it.  For whatever reason, that was the option that Democrats in the House  chose.   In the nearly 2 months since, we have tried to negotiate a short-term  extension to fund these vital programs. As recently as last week, our  Democratic colleagues had a chance to support the restoration of  funding while our negotiations continued.   The supplemental appropriations bill introduced by Senator Shelby  would have funded the Violence Against Women Act through the end of the  fiscal year--again, giving us time to negotiate changes in the law that  Democrats obviously want. But our Democratic colleagues simply refuse  to support even a procedural vote that would have allowed us to get on  the bill and debate it and then amend it. It seems increasingly clear  to me that rather than providing the funding for victims of sexual  assault and other violence, rather than finding solutions, what is  happening here is that politics is creeping in and rearing its ugly  head.   It is clear to me that this isn't about finding a solution; this is  about political game playing. Now, rather than going through regular  order to create a long-term reauthorization that includes feedback from  both sides, House Democrats are trying to jam a one-sided piece of  legislation through the House and then through the Senate. I think this  is very shameful.   Our Democratic colleagues first refused to fund the Violence Against  Women Act. They allowed it to expire, and now they are using victims of  violence as leverage to push through their rushed, one-sided piece of  legislation. Throwing a temper tantrum and holding the Violence Against  Women's Act hostage until you get what you want is not a responsible  way to legislate.   I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to put politics  aside for just a moment and work with us to pass a short-term extension  for VAWA while we use the regular order to discuss long-term solutions.   There is a good way and a bad way to do this, and, unfortunately, our  Democratic colleagues have chosen the bad way, but we would ask them to  reconsider and work with us--not for us, but for the victims of  domestic violence who are suffering as a result of their game playing.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum
