 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment itself.    Mr. Chair, I support the goal of this amendment in  assessing the broadband marketplace and how the government can increase  competition, lower prices, and improve the quality of service. This is  a worthy subject for GAO to look into, and I think we can gain valuable  insights.   This is something we could have approved in the Energy and Commerce  Committee had it been brought to us, but we accept it here on the  floor.   But if we were really looking for ways to increase competition, Mr.  Chairman, in the wireless broadband marketplace, then I am baffled why  Democrats did not find the need to examine how 5G networks will be  severely threatened by their bill.   Numerous reports from entities not even in the tech space indicate  that title II, this overreaching government takeover and the incredible  power being given to the FCC to take charge of the internet, presents  serious challenges to 5G deployment and its amazing potential for  technical improvements.   These reports come from Barclays, which focuses on investment and  banking, Oracle, and even the IEEE, which is the Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers, so it is not a bunch of  politicians talking about this, Mr. Chairman. These are certified smart  people, otherwise known as the real engineers, that we went to.   To quote their analysis, ``5G networks face the challenge of being  developed in a context of high uncertainty, where most of the services  that underpin 5G business models appear to be unlawful under current  rules.''   One example of the efficiencies that can be realized in a 5G network  is network slicing which will allow operators to provide different  services with different performance characteristics to address specific  use cases. Because 5G is being designed for a wider range of use cases  than prior technologies, it is critical that quality of service  management be employed.   Applying net neutrality to these new 5G networks would cripple the  performance of this incredible new technology.   Mr. Guthrie, a Republican from Kentucky, offered an amendment to  address our serious concerns about the impact of the Democrats' bill on  5G, but that amendment to preserve the growth of 5G was not given an  opportunity to be part of today's vote. Sadly, we can't even debate it.  It is not here.   New 5G wireless networks will not only one day support apps and web  pages, and texts, and chats, and video streams, but will also support a  wide range of new technologies, from autonomous vehicles, augmented  reality, innovations in healthcare delivery and education, to all other  kinds of new advances, Mr. Chairman.   These new innovations, let alone the innovations beyond 5G to come,  would be simply impossible, we now believe, and I think others believe  independent of us, with these heavy-handed proposals that will result  from title II power being given to bureaucrats in Washington. That is  what the underlying bill would do.   It is worth remembering that until 2015, the Federal Communications  Commission treated wireless networks differently when regulating net  neutrality, because it did not want to impede the growth of a nascent  technology. If we were to apply that same logic today, we should not  burden developing 5G networks with onerous and outdated regulations, as  these 5G networks are even more in their infancy than wireless was back  in 2010, Mr. Chairman.   So we need to make sure that we don't handicap this next generation  of technology with rules designed for rotary telephones that could  cause us to delay or lose a global race to widely deploy 5G.   Mr. Chairman, those are my remarks. I support the underlying  amendment, the Davids amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I don't have any other speakers, I don't  believe. I will continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I would recommend that my friend from Pennsylvania read  this Barclays piece on what the bill likely could do to diminish the  growth in 5G build-out, which I include in the Congressional Record.      [From Barclays, U.S. Cable, Telecom & Internet, March 25, 2019]          Net Neutrality: Blunt Tool for a Fast-Changing Ecosystem         More heat than light in present Net Neutrality debate:       While Net Neutrality and related issues have evoked strong       passions since the early 2000s, very little of the discussion       has evolved despite significant technological and economic       shifts. The issue has come back into focus with House       Democrats introducing a new bill to reinstate the 2015       Internet Order which was repealed by the FCC post the       election of President Trump. The issue is also making its way       through the courts with 20+ states and tech companies       predictably suing against the FCC's repeal. Therefore, this       issue is likely to remain in the headlines especially given       elections next year.        Reinstating 2015 Open Internet Order may make it tough to       realize full potential of 5G: We believe that Net Neutrality       formulations as proposed in Congress are blunt tools to deal       with a fast-changing technological landscape. The entire       premise of 5G is the ability to enable different network       capabilities for different applications. The 5G standards       development body, 3GPP, has outlined three major use cases       for the technology: enhanced Mobile Broadband, Massive IoT,       and ultra-reliable low latency. While all three are likely to       be used for consumer-facing applications, two of the three       major use cases are also being targeted at industrial users.       Dimensions of data use will also be more varied than just       speed or volume. Some applications will need to transmit       small amounts of data at constant periods (e.g. smart meters)       while others will need bursts of high bandwidth consuming       traffic (e.g. fixed wireless). Therefore, if implemented, the       2015 Open Internet Order framework (ban on paid       prioritization and throttling) without accounting for       emerging technological capabilities and applications is       likely to become a roadblock to 5G monetization.        Title II could have a bigger operational impact than Net       Neutrality: While the Open Internet Order has implications       for future business models, if adopted as law, a more       immediate concern for Internet service providers will be the       push to redefine broadband as a Title II service.       Operationally, this could constrain the degrees of freedom       around variables such as pricing a lot more than the Open       Internet Order itself.        Overall, while the need for some framework on Net       Neutrality is agreed to by both sides of the political       divide, the current set of proposals are, in our view,       inadequate with material limitations on future business       models. The issue requires a comprehensive look at the entire       value chain including the edge, but divided regulatory       jurisdictions and a split Congress make this difficult to       achieve. Therefore, for now, we believe the issue will be       resolved by courts and is likely be a headline risk for       telecom and cable companies.        While Net Neutrality evokes strong passions politically,       very little of the discussion has evolved despite significant       technological and economic shifts. We believe that Net       Neutrality formulations as they exist today are blunt tools       to deal with a fast-changing technological landscape.        For instance, the entire premise of 5G is the ability to       enable different network capabilities for different       applications. The 5G standard development body has outlined       three major use cases for the technology. enhanced Mobile       Broadband (eMBB), Massive IoT (mIoT) and ultra-reliable low       latency (URLLC). While all three are likely to be used for       consumer facing applications, two of the three major use       cases are also being targeted at industrial users (mIoT and       URLLC). Data use across these applications is likely to be       quite varied. For instance, smart meters will need to       transmit small amounts of data at constant periods while       consumer broadband works on bursts of high bandwidth       consuming traffic such as video. Applications such as       autonomous cars and remote surgery may value lower latency       and higher edge computing capacity compared to, for example,       checking email or watching video.        This is quite different from previous generations of       wireless standards which thus far have been largely focused       on consumer applications. The way Congress appears to be       looking at Net Neutrality today or the way the FCC has looked       at this in the past would effectively result in operators       being forced to provide the same level of service to every       application which will not only result in waste but also       limit the impact of 5G. In fact, if the promise of 5G is       realized the way it has been outlined by operators globally,       the whole meaning of what a telecom `service' means (is it       latency? is it speed? it is edge compute?) and how it is       measured is likely to change meaningfully.        Some conditions included in the 2015 Order such as paid       prioritization and throttling could in theory make it       impossible to deploy and monetize some of the features that       make 5G a bigger shift than prior generations. In a 5G world,       this would make it impossible in theory to prioritize latency       for, as an example, a driverless car versus somebody watching       Netflix. Of course regulators can fine-tune these definitions       but that is not what the House bill seeks to do. It       effectively passes this judgment to an administrative body--      the FCC. Given that FCC decisions on this issue have been       split along political affiliations of the Commissioners,       every regime at the FCC could make opposing decisions making       the implementation of any policy next to impossible. This       opens up the entire issue to a lot of uncertainty which is       likely to limit the ability of service providers to formulate       go-to-market plans for 5G.        We also believe that the Net Neutrality framework as of       today (no prioritization, no blocking and no throttling) is       without any nuance to deal with what might be legitimate and       consumer-friendly use cases. For instance, Netflix alone       consumes  cents19% of downstream bandwidth       (wireless and wired) in the US today. In the early days of       cable, when bandwidth in the cable pipe was limited due to       analog signals, content networks had to pay cable companies       for carriage. This allowed a market-based mechanism for       viable networks to effectively `buy' bandwidth and scale       their services based on how widely they were distributed.       Netflix however doesn't have to worry about this dynamic. It       can make its technology decisions independent of the       investment needs of the network. In theory, Netflix can       decide to stream all its videos in 4K and suck up even more       bandwidth, which will be to the detriment of other       applications on the Internet and force cable and wireless       companies to increase their network investment. At the same       time, cable companies will have to deal with broadband price       monitoring by the FCC (which the 2015 Open Internet Order       enables), limiting their ability to pass through price to the       consumer or to Netflix (due to a ban on paid prioritization).        Overall, while the need for some framework on Net       Neutrality is unquestionable, the move by the House to just       pass the buck back to the FCC to deal with the details is not       the right answer in our opinion. This needs a legislative       solution on the scale of the 1996 Telecommunications Act but       this is almost impossible in the current environment. As a       result, we believe this issue is likely to remain unresolved       for a long time to come. Near-term, however, if this       legislation were to pass, it could have a bigger impact on       wireless 5G plans than on wireline operators.     Mr. Chair, I would also point out, actually, that the  bill would regulate 5G. We had a vote in committee to prevent that from  happening, and every Democrat on the committee voted to regulate 5G  through this legislation and give the FCC that authority, and every  Republican voted the other way, because we actually vote for open and  free internet and markets.   I know that the gentleman, my friend, was pretty busy when the  President's people made their statement. I commented that day that I  didn't think that was a good approach. So I have been on record, and I  think most of my colleagues have as well. That is kind of an argument  that, Mr. Chairman, I don't think holds much water.   What we do know is, we are legislating today, and the Democrats'  legislation will regulate 5G, and the people who evaluate the effect of  that say that is going to harm development, rollout, and probably  investment as well.   Mr. Chair, the underlying amendment is good, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I share similar concerns to Mr. Stanton  about promoting broadband deployment on Tribal lands. I have visited a  number of reservations around the country, including in Arizona, as  well as, of course, in my own State of Oregon and elsewhere.   This is a big issue, and the data are not complete. I agree with you  that we need to do better. In fact, that is true, and I think we would  all agree that the data the FCC gets, has, and uses has been a problem  for a very long time. We have to get better so that when we allocate  these funds to do the build-out and everything else, we are getting  funds to the people who really need them. That is especially a problem  with our Native American friends.   In fact, while I was presiding over the Energy and Commerce Committee  last Congress, we accomplished landmark legislation with the enactment  of RAY BAUM'S Act. That reauthorized the FCC, and it included language  to improve services on Tribal lands, Mr. Chairman.   We need to make sure that the policies we impose on the internet  support broadband deployment, especially deployment in Tribal, rural,  and very rural areas. Oftentimes, the Tribal areas consist of rural  areas where we have very small internet service providers providing  access to the internet, and they are desperately trying to find funding  to expand their service footprint.   I was a small business owner with my wife for more than 20 years. I  will tell you, you are trying to grow your small business, and then the  government comes in and says: Oh, we want more information. We want  more requirements. And we are going to regulate you more.   Mr. Chairman, all that does is take your money and your plan to  invest and diverts it. You don't get to do as much as you had planned  to do. That is why I supported an amendment to the underlying bill that  would have specifically protected a small business from the heavy hand  of overreporting.   That amendment would have included the language of my bill on small  businesses that was passed unanimously by the House in each of the last  two Congresses--unanimously, right here on this floor. It would have  extended the exemption for small ISPs from President Obama's FCC's  enhanced transparency rules for 5 years and expanded the exemption to  include businesses with 250,000 subscribers or less.   This was based on a bipartisan compromise that the FCC's original  exemption was not enough to protect small ISPs. We all agreed to that.  We negotiated that and twice passed that unanimously in the House.   I agree that all consumers should be protected, but the enhanced  transparency rules could deter broadband from being deployed further on  Tribal lands and reaching consumers in the first place. That is because  these enhanced disclosures place an unnecessary regulatory burden on  small businesses and distract them from working to bring broadband  internet access to customers across the country, especially on Tribal  lands.   As a reminder, my amendment would not have let ISPs skirt  transparency. It did not do that. We are just talking about really  costly reporting requirements. Instead, they would follow the less  onerous transparency rules adopted by the FCC back in 2010 so consumers  would still have access to information needed to make informed  decisions about their internet service, and ISPs could focus on  providing service rather than cumbersome regulatory requirements.   There is bipartisan consensus in improving broadband deployment to  Tribal lands and, I think, our rural areas and our urban areas that are  underserved. But it seems my colleagues across the aisle don't support  this as much as we claim and they claim. Otherwise, I would have  expected the amendment I had, which reflected exactly what we twice  agreed to, to be part of the underlying bill. It is not, and that is  unfortunate. But Mr. Stanton's work is valuable, and I support it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H3228]]         Mr. Chairman, I will be brief here. The only effort to  nationalize 5G and to fully regulate 5G is contained in the Democrats'  bill. That is where it is happening.   We had an amendment in the Rules Committee to prevent that, and the  Democrats who control the Rules Committee by a 2-to-1 margin refused to  even allow us to debate that amendment here on the floor.   Finally, the President never said he was going to nationalize 5G.  Somebody leaked a memo out of the White House that said that is a good  idea. I oppose that. Right that same day, within hours, they had been  clear on that.   Let's be clear here. The facts of the matter are that this  legislation nationalizes and regulates 5G like it has never been done  before and threatens innovation and development of this exciting new  opportunity for American consumers.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great State  of California (Mr. McCarthy), who is the Republican leader.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, but I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's concern about the accuracy of  the FCC's reports on deployment. I share those. And with his broader  concern about broadband generally, I agree with that.   In fact, many Members on both sides of the aisle share these  concerns, especially when it comes to the unserved Americans in our  most rural areas, like my district that would stretch from the Atlantic  to Ohio. It is a big district.   So, I will support this amendment. However, I would ask my colleagues  to seriously consider, Mr. Chairman, the negative impacts of giving the  FCC power to regulate rates on rural broadband deployment.   Mr. Kinzinger's amendment to block any sort of rate regulation was  actually blocked by the majority from being considered today, and that  is unfortunate.   At the full committee markup, Mr. Kinzinger highlighted a memo from  the Congressional Research Service that noted there is nothing  permanent to the forbearance that the majority claims to be doing when  it comes to controlling the prices providers charge consumers.  [[Page H3230]]    So, we could get into rate regulation through the FCC, and every ISP  would have to come back here and beg and explain their rate structure  and everything else. And we have got thousands of them.   The majority attempted to remedy this flaw with some additional  language purporting to lock in the FCC's forbearance on this matter,  but the actual effect of that language is still unclear.   Most importantly, they left open the broad authority of sections 201  and 202 of the Communications Act and other authority that gives the  Federal Communications Commission, all five unelected officials, plenty  of leeway to regulate rates under title II.   The legislation we have before us clearly leaves the door open to  rate regulation. If this were not the case, then the Kinzinger  amendment, I would think, would be before the House today or would have  been approved in committee when we had a chance to do that.   This is no way to conduct business in the internet age. These title  II regulations were originally implemented for railroad monopolies in  the 19th century. So, if you really believe in a competitive, open  marketplace and a competitive, open internet, you don't turn it over to  unelected bureaucrats in Washington to micromanage.   As they were applied in their original incarnation, the requirements  of just and reasonable practices under section 201(b) and no  unreasonable discrimination under 202(a)--which, by the way, sound  perfect--provided sufficient authority to impose price controls on  railroads.   So, by opening the door with title II and these other sections of  law, you are now giving this vast power to basically three unelected  officials at the FCC. You just need a majority to decide how the whole  internet runs. I think that is a problem.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I appreciate the gentleman's amendment. As I said, I intend to  support it. We need the facts here, and I support getting the facts.   We know the reporting data we often get is not accurate. And, if  people are lying about their data, then we should hold them  accountable, and I'll join you in that effort. That is not acceptable.   On the issue of rate regulation, that is what title II is all about.  That is what this bill gives the FCC the authority to do.   While you can argue that adopting the forbearances that the FCC did  under title II when they had that authority may preclude rate  regulation there, by giving them this enormous authority, your own  counsel testified in answer to our question, that they could go through  a standard rulemaking process and use sections 201 and 202 to do their  own rate regulation.   You see, you may close the front door, but you left the back door  open. Actually, you created a back door.   That is where I am concerned, and my side is concerned that you are  empowering the FCC with these incredible authorities designed for  monopoly railroads and designed for monopoly communications systems  that could really hamper future investment in things like 5G and  provide all this micromanagement of the internet and harm consumers.  That is why so many of us oppose this particular provision.   I keep seeing Republicans on this floor, Mr. Chairman, accept the  Democrats' amendments in almost every case. They blocked some of ours  from being able to be considered.   But, when it comes to this fundamental issue of turning the internet  over to the Federal Government and three unelected people to do  incredible things that aren't good for the long-term benefit of  consumers and new technologies, we have to remain opposed.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, again, I support this amendment to require  the GAO to look into ways to promote deployment of broadband to our  most rural and underserved areas. It is a very worthy subject and one  on which I think we can find some really broad bipartisan agreement. It  is a top priority of mine and has been, so I won't oppose the  amendment.   We are obviously delegating a lot of authority to the GAO, which is a  wonderful organization, but we all have had hearings and know what  really needs to happen, I think, going forward to get broadband built  out. However, if you are really concerned about deployment to rural and  underserved areas, you should be extremely concerned about the impact  the underlying bill is going to have on our ability to get broadband  out to these areas and close the digital divide.   Title II is a proven investment killer, period, hard stop. This is  shown not only in the overall nationwide investment numbers going down  during the only 2-year blip these rules were in effect. Remember, my  colleague from New York, these internet rules you are about only  existed for less than about 2 years. That is it.   The whole growth, the expansion of the internet and broadband  occurred during the period of the 1990s to 2015. Then the internet  order was put in and investment went down, and then the internet order  was repealed and investment is going up.   The head of the Eastern Oregon Telecom Company, Joe Franell, came  back to Washington and testified before our subcommittee and said,  under title II, his investors lost interest; deals dried up; the bank  wouldn't even give him a loan. It was an extremely compelling story  from somebody who is on the front lines of getting broadband built out  to the very areas you and I would agree need service.   And we heard from many other small rural ISPs as well with the same  stories. They are the ones that take the worst hit under title II that  is in this bill you support.   Now, I submitted an amendment to the Rules Committee to do something  real to address the worst uncertainties that these small carriers have  to deal with under title II.   Title II opens the door to government control of private networks. It  opens the door to government taxation of the internet. It opens the  door to government regulation of speech online.   My amendment would have closed all of those doors. Unfortunately, the  Democrats, again, who control the Rules Committee, Mr. Chairman, 2 to  1, would not find a way to even allow us to bring that amendment here  for a vote or debate.   I have to say, under title II, our smallest rural ISPs would have a  really tough time, and we have seen a lot of evidence of this in the  past. So I hope my friends will consider that, when we are voting on  this underlying bill, we are actually going to cause those small ISPs  more harm than good, and that will delay deployment into unserved and  underserved communities.   A GAO study on deployment will have no impact whatsoever on  deployment-killing excesses of title II, but it will give us some ideas  about how to build out broadband, so I won't oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time remains.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate both my colleagues' comments, but  the nationwide numbers of investment obscure what happens in our  smallest investors, among those that are out  [[Page H3232]]  there, like Joe Franell in Eastern Oregon trying to build out.   What we do know is he came back and testified to the problem he  encountered individually as one who is very progressive and active,  trying to connect really difficult places to get to with the highest  speed broadband possible.   I have met with him before; I have met with him during; I have met  with him afterwards. He came back on his own dime to make the case  that, when these rules were in effect, he had difficulty getting loans;  he had difficulty building out; he was burdened more than he had ever  been before, and that diminished his ability to build out.   His numbers probably are dust in terms of investment that the big  companies have, but that is who I care about are the little operators  that are so pushed down by this heavy hand of government  overregulation. So that is, I think, what we have to maintain our focus  on.   Again, title II gives these vast unprecedented powers to the FCC to  regulate the internet like it has never been regulated before. People  who have no Gs need our help, but people waiting for 5G don't need us  to pass legislation that will screw it up and diminish innovation, and  that is one of the reasons I am opposing this version of net  neutrality.   We could agree on no throttling and no blocking and the paid  prioritization issue as well.   The other thing I found interesting, Mr. Chairman, is, throughout the  course of all of our hearings, there wasn't a witness panel of people  who had faced all of these parade of horribles we have heard about from  ISPs.   There weren't any witnesses. They didn't bring anybody. I don't know  if they are out there or not. They didn't bring anybody who has been  affected by the edge providers, however, and that is another subject  for our conversation going forward.   Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I don't think I am opposed to the amendment.     Mr. Chairman, I don't disagree with my colleague from  Virginia that the maps showing broadband deployment in the United  States can and must be improved. That is why, when Republicans held the  majority for the Energy and Commerce Committee, we held numerous  hearings on how to do that, how to improve broadband mapping at the  FCC.   We also shared legislation with our Democratic--then minority-- colleagues to bring in the expertise of the National Telecommunications  and Information Administration to aggregate granular data beyond the  carrier data that the FCC uses for its maps.   Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle didn't  want to work with us to improve mapping last Congress. I am more  hopeful this time that we can engage--we are ready, willing, and able  to do so--and that we can address this matter.   Mapping is clearly important--I think we all agree on that--and it is  where we should focus our limited Federal money on broadband support.  But rather than help spur broadband deployment and provide more  granular data, the underlying legislation would make it more difficult  on broadband providers to deploy broadband.   We just discussed how investment in broadband, especially for our  small providers, suffered under title II. They came and testified to  that.   But my reservation on this amendment, Mr. Chairman, has to do with  the conflict that I see between the Wexton amendment, No. 5, and the  Spanberger amendment, No. 11. I wonder if the gentlewoman from Virginia  would care to comment about that, and I would be happy to yield. I  didn't have a chance to talk with her. It may not be fair.   The issue here is the Wexton amendment, which we did not oppose,  requires the Federal Communications Commission to submit to Congress,  within 30 days, a plan for how the Commission will evaluate and address  problems with the collection of form 477 data.                                time  1015    I believe those are the same data we are talking about with your  amendment to have the GAO do this investigation and report to Congress  as well.   The conflict I see is, on the one hand, we are telling the FCC to go  do its work and report back in 30 days, but in your amendment, we are  telling the GAO to go do its work and tell us eventually where the  problems are. They can do that, but we have already told the FCC to  report back its answers.   I am not going to oppose the amendment, but it seems like there is  kind of a conflict here, potentially. Because we want to get it right,  it seems like we would wait to have the FCC report back until the GAO  had completed its work. Then we could work with the FCC to say, okay,  now that we know what the GAO has found and informed us on, then, FCC,  go and report back.   I might have structured this a little differently had we had time to  work out some of that.   I am not going to oppose the gentlewoman's amendment. We have to get  the data right. We have to get the mapping right.   When the stimulus came out in the Obama administration, I argued this  very point in the committee. We were in the minority then, so of  course, I lost. But they were spending money that was being set aside  in the stimulus to build out broadband in America before they had the  maps to figure out where people were underserved and unserved.   It seemed kind of backward then, and I think it was. We didn't get  the maps until after the money was allocated. The time to do the audits  and evaluations of how that money was spent, the money for that ran out  before the build-out was finished, so we had to come back to look at  that. Then we did find limited cases of fraud and abuse, not much,  frankly, but enough. It is taxpayer dollars.   I won't oppose the gentlewoman's amendment. I think we can work out  these things if this bill were to move forward, but the timing is the  issue that I have some reservations on.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's amendment and the  gentleman's comments. We can figure out how to work this out, I think.  But clearly, we have to fix the maps.   Even the industry has told me, at least--they admit the data, the way  it is collected and everything else, is not an accurate representation.  They would like our help in this as well.   Hopefully, we can move forward on an NTIA reauthorization as well. We  marched through a number of agency reauthorizations and programmatic  reauthorizations that hadn't been done in decades in the last 2 years.  We should continue that important work as well. We stand ready as  Republicans to join our colleagues to get that done.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, I agree with my colleague across the aisle,  Mr. McAdams, that ISPs should be able to block unlawful content, and I  support his amendment.   In fact, even when the FCC imposed the heavy-handed title II  regulations, it recognized in paragraph 113 of its order that the ban  on blocking did not ``prevent or restrict a broadband provider from  refusing to transmit unlawful material, such as child pornography or  copyright-infringing materials.''   This was similar to the FCC's earlier nonblocking rule, which was  also affirmed, that ISPs could block material that was unlawful.   It strikes me as interesting that you have to have this amendment to  apparently clarify an ambiguity some must feel exists in the underlying  bill, but we will support it if it is necessary to do that.   I firmly support net neutrality that allows Americans to enjoy the  lawful content on the internet and applications of their choosing.   I would point out to my friend from Utah that the concerns about  social media, and I share them, are not covered by this legislation.  Those big platforms are completely exempt, as near as we can tell, so  that is another area where I think we all share a common bond, that  there is concern about what goes on in social media, things that aren't  legal, things that are fake. I mean, you name it.   Under title II, the FCC could police internet content, as it  currently does with content broadcasts over television or radio. I was  a radio broadcaster for 21 years, owned and operated stations, and that  concerns me a bit if we are going to get the FCC being the Nation's  speech police. By making further rules on the ISPs, you might be able  to end up there. That is a concern.   This is a really broad, open-ended authority that you all are giving  to the Federal Communications Commission. That is because the FCC did  not forebear from some content-specific provisions of title II, such as  section 223. That would give the FCC authority to impose content-based  restrictions if it found it to be ``just and reasonable.'' That goes  well beyond just the legal content, I think.   I am not burdened with a law degree, but I have some really good  lawyers that counsel me on these matters.   This is why we offered an amendment that would have put certain  protections in place for consumers' freedom of speech online because  that is also something we all swear to uphold, our First Amendment  rights of religion and speech.   Rather than talk about how we can prevent the FCC from someday  abusing the expansive authority that the majority is about to give it,  we are here discussing something that has been universally agreed upon  by all parties to this debate.   Mr. Chair, we appreciate the gentleman's perfecting amendment to this  legislation. I intend to support it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   I again thank the gentleman from Utah for bringing this amendment. I  guess my suspicions were right: It is merely restating what is already  in the 2015 order, which is what this bill basically reinstates into  law.   Mr. Chair, I thank my staff as well for the great job they have done.  I appreciate both sides as we work together on these complicated and  sometimes controversial issues.   I would point out that, under sections 223 and 201, you are again  opening the door to vast new regulation of speech and content, I  believe and our attorneys believe, by giving the FCC this authority.   I am a First Amendment guy. I have a degree in journalism. I believe  in free speech. Sometimes, I don't like that speech. Sometimes, I find  it offensive. The stuff that is illegal, you bet, we are all together  on. But there are some interesting stories coming out around Europe and  elsewhere where countries now, especially some of those in the more  authoritarian parts of the world, are using this argument to crack down  on political speech they find offensive.   I think we have to be very careful as Republicans, as Democrats, as  all  [[Page H3235]]  Americans to try to find that balance between the obvious and the  speech that really is about protecting the powerful. I think we can  find common ground on that, but I do wince a bit that we are opening  the door, or you all are with your bill, to giving the FCC the power to  tax the internet, the power to regulate speech on the internet by going  through a rulemaking.   I think that heads us in a little more dangerous direction and,  meanwhile, does not address some of the issues I hear in townhalls. I  have done 20 of them in every county in my district this year. When  people begin to step up and have issues, it is not the ISPs they are  complaining about, other than speeds and connectivity, that sort of  thing. It is what is happening on some of the social media platforms,  which are not addressed by this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit and it is at the  desk.    Oh, my gosh, Mr. Speaker, in its current form, yes.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment is actually pretty simple,  and Members have a clear choice today on the floor: Are you for taxing  the internet or not? That is the question.   As we have discussed at the Energy and Commerce Committee and again  on the House floor today, Mr. Speaker, no one fully understands the  implications of the underlying legislation. In fact, we have adopted  amendments that the sponsor indicates aren't really necessary but do  reinforce what is already in the bill. The scope of what it entails is  still unclear, however, and the impact it could have on consumers is  still uncertain.   Now, Democrats claim their bill permanently forbears from many of the  heavy-handed regulations that the Federal Communications Commission  could impose through this government takeover of the internet. It is  important to note that nothing in the underlying bill would prevent the  Federal Communications Commission from imposing similar regulations in  the future or through other provisions in statute.   Now, my colleagues never could produce the list of 700 forbearances  they claim the FCC engaged in that they are going to lock in statute  today. That is what you are voting on, among other things. We never  could get that list of 700 forbearances.   We have offered amendments in the committee and in the Rules  Committee to ensure that consumers are protected and to ensure that the  Democrats' rhetoric about their bill actually matches the substance.  These amendments were all rejected on party-line votes in committee.   What is clear is that the Democrats want a government takeover of the  internet. They want to open up the floodgates to a Federal, State, and  local cash grab through taxation and fees that could be put on by local  governments, State governments, and even the Federal Government.   Now, they will argue: Oh, no, there is nothing in the underlying  bill, no, no, no. It does not touch the Internet Tax Freedom Act.   That might be true. It doesn't have to because the underlying bill  opens the floodgates to section 201 and section 202 and other  provisions that would allow local, State, and Federal governments to  tax the internet. They can't do that today.   So, again, your vote is pretty simple: tax the internet or don't tax  the internet.   Once you classify internet services under the utility-style services,  tax administrators are going to do what they do best, and that is find  a way to charge fees and taxes on this category since they understand  how to get milk from every cow that walks by. Guess who is getting  milked. It is the consumers.   So if you have any doubt, Mr. Speaker, just check your monthly phone  bill. Your internet subscription is the new target. We are seeing all  kinds of things in this bill. They are doubling, potentially, use of  fees for the use of some facilities and poles, even altruistic-sounding  ones on telecommunications relay services and 911.   But guess what. Just ask New York residents how much of their monthly  911 charges are being diverted from their 911 call centers. According  to the Federal Communications Commission's 10th annual report to  Congress on how States collect and use 911 fees, a staggering 90.35  percent of the money New Yorkers pay for 911 services gets diverted.  For my friends in New Jersey, 77.26 percent gets diverted.   So these tax collectors know how to tax; they just haven't had the  opportunity to tax the internet, but they may well get it under this  bill if it were to become law.   So, Mr. Speaker, this is pretty simple. Republicans want to close the  door on taxation of the internet. Will Democrats join us or not?   If you vote for the motion to recommit, Mr. Speaker, you vote to  close the tax and freedom door. A ``no'' vote leaves that door wide  open for taxation of the internet.   Do you want your consumers to pay higher bills every month for their  internet service or not?   Say ``no'' to higher taxes and fees and ``yes'' to this amendment to  protect those who actually pay the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
