 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss  something that is very, very important to me as public policy, but it  is something that is really personal to me, and that is the Federal  TRIO Programs.   The TRIO programs are a set of higher education initiatives  authorized by the Higher Education Act of 1965 that provide an  educational opportunity to first-generation, low-income students.   You see, in 1969, at age 18, as a high school senior, I became  pregnant with my first daughter, Jesselynne. I was a college-bound  student, suddenly feeling that I was derailed from my prospects and my  future, but the outreach of the TRIO programs in Marquette University  enabled me to get a high-quality education at Marquette University,  else I might have slipped through the cracks.   You see me here standing today as a Member of Congress, but even  prior to that, I contributed greatly to my community, because of my  educational opportunity, as someone who created affordable housing  through our State agency, put together a financial institution, a  credit union for low-income communities to fill the financial gaps, and  contributed in so many other ways, including paying taxes--and by the  way, my daughter is a special education teacher today.   But without TRIO support, I wouldn't be here, and there are so many  other millions of young people who are talented, but they are just poor  and don't have the family background to enable them to get to college.  Access to quality and affordable education can change your entire life  because a college education is one of the greatest democratizers and  greatest equalizers in our democratic society. And that is why it has  been the honor of my career to be the cochair of the bipartisan TRIO  Caucus here in Congress to pay it forward for the next generation.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to introduce a resolution, along with my  cochair,  Mike Simpson, in recognizing November 8 as National First- Generation Celebration Day, a day that commemorates the signing of the  Higher Education Act of 1965 by President Lyndon Baines Johnson.   I thank the many Members who signed on to our resolution, especially  our Senate cosponsors, Senator Warnock, a TRIO alum, and Senator  Marshall, a first-generation college graduate, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to  highlight how the Build Back Better Act will help to advance the goal  of helping more first generation and students of modest means get to  college and be able to benefit from the programs like TRIO that can  help to ensure that they graduate and gain the skills necessary to  participate in our ever, ever complicated economy. And without efforts  to make higher education affordable and reducing the debt burden on our  students, I am afraid that many students will never have the  opportunity to benefit from TRIO, so we need to do more to make sure  that cost is not a barrier to quality higher education.   And that is why I think the Build Back Better effort--and I just want  to call out Chairman  Bobby Scott for all the work he did in increasing  the maximum Pell grants to help low-income students get to college. It  is clear that Pell grants haven't kept up with the rising costs of  college and would provide $500 million over 7 years for grants to  States and institutions of higher education and Tribal communities and  universities to improve student outcomes, including enrollment  retention, completion, and employment placement.   So I just thought it was important to say that when the Build Back  Better bill gets to the floor, we should all support it for the  educational initiatives that are in it.   But the story of TRIO is a remarkable one that benefits students of  all races, creeds, colors, both genders, veterans. It ought to be  celebrated.   Mr. Speaker, I am urging, when it comes to the floor, that you all  support the bipartisan resolution to celebrate National First- Generation Day.                            ____________________
