 Madam Speaker, there is a Gospel reading I like: Matthew  25: ``For I was hungry and You gave me food, I was thirsty and You gave  me drink, a stranger and You welcomed me, naked and You clothed me, ill  and You cared for me, in prison and You visited me.''   That spirit of welcoming and compassion is a part of what defines us  as Americans. In fact, we have enshrined it in our legal code,  including laws requiring safe and sanitary conditions for migrant  children. Yet right now, children are imprisoned in appalling and  unconscionable conditions.   These children have not been welcomed in the spirit of Matthew.  Instead, they are in cages, in prison without adequate food, clean  clothing, clean diapers, toothbrushes, access to showers, and a  comfortable place to lay their head.   ``Whatever you did unto the least of these, you did unto me.''   Madam Speaker, we will be judged as a nation, as a government, and a  people for our failure to look out for the least of these. May this  imprisonment end.                            ____________________
