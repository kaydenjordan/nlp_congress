 Mr. Speaker, I stand here to honor the life of  Captain Donald Lambert, Jr.   Last weekend, the Henrico County Police Department lost one of its  own.   Captain Lambert served in the Henrico Police Department for nearly 34  years, and his fellow officers remember him as a true friend, mentor,  and leader.   I had the privilege of getting to know Captain Lambert through his  work as the head of the Henrico Special Operations Group. Captain  Lambert's security expertise helped keep me, as well as my  predecessors, Congressmen Brat and Cantor, and our staffs, out of  harm's way, and I am forever grateful for his dedication to his work.   Captain Lambert was a pillar of our central Virginia community. He  was a dedicated member of the Henrico Police Department, but he will be  remembered as a gifted musician, a beloved Sunday school teacher, and a  man who demonstrated true compassion for others.   Captain Lambert's decades of selfless service to the community of  Henrico and the Commonwealth of Virginia will never be forgotten.   Our hearts are with his family, friends, and fellow men and women of  the Henrico County Police Department as they honor his life.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  amendment to H.R. 1 to crack down on foreign-backed disinformation and  propaganda on social media. This amendment is the text of the  Bipartisan Foreign Agent Disclaimer Enhancement--FADE--Act.   Under the FADE Act, political ads, issue campaigns, and content  funded or directed by a foreign principal and intended to influence the  American people must be disclosed to the Department of Justice. But too  often, this rule does not extend to the world of social media.   Additionally, foreign agents acting from abroad too often evade  current disclaimer requirements. Amid the pandemic and following the  2020 general election, foreign governments continue to exploit existing  vulnerabilities in our national security, including influencing  Americans directly and infiltrating public discourse without their  knowledge. Foreign adversaries, such as Russia, China, and Iran, are  among the most active, and they are increasingly assertive in their  efforts.   Madam Speaker, this amendment will help protect against foreign  influence that seeks to sow political division and promote dangerous  information contrary to the Foreign Agents Registration Act.   My amendment would require disclaimers--clearly stating this content  is coming from a foreign principal.  [[Page H1034]]
