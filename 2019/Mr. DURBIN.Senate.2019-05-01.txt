 Mr. President, in 1962, the airline Alitalia sent a young  man named Dominic DiFrisco to Chicago to help with publicity for its  inaugural flight between the city and Rome. What was a temporary  assignment became a life decision for my friend Dominic. He found a  home in Chicago and, in the decades following, became a champion for  Chicago's Italian community.   On Sunday, he passed away at the age of 85 after a life of  celebration, stories, and love. There are so many stories of Dominic  helping people that they are too numerous to count here. If you grew up  in Chicago, you knew Dominic.   For decades, Dominic was the most recognized and vocal supporter of  Italian Americans. Dominic was born in 1933 in the Bronx of New York  City to Leoluca and Antonina, immigrants from Sicily. He graduated from  Fordham University in 1955 and began his career in public relations.  His career was defined by building bridges between the public and  private sectors.   His color commentary, with his vast knowledge of Chicago-Italian  history, was a staple during the broadcast of Columbus Day parades. He  helped make sure other ethnic groups and Jewish Holocaust victims had  roles in the Chicago Columbus Day parade. He was a man of stories. He  always had one for any situation, and Columbus Day will not be the same  without him.   If you travel a few blocks north of Taylor Street's Little Italy in  Chicago, you will find Our Lady of Pompeii, the oldest surviving  Italian-American Catholic Church in Chicago. It has been an anchor to  the community since 1910, but in 1993, the archdiocese announced it  would close Our Lady of Pompeii. That didn't sit well with the locals,  especially Dominic. He joined the effort to resurrect the church, which  continues to serve the community today. Our Lady of Pompeii calls him a  founding father.   Dominic was president emeritus of the Joint Civic Committee of  Italian Americans, and he created and hosted the annual Dante Awards.  More than 40 journalists have won Dante Awards for their work answering  Dante Alighieri's call to be ``no timid friend to truth.'' Dominic was  no timid friend to anyone he knew.   Dominic was a great friend. He was always helping people whether it  was a smile, a kind word, or his latest recommendation for an Italian  restaurant. His stories were legendary, but his whole life was an  extraordinary story. A few years ago, Dominic accepted my invitation to  attend a joint session of Congress featuring the Prime Minister of  Italy. It is fair to say that many of those in the Capitol that day  were as impressed with Dominic's passion for life, his stories, and his  hopefulness for the U.S.-Italian relationship as the speech itself.   In a Chicago restaurant called Gene and Georgetti's, there is a table  that was Dominic's. It was his court, and now, sadly, it is quiet. To  his wife Carol and the DiFrisco family, Loretta and I send our sincere  condolences.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

(l) Biennial Reports by FEMA.--Not later than 2 years after       the date of enactment of this Act, and not less frequently       than once every 2 years thereafter until the date on which       all activities carried out with amounts from grants under the       pilot program are completed, the Administrator shall submit       to Congress and make available to the public on an internet       website a report that--        (1) describes--        (A) the progress of the activities carried out with amounts       from those grants; and        (B) the effectiveness of technology-based mapping tools       used in carrying out the activities described in subparagraph       (A); and        (2) with respect to the final report that the Administrator       is required to submit under this subsection, includes       recommendations to Congress and the executive branch of the       Federal Government for implementing strategies, practices,       and technologies to mitigate the effects of urban flooding.        (m) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that,       because the pilot program is limited with respect to scope       and resources, communities that participate in the pilot       program should acknowledge that the most successful efforts       to mitigate the effects of urban flooding--        (1) take a structural-based mitigation approach with       respect to construction, which includes--        (A) recognizing any post-storm damage that may occur; and        (B) pursuing designs that proactively minimize future flood       damage;        (2) make individuals in the community aware, through any       cost-effective and available means of education, of the best       approaches regarding the construction of properties that are       able to survive floods, which reduces the cost of future       repairs; and        (3) encourage home and property owners to consider the       measures described in paragraphs (1) and (2), which are the       most cost-effective and prudent ways to reduce the impact of       flooding, when constructing or renovating building       components.        (n) Funding.--There are authorized to be appropriated for       grants under the pilot program--        (1) $1,200,000 for fiscal year 2020; and        (2) $4,300,000 for fiscal year 2021, to remain available       through 2023.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

(g) Priority.--        (1) In general.--The Administrator shall select applicants       for grants under the pilot program based on the extent to       which the applications of those applicants shall achieve the       objectives described in subsection (c).        (2) Tiers 2 and 3.--In selecting applicants to receive       grants under the pilot program under subparagraphs (B) and       (C) of subsection (f)(2), the Administrator shall give       priority to applicants--        (A) that are highly vulnerable to sea level rise;        (B) within which are located a military installation or       another facility relating to national security concerns; or        (C) that have--        (i) populations that are highly vulnerable to urban       flooding; and        (ii) an uneven capacity for flood mitigation and response       efforts resulting from socioeconomic factors.        (h) Amount.--        (1) Considerations.--In determining the amount of a grant       under the pilot program, the Administrator shall consider the       population of the grant recipient, which may be considered in       terms of the tier under subsection (f)(2) with respect to the       recipient.        (2) Federal share.--The amount of a grant under the pilot       program may not exceed 75 percent of the total cost incurred       in carrying out the activities described in subsection (c).  [[Page S2573]]         (i) Duration.--The Administrator shall require each       recipient of a grant under the pilot program to complete the       activities described in subsection (c), which shall be,       subject to subsection (h)(2), carried out using the grant       amounts, not later than 18 months after the date on which the       recipient initially receives the grant amounts under the       pilot program.        (j) Use of Census Data.--The Administrator shall make all       determinations regarding population under the pilot program       by using data from the most recently completed decennial       census by the Bureau of the Census.        (k) Grantee Reports to FEMA.--Each recipient of a grant       under the pilot program shall, not later than 30 months after       the date on which the recipient initially receives the grant       amounts, submit to the Administrator a report that       describes--        (1) the activities carried out with the grant amounts;        (2) how the activities carried out with the grant amounts       have met the objectives described in subsection (c);        (3) any lessons learned in carrying out the activities       described in paragraph (2); and        (4) any recommendations for future mapping modernization       efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.        (l) Biennial Reports by FEMA.--Not later than 2 years after       the date of enactment of this Act, and not less frequently       than once every 2 years thereafter until the date on which       all activities carried out with amounts from grants under the       pilot program are completed, the Administrator shall submit       to Congress and make available to the public on an internet       website a report that--        (1) describes--        (A) the progress of the activities carried out with amounts       from those grants; and        (B) the effectiveness of technology-based mapping tools       used in carrying out the activities described in subparagraph       (A); and        (2) with respect to the final report that the Administrator       is required to submit under this subsection, includes       recommendations to Congress and the executive branch of the       Federal Government for implementing strategies, practices,       and technologies to mitigate the effects of urban flooding.        (m) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that,       because the pilot program is limited with respect to scope       and resources, communities that participate in the pilot       program should acknowledge that the most successful efforts       to mitigate the effects of urban flooding--        (1) take a structural-based mitigation approach with       respect to construction, which includes--        (A) recognizing any post-storm damage that may occur; and        (B) pursuing designs that proactively minimize future flood       damage;        (2) make individuals in the community aware, through any       cost-effective and available means of education, of the best       approaches regarding the construction of properties that are       able to survive floods, which reduces the cost of future       repairs; and        (3) encourage home and property owners to consider the       measures described in paragraphs (1) and (2), which are the       most cost-effective and prudent ways to reduce the impact of       flooding, when constructing or renovating building       components.        (n) Funding.--There are authorized to be appropriated for       grants under the pilot program--        (1) $1,200,000 for fiscal year 2020; and        (2) $4,300,000 for fiscal year 2021, to remain available       through 2023.                            ____________________
