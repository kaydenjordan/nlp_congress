 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by  thanking Chair Adam Smith for his leadership on H.R. 7900, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, and for working with my  team over the past few years to strengthen provisions to address toxic  PFAS exposures at the Department of Defense.   I thank Representatives Slotkin and Khanna for working with me on  this as well.                                time  2250     For more than 50 years, the military required  the use of firefighting foam made with dangerous PFAS chemicals known  as aqueous film-forming foam or AFFF, despite having known since the  1970s that it was toxic to people and the environment.   The Department of Defense has historically disposed of or destroyed  these chemicals through incineration or burning. However, PFAS does not  break down under typical incineration conditions.   Research shows that PFAS emitted through air stacks can travel  several miles downwind from facilities emitting PFAS, like  incinerators. That PFAS then deposits in soil and in drinking water  supplies in downwind communities, exposing unsuspecting Americans to  these dangerous chemicals.   Research also shows that in practice, incinerators are likely not  destroying PFAS completely, but rather, emitting PFAS and other toxic  chemical byproducts in our air, drinking water, and other local  surroundings.   Madam Speaker, that is why PFAS substances have often been called  ``forever chemicals.''   Why are we disposing of PFAS through incineration without evidence  that the chemical is, in fact, being destroyed and not causing further  harm to our communities?   That is why my amendment is critical. It builds on a provision  enacted under last year's NDAA, which placed a prohibition on the  incineration of PFAS by the Department of Defense until the  Environmental Protection Agency completed guidance or a final rule on  the safe disposal of PFAS.   This amendment simply extends the prohibition and requires the  Pentagon to submit a report to Congress on the progress of its  implementation of other safe disposal methods such as onsite PFAS  destruction technologies not requiring incineration.   There is no doubt that we need to dispose of dangerous PFAS  chemicals, but we cannot pursue disposal methods that cause more harm.  This amendment protects our communities and our environment and ensures  we are pursuing disposal methods that are safe.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in protecting our  communities and our planet from dangerous PFAS exposure by supporting  this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), my distinguished colleague.    Madam Speaker, I want to be clear: This is not  a permanent ban on the incineration of PFAS. It is a moratorium until  guidelines for safe disposal can be produced.   Unfortunately, Congress was forced to place a moratorium on  incinerating PFAS because DOD flagrantly ignored the directives  requiring DOD to satisfy certain requirements before incinerating PFAS  to ensure it did not cause further harm.   EPA's scientists reviewed non-incineration technologies; namely,  three commercial systems using supercritical water oxidation, and found  a high level of AFFF destruction, well over 99.99 percent. EPA has  suggested these technologies could replace incineration for AFFF.   We know there are better technologies; we are simply extending this  [[Page H6305]]  so that the Department of Defense can come up with a plan to dispose of  PFAS safely.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
