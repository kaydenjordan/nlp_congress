 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Mac  Thornberry for his extraordinary leadership and for the opportunity to  speak on amendment No. 76.   In the past few years, we have seen a clear rise in how terrorist and  extremist groups use propaganda and sophisticated messaging operations  to increase their reach to recruit new members, execute attacks, and  raise funds.   These violent extremist organizations represent a new type of threat  to the United States and our families, and we must identify how  existing agencies should work together to address the threat.   This amendment requires the President to submit a comprehensive  interagency strategy for countering violent extremist groups that pose  a threat to American families or their interests. Any plan would  identify how to counter the violent messaging, combat terrorist  financing, support existing law enforcement activities, support  counterradicalization organizations, and offer military support.   Additionally, the amendment provides for accountability by requiring  an annual assessment of the progress made implementing and achieving  the strategy. The time is now to bring a whole-government approach to  combat violent extremism. This strategy will serve a vital role in this  effort.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the passage of this amendment and the en bloc  package.
