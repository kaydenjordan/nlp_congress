 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the hard work,  leadership, and resilience of one of my young constituents, Irene  Alvarez.   She is finishing up her junior year at Salida High School and is the  winner of the 2023 Chaffee County Boys & Girls Club Youth of the Year  award.   When Irene was in sixth grade, her father was deported. Her mother  was forced to raise her as a single parent, working tirelessly cleaning  houses to support their family.   Despite all the trouble she faced at home, Irene chose to dedicate  herself to helping others. In her 10 years at the Chaffee County Boys &  Girls Club, she has become a leader, mentoring the kids around her,  especially those who do not speak English.   She teaches art, assists kids with their homework, and helps them  translate when necessary. In Irene's own words, we help ourselves by  helping others.   In the face of adversity, Irene triumphed. I can't express how proud  our whole community is of her strength and perseverance.   I congratulate Irene, and I congratulate the Chaffee County Boys &  Girls Club for being there to support and inspire leaders like Irene.                            ____________________
