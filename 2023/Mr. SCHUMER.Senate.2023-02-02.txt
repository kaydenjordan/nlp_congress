 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first a little bit of housekeeping, and  then we will get to my remarks.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there are two bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    Mr. President, in order to place the bills on the  calendar, under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceeding en bloc.    Mr. President, in America, when it is time to pay the  bills, we do so without fail and without delay. That is what families  must do, and that is what our government must do. It is one of the  bedrock principles of this country--one that holds true no matter who  is in the White House and which party holds majorities in Congress. Not  even during the Trump administration was this solemn duty neglected  even if many MAGA Republicans may feel differently today.   When I was minority leader here in the Senate, I sat down with  President Trump to find a path to raise the debt ceiling multiple  times. We didn't engage in hostage-taking. We didn't resort to  blackmail or brinksmanship. By no means was it easy, and many on the  other side didn't want to go along, but Democrats worked constructively  with the Trump administration to get it done, and it happened three  times. The same thing must happen again this year--no brinksmanship, no  hostage-taking, no default on the national debt. Congress must raise  the debt ceiling on a bipartisan basis without the hostage-taking,  without the brinksmanship.   So I was very glad to hear President Biden reaffirm this truth after  his meeting with Speaker McCarthy. He reiterated we ought to pass a  clean debt ceiling extension. President Biden is correct--the American  people expect us to do the right thing in the coming months because if  we default on the debt, every single American is going to pay the  price.   Later this morning, I will join with some of my Democratic colleagues  to put a spotlight on the consequences of default because they are not  remotely theoretical or abstract. The debt ceiling is not just an  abstract exercise somewhere up there in the clouds. If we fail to renew  it, it is going to affect every American family's pocketbook or wallet,  with many, many dollars taken away.   A default on debt would create a crisis unlike any we have ever seen  in our country. Mortgages, car loans, and credit card rates all will go  shooting up. American families with adjustable rate mortgages or who  are seeking to buy a house will pay thousands of dollars more each  year--what a terrible nightmare at a time when costs are already too  high in housing and everywhere else.   But just as terrible as that sounds, this is only the tip of the  iceberg. If the U.S. defaults, retirement savings--the  [[Page S214]]  money that people have scrapped away, put away, so they might live in  dignity toward the end of their lives--will be utterly devastated. By  one measure, the typical retirement account could lose $20,000 in  value--$20,000. We are talking about people's livelihoods, money that  people have set aside little by little every month so they can reach  retirement with some degree of dignity.   A default would rob Americans of that, and the devastation would go  on and on and on. Social Security would suffer. Medicare would suffer.  Over 18 million veterans could lose their hard-earned benefits, like  disability compensation. America's reputation on the world stage would  be permanently stained, and few things would hand the world over to the  Chinese Communist Party more than a first-ever default by the United  States of America.   So the bottom line is simple: Playing games with the debt ceiling is  dangerous, destabilizing, and would spell disaster for every single  American--dangerous, destabilizing, disaster. The last thing we should  be doing in Congress is using the debt ceiling as a political  bargaining chip. Instead, we need to come together and make sure the  United States is able to pay its debts on time--without brinksmanship,  without hostage-taking--just as we have done throughout our history.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on Big Oil profits, last year, while  soaring gas prices stretched the budgets of American families, Big Oil  enjoyed a record--a record--year of profits. There were huge amounts of  money made by these companies. Earlier this week, Exxon reported a $56  billion--billion--net profit in 2022, setting a record high not just  for Exxon but for Big Oil as an industry. And Exxon wasn't alone-- Chevron reported $35 billion.   While Americans were feeling the pain at the pump--driving their cars  up to the gas stations and wondering how high it was going to be--the  five top big oil companies brought in a record of nearly $200 billion  in total profits in 2022, taking advantage of what they called  ``favorable market'' conditions. It is nothing short of repugnant for  the biggest oil companies in America to celebrate dizzying profit  margins that they earned by jacking up gas prices on hard-working  Americans.   And what did the oil companies do with this tsunami of cash? They  could have prioritized it by paying their workers better, but they did  not. They could have made transformative investments in new clean tech  and helped push the frontier in clean energy, which we all know is  coming, but they did not. Maybe, best of all, they could have lowered  gas prices, but they did not. Do you know what the oil companies did?  This is just as galling--galling. They rewarded shareholders by  implementing stock buybacks at near record levels. Buybacks do no good  for the economy. They don't help the worker. They don't help the  consumer. They don't move us along to green energy. They don't even  produce more oil. All they do is line the pockets of the already  uberwealthy executives and shareholders.   Here is one example: Exxon announced they plan to spend $35 billion-- $35 billion--on stock buybacks in the next 2 years, which is more than  double their plans to invest in clean energy over the next 5 years. I  want to say that again. For anyone who doesn't think corporate America  is out of control and does whatever it wants and thumbs its nose at the  needs of the globe or the workers or the citizens, Exxon announced they  plan to spend $35 billion on stock buybacks in the next 2 years--more  than double their plans to invest in clean energy over the next 5  years. That is where Exxon's priorities are.   So Big Oil executives may claim they are good stewards or that they  understand the climate crisis, but when it comes time to put their  money where their mouth is, their actions tell a different story.   We must continue to take on entrenched oil interests, just as we did  last year when we passed the Inflation Reduction Act. Doing so will  have a tremendous benefit for our economy, for our environment, and for  American families everywhere.   We Democrats will continue to make one thing clear: If oil companies  are going to make record profits, they must do it not by manipulating  prices to take advantage of hard-working Americans.                            ____________________     Now on Chile and the treaty, for more than a decade,  Congress has been working on an important tax treaty with Chile that  holds important and long-term consequences for American businesses and  American competitiveness on the world stage.   Right now, nations around the world are racing to source important  materials like lithium. Lithium is a key ingredient in everything from  iPhones to EV batteries. Chile is one of the most important sources of  these kinds of raw minerals, including lithium, and many U.S. companies  have spent years building business partnerships with Chile and have  grown their presence in that nation.   But these companies face a terrible problem. Because of current  policy, American companies face double taxation due in Chile and are at  a huge disadvantage compared to other nations like China. We don't want  China to get this lithium. We need it.   So we have a taxation treaty at the ready that would remove this  obstacle. It is very similar to the more than 60 other treaties we  already have with nations around the world. This is nothing new. It is  wildly supported by voices across the political spectrum--the Biden  administration, on one hand, but the pro-business Chamber of Commerce,  on the other.   Here is the amazing thing. The U.S.-Chile treaty was already reported  out of committee last year. It had, I believe--I am not certain of  this, but I think it was passed by voice vote, meaning unanimous  support. It had overwhelming support. Unfortunately, it has to go  through committee again because of the new Congress, but Democrats are  100 percent ready and eager to get this important treaty moving.   Republicans in the past always have long supported moving it forward  too, and I imagine most do. But, right now, this treaty has been  delayed yet again because some want to add last-minute changes to the  text that risk undermining it altogether.   Again, there are some who want to introduce last-minute changes to  the treaty, even though this was reported by voice vote out of  committee last year, was nearly added to our end-of-year  accomplishments alongside the omnibus, and has been around for close to  10 years.   Let me be clear. These last-minute changes could delay or even end  any chance of getting this treaty done. It at least could force us to  renegotiate with other governments, and you know what a long, time- consuming, difficult, fraught-with-peril process that is.   We should move forward and ratify this treaty with the agreed-upon  text without last-minute changes. The effort has been more than a  decade in the works. It is time to finish the job.   Again, if we want to give China advantage to get Chilean lithium,  instead of giving it to the United States, where we so desperately need  it, that would be a disgrace and a shame. Moving this treaty quickly,  without any last-minute changes, is the way to solve that problem.   So, please, let's move forward. Both sides should come together to  move forward quickly and without any more delay. It is long enough.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, quickly, on the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, last month, the House passed a bill to prohibit the  sale of oil from the Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. I  have seen the proposal, but here is my question: Why stop at China?  What about Russia, North Korea, Iran?   If we are going to do this, why not do it right and see if we can add  a few more countries to the list? It is certainly worth taking a look  at.   So that is what we are doing. We are going to take a look at this  proposal and, hopefully, find ways to make it stronger.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 3.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore.
