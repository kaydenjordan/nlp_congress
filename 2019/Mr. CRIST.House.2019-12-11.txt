 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Elijah E.  Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   Pinellas County residents, my bosses, are fed up with the high cost  of prescription drugs. One young constituent, Taylor McKenny, said it  best: ``You shouldn't have to choose between paying rent or paying for  life.''   You see, Taylor has type 1 diabetes, and when the insurance ran out,  Taylor's family had to pay $120 just for a 3-day supply of insulin,  medicine she has to take every day simply to stay alive.   A lifesaving drug shouldn't have a poisonous list price.   I cosponsored H.R. 3 so that Taylor can afford her insulin and nearly  600,000 of my constituents can get cheaper drugs.   I also cosponsored the Doggett amendment because everyone, those with  or without insurance, should be protected.   Today's choice is quite simple: Do you stand for the people or do you  stand for big pharmaceutical companies?   I stand for the people.   Lower drug costs now.                            ____________________
