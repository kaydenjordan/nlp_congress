 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, it has been almost 2 months since severe  flooding devastated communities in southwest Iowa and our neighbors in  Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri. Entire towns were under water, homes  were destroyed, and family farms were devastated. Small businesses are  facing irreparable damage, and many local schools may be forced to  permanently close their doors.   I have been down to the flood zones multiple times to speak with  farmers, homeowners, and business owners who have lost everything.  Their resilience is inspiring, but the damage is heartbreaking.   When I helped Lizzie Young and her family muck out her house, I saw  firsthand how desperately Iowans need that disaster relief.   David Leuth, a farmer from Percival, has been kayaking out to his  farm field to assess and repair his damage.   Fran Par, a Pacific Junction resident whose home remained under water  for weeks, has been helping repair large city water pumps to move water  out of the flooded area.   In Hamburg, Grape Community Hospital, the only rural hospital in the  area, had to bring in military-operated water tanks just to keep its  doors open to provide basic services. True to who Iowans are, they are  now providing space to local businesses inside the hospital so that  those businesses don't have to leave the area. We want to keep people  in our State.   School district superintendents in Mills and Fremont Counties are  locating displaced students to provide them with transportation and  meals so they can keep coming to school on a daily basis.   Iowans need our help. My amendment today increases funding for  programs that are crucial to helping Iowans and our neighbors rebuild  and recover.   My amendment will increase funding for the Emergency Watershed  Program which is desperately needed for the Midwest to recover. The  Emergency Watershed Program helps communities quickly address serious  damages to infrastructure and land and fix imminent hazards to life and  property caused by natural disasters. From my firsthand experiences in  the flooded areas, I can attest to the serious damage and hazards that  these communities face.   The USDA had to release a new estimate in April for funding for the  Emergency Watershed Protection program due to the Midwest floods.  Instead of the $125 million that was the prior estimate, the USDA has  now estimated they will need $435 million. So my amendment of $310  million makes sure the USDA has enough money to help the Midwest.  Without this funding increase, the USDA might not otherwise be able to  ensure Iowans and our neighbors get the help that they deserve.   The Emergency Watershed Program funding will be used to remove debris  from streams, roads, and bridges; it will help repair eroded river and  stream banks, and it can be used to repair damaged and destroyed  drainage facilities in communities like Hamburg. This funding can be  used to repair the more than 40 levees that breached during the  flooding, and those that didn't break suffered erosion damage from  overspill from those that are still standing.   Experts believe it will take years to repair all the damage. Iowans  don't have that time to wait, and the National Weather Service shows  the Midwest will remain vulnerable to flooding all spring and summer,  and rivers are expected to stay high.  [[Page H3709]]    This Federal aid is vital to rebuilding Iowa communities. The Iowa  Governor believes we sustained almost $1.6 billion in damages. Early  estimates also indicate at least $214 million in agriculture-specific  damage, and we still don't know the true extent of our agriculture  losses yet.   We can't afford to wait. We can't let partisan politics stall this  crucial bill, and we must not turn our backs on our communities when  they are recovering from devastating damages of natural disasters. That  is not who we are as Iowans, and that is not who we are as Americans.   I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in the House  and the Senate to get together and work for hardworking Americans.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment is to increase funding for the  Federal Highway Administration Emergency Relief program.   As we have just discussed, I have toured the flood zones in my  district, and I have experienced firsthand how badly the floodwaters  have eroded and impacted our roads. The flooding was so severe that as  of only just this past Wednesday of this week did our major interstate  I-29 finally fully reopen, and this comes nearly 2 months after the  flooding began. The closing of I-29 cut off the major north-south  artery in Iowa that connects the Omaha-Council Bluffs area to Kansas  City.   Drivers are forced to travel hours out of their way and find smaller  two-lane roads and highways to get to where they need to be. The  resulting truck and traffic damage on our secondary roads is already  apparent. Residents have suffered as traffic has suddenly doubled and  tripled, and we still have roads that aren't open yet.   Mr. and Mrs. Patel, motel owners in Fremont County, are dependent on  I-29 being open and traffic coming through the area to keep their  business open, and that is not going to happen without functional  roads. If our roads remain closed, children can't get to school,  community members cannot patron local businesses, and grandchildren  can't spend time with their grandparents.   The Federal Highway Administration Emergency Relief program will help  Iowa address our immediate highway repair needs, restore traffic, and  help restore our facilities.   Safe and functional roadways are some of the most critical  infrastructure in any community, let alone one trying to recover from a  disaster, and this type of Federal aid is vital to rebuilding Iowa  communities in need.   Initial estimates from our Governor show we sustained over $1.6  billion in damages, and that number is growing. Programs like this one  mean that Iowa and Nebraska can focus on repairing our local roads and  ensure the Federal Government does its part in paying for those roads.   I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in the House  and the  [[Page H3710]]  Senate to get to work helping hardworking Americans, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I just want to close by thanking my  colleagues across the aisle and, in particular, Representative  Fortenberry and Mr. Curtis for helping out all these people in need,  not just in our communities in Iowa, but across the country. I am  looking forward to passing this disaster bill today so we can get this  immediate relief out to folks across this country, including those in  my own backyard.   I am grateful for all the work that has been done by the chair of  Appropriations and the subcommittee chair, Sanford Bishop, to help us  get where we needed to be on this. I am looking forward to going back  to Iowa and letting them know we have got the funding necessary to help  them repair their lives.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, passing this disaster supplemental is vital  to any community that suffered from disasters over these last 18  months. But I rise today to talk about one community--mine, Iowa's  Third Congressional District.   Entire towns were underwater. Many Iowans have had their homes, small  businesses, and family farms destroyed. Medical centers and schools  face irreparable damage and may never be able to reopen their doors  again.   Parents are worried about where they are going to be able to send  their kids to school. The lasting impacts on the health and well-being  of Iowa families and our rural communities are beyond calculation.   I have been to our flood zones multiple times to speak to farmers,  homeowners, and business owners who have lost everything. Their  resilience is inspiring, but the damage is devastating. And Iowans are  hardworking, taxpaying Americans.   This motion to recommit is playing partisan politics with people's  lives, and it is unacceptable.   I helped Lizzie Young and her family muck out their house. David  Leuth, a farmer from Percival, has been kayaking out to view his  fields. Fran Mierzwa from Pacific Junction had her house underwater for  almost 2 months.   Great Community Hospital in Hamburg, the only rural hospital in the  area, had to bring in military-operated water tanks just to keep its  doors open for basic services. Now, because they are standing up for  their community, they are providing space for small businesses to  operate, in hopes that those businesses don't leave the area so that  community doesn't die.   If this motion to recommit passes, it will prevent this disaster  funding from moving forward.                                time  1215    If this motion to recommit passes, it will prevent disaster funding  from moving forward. A ``yes'' vote is to tell Iowans and Americans to  wait longer. A ``yes'' vote is a slap in the face to everybody across  this country who is suffering from these disasters.   I am here to tell you Iowans can't afford to wait. None of our  constituents who have been impacted by floods, tornadoes, or fires can  afford to wait.  [[Page H3714]]    Madam Speaker, I urge this body to stop making Americans wait, to  vote down this motion to recommit, and to pass this bill.
