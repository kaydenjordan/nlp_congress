 Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, today I rise to recognize  Unalam, a family-run lumber manufacturing business in Otsego County,  New York, which will celebrate its 125th anniversary this year on  October 4.   Unalam is owned by the Van Cott family, which has established a  multigenerational reputation of supporting our upstate farmers and  small businesses with quality lumber products and innovations.   Unalam's journey began in 1892, when J.W. Van Cott began selling  lumber in Unadilla, New York. Since then, each generation has left its  mark on the family's business. Unalam has become a renowned firm for  its expert production of glulam, or laminated timber barn rafters.   Today, Unalam is headed by J.W. Van Cott's great-great-grandson,  Craig Van Cott, and his children, Zoe Vandermeulen and Leif Van Cott.   I thank and congratulate the Van Cott family as well as the past and  present employees of Unalam as they celebrate this incredible  milestone.                            ____________________
