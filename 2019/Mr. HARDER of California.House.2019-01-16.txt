 Madam Speaker, today, I rise on behalf of  the communities affected by the devastating wildfires in northern  California.   These past few months have been a trying time for our community.  Entire towns were destroyed, crops were burned, and thousands of  families were left with nowhere to call home. My relatives' home was  completely destroyed in the Paradise fire.   In my district, we had to wear masks because of the terrible air  quality. Farmers throughout our region took a huge hit with missing  livestock and crops ruined by thick ash.   Today, I am proud to lead a bipartisan amendment bringing $1.9  billion in relief to our farmers for crop and livestock losses during  the fire. This is incredibly important to my district, and it is just  the start in helping our communities rebuild. It is also a perfect  example of how we can put party labels aside, actually work together,  and do what we were sent here to do: help people.   I know a lot of people in my district are frustrated we can't even  work together to keep our government open. I am frustrated, too. Let  this be an example and a sign that, out of tragic loss, we can remember  what actually unites us.                            ____________________
