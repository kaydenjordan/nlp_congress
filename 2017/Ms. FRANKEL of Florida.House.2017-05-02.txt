 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson for  yielding, and I also want to thank Chairmen Shuster and Barletta and  Ranking Members DeFazio and Johnson for their continued support.   I have had the honor of working on this legislation with my friends  from Florida: Congressmen Dan Webster, Brian Mast, and Frederica  Wilson.   I have said this before and I am going to say it again: Florida knows  hurricanes. In 2004 and 2005, Charley, Frances, Jeanne, Wilma, and  Katrina tore through our State, leaving families stranded and property  damaged.   I was the mayor of the city of West Palm Beach when we saw trees  crash to the ground, ripping power lines and blocking flooded streets.  Water systems were compromised, and our local governments, around the  clock, did a miraculous job cleaning debris, fixing broken  infrastructure, and getting life back to normal. It takes a lot to get  it done.   When hurricanes strike, communities are ravaged, and so are their  budgets. So I want to first thank FEMA for the funding assistance it  provided Florida in a great time of need. With that said, FEMA is now  asking some of our cities and counties to pay back money that was given  for disaster relief projects that were approved more than 10 years ago.  [[Page H3024]]    There is no question that FEMA should do a responsible audit and make  sure that money is used properly. However, the process should not be an  endless journey into the Federal bureaucracy. Our local governments  cannot afford to wait an infinite number of years for FEMA to do its  assessment, especially when millions of dollars are at stake.   The current practice stymies our local governments' ability to plan  their future budgets, and, unlike the Federal Government, they can't  run a deficit. So this bill would make sure that the process is more  evenhanded, giving FEMA adequate time to review its grant payments  while allowing for the financial security of our local governments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this very good  legislation, and I urge the Senate to take action.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New  York.   I just returned from a trip to South Korea and Japan, a bipartisan  trip, where we focused on the dangers of North Korea. First, I want to  just say what became very clear to us is how important our relationship  is with South Korea and Japan, both economically and for our national  security.   We sat in roundtable discussions with scholars, ambassadors, and  military leaders from the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China;  and I will tell you one thing was unanimous in the thinking: a  preemptive military strike right now on our part would be  catastrophic--catastrophic not only to our friends in South Korea, the  millions who live there, our friends in Japan, but the hundreds of  thousands of American citizens and our military personnel.   I thank our chairman and our ranking member for their good work, and  I urge my colleagues to support this good bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge a ``no'' vote on  this misleading name, Working Families Flexibility Act.   Quite simply, this is a bait-and-switch proposal. It awards employers  flexibility, not the families who need it. It fails ordinary working  men and women, like the mom who has no overtime stored up and must go  into credit card debt after having a baby or the dad who has worked  long, crushing overtime hours but can't afford to give up his pay in  order to stay home with his ill son.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats have better solutions: 12 weeks of paid family  leave, guaranteed paid sick days. These are proposals that will  modernize our workplace. It will lead to better workers and stronger  families.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special  Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special  Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, the women of the Democratic  Women's Working Group are here today with other Members that we have  invited to raise awareness about the offensive Marines United Facebook  page and others like it.   On these pages, male marines posted nude or intimate photos of female  servicemembers and veterans without their consent. This affected  hundreds of women, with an audience of an estimated 30,000 marines with  access to the Facebook page.   The Democratic women recently held a hearing on this alarming  situation which, incidentally, began less than a month after the first  Marine infantry unit was assigned women, and that was January 5.   At our hearing, we heard testimony from advocates for servicemembers,  a former marine, and a journalist who  [[Page H3053]]  covered this issue extensively, and most importantly, we heard from  Erika Butner and Marisa Woytek, two brave, resilient marines.   Marisa is a current lance corporal. She proudly followed in her  father's footsteps, and she joined the Marines because, as she stated,  she wanted to be part of something bigger than herself.   Erika enlisted in the Marines for many of the same reasons in 2011,  fully aware that she could be deployed to a combat zone. A lifelong  patriot, she was ready, and willing to take that chance. But in her own  words--little did she know that the ``war she would fight would be  among her very own brothers in arms.''   At our hearing, the women described harassment and exploitation at  the hands of their Marine brothers, and, quite frankly, it made us feel  sick to our stomachs.   Their male counterparts put up Erika's and Marisa's photographs and  made lewd and derogatory comments--asking other men to vote on whether  they would ``smash or pass'' on these women, meaning would they have  sexual relations with them.   The women were threatened with rape and violence, with Facebook posts  like: ``We should throw marines into a tub of acid and rip-off their  eyelashes.''   Sadly and shockingly, Marisa and Erika were not alone. Thousands and  thousands of photos of women were shared on these Facebook pages.   I want to say to Marisa and Erika and all of these women: We share  your anger and your hurt, and we are so grateful to you for coming  forward with your stories.   I am a mother of a United States Marine veteran who served in both  Afghanistan and Iraq--a proud mother--and I understand the selfless  sacrifice a marine makes when he or she puts on their uniform. So I am  outraged, as are my colleagues whom you will hear from today, that so  many brave marines were subjected to this kind of harassment and  exploitation while willing to sacrifice for our country. It is not only  personally degrading to courageous patriots, it hurts the effectiveness  of our military and the ability to recruit women.   So today's Special Order is another opportunity to amplify the voices  of Marisa and Erika and to send a message that we stand with them and  we will fight for their honor.    I want to thank Congresswoman Jackie Speier and Congresswoman Martha  McSally, who I hope will be here with us today. They are actually, very  sadly, at another hearing where the topic is sexual harassment in our  military academies.   After our hearing, they went on and they introduced a bill to make it  illegal for military members to share photos without consent. This is a  bipartisan effort. I am proud to be a cosponsor, as are many of my  colleagues, again, whom you will hear from in a few minutes; and we owe  it to Erika and Marisa and all of the other women that have been  subjected to this abuse to pass this legislation and to work together  to change the culture of disrespect that allowed it to happen.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lee), a great leader in this Congress, a member of our Appropriations  and Budget Committees and Subcommittee on Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.   Representative Lee, we are pleased that you are with us tonight.    Very well said, Representative Lee. Mr.  Speaker, I thank Ms. Lee for her excellent service and advocacy.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield the floor to the gentlewoman from  the  [[Page H3054]]  State of Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), my co-chair and our vice chair of  the Women's Working Group, a very illustrious Member, and she serves on  the Transportation and Oversight Committees.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Kuster  for that forceful advocacy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee),  one of our greatest fighters for human rights, for women's rights; the  ranking member of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Frankel, our  chair, our leader, and all of my colleagues that appeared today. What a  powerful force of women who are standing by our Marines.   Now, let me be very clear: All of our men and women in the United  States Marines have earned and deserve our respect and trust. All of  the women in the United States Marines deserve our trust and our  respect.   So it saddens me today to have to rise and bring to the attention of  so many this unbelievable abuse of the men and women--men because their  reputation is tarnished, through no fault of their own, who are not  affiliated with Marines United; and women who feel that their service  to this Nation has been denigrated.   Let me cite for you the words of 23-year-old Erika Butner:   ``As a Marine Corps veteran, I am disheartened and disgusted with  this scandal.''   Victim blaming and the excuse that some are giving that boys will be  boys needs to stop.   Butner says she first heard of the group in August when a friend of  hers was posted to the page without her consent. In January, she  notified the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and Google about a  shared drive posted to the group that contained naked photos of more  than two dozen servicemembers. Comments posted to the group described  the victims graphically and, in some cases, advocating that they be  raped or sexually assaulted. Names, ranks, and duty stations of the  victims were also shared. The Marines United page has been taken down,  but there are supposed to be some 30,000 users of that site.   Can you imagine that this is my story for America: that young women  marines who put on the uniform and, therefore, are willing to lay down  their life and bleed for this Nation and die will be subjected to this?   So I join my colleagues in standing against it, and I ask my friends  in the United States Marines--and I have many. I have staff persons who  have been members of the Marines and a wounded warrior on my staff  right now who loves his Marines. But enough is enough. We will not  tolerate the objectification of women, we will not tolerate the  nonconsensual pornography, and we will not live with sexual assault.   That is why, for starters, I am proud to be a cosponsor of  Congresswoman Speiers' resolution for claiming April as Sexual Assault  Awareness and Prevention Month. Also, I am very pleased of the privacy  bill that is being put forward to never have this occur again. Every 98  seconds another American is sexually assaulted, and there are an  average of 321,500 victims per year.   So this ties very clearly into what these United States Marines, who  happen to be women, are facing. This is a horrendous reality for women  here in the United States, but it is a reality for women in uniform who  are defending our freedom abroad. That is what I want to focus on as I  complete my remarks.   These female marines go to faraway places and are in the battlefront  and the battle lines, standing alongside with their male counterparts.  They are expected to go through basic training without any waivers.  They are expected to carry that gun without any waivers. They are  expected to wear that uniform in dignity without any waivers.   Nude photographs of female marines and veterans across the military  were shared on Marines United, and those photographs showed women in  various stages of undress, and they were grossly obscene. Some posts on  Marines United suggested sexually assaulting women marines and that  women did  [[Page H3056]]  not belong in the United States military or this particular branch.   Once again, these photos were posted without the knowledge and the  consent of the women whose photos were posted. This conduct, as I said,  is unacceptable.   The Marines Corps' creed of good order and discipline is being  undermined when it cannot police Marines who use social media to  promote anti-Semitism, sexism, and racism. These messages of hate are  oppressive and demean human dignity.   Let me close by saluting our United States Marines because I do know  that they have decades and centuries of laying their lives down. That  is not the issue here as I stand before you today.   What the issue is, of course, is that United States Marines deserve  the dignity and the respect, even if they are women and, I might say,  especially because of what has occurred because they are women. They  ask for no deference. They ask for no waivers. They ask for no  apologies in terms of them being United States Marines. They simply  want that dignity and respect that we all owe them.   I salute them and we stand alongside them.    Mr. Speaker, I think we have made it clear  that when a member of the military is unfairly abused, we are all  abused, we are all dishonored.   This is not a Democratic issue. This is not a Republican issue. This  is an American issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), one  of our great Americans, an Air Force veteran who serves on our Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Bacon,  first, for his service to our country and for speaking from the heart.  We are very pleased to join him in this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Torres), who serves on the Foreign Affairs and the Natural Resources  Committees.   I want to say that Representative Torres is, like myself, the mother  of a military veteran. Her son is a member of the Air Force. In  bringing the gentlewoman up here, she probably experiences a lot of  what I did. I think for parents whose children are in the military, man  or a woman, there are so many of those times where you just dread that  knock on the door.                                time  1830    You have seen your child put on uniform, and the pride that they  feel. Now, could you imagine having gotten a call from your son that  someone had posted a nude picture of him on a Facebook page and he was  being humiliated? It is just hard to believe.   I know you are going to share some of your insight into all this. I  am pleased to have you here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Torres).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  son's service and for her service, too. I know what it is like to be  the mother of a military person.   Mr. Speaker, we are waiting for--Representative McSally is going to  be with us in a few moments, and I thought, as we wait for her to join  us--as I said, she is at a hearing now. Unfortunately, the hearing is  on the topic of sexual harassment in the military academies.   I wanted to just state for the Record the folks who participated at  our Democratic Working Women's Group hearing that we had a couple of  weeks ago, we talked about Lance Corporal Marisa Woytek. We talked  about Erika Butner, who is a Marine Corps veteran, and both,  unfortunately, were victims of this Marines United scandal.    We also heard from James LaPorta, who is a journalist for The Daily  Beast and a former U.S. Marine Corps sergeant who has covered Marines  United extensively. His work has appeared in The Washington Post and  the Chicago Tribune, among other national publications. During his 8  years on Active Duty, Mr. LaPorta served within the infantry and  intelligence communities, deploying multiple times to the war in  Afghanistan.   We also heard from Miranda Peterson. She is the executive director of  Protect Our Defenders, which she joined in 2013. Protect Our Defenders'  mission is to uplift and support survivors of military sexual assault,  and to improve and reform the U.S. military's process for addressing  rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment.   Prior to joining Protect Our Defenders, Mrs. Peterson worked on the  historic lawsuits against the Department of Defense filed on behalf of  military sexual assault survivors who experienced abuse and retaliation  after reporting, and which were the subject of the Oscar-nominated  documentary film, ``The Invisible War.''   We also heard from Elizabeth Hillman, and she is the president of  Mills College. She was invited by Representative Barbara Lee. Elizabeth  Hillman has conducted extensive research on the history of sexual  violence in the military organization's culture. She is a director and  past president of the National Institute of Military Justice, a  nonprofit that promotes fairness in and public understanding of  military justice worldwide.   She previously served on the Response Systems to the Adult Sexual  Assault Crimes Panel, an independent panel chartered by Congress to  study and make recommendations about sexual assault in the U.S.  military.   And of course we heard from Gloria Allred, who is a nationally  renowned women's and victims' rights attorney. She was the lawyer  representing Marine Corps veteran Butner and Active-Duty Marine Lance  Corporal Woytek.   What treasures these activists are. They are patriots in their own  way because they are defending and standing up for our patriots; and  how sad that they have to spend so much of their time to do that.   Now, since this scandal broke up, there have been numerous articles  written. I want to share one as we wait for Representative McSally,  who, herself, is a military veteran.   Thomas Brennan actually broke this story. He wrote that: ``The U.S.  Department of Defense is investigating hundreds of marines who used  social media to solicit and share hundreds, possibly thousands, of  naked photographs of female servicemembers and veterans.'' That is just  so shameful.   ``Since January 30, more than two dozen women, many on Active Duty,  including officers and enlisted servicemembers, have been identified by  their full name, rank, and military duty station in photographs posted  and linked to from a private Facebook page.'' Again, very shameful.   Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to welcome Representative McSally. I  would say to you that I have been talking about you in your absence.  First of all, I told the Speaker that you were, unfortunately, at a  hearing on sexual harassment in the military academies.   But we are so grateful for your--first of all, for your service to  our country and for your advocacy in standing up for what is right for  our military men and women. Ms. McSally is our lead sponsor on this  PRIVATE Act, which we have had many speakers talk about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally).   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague. And yes, I  just came over from a hearing on the Armed Services Committee; first  panel with some victims, and second panel with the superintendents of  the different military academies.                                time  1845    As the only female veteran on my side of the aisle, and having been  an academy graduate myself, I thought it was very important for me to  be there and continue to help to lead on these issues that are near and  dear to my heart. I know there has been much discussion. I want to say  thank-you for helping to organize this and manage it and all the people  who came down to speak on this very important issue.   As was likely mentioned before, we came upon this issue on Saturday,  March 4. The Marines United Facebook page discovered individuals linked  with this private group were posting nude, intimate photos of women, as  well as personal information, their names, and duty stations, without  their consent or their knowledge.   The next day, the NCIS started to launch an investigation and, 1 week  [[Page H3058]]  later, discovered, unfortunately, this was not an isolated activity.  Sharing intimate photos without a consent is a problem that now we are  seeing in the other branches of the military.   Such degrading behavior from troops in uniform is disgusting. As a  veteran and a former commander myself, it is infuriating. In some ways  it is not surprising, but it is intolerable, and we rise on both sides  of the aisle today to say that we are standing together to help on our  part, in our appropriate role to stop this.   Our servicemembers enlist to serve this country and protect it from  our enemies. They should not have to watch their backs among  individuals who are to be their teammates. Sharing explicit photos of  fellow servicemembers undermines women and destroys trust and morale.  It decreases effectiveness of our Armed Forces, and it embarrasses  America. United States troops must be warriors. What it means to be a  warrior is to embody courage, commitment, honor, trust, and respect. In  all the services we have our core values. They are on and off duty.  That is what it means to stand up. We stand in the gap for others. We  are not the perpetrators. We are supposed to be the protecters. We are  supposed to be the ones who are embodying and leading in those values  that we hold dear.   The unearthing of this widespread problem has highlighted the  difficulty in prosecuting Active Duty military members, though, who do  this, who share private, intimate photos of their teammates without  consent. This action is harmful, and it destroys the bonds of trust in  the unit that are so critical for our warfighting capabilities.   So to look at the UCMJ, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, again,  I am pretty familiar with this having been a commander and a retired  colonel. We have a couple of articles, article 133 and article 134.  Article 133 is conduct unbecoming of an officer. Article 134 is what we  call anything that is prejudicial to good order and discipline. This is  one I would say as a commander we often use as the catchall article.  When we could not prosecute someone under another article, we go to  article 134 because we knew their behavior was degrading good order and  discipline.   Civilian law faces challenges in prosecuting this crime. Thirty-five  States and the District of Columbia have statutes against sharing  private, intimate digital media without consent, but the State laws  vary in their proof, the elements, and the punishment.   The Marines recently created a regulation where they can charge these  Neanderthals who commit these violations, but creating regulation isn't  the same thing as strengthening the law. That is why I introduced the  PRIVATE Act. Again, this is a bipartisan bill. My bill provides clear,  unambiguous charge that gives commanders a sharper tool in the UCMJ for  targeting and prosecuting this behavior. It clearly defines this  behavior as a crime, and it also addresses the issues of intent and  free speech.   These actions are a symptom of a larger issue: why we must change the  culture that promotes this behavior. While these blatant, disrespectful  actions have been committed by a specific subset of our military, this  is indicative of a larger cultural problem. I just came from speaking  about that in our Air Force Academy hearings--I'm sorry, not just Air  Force, all the academies.   This is not the first time that behavior like this or culture like  this has really been addressed, nor will it be the last. Myself, as the  first woman in the U.S. to fly in combat in a fighter aircraft and to  command a squadron, I have personally experienced, confronted, and  overcome sexist behavior in the military. I have been there, I have  seen it, I have lived it, and, quite frankly, I am sick of it.   We need to do what we can together to stop it. We must confront the  underlying issues that inculcate resentment toward women in our  services. We need to address the topic now and send a clear message  this behavior has no place in our military. The issue is developing at  the speed of broadband, but our solutions are often stuck at the speed  of bureaucracy.   I have met with the commandant of the Marine Corps, General Neller,  immediately after this news broke. We had a very productive  conversation, and I look forward to continuing work with him and the  other service chiefs to address this issue.   We also can't allow this to turn into victim blaming, though.  According to one victim who tried to have a video removed:   ``I went to the police to get them to take it down, and they told me,  because I didn't live in North Carolina, they couldn't do anything. I  then went to his command, and they said: Why don't you stop making sex  tapes?''   This is not a matter of free speech on the internet. This is a matter  of military members who have infringed on the rights, the duty, and the  basic respect of others. We can't afford to let another military member  become a victim of this crime.   I appreciate everyone stepping up for this Special Order today. I  appreciate the bipartisan support of the PRIVATE Act. It is not going  to solve it by itself, but it is going to give the commanders another  tool. I promise I am going to tirelessly be working and leading on this  issue to protect our troops and make sure we have the best, most  respected, and most trusted warfighting force.   I want to thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to speak.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative McSally.  We have come to, I think, a perfect ending here today--those of us who  were here today. I know, on a bipartisan basis, we look forward to  fighting for the gentlewoman for what is right and to get this bill  passed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
