 Madam Speaker, today, I am here again, once more, to  speak about an American citizen, Michael Nguyen, who is currently in  prison in Vietnam on vague allegations and charges.   I thank my colleague, Representative Katie Porter, for her tireless  advocacy on this matter, and the men and women at the State Department,  including Ambassador Dan Kritenbrink, for their work and continued  support.   It has been over a year since Michael was arbitrarily detained,  hastily tried, and harshly imprisoned on claims that he plotted to  overthrow the Government of Vietnam, which no one--and I repeat, no  one--has seen any evidence of.   Earlier this year, Michael was convicted, along with two Vietnamese  men, after a half-day trial. Michael was sentenced to 12 years in  prison, which is longer than the two Vietnamese men received for the  same charges.   Michael's family has struggled emotionally and financially with his  imprisonment. His wife and four daughters only want him to come home.   He is currently appealing the length of his sentence.   As a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Vietnam, I call upon the  Vietnamese Government to do the right thing: quickly close this case  and return Michael back to the United States and to his family.                            ____________________
