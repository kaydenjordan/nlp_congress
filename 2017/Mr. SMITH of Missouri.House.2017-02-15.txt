 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res.  42, to eliminate the Obama administration's intentionally unfaithful  execution of our laws.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, the previous administration knew  exactly what they were doing when they wrote this regulation. President  Obama signed off on the underlying law to allow States to drug test  certain unemployment insurance recipients, then he worked to block its  implementation. Today, we will vote to end President Obama's  obstruction.   Instead of faithfully executing the law, as our Constitution demands,  the Obama administration effectively blocked States from making sure  hardworking taxpayer dollars only go to deserving citizens.   The Congress spoke in 2012, before I arrived here, but here is what  happened. Congress spoke, and the President signed a bill into law to  give States an option--not a mandate, an option--to drug test.   I stand today to say let's roll back and undo our previous  President's unfaithful execution of the law and allow States like  Missouri to have the freedom to decide for themselves. This is not a  mandate; this is simply about states' rights.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this joint  resolution.
