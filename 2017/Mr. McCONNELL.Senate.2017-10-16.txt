 Madam President, as I discussed with the President and  the Vice President at our working lunch today, the Senate has a full  schedule of important work ahead of us.   The Senate's fall agenda includes confirming more nominees to the  judiciary, administration, and other important positions. Later today  we will resume consideration of another nominee, Callista Gingrich, who  has been nominated to serve as our Ambassador to the Vatican. That  agenda includes providing continued assistance to communities affected  by the recent hurricanes, and we will process the President's  supplemental funding request to do just that. The Senate's agenda also  includes completing work on the budget resolution and advancing tax  reform--two things that are critical to helping our economy finally  realize its true potential after the stagnation of the last decade.   This budget will be the next step to spurring growth in our economy.  It provides a pathway to balance, it reins in Federal spending, and it  honors our commitments to Social Security and provides for the national  defense.   In addition to these important aspects of this budget, it will also  provide the legislative tools to advance tax reform. As I have said  before, tax reform is the single most important thing we can do today  to get our economy moving again.   We think taxes should be lower, simpler, and fairer for middle-class  workers so that Americans can keep more of their own hard-earned money  in their paychecks. We think taxes should be reformed to end the  perverse incentives that help keep American jobs and profits offshore  and so it is easier to make and keep American jobs where they belong-- right here at home.   We think it is time to take more money out of Washington's pockets  and put more money in the pockets of the American middle class. That is  why we know it is time for tax reform.   The tax reform goals I just mentioned are shared by many, including  the President, his team, Chairman Orrin Hatch, and Chairman Mike Enzi.  As I said, to get there, we first need to pass the budget before us. I  want to thank Chairman Enzi and the members of the Senate Budget  Committee for all of their work in getting us to this point. As we  advance that budget on the Senate floor this week, Senators on both  sides of the aisle will have the opportunity to offer their input.   I look forward to putting our finances on a better path with this  budget, just as I look forward to continuing with the other important  initiatives on the Senate's fall agenda.
