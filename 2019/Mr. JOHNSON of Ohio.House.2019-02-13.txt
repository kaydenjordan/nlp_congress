 Mr. Speaker, as a proud father of four and a  grandfather of six, I rise today in strong support of those who cannot  defend themselves, the most innocent and defenseless among us, the  unborn.                                time  1800    I share the pro-life views of those I serve in eastern and  southeastern Ohio.   A few weeks ago, many Ohioans joined more than 100,000 pro-life  Americans at the annual March for Life here in Washington, D.C.  Although, with so little national media coverage of this major event,  some may have missed this passionate and growing movement made up of  men and women, boys and girls from all walks of life.   Recently, we have witnessed the inhuman policies introduced by  multiple States permitting late-term abortions, even, unbelievably, all  the way up to birth.   It is past time that Congress pass legislation banning this horrific  practice.  [[Page H1565]]    Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides to reject  infanticide and defend the sanctity of human life.
