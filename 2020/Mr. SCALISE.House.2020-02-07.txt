 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), my friend, the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring  about the schedule for the House next week.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding back and  for going through those items that are going to be up on the House  floor next week.   I would like to ask the majority leader with respect to some of the  things that were discussed at the State of the Union--and I am sure we  are going to be talking about a few things that happened during the  State of the Union.   The President identified a number of items where he challenged us in  Congress to work with him on addressing some of the challenges that are  facing our country. And he identified some items by executive order  that he is working on, but he also identified some items from  infrastructure--where I noticed there was applause on both sides of the  aisle--to some areas on educational opportunities, school choice--where  unfortunately, the remarks weren't received as equally as maybe they  should have been--but it also provides us some opportunities to find  some areas where we can work and achieve some things that would benefit  people all across this country.   I would ask the gentleman, first, starting with infrastructure, there  is tremendous interest that I have heard from Members on both sides to  try to work on a package that we can get agreement on.   I haven't seen the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure  tasked directly with doing that, but I have heard there is interest  from Chairman DeFazio and from Ranking Member Sam Graves in trying to  reach that common ground.   Is there an emphasis that is placed from the leadership of the  majority on tasking the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure  with actually going and working and going and finding that common  ground, which we know is there, to try to put together an  infrastructure package in these next few months?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. On those fronts,  clearly there is an ability to find common ground as we talk about  infrastructure. There has been a lot of discussion over what that  number would be, what the amount would be, because ultimately, it would  have to be a number that we could both get an agreement amongst  Republicans and Democrats that would be paid for.   And I think both sides acknowledge, it has got to be paid for. That  has usually been the sticking point with infrastructure. But within  that, whether it is $200 billion or $2 trillion, there is an  understanding that we need to do more work to try to find out how we  can get agreement on how to pay for it. And I do think the ability is  there to find that agreement. The amount would be variable.   But also, it is something the President has talked about, as well as  a number of Members of Congress have, making reforms to the way we  build major projects: roads, bridges. The infrastructure delays so  often are caused by red tape that is unnecessary.   I have heard from Governors, both Republican and Democrat, that would  like to see Congress not only send money--obviously, the States would  like to see more Federal money come--but also, to see less strings  attached so that a project that right now might take maybe 10 years to  do, because of so many overlapping delays in red tape, that should  maybe take 2 years at most. In many cases, that delay alone is what  prohibits the project from being done because it drives the cost up so  much. Because a project that might take 10 years, in many cases is  going to be deemed unaffordable and it just gets scrapped as opposed to  if we address not just the financing, but also the bureaucracy and  eliminating red tape so that we can get more projects done quickly. I  think that would be another area where there is a lot of mutual  interest in seeing if we can come together.    And the President is very interested in doing that, when I have had  talks with him. It is not just the amount that we are able to get  agreement upon, but it is also the reforms to the red tape so that we  can move projects quicker. And in many cases, do projects that are  unaffordable because of those delays that are unnecessary. And I know  that is something we can work on. Hopefully, we can get everybody  together a few more times to get closer to finding that agreement on  infrastructure.   As it relates to healthcare, there has definitely been a divide  between our sides, if you look at H.R. 3. I think the gentleman  recognizes it was a very bipartisan bill. The vote reflects that.   The Senate--however our agreement might be on how the Senate does  business, clearly, they do business differently than the House--but  traditionally, they have been reluctant to take up hyper-partisan bills  when they are moving things through. They will go more to a bill that  has got more broad support. USMCA is a real good example of that. It is  probably the best template for how both sides can work together to do  something big. Something very bipartisan, something very good for our  country and something that we were able to get moved through both  sides.                                time  1230    If you look at H.R. 19, for example, I would suggest to the gentleman  that whatever the bill number is, it is not really the number of the  bill. It is what is ultimately in it that we can get bipartisan  agreement upon.   H.R. 19 was an approach that we took to say let's go find not the  partisan approaches to healthcare, but areas where we had broad  bipartisan support, including the package of bills that came out of the  House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously.   Most people across the country are shocked when they hear that  Congress actually did work together.   Republicans and Democrats came together to put together a package of  bills that would lower drug prices that the President would sign that  could be in law today where prescription drugs, generic drugs, would be  on the market quicker so people could be paying a lower cost.   That package of bills came out of committee unanimously. Every  Democrat, every Republican worked for months. It took a long time to  put that agreement together, but, ultimately, both sides did come  together.   If we could look at those approaches. And, again, H.R. 19 includes  only bills that were bipartisan. People had worked together on various  elements of improving healthcare, from lowering prescription drugs,  protecting preexisting conditions, but not in a partisan way, in a  bipartisan way that could actually get signed into law.   One way or another, we are going to find some issues where we can  move, both Republican and Democrat coming together, bills over to the  Senate. Those would clearly have a much higher likelihood of not only  getting taken up by the Senate, but actually getting signed into law.   So I would suggest, when you look at some of those approaches, the  bipartisan approach where you don't have a Presidential veto, but you  also have a strong ability to get Senators on both sides to want to  take that up as well.   And then, finally, on school choice, the Education Freedom  Scholarship and Opportunity Act, this is something that President Trump  cited in the State of the Union specifically, and you can see it in  isolated cases.   I come from a city, New Orleans. I was born in the city of New  Orleans. I was on the board of Teach for America in New Orleans, and we  had a dramatic overhaul of our public school system where we created a  charter school movement.   It was actually a Democrat Governor, Kathleen Blanco, who,  unfortunately, passed away recently, who signed that bill, Republicans  and Democrats working together, that has transformed some of the worst  failed public school systems in the country.   New Orleans' public school system--prior to our reforms, considered  by most as the most failed public school system in the country--now has  a very healthy charter school movement where children have real  opportunities. Parents have real opportunities. Schools are competing  for students, and it is working for the student. This is in a large  urban system where it was failed, and now it is very successful.   Clearly, no system is perfect, but there are many more options there.  There are many more options for parents.   Congressman Byrne has a bill--there are other bills that are out  there--to try to give at least some additional options to families so  that, if they are in a failing school, they can have a better place to  go, and, ultimately, the system would be working better for the  students.   So, on all of those fronts, I would hope that we could find those  areas of  [[Page H965]]  common ground and start there, build that, and work with the Senators  and with the President, who wants to address these issues, like we were  able to address USMCA, which was signed into law last week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Clearly, we have got a lot of agreement on our  disagreement with the Senate's way of doing business. Of course, one of  their impediments that I know I have encouraged a change in that they  haven't taken up is the 60-vote rule just to bring up a bill.   So many of the bills, when we were in the majority, that would go  over to the Senate that we felt strongly about that would not be  brought up, it was a majority Republican Senate, but because they have  a 60-vote requirement, the minority could and would, on occasion,  prevent many of those bills from coming up.   But that is why I suggested to the gentleman, what we found is, of  the issues we would like to tackle that we really do feel confident we  can get an agreement with the President on, the Senate has shown a  higher likelihood of taking up a bill if it has got that broad support.   And so in the example of H.R. 3--and, for the record, there were only  two Republicans who voted for it--while that could be called  bipartisan, there was a separate package of bills that came out of  committee unanimously.   So, if you have one approach that still is viewed as very partisan,  with just two Republicans voting for it, to address healthcare issues,  if there is a different way to approach it where every Republican and  every Democrat on the committee of jurisdiction passed those bills that  would lower drug prices and the President said he would like to sign  it, I would think the gentleman would agree, if those two bills are put  side by side, which one do you think would have a higher likelihood of  making it through the Senate to the President's desk? It is very clear  that the one that was unanimous would have a higher likelihood.   And that is why I just suggested H.R. 19, because that was a bill  that, while we would have liked to have included a number of other  issues that maybe just our side might support, we put those on the side  for now to say let's find those areas in healthcare where we have very  broad support amongst Republicans and Democrats, and that is reflected  in H.R. 19. You want to put a different package together.   If the approach is let's address this in a bipartisan way, we have a  very high likelihood of getting not just the President's support, but  also the Senate's support at moving that through.   I don't know if the gentleman has any more comments on that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   And now that the Senate has a little more free time, maybe we can get  them to take up some of that legislation. I surely hope that we, on  both sides, will continue working toward those, because there are areas  of common ground that many have found and many have worked for months  to find.   I do want to shift gears and talk about the decorum the night of the  State of the Union.   The President talked about many things, as in any State of the Union,  and I have attended 10 now. We have had Republican and Democrat  Presidents, and there are things that I agree with in certain States of  the Union, and you can stand, you can sit, you can applaud. But I think  we all saw something that goes way beyond and, in fact, violates the  rules of decorum in the House, and that is when the Speaker ripped up  the speech.   Clearly, it was a premeditated move. I have seen actual video of her  practicing or starting to rip it prior to the end of the speech.   But when you go through the speech--and, again, the President's theme  was ``the great American comeback,'' and he talked about things that  are working well in our country, working well for everybody, where  every segment of society is benefiting, and, of course, as every  President since Ronald Reagan has done, highlighting some of those  great things that are happening in our country by bringing people into  the gallery to show the real face on some of these great things that  our country does.   Again, if part of a policy that created that great visual is  something that one side disagrees with, some people stand up, some  people don't. But to suggest that it didn't happen or that it is a  lie--as some in the leadership of your majority actually said, the  whole speech was a lie--I would ask: Was General Charles McGee's  recognition as a Tuskegee Airman a lie? I think that was something  great that people enjoyed celebrating.   Kayla Mueller, the humanitarian worker who was brutally murdered by  al-Baghdadi--it happened. Her family was here. And al-Baghdadi was  taken out by American troops, which I think was the right thing to do.  That is not a lie. That is something that we ought to recognize and  respect.                                time  1245    When Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake was killed serving a tour of  duty in Iraq by a roadside bomb that was generated from an Iranian  terrorist, which was led by General Soleimani. And now Soleimani is  gone because the President took action to take him out. That happened.  It is not a lie.   In fact, the fact that Soleimani is gone is something we should all  celebrate, just as we celebrated when President Obama gave the order to  take out Osama Bin Laden.   I think for most people there wasn't a dry eye in the House. I know I  have heard from friends all across the country who were tearing up when  they saw First Class Sergeant Townsend Williams, who had been on his  fourth tour in the Middle East, and here was his wife and young  children, and the President surprised surely her, and all of us, by  bringing him back home. What a special moment that was, just to see  that family reunited.   And, again, tears, I think, were not a partisan issue at that moment.  But it clearly did happen, and is not a lie, and it is something,  again, we should all celebrate.   But again, for decorum of the House, for the Speaker to do that, I  think most would agree, was not appropriate. At a minimum, an apology  should have happened. There wasn't.   We brought legislation yesterday to rebuke the Speaker to make it  clear that that is something not becoming of any Member of the House,  let alone the Speaker of the House. Unfortunately, it was tabled on the  roll call vote yesterday.   But I would hope that we could recognize, when that happens again,  that we won't tolerate that kind of activity from our Members, let  alone our leader.   If the gentleman has anything to say about that, I will yield.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments, but  those names were part of that document that was ripped, and I am sure  many of them were as offended as we are that it happened. I just would  hope it wouldn't happen again. I wish we would all speak out equally  against that.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman making that  statement, and I would share that. I wish the person who took the  action would make that statement to those people because many were  offended. But that will be left to discuss later.   But for now, I look forward to working with the gentleman on all of  these issues that we discussed that the President offered the olive  branch for us to work with him on and, I think, are very achievable if  we do roll up our sleeves and tackle it together.   I think there is, again, a template for how to do it. USMCA is  clearly one, and there are many others. 21st Century Cures is another  example when we were in the majority with a Democrat President and  worked very closely to achieve something that will be a milestone in  curing major diseases for years to come; and, hopefully, we can deliver  more of those kinds of wins for the American people that we all  represent.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
