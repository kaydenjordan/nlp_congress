 Mr. Speaker, 67 years ago yesterday, Dr. Jonas Salk  announced that the United States had successfully tested a vaccine to  prevent polio, a dreaded virus that afflicted tens of thousands of  Americans. Mr. Speaker, we have beaten terrible diseases before, and we  will again.   When we were attacked on 9/11, our heroes were the firefighters and  police officers who ran towards the burning buildings and the citizens  who stormed the cockpit of flight 93, who put their own lives at risk.   Mr. Speaker, we have those same heroes today. Today they are the  thousands of nurses and doctors and countless other healthcare  professionals and their staff who work in our hospitals and clinics and  provide the greatest care anywhere in the world.   Mr. Speaker, we owe them our deepest gratitude. We also owe them  every tool, every piece of equipment, and every resource they need to  save lives.   Mr. Speaker, we also have a duty to our parents and our grandparents.  In this greatest Nation on Earth, we protect the sick and the most  vulnerable. We owe all we have to our mothers and our fathers, to the  generations who came before, and we must do all we can now to protect  them.   All of us, Mr. Speaker, are called into the service of this blessed  Nation at this time of challenge, not as Democrats or Republicans, but  as Americans. This pathogen does not recognize party lines, and no  partisan solution will defeat it--neither will the government acting  alone. It will take all of the ingenuity and innovation of the American  private sector working with our Federal, State, and local governments.   This is not a time for cynicism or invective or second guessing. This  is a time to remember that we are citizens of the greatest Nation on  Earth, that we have overcome every challenge we have faced, and that we  will overcome this one.   We are one nation, Mr. Speaker. We should all be rooting for our  President to succeed, for New York Governor Cuomo to succeed, for  California Governor Newsom to succeed, and for Wyoming's Governor Mark  Gordon to succeed.   Indeed, we must do everything we can to help every State and every  Governor in our great Union. The bill we are voting on today is a  crucial step.   On the Sunday after 9/11, my family worshipped at Evergreen Chapel at  Camp David with the families of Cabinet officials and servicemembers  who were assigned there, many of whom would go on to serve overseas in  the following years.    Mr. Speaker, that morning, as our Nation faced another  time of testing, the chaplain urged us:         Work as though everything depends on you, because it does.       Pray as though everything depends on God, because it does.    We will defeat this virus. We will restore our economy. We will heal  our Nation. We are Americans.
