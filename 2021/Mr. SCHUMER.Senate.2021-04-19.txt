 Madam President, the Senate returns this week with a  full plate. Today, we will continue to work on two important  nominations to the Justice Department: Lisa Monaco and Vanita Gupta.  Both should be confirmed by the end of this week. The Senate will also  vote to confirm SEC Commissioner Gary Gensler to a full term.   At the same time, the Senate will continue to work on the anti-Asian  hate crimes bill. Last week, the Senate voted to proceed with the  legislation by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 92 to 6. The process  will continue to be bipartisan.   Senator Collins has worked with Senator Hirono--you, Madam  President--on a few modifications, which we have welcomed. Senators  Moran and Blumenthal have worked with Senator Scott of Florida to  incorporate his feedback into their legislation called the NO HATE Act,  which would improve and strengthen the bill.   Senator Warnock has worked with Senators Hirono and Collins to  include language acknowledging the recent tragic shootings near  Atlanta.   All of these ideas will be incorporated into a broader final  substitute amendment. I will ensure the Senate votes on the substitute  amendment in the coming days. All told, the Senate is on track to  finish this bill later this week.   We are seeing that when the Senate is given the opportunity to work,  the Senate can work. Members from both sides of the aisle have worked  together over the past week to consider, perfect, and--soon--enact  legislation responding to a pressing issue.   Regrettably--very regrettably--in recent years, all of us have  witnessed a surge of White nationalism and violent extremism in  American society. Senators of good will from both sides of the aisle  have taken note and developed proposals to give Federal law enforcement  officials the tools to better detect, prevent, and prosecute this surge  in hate crimes.   The Senate will incorporate many of these ideas in the final  substitute amendment to this bill. As a result, I am optimistic we can  finish our work on the anti-Asian hate crimes bill later this week in  the same manner we started, with an overwhelming bipartisan vote.   And, let me say, it is needed. As I go through New York--I have been  to several more rallies, one early this morning--anti-Asian hate crime,  unfortunately, is on the upsurge. We hear about the violent acts. We  have heard about the deaths. But, every day, thousands--thousands--of  Asian Americans are subjected to smaller but nonetheless stinging acts  of hate crime by being called names, by being spat upon, by being  cursed at, and even just by being stared at in a nasty way like: Who  the heck are you?  [[Page S2002]]    So we must act. We must act both to strengthen the Department of  Justice's ability to prosecute more hate crimes and to pay attention to  hate crimes and to calculate their number, but also to send a message-- two messages, in fact: one to our Asian-American friends--a great 6  percent of America and 10 percent of New York is Asian American--that  you are us, we are all Americans together, and we welcome you being  here. I, for one, like you, Madam President, would welcome more Asian  immigrants coming to America.   But second is a message to those who perpetrate these awful acts: You  are not American. We despise what you do, and we are going to remain  vigilant until this kind of bigotry is diminished and maybe even  snuffed out.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, for the last year,  the country has faced a daunting series of crises. After such a  difficult year, it is important to take stock of how the country is  finally, finally starting to recover.   Over a month ago, Senate Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan,  supercharging our Nation's vaccination drive and putting thousands of  dollars into the pockets of Americans who needed it most. Already, the  benefits are pouring in.   Yesterday, the CDC announced that the country had reached a truly  remarkable milestone. Over half of U.S. adults, 130 million Americans,  have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. It is the  result of a rapidly accelerating pace of distribution, which we in the  Senate--many of us--pushed for, first in the December bill and then in  the ARP bill. The country now averages over 3 million doses per day.   Even better news arrived this morning. Starting today, every single  adult in the United States is eligible to get vaccinated. Let me say  that again. All U.S. adults in all 50 States, Washington, DC, and  Puerto Rico are now eligible to get the vaccine, meeting the deadline  President Biden set just 2 weeks ago.   I urge all Americans to go online, find a location where vaccines are  being administered, and get the vaccine. Register, sign up, call in. Do  whatever you need to do to make yourself an appointment. This is about  protecting yourself and protecting your family. We are on our way to  beating COVID-19, but everyone needs to do their part, and part of  doing your part is being vaccinated.    Inoculating a country of 330 million people--a country the size of a  continent--is a momentous task. The fact that we have already reached  the halfway point in 4 short months is a credit to the Biden  administration and our work here in Congress to fund vaccine production  and distribution, and it is a credit to the thousands of medical  researchers, scientists, doctors, nurses, and all the public health  workers who have made this possible.   Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, our economy has gotten its own  shot in the arm. The Treasury Department announced that nearly 159  million stimulus payments--$376 billion--have reached people across the  country. Last week, jobless claims fell to their lowest levels since  the start of the pandemic. Global consumer confidence is now higher  than it was even before the pandemic. Across the country, the American  Rescue Plan is accelerating our economic recovery. Consumer spending is  up, businesses are gradually reopening, and American workers are  regaining hope and reentering the workforce.   Thanks to our historic investment in American workers, American  families, and the American economy, brighter days are just around the  corner. All of us who worked hard on passing the ARP and the previous  legislation can be very proud of what we were able to do. Now, of  course, we are not completely out of the woods yet. Despite the roaring  success of the American Rescue Plan, we must continue to bolster our  economic recovery and create good-paying jobs for American workers.  That is why infrastructure--big, bold infrastructure--remains at the  top of our priority list.   There isn't a community in this country without some glaring  infrastructure challenges, be they crumbling roads, bridges, or school  buildings, aging sewer systems, housing properties, or unreliable  internet. If America is going to compete in the 21st century, we can't  have an infrastructure that is stuck in the last century, so Congress,  in coordination with the Biden administration, is going to work on a  comprehensive jobs and infrastructure bill this year.   Today at the White House, President Biden will meet with Members from  both parties to continue bipartisan discussions on an infrastructure  package. The President has reiterated his intention and desire to work  in good faith with our Republican colleagues. Hopefully, our Republican  colleagues share that willingness and desire. Reliably investing in our  Nation's infrastructure used to unite our two parties. It can do so  again.   Here in Congress, we are going to start getting our teeth into the  details of an infrastructure package. Right here in the Senate, there  are numerous activities going on this week. Tomorrow, the Senate  Appropriations Committee will hear from four Cabinet-level officials on  the details of the American Jobs Plan: Secretaries Buttigieg, Raimondo,  and Fudge, as well as EPA Administrator Michael Regan. Later in the  week, the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee will hear from  Secretaries Buttigieg and Raimondo on the President's Build Back Better  agenda, and the Democratic caucus will meet with the Director of the  National Economic Council, Brian Deese, on the same subject.   As the Senate begins to shape the contours of a comprehensive  infrastructure bill, I will soon move to have the Senate take up a  bipartisan water infrastructure bill. This legislation, the Drinking  Water and Infrastructure Act, was advanced by the Environment and  Public Works Committee on a unanimous vote earlier this year. It will  authorize tens of billions of dollars to make sure American families,  especially low-income families, have access to safe and clean drinking  water.   The drinking water bill could represent a small but important first  step in bringing our two parties together on the work on  infrastructure. I salute the chairman of EPW, Tom Carper of Delaware,  and the ranking member, Senator Capito of West Virginia, for coming  together on the legislation. We look forward to working with our  Republican colleagues later this work period to get that piece of  legislation done.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I  ask for its immediate consideration.    I ask to dispense with further reading of the amendment.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 62, the nomination of Vanita Gupta, of Virginia,  to be Associate Attorney General.   I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that, as if in  executive session, the nomination of Shannon Estenoz, of Florida, to be  Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife, sent to the Senate by the  President on April 19, 2021, be referred jointly to the Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Environment and  Public Works.    Madam President, I understand that there are two bills  at the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my own  request, all en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  April 20; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate resume consideration of S. 937, the COVID-19 Hate  Crimes legislation; that at 12 noon, the Senate proceed to executive  session to resume consideration of the Gensler nomination and the  Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination; that the  Senate recess following the cloture vote on the Gensler nomination  until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; further, that  if cloture is invoked on the Gensler nomination, all postcloture time  be considered expired at 2:15 p.m.; that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action; finally, that following  the confirmation vote, the Senate resume legislative session.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:28 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, April 20, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
