 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of the rule, which makes an amendment  that I offered part of the security package by the adoption of this  rule.   I want to acknowledge the frustration of my colleagues at adding  funds to construct three barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border.   Like many of you, I would have preferred a package which included all  12 appropriations bills. However, this is the process that we are going  forward with, and, of course, I am supportive of it.   Despite my reservations about the process, I believe that each of  these three projects included in this amendment are absolutely  necessary for national security.   The funds that are in what we call the ``wall'' part of this bill are  28 miles of levee wall in Hidalgo County, Texas.   Many people have asked me what that is. Mostly everybody knows a  levee is a big mound of dirt that keeps the water from flooding. Well,  it is a big pile of dirt with a 20-foot wall on one side made of  concrete to keep it from washing out and a 6-foot fence on top of that.  It serves for water retention, as well as defending our borders.   The funds pay for the construction of 32 miles of bollard wall in  Starr County, Texas, which is Rio Grande City and that area. Bollard  fence is a bunch of steel poles about the size of a small corner post  on a cedar post fence. They rise up about 20 feet in the air and have a  cement base.   Also, the funds pay for 14 miles of wall in San Diego, replacing an  existing 14 miles of wall or fence with a better product because it has  been deteriorating since the 1990s, when it went in.   That is what is in this bill.   Many people claim it isn't necessary to put up barriers between the  border of the United States and Mexico. They say the border is more  secure than it has ever been, apprehensions are way down, and that  border walls do not prevent people crossing. In fact, I disagree, and  they do, too.   It is a fact that apprehensions are down relative to the mid-2000s.  In fact, in the late nineties, in San Diego, before their barrier  fences were built, 500,000 people stormed across that border. Last  year, the number is 25,000. That is a substantial reduction.   More than a million people crossed our Southern border every year in  the early-2000s. However, today, we continue to apprehend certain  people, and it is down to 200,000 a year on the border. That is a  substantial number.   What concerns me more than the number of apprehensions is the fact  that if migrants are crossing the border illegally, then so are  terrorists, drug smugglers, and human traffickers.                                time  1300    Mr. Speaker, many Members of this body probably remember illegal  immigrants rushing the border in San Diego back in the 1990s. Illegal  immigrant entries decreased significantly, as I said. The number of  illegal crossings fell, crime rates declined, commerce increased, and  neighborhoods became safe all because of fences and barriers on the  border.   The Border Patrol cautions that illegal border migration seeks the  path of least resistance and that these commendable results do not mean  that the flow has steadied. It has simply moved to another unprotected  place like the Rio Grande Valley in my home State of Texas. We want to  change that dynamic.   This amendment is important because it is committed to dedicated men  and women who stand in harm's way on our behalf.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I ask Members' support for this  bill and for this amendment.
