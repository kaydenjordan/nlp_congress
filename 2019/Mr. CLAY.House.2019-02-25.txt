 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the newly  installed Clerk of the U.S. House, Cheryl Lynn Johnson.   She is the 36th American to be elected to this critical position. The  Clerk, as we know, serves as the legislative official in the House, a  position that goes back to the first Clerk and to the first Congress in  1789. As was mentioned, she comes to us from the Smithsonian  Institution where she served as the Director of Government Relations.   Among her many achievements, as was mentioned, Cheryl helped to make  the National Museum of African American History and Culture a brilliant  reality.   But this is not her first tour of duty on Capitol Hill. In fact, she  previously spent almost two decades in service to this institution, and  as was mentioned, her first position was serving on the  [[Page H2067]]  committee staff of my father, former Congressman Bill Clay.   She spent 10 years as the chief education and investigative counsel  for the Committee on Education and the Workforce where she advanced  reforms in elementary and secondary education, juvenile justice, child  nutrition, labor issues, and employment and nutrition programs for  seniors.   Prior to that, she served as staff director and counsel for the  Committee on House Administration's Subcommittee on Libraries and  Memorials and then Subcommittee on the Post Office and Civil Service.   Ms. Johnson is a distinguished graduate of Howard University Law  School and the University of Iowa. She is married to Clarence and has a  son, Bradford.   I go back with Cheryl as a friend for 40 years. Our families are  close. Growing up around this institution that we all love, I was  fortunate to be in the company of and witness the examples set by many  great public servants--Members and staff--who devoted themselves to  representing their constituents in the true spirit of public service.   Cheryl Johnson exemplifies the highest standards of public service,  honor, and integrity that will elevate the 116th Congress. I am pleased  to welcome her as our new Clerk, and I am prouder still to call her my  good friend. She will be an enormous resource for Members and staff,  and I am proud to welcome her home.   Welcome back, Cheryl. Congratulations.                            ____________________
