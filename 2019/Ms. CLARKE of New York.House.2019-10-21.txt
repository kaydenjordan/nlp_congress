 Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleague,  Chairwoman Bass, and our coleaders for this evening's Special Order  hour, for providing this moment for us to reflect.   Let me start by saying, on behalf of myself, the Clarke family, and  the people of the Ninth Congressional District of New York, I rise  today to reflect upon the life and the legacy of the great chairman of  the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Chairman Elijah Cummings, and  express my heartfelt and deepest condolences to his wife, Maya  Rockeymoore, his family, friends, constituents, and staff. Our great  Nation is mourning and is in shock over the loss of a great man.   As one of seven children born to parents who were sharecroppers and,  just as important, or maybe more importantly, pastors of the Gospel, it  is safe to say that Chairman Cummings embodied the epitome of our  ancestors' wildest dreams and most fervent prayers.  [[Page H8290]]                                     time  2030    Chairman Cummings represented Baltimore, Maryland, with devotion,  pride, dignity, and integrity, and dedicated his career to ensuring  that his beloved community was never marginalized.   As chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Mr.  Cummings used his voice to protect our democracy, to protect our civil  liberties, and indeed, our humanity and our Constitution until his very  last breath, and we will forever be indebted to his lifelong dedication  to public service.   He will be remembered as a steadfast, former chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus, an advocate of the Congressional Black  Caucus and black communities across this Nation who used his voice to  elevate our colleagues in leadership positions and to mentor black  staffers.   I recall when I was elected to the House of Representatives in the  year 2006, I heard from all of the members of the New York  Congressional Delegation, but I got a call from this gentleman from  Baltimore, Maryland, with a thundering voice over the phone. That is  when I knew I had made it, because I received a call from Elijah  Cummings. And he offered his support, his mentoring, and his  encouragement, and continued to do that every day that we served in  this body together.   Let us all take comfort in knowing that Chairman Cummings' legacy  will be forever ingrained in the halls of Congress through the next  generation of leaders that his work impacted and inspired, and all of  us who are his legacy keepers.   Chairman Cummings completed his mission. He is now, as he has said,  dancing with the angels, and will go down in American history as a  pillar in preserving our democracy and our core American values.   Words cannot express the void and loss that our collective community  feels during this time of bereavement, but we must lift our heads and  continue to walk in the light of Chairman Cummings' legacy. We are  standing on the shoulders of a giant, and we will live out his mission  of creating a better America for all, one where we pass on to our  children and grandchildren a nation far greater than the one that we  inherited.   May Chairman Elijah E. Cummings rest in peace and rise in glory. We  will miss him dearly. I thank him.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and my privilege  to continue the CBC's Special Order hour, and we are going to call this  portion CBC and friends.   It is my honor now to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green),  one who has served alongside the Honorable Elijah E. Cummings  throughout his tenure here and I know would like to bring forth his  very special remarks and reflections at this time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Houston for sharing those very inspiring, uplifting comments about our  dear, beloved colleague at this time.   It is important for us, as we go through the stages of mourning, to  recognize, as he has stated, rightly stated, that we were fortunate to  have Elijah Cummings with us for 68 years--his family, his friends,  even longer--and during the 68 years, we were fortunate to have him as  part of our family here in the Congressional Black Caucus and in the  Halls of Congress.   In that time, he was able to accomplish so much through his God-given  talents and abilities that he has become well-known not only here in  the United States, but around the world.   I am hearing from members of the Caribbean community who have read  about and heard about the passing of Elijah Cummings, all of whom have  reached out to share with me their comments and their condolences  because they understand what Elijah has meant not only to the United  States House of Representatives, United States Congress, but, indeed,  because he was a world-class leader.   Mr. Speaker, I have some friends and colleagues of the honorable  chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee who would like to say a  few words, if you will, about our great colleague.   It is my honor, at this time, to yield to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), my classmate and colleague, a member of the  Oversight and Reform Committee and the Judiciary Committee, to give his  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Tennessee for sharing his insight and his own personal experiences with  our dear colleague, Elijah Cummings, who touched so many lives, Members  here in Congress, the members of their family, our own constituents.   Like Mr. Cohen, so many people in my district were reaching out and  expressing their condolences and sharing their stories with me this  past week. I attended a church service where, again, people talked  about Elijah Cummings. His influence has gone far and wide, and I think  that the values that he held about our democracy are reverberating, and  that should give us all great heart to move forward and press forward  as we fight the battle to preserve our democracy and lift up the  Constitution and rule of law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch),  another colleague and also another classmate of mine, who has joined us  and would like to share his sentiments, his insights into the life of  Elijah Cummings and his interactions with our dear colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Vermont for sharing his insight as a member of the committee led by the  Honorable Elijah E. Cummings.   As we wind down here this evening, there are a couple of things that  have been a running theme among our colleagues this evening, and it is  sort of the quiet thunder, the strength, the dignity, the integrity of  the Honorable Elijah E. Cummings. And I thought about the fact that  still waters run deep. He wasn't a boisterous person, a showboater, but  he knew how to command the moral authority that moves a Nation. Whether  it was voting rights or civil rights, whether it was the children of  Flint or the children of the border, whether it was preserving this  democracy and making sure that the rule of law stands above all else in  the Constitution of the United States, we could turn to our North Star,  Elijah E. Cummings to be a champion, to be a voice, to be the compass  that led this Congress into the next level of integrity that we need to  move this Nation forward.    And so, we are honored this evening that so many colleagues have  taken the time to be here in tribute to the Honorable Elijah E.  Cummings. We again want to, on behalf of the members of the  Congressional Black Caucus and colleagues of the wider body, express  our heartfelt condolences to Maya Rockeymoore, the family, the  constituents of Maryland's Seventh District, as well as the very  dedicated staff of the Honorable Elijah E. Cummings.   Congressman Cummings will never be forgotten. As I stated in my  comments, we are legacy keepers, and so everything that we have been  taught and learned from Elijah will be applied in the days ahead as he  would have us do.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 25 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, October 22, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
