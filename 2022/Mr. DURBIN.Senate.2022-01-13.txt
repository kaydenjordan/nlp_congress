 Mr. President, earlier today, the Republican Senate  leader came to the floor and noted the fact that when the American  people were asked about the issues of the moment, they didn't mention  their right to vote. I think most Americans would be surprised that we  are even debating that issue at this moment in American history.   We know the right to vote has been contentious, divisive, deadly when  it comes to the policies of this Nation and particularly the policies  of individual States. It was one of the critical reasons, in addition  to the hideous institution of slavery, that we went to war among  ourselves and 600,000-plus Americans gave their lives. It really was at  the heart of what happened after that when the North prevailed, the  Union was saved, and the President of the United States, a man from  Illinois, not only created an Emancipation Proclamation but set the  stage for constitutional amendments which guaranteed that right to  vote.   So I imagine some people would be excused if they didn't list it as  the highest priority. They probably assume it is really not an issue  for debate, but it is. You see, in this last Presidential election, we  had two or three historic things occur.   First, the turnout of American voters was unprecedented. That is a  good thing. In a democracy, it is to be applauded, and each year, we  should try to improve on that outcome.   The second thing, though, we would have to put in the liability  column, and that is a petulant former President who refused to even  acknowledge that he lost the election and instead claims that he was  abused and that it was stolen from him. That fanciful lie is now making  its way across America back and forth as former President Trump peddles  it in every quarter. Unfortunately, some people are listening. Some 30  percent of American people agree with the former President that the  election was stolen from him.   He couldn't win that argument in any courtroom. He couldn't even  convince his handpicked Attorney General to back him up. So he resorted  to sending a mob of his followers on January 6, 2021, to storm this  Capitol. For the first time since 1812, we were invaded by people who  did not subscribe to the basic tenets of our Constitution. It was a  grim day. I will never forget it. Those who were here, I am sure, say  the same. But it set the stage for a campaign that has followed for  more than a year.   This morning, we read in the paper that some eight Republican  attorneys general are going to close ranks in a Trump-inspired alliance  to change election laws across America to his liking. Shame on them,  and shame on anyone who thinks that is what America is all about.   We should encourage more and more of those legally eligible to vote.  We should make it an easy exercise and not a hardship and burden. But  the States--almost 20 of them now--are in the process of changing the  laws in their States on voting and, with each change in the law, making  it more difficult. Oh, it doesn't sound too reprehensible on its face,  until you add it all together: the notion that people would have less  time to apply for absentee ballots; the fact that they would have to  come up with a good reason; that their applications for those ballots  would have to contain certain information, which is new and sometimes  challenging to individuals; limiting the periods of time that people  can vote; limiting the opportunity to register to vote in special  elections, as in the State of Georgia. Each one of those is an additive  factor to reducing the likelihood that people will turn up and vote-- even this notion in Georgia that you can't provide food and drink to  voters waiting in line.   Well, in my hometown of Springfield, IL, we vote in the Park  District. There is seldom a wait of more than 5 minutes. That is about  the average across America, but we know there are exceptions. We have  seen people waiting in line much longer. In fact, one State found that  African Americans waited in line an average of 50 minutes--not 5; 50  minutes. The idea of perhaps giving someone a drink of water under  those circumstances is now against the law in Georgia. It is hard to  imagine. That is just one of the things they wanted to add to the  burdens of voting in America.   So when we come to the floor and discuss voting, and the Republican  leader tells us people don't care--I bet they will when they come to  realize what is happening.   It is interesting that he notes that what they do care about--they  care about the coronavirus. I do too.   I didn't have to check the voting records to know what I am about to  say is true. That Senator from Kentucky and every other Senator on that  side of the aisle voted against Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan.   In the beginning of his administration, he had a bold, policy-driven  piece of legislation called the American Rescue Plan, which set out to  do something that had to be done. Yes, we had found the vaccines, but  in order to produce them and to administer them, we needed a program  that cost money.   Joe Biden stepped up and said: This is what we are going to do. We  are going to get this jab, this shot, available to Americans across the  board, and we are going to spend the money to do it. It does no good to  have a formula that can save your life, and yet you can't access it or  pay for it.   So he put it in the American Rescue Plan. It just made common sense,  didn't it? With so many people dying and sick, that we have an  ambitious, unprecedented, historic administration of that vaccine  across America? It was an easy vote for me and for every Democrat and  obviously easy on the other side for Republicans because not a single  one, including the Republican leader from Kentucky, would support  President Biden in that effort.   There was money in there as well to keep businesses open so that they  could hire back their people, go back in business. I don't know about  the Presiding Officer's State. I am sure New Jersey is similar to  Illinois. But I have talked to a lot of restauranteurs who walked up to  me and said: Senator, we never met before, but if you hadn't voted to  give me a chance to reopen this business, I wouldn't be here today.   That is the reality of the bill that the Republicans all, every  single one, voted against. So it is no surprise that they come to the  floor critical of Joe Biden and his Presidency and saying he just  doesn't understand the real issues. Well, the coronavirus is a real  issue. The President's response was a real response. Sadly, the  unanimous opposition to the President by the Republican side of the  aisle was also a real response.   I can remember, coming out of college and hearing about the Voting  Rights Act being debated right here on the floor of the U.S. Senate,  and as I have said before on the floor--and I won't belabor it--I have  taken the time over the years to understand what led up to it-- Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the great migration, and all that followed  from that.   And my friend--and she is my friend--Carol Anderson, a professor at  Emory University in Atlanta, GA, has written a book called ``One  Person, No Vote.'' She flattered me and asked me  [[Page S206]]  to write the forward to the book, which I gladly did, and then read it  and thought: What an incredible story it tells us about America and the  battle to win the vote.   I remember--as I mentioned, I was young and fresh out of college and  law school--when Dr. Martin Luther King came to the city of Chicago. I  remember it well because I was in the midst of working as a young man  on a political campaign. And it made all the headlines when Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr., decided to walk through Marquette Park. That  particular parade--that protest--drew violence from people dressed in  Nazi uniforms, throwing rocks at him, and jeering at those who  supported his effort.   I remember that because, nowadays, when you talk about Dr. Martin  Luther King's day of observance, which is coming up next week, people  have a tendency to think of that in gentle and positive terms--and it  should be. But let's not forget the price he paid--ultimately, his  life--to deliver that message to a divided America. And so when we talk  about why he did it and what it meant to us, one of the guiding factors  was the right to vote and his belief that, from Reconstruction forward  to his day, we were still finding ways to deny the right to vote to  African Americans and others in this country. It was that fundamental  an issue--an issue he was willing to give his life for.   For some of us, Martin Luther King Day will be a day of reflection, a  chance to envision in America what it truly means to be ``free at  last.'' But it is also a day of action. Let's hope we have some action  here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   Each day we open the session in the Senate by pledging allegiance to  the flag. That is a good thing. I do it out of respect and gladly so.  But we don't stand here and pledge allegiance to the filibuster. The  filibuster is a Senate rule, not that long in its history, that is an  interpretation of what the Senate is about. It has changed over the  years over and over again. It is not sacred. It is not constitutional  dictum. It is, in fact, the best efforts of politicians in this  Chamber, in their day, to write a rule that establishes a minimum vote.   What does it mean to us? Well, it means a lot. In a Senate that is  divided 50-50--50 Republicans and 50 Democrats--it means that there are  measures which require 60 votes. It used to be a rare occurrence in  this body that someone would invoke a filibuster, and yet now it has  become virtually commonplace.   If you just look at the last 5 or 10 years, you can see a change in  the Senate, a dramatic orchestrated change in the Senate. What was  uncommon, requiring 60 votes for a measure, has now become the  standard, and, of course, what that means is very few things come to  the floor of the Senate.   When the Republicans were in control, just a few years ago, during  the course of an entire calendar year, on the Senate floor we voted for  26 amendments--26. In the normal history of the Senate, hundreds of  amendments are voted in the course of a year. But because of the  filibuster and the design of many to slow down and stop the business of  the Senate, in 1 year we voted for 26 amendments--26.   And that is what happens when you shut down debate. That is what  happens when you shut down opportunity for amendments. And that is what  happens when you pledge allegiance to the filibuster.   We have to be honest about this. There should be an exception written  in for the filibuster when it comes to voting rights. Something as  fundamental as our constitutional authority to vote should be given the  day for argument on the floor of the Senate and should be subject to a  majority vote, up or down. That is not too much to ask.   I would rather pledge allegiance to the flag and to the voting  authority in America that it represents than to the filibuster, a rule  which has been misused as much as it has been properly used in its  history.   There are many enduring victories we can attribute to Dr. King and  the civil rights movement. But the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 are certainly high on the list. These laws  put a stake in the heart of Jim Crow, expanding voting rights to  generations of Black Americans.   Prior to the passage of these laws, State legislators throughout the  Deep South had disenfranchised voters of color through a whirlwind of  discriminatory legislation. These laws didn't explicitly ban Black  Americans from voting. The 15th Amendment, ratified during  Reconstruction, prevented them from doing that. But soon enough, these  lawmakers discovered new ways to discriminate against voters of color.  And in decades after Reconstruction, they erected barriers to the  ballot box, like poll taxes, property ownership requirements, literacy  tests.   When it comes to Jim Crow laws, it is easy to get caught up in  abstractions and generic descriptions. You hear the phrase ``literacy  test,'' that was used even into the 1960s in America, and you think:  Well, that just means I have to read at grade-school level, right?   Wrong. A poll test from a Louisiana parish had questions on it which  I struggle to answer even today. And they were designed to make sure  that voters wouldn't be able to answer. ``Draw a line around a number  or letter of this sentence.'' What the heck does that mean? And on and  on.   I share this example to demonstrate what voter suppression looked  like in the days of Dr. King. In the words of historian Carol Anderson,  whom I mentioned earlier, tactics like literacy tests were  ``legislative evil genius.'' They didn't disenfranchise voters on the  basis of their skin color outright. But they were only administered to  some voters, and you can imagine which ones.   Thank God the Members of the Senate on a bipartisan basis decided in  the 1960s to outlaw this legislative sleight of hand. Our predecessors  didn't cave in to the disingenuous cries of ``States' rights,'' which  we hear to this day on the Republican side of the aisle. Our  predecessors understood that voting is a fundamental liberty. It should  be treated differently. It is the reason we pledge allegiance to that  flag, because we make the decision, under that flag, of who governs us.   Right now, millions of American voters are facing a new wave of voter  suppression laws, and much like the proponents of Jim Crow laws did in  their day, Republicans State lawmakers today are erecting new barriers  to the ballot box, latching onto the myth of ``widespread voter  fraud.'' That is what the State legislative leaders are saying. Where  could they have come up with that idea? Is it possible that it is a  disgruntled former President with a bruised ego because he lost his  effort for reelection in 2020?   The reality is, the laws they are passing in these States are not  about preventing voter fraud. They are about preventing eligible  Americans from voting. The nurse working back-to-back shifts on  election day, the single parent who doesn't own a car or can't afford a  babysitter, or a person living with a disability--should we be  concerned as to whether they have an opportunity to vote? We certainly  should.   The new laws enacted in nearly 20 States will prevent our most  vulnerable neighbors from exercising their right to vote. That is why  we ought to look at the Senate rules. It isn't just a matter of some  theoretical academic debate on the rules. These are real-life decisions  in States across the Nation.   And the most troubling of these laws take the assault of democracy  even further. They give partisan actors more power to meddle and  interfere in election administration. Some of the proposals we have  seen can potentially allow partisans to overrule the valid votes of the  American people and anoint a victor of their own choosing.   Over the next few days, I expect many of us will quote excerpts of  Dr. King's most famous speeches. My hope is that we will take heed of  the words he wrote in that letter from the Birmingham jail. In it, he  responded to a group of White religious leaders who had pleaded with  him and his fellow civil rights advocates to slow down, wait a little  longer, racial equality is going to follow soon.   In response, Dr. King wrote: ``For years now, I've heard the word  `Wait!'. . . . This `Wait' has almost meant `Never'. . . . We must come  to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, of yesterday that  `justice too long delayed is justice denied.'''   He continued, ``We've waited for more than 340 years for our God- given and constitutional rights. . . . I hope,  [[Page S207]]  sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.''   The issue that we are debating on voting rights and the issue of our  rules is not just a casual conversation about a rule book no one hardly  knows of. It is an issue that does go to the heart of our democracy, to  our pledge of allegiance to the flag, not to the filibuster.   The issue is our Republican colleagues are afraid of this debate.  Traditionally, they played a key role in the passage of the Voting  Rights Act in the 1960s. In fact, percentagewise, there were more  Republican Senators voting for that than Democratic Senators. And I say  that acknowledging that my Democratic Party, in those days, was not  altogether on the right side.    We have been told that we are breaking the Senate if we change this  rule to protect people's right to vote. At the heart of what the Senate  is and what it stands for and the reason it exists is the right of  Americans to vote.   Is it worth a carve-out? Is it worth a change? Is it worth a  modification of the Senate rules to protect the right to vote? Can  anything be more sacred?   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) is  necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 44, as follows:                         [Rollcall Vote No. 8 Leg.]                                  YEAS--55       Baldwin      Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hassan      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kelly      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rosen      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Warnock      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--44       Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Paul      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--1               Schatz
