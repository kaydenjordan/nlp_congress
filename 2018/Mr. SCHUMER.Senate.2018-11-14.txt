 I am here.    Reserving the right to object. Very simply, there has to  be some comity here. Republicans cannot  [[Page S6952]]  block Democratic nominees and then expect Republican nominees to go  through, so I object.    Mr. President, we have to have some bipartisanship here.  I understand my friend from Tennessee. He is my friend. I hope he would  work with us to create bipartisan packages to get nominees through.  That is not happening. We need to do it.   I yield the floor.
