 Madam Speaker, last week, the Biden  administration announced that they are cutting off the benefits for  60,000 National Guard and Reserve soldiers who do not want to take the  COVID vaccine.   We are losing some of our best and brightest servicemembers to the  Biden administration's ideological purge of our military.   President Biden's military purge weakens America and emboldens our  adversaries, especially China.  [[Page H5982]]    I am proud to join Congressman Massie on his amendment to prohibit  vaccine mandates for our servicemembers and to reinstate servicemembers  who have been forced out due to the mandate.   I will continue to advocate for our troops.                            ____________________
