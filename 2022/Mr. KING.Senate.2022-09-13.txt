 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this is going to be an unusual set of  comments for me because I am going to start out with some personal  history, which I hope will make sense in terms of what I want to  address.   I started working in the alternative energy industry in 1983. When I  say industry, it was, actually, a very small company developing small  hydro projects in Maine and New England. We then worked on the  development of biomass projects. We, later on, worked on wind power and  then also on the development of large-scale conservation. So my  professional life has largely been occupied with energy and  particularly with renewable energy.   At the same time, I had a deep history in Maine in environmental  matters. I represented the environmental community in Maine before the  Maine Legislature, in the seventies, if you can believe that anybody  around here was still doing things in the seventies. I also, as  Governor, was very active in conservation matters and am proud to say  that, during my 8 years as the Governor of Maine, we put aside and set  into conservation and protection status more land than in the prior  175-year history of Maine combined. This has been a passion of mine,  the protection of the environment, for my entire life--so the history  of renewable energy development and also environmental advocacy.  [[Page S4548]]    I learned some lessons when I was working in the field of developing  alternative or renewable energy. The most important lesson is that  there is no free lunch when it comes to energy. There are always costs  and benefits. There are always impacts that some people think are  terrific and that other people think are not so good. There are always  trade-offs.   In fact, I will never forget my going to hearings on hydro projects  and having people come and object and saying: We like hydro but not on  our river, not on this site, and, by the way, we don't really think you  should be ruining the rivers. Why don't you go and do wind power?   Lo and behold, 20 years later, I worked in the area of wind  development, of wind power, and people came to our hearings and said:  We don't really need to spoil the view in our mountains. Do more hydro.   I am not making that up. I actually lived that sort of conflict.   The second lesson I learned is that you may have global goals with  renewable energy but have local impacts, and you often have a  controversy about a particular project.   The third thing I learned is that change is hard. Everybody is for  progress. Nobody is for change. Change is difficult, whether it is for  a local community, a State, or a nation.   The fourth thing: Permitting is hard. Getting permits for renewable  energy projects was lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive. This was  serious learning that I had during this period in that, if you want to  develop even the most beneficial project, you are going to have to go  through an often arduous permitting process, and somebody isn't going  to like it. There always will be trade-offs.   These were sporadic, small projects. Indeed, in New England today-- and I just checked this morning--about 10 percent of our electricity  comes from renewables. This is after almost 40 years of the development  of these projects--about 10 percent. We are now talking about a  transition in energy to a fully renewable future. Well, if you do the  math, that means 10 times the amount of renewable energy development  which we have done in the last 40 years, in the next 10 to 15 years.  People have to understand that this is a major, major change that is  going to require trade-offs. It is going to require us to make  decisions and to understand--again, to go back to my basic premise-- that there is no free lunch.   We are now undertaking the largest and most far-reaching energy  transition in human history. The transition to fossil fuels took about  150 years. Going back to around 1800, you can see the graphic goes up,  but we really got into the real heart of the fossil fuel economy in the  mid-20th century--150 years. We are talking about transitioning away  from fossil fuels to renewables over 15 years--not 150 but 15.   We have to grasp that this is an enormous undertaking and that it is  going to involve change. We are literally in a race with climate  change. That is why it is going to have to happen in the next 10, 15,  20 years, because the consequences of not doing it are catastrophic,  and we are already seeing that.   I think that we have reached a point at which most Americans realize  that climate change is real. The fishermen in Maine know it. The  loggers know it. The farmers know it. The people who work with the land  and the sea and the atmosphere understand what is happening. They see  it. The animals know it. They know what is happening, and that is why  we have to make this transition. That is why it is so important that we  make this transition, and it has got to be fast. We don't have time to  do it over 150 years or even over 50 years. It is a huge change. It is  going to involve dislocation, and it is going to involve trade-offs.  That is really the question that I want to address today.   There is broad agreement, I believe, that we need change, that we  need to develop responses to the global climate change crisis. There is  certainly agreement in the environmental community as far as that  question is concerned. There is nobody in the environmental community  whom I know who doubts climate change or doubts the necessity of taking  dramatic action to meet it. Climate change is as real as it gets, and  we have to address it.   How do we address it? With nonfossil fuel electrification--fast. If  we can do that, we can address the CO2. Really, what we are  talking about is the emission of CO2. Is it a problem? Well,  the average over the past million years of CO2 in the  atmosphere is about 280 parts per million. It varies up and down.   People say: Oh, this is a natural cycle.   Yes, it varies up and down between 150 and 300 parts per million. It  is now at about 420 parts per million. It has gone up 20 in the last 2  or 3 years. The last time we were over 400 parts per million of  CO2 in the atmosphere the oceans were 60 feet higher. We are  in unchartered territory in human history right now. We have to deal  with it, and we have to deal with it in a hurry.   Where is all of that CO2 coming from? Well, here is a  rough breakdown of the CO2 budget, if you will: About 30  percent comes from the generation of electricity--30, 35 percent.  Another 30, 35 percent comes from transportation, the combustion of  fossil fuels in vehicles. The last 30, 35 percent comes from space heat  and industrial use. So that is the budget that we have to deal with.  How do we tackle that? With electrification, with the electricity  coming from renewable sources.    Now, if you have an electric vehicle and you are feeling really good  about saving the environment, you are not saving the environment if the  power for that electric vehicle comes from fossil fuels. You are saving  the environment if the power for that electric vehicle comes from  renewables. So that is what we are talking about, but there are  problems with renewables.   Remember, I said I had worked in the wind power business. The wind  doesn't blow all the time. The Sun doesn't shine all the time. The term  is ``intermittency.'' That is the issue. That is the issue with  renewables--intermittency--the fact that there has to be something to  supply power when the Sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow.   The answer to that is storage. The real Green New Deal is energy  storage. If we can solve that problem in a cost-effective way, then we  really can have a realistic, all-renewable future, because what you  have with energy storage, plus renewables, is essentially baseload  power without CO2. That is really the direction that we are  moving in.   However--and this is what I want to really stress--you can't be in  favor of electrification; you can't be in favor of renewable power; you  can't be in favor of electric vehicles if you are not in favor of  mining the lithium that you need for the batteries or in covering a lot  of farmers' fields with solar panels. You can't have those things  without paying a price. It would be nice if you could.   I would love it if I could wave a wand and say: We are going to get  rid of fossil fuels, and we are going to have an all-renewable future.  Yes, I want that, but we have to recognize that, in order to get there,  there are some things we have to do that heretofore we really haven't  been very likely to like.   One of the other issues with renewable power is that a lot of the  renewable power is in places where there aren't people. So we have to  get that renewable power to the places where there are people.   Do you know what that means? Transmission, new transmission lines,  new rights of way. People aren't going to be too crazy about that, but  you can't have a renewable energy future without having transmission,  and you can't have a renewable energy future without having batteries  or some storage technology that, chances are, is going to require Earth  minerals that you are going to have to mine.   Geography is a problem. Technology is a problem. This will require  trade-offs. We have to keep in mind that we are talking about a global  goal--we are talking about literally saving the Earth--but we have to  understand that there are going to be costs to do so.   Let's talk about permitting.   One of my favorite stories is when God went to Moses and said: Moses,  I have good news and bad news.   Moses said: God, give me the good news.   God says: I am going to empower you to part the waters of the Red  Sea, allow my people to go free, and then  [[Page S4549]]  have the waters come back and inundate Pharaoh's army.   Moses says: That is wonderful, God. What is the bad news?   God says: You have to prepare the environmental impact statement.   We have got to understand that permitting is part of the process of  going to a renewable future.   Now, when I was the Governor of Maine, I had a very clear policy: no  diminution--no cutting, no cutting corners--of environmental standards,  but I wanted the most timely and predictable environmental permitting  process in the country, and I don't think that those two things are in  any way mutually exclusive.   When I talk here and work with my colleagues here about permitting  reform, I am talking--we are talking--about the process, not the  standards. We are not talking about lowering the standards, saying that  you can emit more or you don't have to meet clean water standards.   I sit at Edmund Muskie's desk in my office. Lightning would strike me  if I were lowering the water quality or air quality standards, but we  have got to talk about a process that is timely and predictable.   The estimates are that, to permit a mine in this country, it takes  about 10 years--about 10 years. We don't have 10 years to spend on a  permitting process if we are going to solve this problem in time to  save the country and the planet. We have got to figure out how to do  this in a more timely way. How are we going to do it? I don't know the  details of the various discussions that are going on here, but I have  some thoughts that I have suggested to Senator Manchin and others.   One is one-stop shopping. You shouldn't have to go to five different  Agencies. Go to one Agency that is in charge of the permitting process,  and let them lead it. Don't make the applicant go to five, six, seven  different Agencies.   Secondly are deadlines--real deadlines, deadlines that mean  something--so that the Agency, if it says 180 days, has got to have a  decision in 180 days. Eisenhower retook Europe in 11 months. There is  no reason that we can't get decisions out of some of these Agencies in  less than a year. So deadlines and reasonable timeframes, I think, are  part of this process, and an accelerated appeals process, where the  appeal of an environmental decision on a renewable energy project, that  is related to renewable energy, or that is related to our renewable  energy future can go to the courts and get a fair hearing but on a  timely basis and not go through a long process that takes, again,  years.   Another suggestion I have--and this goes back to my experience of  working on renewable energy projects--is there should be some credit  given for the nature of the project that you are doing. In other words,  if you are doing a project that is going to contribute to the solution  of the problem of global climate change, you shouldn't be treated as a  strip mall. Some weight should be given to the import and the value-- the environmental value--of the project, vis-a-vis the incidental  environmental costs--and I could be criticized for using the word  ``incidental,'' but the smaller environmental costs that may be  involved in getting there. I think that has got to be how we approach  this whole permitting question.   So why am I here today? I am here today to talk to my friends in the  environmental community--and I do mean friends, people whom I have  worked with all my life--to have them change the way they think about  the environmental process and what they have conventionally and  historically thought about this kind of action.   Historically, if you go back to the beginning of the environmental  movement in the sixties and seventies--and Lord, help me, I was there-- the environmental movement was about stopping things. The environmental  movement in Maine began with a proposed oil refinery on our coast.  People wanted to stop it because they didn't think it was the  appropriate place. But if you think about that, a lot of the  environmental movement has been about stopping things, stopping  projects, stopping highways, stopping whatever.   What we have to do now is think about facilitating getting things  done in order to get to the renewable future that we want. I think that  is a very, very important way to look at this process. You can't be for  EVs if you are against mining lithium.   Let me give you just a couple of numbers on what I am talking about.  Copper--remember, I talked about transmission. Copper, copper wires to  transmit electricity, the estimate is--I want to be sure this is right.  The estimate is we are going to need as much copper annually by 2050 as  has been mined in the entire prior history of the world. In 1 year, we  are going to need that much. The estimate is that in order to achieve  our climate goals, we are going to have to triple--triple--the grid:  the wires, the rights of way, the towers. The grid infrastructure has  to be tripled in order to absorb the new and transmitted--distribute  the new energy that is going to be needed. If you have electric  vehicles, you are going to need more wires to get the power--that is  going to be a huge increase; between doubling and tripling is the  estimate--of the strength of the grid.   The International Energy Agency--not me and not some commercial  group, but the International Energy Agency says that by 2040--that is  not that long from now, barely over 15 years--we are going to need 42  times the amount of lithium that we have, 25 times more graphite, 21  times more cobalt, 19 times more nickel, and 7 times more rare-earth  elements. Now, we have two choices: We can buy those things from other  countries, particularly countries that may be potential adversaries. Do  we really want to be dependent on China for this kind of essential  material to our environmental future? I don't think so. But if we are  going to say we don't want to import it, we have got to get it out of  the ground here, and we can't spend 10 years deciding it. I am not  saying lower the standards, but I am saying the process itself should  not be used as a weapon to undermine projects that are necessary to  achieve our ultimate climate goal.   This is a change. This is a change of thinking that is required by  the reality that we face. I am here because I want to face that  reality. I want to do something about climate change. I want to take  the actions necessary, not token actions but the real deal. But it is  going to involve these enormous commitments of time, effort, and money  and also our understanding--particularly in the environmental  community--that there is no free lunch.   On December 2, 1862, Abraham Lincoln came to this Congress to talk  about the progress of the Civil War. His problem was that the Congress  was being the Congress. They were doing politics, and he didn't feel  they were really taking it seriously or understood the massive change  that was sweeping over the country. At the end of that speech, the  afternoon of December 2, 1862, Abraham Lincoln gave what I think is  still the best analysis of how you deal with change that I have ever  encountered, and I think it applies exactly in this situation. Lincoln  said:         The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy       present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty,       [therefore] we must rise--with the occasion. As our case is       new, so we must think anew, and act anew.    And then here is the key line:         We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our       country.    ``We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country.''   ``Disenthrall'' means thinking new and different ways. Let go of the  way you thought about these kinds of issues in the past. Disenthrall  ourselves, and then we shall save our planet.   I yield the floor.
