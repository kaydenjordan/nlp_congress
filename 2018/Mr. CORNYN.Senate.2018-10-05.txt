 Madam President, as the world knows now, we just held a  successful cloture vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to become  the next Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.   I am glad we were successful in closing off debate. We now know that  under the Senate rules, 30 hours are available for Senators to debate,  and I am sure there will be many Senators who will be coming to the  floor and offering their thoughts.   To my mind, what the Senate just voted for was to end the games, the  character assassination, and the intimidation tactics that  unfortunately have characterized so much of this confirmation process.  Our vote today was important, not only because it will allow us to move  forward and conclude this confirmation process, but it was important  because it showed the Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be  bullied by the streams of paid protesters and name-calling by the mob.  We will not be complicit in the attempts to tarnish a good man's  character, destroy his career, and further delay this confirmation  process--a constitutional process of advice and consent.   What has been particularly galling on the part of some of our  colleagues over the last 24 hours is the fact that the FBI  investigation they called for, they are virtually ignoring or, in some  cases, disparaging. They called for that supplemental background  investigation just last Friday. Let's all remember what our friend the  senior Senator from Minnesota said last weekend. He said: Let's give  this 1 week. Well, that is what we gave them. The junior Senator from  Delaware asked for the same period of time at the hearing--a 1-week- long FBI investigation.   Our colleagues got what they asked for, and unfortunately, since they  had already decided to vote against the nomination, they must have been  somewhat disappointed that the supplemental background investigation  came up with no new information, no corroboration at all.   I actually think, in some ways, our colleagues who called for a 1- week delay have done us a favor because every lead that could be  followed has been followed and exhausted. As the majority leader was  saying earlier, in America, under our constitutional system, where we  don't presume you are guilty and require you to prove your innocence  and where we believe in due process of law, I think the FBI  investigation was a useful way to demonstrate to the American people  that none of these allegations that had been made against Judge  Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct has been proven.   It also, I think, gives us a chance to pivot from what has been a  shameful and disgraceful confirmation process. If this is the new norm  for the Senate--that somebody could be denied a confirmation based on  an unproven allegation--I can't imagine people would be willing to  subject themselves to that in the future. It would be a dark day for  the Senate, for the United States, and for our system of justice that  believes in a fair process and a constitutional presumption of  innocence. When an allegation is made, the person making that  allegation actually has to come forward with some evidence.   A number of Senators--actually, it was a bipartisan consensus--wanted  the FBI to conduct a limited investigation into current, credible  allegations that were pending. They wanted the FBI to interview  individuals like Mark Judge, who had already offered a sworn statement  under penalty of felony, and others who may have had information who  were identified by Dr. Ford as being present on the day this alleged  activity took place. There was no confirmation. There was no  corroboration.   In fact, there was a refutation. The people she said were there and  could be witnesses to what happened said: I have no knowledge of that.   Dr. Ford's best friend, Leland Kaiser, said: I don't even know Brett  Kavanaugh. I never met him.   Well, we have all had an opportunity to read the confidential report.  We have seen who was interviewed, what they were asked. Any doubts  people may have had should now have been put to rest by what the  contents reveal. These fantasies about Judge Kavanaugh being some sort  of serial high school or college predator have been exposed as only  that--myths not based on fact. There is no reliable evidence,  whatsoever, to support any of these baseless allegations against Judge  Kavanaugh.   As we know, this wasn't exactly designed to be a truth-finding  process. This wasn't a search for the truth. Our colleagues across the  aisle already made up their mind a long time ago, some even before  Judge Kavanaugh had been nominated. This was more of, as the majority  leader said earlier today, not a search for the truth but a search-and- destroy mission.   Obviously, as they continue to move the goalposts, calling for more  delays, more investigations, there have been seven background  investigations by the FBI of Judge Kavanaugh during his public service.  The FBI talked to more than 150 witnesses. Don't you think, if there  were anything to these outrageous allegations, some of that would have  come up at some point in the seven FBI background investigations that  have been conducted?   But our colleagues across the aisle continue to resist, putting a  definitive end to this process and unfortunately caring little, if any,  about the reputation of somebody who has demonstrated his outstanding  qualifications and his commitment to public service. I think some of  these attacks have become exhausting, politically exhausting, quite  frankly.   Our colleagues don't realize what they have unleashed when Senators  get coat hangers mailed to their home, paid protesters show up on their  doorstep or at their office or they are accosted in the Halls of the  U.S. Congress. These paid protesters reportedly, once they get  arrested, actually make more money from their funders than they do if  they don't get arrested. That is what has been unleashed.   Chairman Grassley called it mob rule, and that is exactly right-- where the Judiciary Committee, during the first confirmation hearing  for Judge Kavanaugh, Senators said: I am breaking the rules. I am  releasing committee confidential information. I know the rules prohibit  me from doing that--and they don't care.  [[Page S6566]]    If there are no rules and there are no norms and if we don't have  enough respect for this institution and the people whose lives we  touch, this is what gets unleashed.   I feel bad for Dr. Ford, in particular. She wanted none of this  three-ring circus. She sent a letter to the ranking member and asked  that her identity remain confidential, only to find, after the first  confirmation hearing, that it was leaked to the press. Then the press  came to talk to her, and I guess she figured she had no other recourse  but to actually tell her story to the press once her wishes were  violated. She didn't consent to that. She didn't authorize the release  of that confidential letter to the press, but that is what happened.   When we gave her an opportunity to have a bipartisan, professional  investigation, to have staff go out to California and interview her  confidentially, she said: Nobody explained to me that was an option.  Well, the lawyers that the ranking member referred her to apparently  didn't even tell their own client she had the opportunity to avoid this  three-ring circus and the embarrassment associated with it by doing  something confidentially.   That is how the Judiciary Committee ordinarily operates when  allegations are made. They are investigated by committee staff or by  the FBI--actually by both--but that didn't happen here until after this  mob rule unleashed what we have seen here in the last few weeks.   We know, when Dr. Ford sent her letter to the ranking member, it  wasn't shared with the FBI initially. It wasn't shared with Judiciary  Committee investigators. It wasn't shared with the committee itself in  a closed-door session, which followed the open session, where Judge  Kavanaugh was asked about other personal matters that came up during  the course of the background investigation. The ranking member didn't  even attend that closed-door session, nor did anybody mention it to the  judge when he went to talk to some 60-plus Members of the Senate one- on-one.   The ranking member, when she had that one-on-one meeting with Judge  Kavanaugh, said nothing to him about the allegations. She could have  asked him about the allegations, generally, without revealing the  identity of Dr. Ford. We know at that point, she had already talked to  Dr. Ford and recommended partisan lawyers. We know those lawyers  arranged for a polygraph examination to be administered. Other  preparations were being made, plans were being hatched. Our colleague  from California said nothing.    I really think that Dr. Ford has been treated terribly by this  ambush, by this hiding of evidence and allegations that could have been  investigated and should have been investigated in a more dignified and  appropriate sort of way.   Once Dr. Ford was identified, in consultation with colleagues--both  Republicans and Democrats--we decided Dr. Ford should be given an  opportunity to tell her side of the story. Unfortunately, we were not  able to mitigate or reverse a lot of the awful circumstances under  which she had found herself because of what had already been unleashed,  but we did our best. We tried to do whatever we could to accommodate  her. As I said, investigators offered to go to California. We brought  in an experienced sexual crimes investigating attorney to ask questions  in a respectful sort of way in order to illicit as much information as  we possibly could get about her claim even though it was 35 years old.   Throughout the hearing, we listened to Dr. Ford, and we tried to  understand what she was telling us. We took her allegations seriously  and treated her in the same way we would have wanted our wives or our  daughters to have been treated if they had found themselves in similar  circumstances. Yet we knew, at the end of the day, there was no other  witness to corroborate or to confirm what she had said, even by the  ones she had identified as having been present.   This is not about believing women or believing men. It is not a zero- sum game. As the junior Senator from Nebraska said the other day, it is  not about being for the #MeToo movement or against it. Who could be  against it?   I hope there is some good that comes out of this disgraceful display.  One of the things that might be good would be that more women would  feel confident in coming forward and telling their stories to the  appropriate authorities and producing the sort of information that  would be necessary to make a criminal case--to investigate the case, to  charge the case, to try the case, and to convict the people who commit  sexual offenses. I hope there is some good that comes out of this.  There is also, maybe, some legislation that we could work on together  to try to heal the wounds that have been caused by this abominable  process.   I have worked a lot with colleagues here to pass anti-human  trafficking legislation, to end the rape kit backlog, and on other  things to try to help victims. I think, maybe--just maybe--in putting  our heads together, in talking with each other, and in working in good  faith, we could come up with some legislative response that might find  some good from this terrible situation.   The other thing about these allegations that have been made against  Judge Kavanaugh is that they are completely out of character. We know  he has been a circuit court judge for 12 years, authored more than 300  opinions, clerked for Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, worked at  the White House as a lawyer and as Staff Secretary for the President,  taught at Harvard, and had been hired by now Justice Elena Kagan to  teach at Harvard, as well as having taught at Georgetown and Yale.   By all accounts--every account of anyone with personal knowledge of  Judge Kavanaugh's character and treatment of women--he has treated  women with respect. And it is not just conservatives who sing his  praises. A liberal law school professor at Yale called Judge  Kavanaugh's selection the President's finest hour, his classiest move.  The same professor complimented Judge Kavanaugh's studiousness and said  he has already shown flashes of greatness. Lisa Blatt, a self-described  liberal feminist lawyer who has argued numerous cases before the U.S.  Supreme Court, has said Judge Kavanaugh is supremely qualified. That  echoes what the American Bar Association has said--the gold standard  for some of our colleagues when it comes to judicial nominees. The  American Bar Association has said that Judge Kavanaugh is unanimously  well qualified. That goes for his temperament as well. So I believe  this nominee is about as good as it gets.   On July 10, the day after Judge Kavanaugh was nominated, I said that  my Republican colleagues and I would not back down from this all-out  assault on this nominee, but never in my wildest dreams could I have  imagined that this fight would devolve into the mob rule that we have  seen--of Senators and staffs taunted, threatened, and of millions of  dollars spent in advertising and in paying protesters to show up on  Senators' front lawns, to harass them at restaurants, and to attack  them in the halls of Congress. I never imagined that this would get  this bad, when Senators would say ``I am breaking the rules'' and would  dare anybody to do anything about it. This has turned into the kind of  nasty and venomous politics that I had hoped never to experience.   This also has demonstrated the dark underbelly of Washington, DC,  where power is so important to some people that they will do anything  to get it. They will destroy you. They will tarnish your good name.  They will condone threats on family members, including on children.  They will harass you. This has really been disgusting.   I am an optimist, so I don't believe this is our fate. I don't  believe we are condemned to work in a Senate and live in a country  where this kind of activity is condoned or ignored. Actually, I think,  by defeating Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, we would be signaling that  this is somehow the new normal. We would be setting the precedent of,  yes, that kind of thing works, so let's try it again. I am not saying  it is just one party or the other.   The day after Judge Kavanaugh was nominated, I also said we would  defend the record of Judge Kavanaugh, who is a thoughtful public  servant, against deliberate attempts to denigrate him. I stand by that  statement, and we have defended him. Yet we have not just defended him  but have defended the Constitution, fundamental notions of fairness and  fair play that are reflected in  [[Page S6567]]  our commitment to the due process of law, and the rights of somebody  who has been accused of a crime, which Judge Kavanaugh has been accused  of on multiple occasions.   Even as the mud has been slung on all of us, even as insults have  been hurled against this nominee and as his family has faced ridicule  over atrocious exploits that never even happened, at least, I think, we  can be proud of the fact we have tried to defend the Constitution, this  institution of the Senate, and have pushed back with everything we have  had against mob rule.   Unfortunately, those who wanted to take down this nominee viewed  Judge Kavanaugh as a sacrificial lamb in some sort of vengeance  campaign. Thankfully, they have now failed to stop his nomination from  going forward.   This nomination is no longer simply about Judge Kavanaugh and the  current vacancy on the Supreme Court; it is also about the principles  we must stand up for and defend. It is about validating public service  and decades of honorable conduct. It is not about forgetting all that a  man has done, all that he is, and all that he has worked for at the  drop of a hat based on unsubstantiated, uncorroborated allegations. It  is about standing firm in the turbulent political winds. If I think  about any institution in this country, I think about the Senate and how  it ought to be the place in which standing firm against the turbulent  political winds occurs.   We all had a chance to read the FBI report, which failed to  corroborate Dr. Ford's allegations. Then we did exactly what we needed  to do today, which was to vote--to stop the circus, to stop the high  jinks, to stop the character assassination, and vote. I am glad our  colleagues decided to close off debate now as this 30-hour postcloture  period ensues. I look forward to concluding the confirmation process  and confirming Judge Kavanaugh to be the next Associate Justice on the  U.S. Supreme Court.    Mr. President, in a few moments we will vote to confirm  Judge Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is time.   Justice Gorsuch and Justice Sotomayor were confirmed 66 days after  they were nominated. Today marks the 90th day since President Trump  nominated Judge Kavanaugh. So this is in line with the timeframe for  previous Justices.   What is different, though, about this nomination is the manifest  unfairness in the way it was conducted and in the tone and behavior of  some Senators, as well as the special interest groups that support  them.   This institution used to be known as the world's greatest  deliberative body, but you wouldn't know it now on this nomination.   The Senator from Maine said yesterday that we have hit rock bottom  when it comes to the judicial confirmation process and, sadly, I  agree--this, despite the heroic efforts of Senator Grassley, who along  with his staff, has been magnificent as chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.   What precipitated this embarrassing period for the Senate was the  intentional and deliberate withholding of Dr. Ford's allegations from  the Judiciary Committee and Judge Kavanaugh until the 11th hour, and  then publicly ambushing everyone else concerned.   It has been a process that, in words that echo from another dark  period for the Senate, the McCarthy hearings, has been cruel, reckless,  and indecent, both to Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.   Still, despite these hijinks and the weaponization of the  confirmation process, we bent over backwards to try to accommodate Dr.  Ford once she said she wanted to come before the committee.   We know she requested confidentiality as her allegations were  investigated. She did not consent to nor authorize the release of her  letter. She didn't want a public spectacle. Judiciary Committee staff  even offered to fly to California on a bipartisan basis and interview  her confidentially, but this offer was not even shared with her by her  partisan lawyers. In other words, she said she never understood that  offer was on the table. She thought the only way she could tell her  story was  [[Page S6692]]  in the midst of the three-ring circus that that hearing became.   But after the damage to her was done when her identity became known,  we invited Dr. Ford to testify. She came and did so, and I respect and  admire her courage. It could not have been easy. We listened  respectfully to her story. We took it very seriously. We treated her  the same way we would want our wives or daughters to be treated, and we  tried to learn the facts--cold hard facts--as elicited by an expert in  dealing with sexual assault cases.   We all know after the hearing what that attorney told us because it  became public. She said, as a prosecutor, she would never recommend  charges under these circumstances because, in her view, there was no  corroboration of Dr. Ford's account and there were inconsistencies in  her story regarding the place, the time, and the people involved in  relevant events. In other words, this was not a case of he said, she  said. It was a case of she said, they said, including everyone Dr. Ford  claimed was a witness. Not only was there no corroboration, but the  alleged witnesses refuted her claim, including her best friend, Leland  Keyser, who said she never met Brett Kavanaugh.   Even after all of that, even after hiding information that should  have been shared confidentially with the Judiciary Committee, even  after the outrageous conduct by some Senators at the first hearing,  intentionally violating committee rules and seeking delay after delay,  even after that, we took another additional step to address any  lingering concerns. The FBI lunched a supplemental background  investigation. There are two words to note about this investigation:  ``supplemental'' and ``independent.'' It is supplemental because Judge  Kavanaugh has had six other previous background investigations. This  was the seventh. It is independent, because now opponents are saying:  Well, the investigation was merely checking a box. It wasn't thorough  or comprehensive enough.   But that simply doesn't jibe with the facts. The FBI was told to  investigate current credible allegations, and they had a free rein to  contact anyone they wanted, and they contacted many of the people that  our Democratic colleagues, Dr. Ford, and Ms. Ramirez themselves said  were eyewitnesses or persons with relevant knowledge. I am talking  about folks like Mark Judge and others.   So opponents are trying to have it both ways: They demand an  investigation but then badmouth it when it doesn't reveal what they  hoped it would. Politics should not have and didn't dictate the terms  of this supplemental background investigation. The FBI knows how to do  its work, and now opponents of this nomination should accept its  findings.   But this has never been a search for the truth by Senators who had  already announced their opposition to this nomination--some of them,  even before Judge Kavanaugh was named. Rather, it has become a matter  of delay, defeat, and destroy.   I do believe the Senator from Arizona and others who joined in his  request did us a great favor by insisting on the FBI supplemental  background investigation. The American people can feel better that  leads have been followed and exhausted for those still interested in a  search for the facts.   The American people now know that we took it upon ourselves to take  one last step to dispel any doubts about Judge Kavanaugh's fitness to  serve on the highest Court in the land, and now that step is complete.  So to Senators Flake, Collins, and others who requested that  supplemental background investigation, I say thank you.   Both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh have been badly treated throughout  this process. Dr. Ford has been treated less as a real person than as a  poker chip in a card game. Her wishes for confidentiality were ignored,  her letter was leaked, and her story was weaponized in a political  ambush.   This whole sad charade has likewise been unfair to Judge Kavanaugh.  These allegations could and should have been investigated by the  committee under normal procedures and timelines designed to protect  both the accuser and the accused. Instead, we got mob rule.   Some blame Judge Kavanaugh for his righteous indignation and  impassioned defense at the second hearing, but as somebody who served  for 13 years on the bench myself, I know the difference between  deciding a case as a judge for which Judge Kavanaugh's temperament has  been universally praised and defending oneself against character  assassination and personal destruction. Judge Kavanaugh understands the  difference, too, and I have no doubt whatsoever about his judicial  temperament.   Imagine what this has been like for Judge Kavanaugh's parents or his  wife or his children or the friends and colleagues who know the real  Brett Kavanaugh--shocking or embarrassing doesn't begin to describe it.  I am disappointed more than I can say at those who have unleashed these  unjustified attacks on the judge and his family and disappointed in  their lack of any empathy or remorse for what they have put them  through--no empathy, no remorse, none.   For some of them, it seems the end justifies the means. Chew good  people up, spit them out. No problem. All in a day's work.   After the dust settles on this dark period, we need to think about  the damage all of this has done to the Senate as an institution and to  the judicial confirmation process that we most certainly will embark  upon again in the near future.   It is my hope--it is my prayer--that the politics of personal  destruction, simply because you don't agree with the nominee's judicial  philosophy or the President who nominated him or her, will stop. The  low road is not available to us anymore because there is no lower road  than the one we have been on.   It is my hope that some of the tactics we have seen--intimidation,  bullying, violating the rules, taunting Members, trying to coerce them  through bribes, carpet bombing them with TV ads, sending them coat  hangers in the mail, screaming at them in the hallway--these cannot  become the new normal. So we cannot reward those tactics. I guarantee  that if these tactics had succeeded in blocking Judge Kavanaugh, they  would become the new normal, and that ought to chasten all of us. I  hope we have learned a painful lesson these last few weeks and will  strive to do better. I pledge my good faith and best efforts to do so  and to try to help.   We should recall the not-so-distant past when Ruth Ginsburg, the  former counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, was confirmed by  a vote of 96 to 3; when Justice Scalia was confirmed by a vote of 98 to  0; and John Paul Stevens was confirmed by a vote of 98 to 0 as well. In  a rational, logical world, Judge Kavanaugh should have similarly  lopsided numbers; that is, if people were willing to get past their  tribalism and look at our nominee's record, look at over the 300  opinions he has authored, the decisions he has authored that the  Supreme Court has unanimously embraced. If they would look at his  scholarship, talk to his former colleagues and law clerks, if opponents  were willing to do that honestly and thoroughly, they would have found  a brilliant individual who cuts no corners in his legal analysis, who  lets the chips fall where they may, and respects the very important but  limited role of the judiciary in our constitutional system.   In my view, a vote against Judge Kavanaugh is an endorsement of the  way the opponents have mishandled and abused the confirmation process,  as well as the shameful intimidation tactics they employed.   A ``no'' vote neglects all the man is and all he has accomplished  based on unproven accusations about adolescent conduct. It justifies  the manipulation and mistreatment of people like Dr. Ford for political  gain. It would establish a dangerous precedent and legitimize mob rule,  including the presumption of guilt in violation of everything in our  Constitution--   (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)    Mr. President, it would establish a dangerous precedent.   (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)    Mr. President, it would establish a dangerous precedent  and legitimize mob rule, including the presumption of guilt, in  violation of everything our Constitution and fundamental notions of  fairness that we stand for.   Some say we are a nation divided, but I am not so pessimistic as  some. I actually hope we can all learn, we must learn, I believe, from  this cruel, reckless, and indecent episode, but a ``no'' vote will not  unite us; it will help reward despicable tactics and set a new ugly  precedent. It will only encourage the spurning of tradition and agreed- upon rules, norms, and process. We should not ignore, we cannot  acquiesce in or condone what has happened here. We should send a  message loud and clear that the U.S. Senate will not be intimidated.   I will cast my vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to the  Supreme Court of the United States.
