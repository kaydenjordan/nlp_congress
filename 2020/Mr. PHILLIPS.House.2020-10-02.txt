 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge a ``yes'' vote, a  unanimous ``yes'' vote, on Mr. Malinowski's resolution. Quite frankly,  I cannot believe that I have to stand on the floor of the United States  House of Representatives to issue these remarks.   Every one of us here swore the very same oath to defend our Nation  from enemies, both foreign and domestic. QAnon is a dangerous enemy, a  dangerous enemy lurking right within our borders that must be  forcefully and, again, unanimously condemned.   What they propagate is not real. Their baseless conspiracy theories,  lies, and fearmongering are creating something, however, that is very  real. And that is division; it is hate; and if left unaddressed,  violence against fellow Americans.   Just this week alone, my dear friend, Representative Malinowski, has  received numerous death threats for simply condemning QAnon.  Representative Spanberger, a former CIA officer, has been labeled a  terrorist. And how could we forget Representatives Scalise and Giffords  both being shot during the last number of years by deranged people?   Every one of you here knows the very lives of our colleagues are now  at risk. So who is going to speak against it? Has hate really become a  partisan issue? Is reality really up for debate?   I applaud my friend, my dear friend, Representative Riggleman, who  has spoken very forcefully and immediately against QAnon. I know others  are following suit. But those who don't, for those who do not, what  reason could you possibly have to remain silent?   My friends, we are all Americans, every single one of us. And  Americans are looking to us right now to model principled, thoughtful,  decent leadership at this increasingly fragile time in our history. And  history shall be our judge.
