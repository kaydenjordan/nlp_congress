 Madam President, now for years, Republicans and  Democrats have spoken about the need to invest more in our Nation's  infrastructure. We are a country the size of a continent. Every State  has critical infrastructure demands, bridges that need repair, railways  that need maintenance, sewer systems that desperately need expansion  and renovation.   Over a month ago now, a bipartisan group of Senators announced a deal  with the White House on a framework for a bipartisan infrastructure  bill--a breakthrough moment. Ever since, I have committed both publicly  and privately to put that bill on the Senate floor.   Unfortunately, last week, our Republican colleagues prevented the  Senate from taking a procedural step to begin the debate. But I want to  be very clear. I am fully committed to passing a bipartisan  infrastructure bill.   As majority leader, I have the ability to move to reconsider the vote  to begin debate on that bill this week. Since Senators are still  finalizing the text of the agreement, Senators should be on notice that  the Senate may stay in session through the weekend in order to finish  the bill.   Let me say that again. Senators should be on notice that the Senate  may stay in session through the weekend in order to finish the  bipartisan infrastructure bill.   As I have said before, further delays may mean that the Senate will  remain in session into the previously scheduled August recess.   We have reached a critical moment. The bipartisan group of Senators  has had nearly 5 weeks of negotiations since they first announced an  agreement with President Biden. It is time for everyone to get to  ``yes'' and produce an outcome for the American people.   I understand that bipartisan achievements are difficult in our  polarized times. Extreme partisans are always rooting for failure. Look  no further than the former President.   Just this morning, former President Trump released a statement urging  Republicans to retreat from all bipartisan negotiations on  infrastructure until after the midterm elections in 2022, maybe longer.  Again, the former President said this morning that Republicans are  ``weak fools and losers''--his words--for even talking to Democrats and  suggested that the Republicans should not negotiate at all unless they  are in the majority. FOX News personalities, following his lead, are  now encouraging primaries for Republican Senators who support a  bipartisan infrastructure deal.   Look, there are always going to be radical voices on the far right  who brook no compromise, but that is only a recipe for obstruction and  gridlock. We have the opportunity right now to actually accomplish  something good for the American people.   Will our Republican colleagues follow the absurd demands of the  disgraced former President and his media allies, or will they get a  good, bipartisan deal over the finish line? Republican Senators must  ignore former President Trump if we are ever going to make progress  with the American people. He is rooting for our entire political system  to fail. I and the rest of my Democratic colleagues are rooting for a  deal.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 257.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 258.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, July 26, be  waived.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
