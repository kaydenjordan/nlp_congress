 Mr. Speaker, when I ran for Congress, I ran on the  promise that I would use my position to reverse Washington's debt  culture.   In my first term, I was in the minority party, and after 2 years of  voting against Democrats' spending proposals, I finally today get the  opportunity to vote ``yes'' on a comprehensive and thoughtful piece of  legislation that will serve as the most significant spending cut in  American history.   Does this bill achieve everything that I want? No, of course not.  That is the reality. However, my support is a significant step forward,  reversing our ballooning national debt.   The Fiscal Responsibility Act allows us to cut spending by $2.1  trillion over the next decade. It is the largest deficit reduction  ever. For the first time in 40 years, we will be able to address our  permitting process, to be able to address our energy sector and  transportation projects from crippling regulations.   This act represents the beginning of what is to come as Republicans  govern in a responsible, productive manner. We fought hard to get this  agreement and blew through Democrats' red lines over and over again.   This isn't over. We can responsibly govern, and success today will  bring more success in the future. I look forward to casting my vote  ``yes.''
