 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great Colorado  statesman and a devoted community member, University of Colorado Regent  Emeritus Tilman ``Tillie'' Bishop, who passed away on June 16.   Born and raised in Colorado, Tillie dedicated his long and  influential life to service for the people of our great State.   He held a wide variety of elected offices, including 28 years in the  Colorado General Assembly, making him the longest serving State senator  from Colorado's western slope, as well as 6 years on the University of  Colorado Board of Regents.   Tillie's passion for education and his commitment to promoting a  school system that diligently serves each and every student was  tangible and, no doubt, came from the over 30 years he worked as a  public school teacher and college administrator.   It was my honor to serve on the board of regents with Regent Bishop.  He always found ways to work across the aisle to ensure that the  students at the University of Colorado were given a top-tier education  that would prepare them for a successful future.   And I will never forget Tillie's determination and his devotion to  those he served. He was a great statesman, and I know that many in  Colorado, myself included, will miss him.   I send my deepest condolences to Regent Bishop's wife, Pat, and to  all of his family, and we thank him for his incredible service.                            ____________________
