 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for yielding.   Madam Speaker, our bodies should unite to stop the violent cartels  and drug lords who have taken advantage of the humanitarian national  security crisis on our southern border. Border security is national  security, and we need to be doing everything we can to secure our  southern border.   For years, our senior Border Patrol officials have made modest  requests for tactical barriers. The President's request prioritizes the  top 10 of 17 priority areas that Border Patrol wants to secure.   The men and women patrolling our borders put their lives on the line  every day to keep us safe from terrorism, drug trafficking, sex  trafficking, gunrunning, money laundering, and all sorts of dangerous  crimes. They routinely encounter some of the most dangerous criminals  and traffickers anywhere in the world.   They seize drugs that would have otherwise made it onto Ohio streets  where we are dealing with the tragedy of this opioid crisis that has  killed far too many of our friends and neighbors. They have also  arrested illegal aliens who were charged and convicted of crimes,  including sexual assault, kidnapping, and homicide. A significant  percentage of women and girls entering the country illegally are raped.   We should be giving our personnel on the border the resources they  need to get the job done. Nevertheless, millions of Americans want to  participate in this great cause. They have contributed private funds  and would like to give directly to our government.   That is why I introduced the Buy a Brick, Build the Wall Act, which  would allow the Treasury Department to help fund this wall and make  sure the resources go to the cause that so many people support. We need  to unite and secure our border.
