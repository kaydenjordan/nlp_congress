 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because every American should  know that we are now at the point where the Democrats are demanding  that ICE release dangerous criminals onto the streets of the United  States.   First, they demanded that we not build a wall. Their leader said that  would be immoral. Now they are demanding that we release dangerous  criminals we have already apprehended.   Mr. Speaker, they are threatening to shut the government down, they  are so committed to this position. Most Americans know their  government's most sacred obligation is the defense of the Nation. The  Democrats want to abolish one of the very agencies tasked with this  responsibility. This is a backdoor effort to do so.   Under this latest proposal, ICE has said they could be required to  release as many as 15,000 criminals on to our streets. The far left  radical positions of today's Democrats are threatening the security of  our Nation.   It is time to build the wall, secure our borders, support our law  enforcement, and keep dangerous criminals off our streets.                            ____________________
