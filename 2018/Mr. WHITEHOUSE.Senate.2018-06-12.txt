 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 15 minutes as in morning business.    Mr. President, a crash takes place in a system when  conditions in that system reach a tipping point and the system rapidly  destabilizes.   Climate change promises a lot of tipping points in the Earth's  natural systems--ocean acidification, for instance, reaching a tipping  point where foundational species, such as the pteropod, have trouble  forming their shells, and populations of those foundation species  crash, taking down the trophic levels above them; polar warming, for  instance, releasing trapped frozen methane from Arctic tundra and  hyperaccelerating the greenhouse effect. At the more local level,  seasonally linked species, reacting to changing seasons, can get out of  phase with one another, so the feeder and its food source no longer  overlap in time, and then they have a crash.   In what Pope Francis has called ``the mysterious network of relations  between things,'' climate change promises natural disruptions, large  and small.   Of course, the same kind of disruption can occur in economics.  Because we are ignoring climate change, we are hurtling toward natural  disruptions like the kinds I mentioned. On top of that, recent warnings  indicate that we are also hurtling toward economic disruptions-- crashes, if you will--which we could avoid or moderate if we prepared.  But since the fossil fuel overlords of the present Congress won't let  that preparation happen, we need to  [[Page S3749]]  expect these economic crashes. What are these economic crashes? The  first one I will discuss is the effect of sea level rise on coastal  real estate values.   Sea level rise can hit you economically long before the ocean  actually laps against your doorstep. When the prospect of coastal  flooding begins to creep into the 30-year mortgage horizon or when the  prospect of coastal flooding begins to darken property insurance  horizons, there will be an effect.   Long before your house is actually flooded, its value can crash if  the house becomes uninsurable or if it becomes unmortgageable to the  next buyer. Freddie Mac has described the effect of this property value  crash on America's coastal regions as follows: ``The economic losses  and social disruption may happen gradually, but they are likely to be  greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great  Recession.'' Those of us who lived through the great recession of 2008  and forward know how serious that warning is.   It is not just Freddie Mac; the insurance industry shares this exact  concern. Here is what the editor of the trade publication Risk &  Insurance had to say: ``Continually rising seas will damage coastal  residential and commercial property values to the point that property  owners will flee those markets in droves, thus precipitating a mortgage  value collapse that could equal or exceed the mortgage crisis that  rocked the global economy in 2008.'' So from government-backed housing  corporations to private insurance industry representatives, the warning  is clear.   The leading edge of this predicted effect may already actually be  upon us, as we have recently seen coastal property values begin to lag  inland property values in a way that experts think may reflect this  emerging coastal economic hazard. When talking about matching the  damage done to the economy by the 2008 recession, that is a serious  risk.   The second economic crash we are warned of is the effect of a so- called carbon bubble--a carbon bubble in fossil fuel companies. This  carbon bubble collapse happens when fossil fuel reserves now claimed as  assets by the fossil fuel companies turn out to be not actually  developable and thus become what are called stranded assets. A recent  publication by economists in the journal Nature Climate Change has  described the following estimated asset reductions in fossil fuel  reserves: ``The magnitude of . . . stranded assets of fossil fuel  companies (in a 2 degrees C economy) has been estimated to be around  82% of global coal reserves, 49% of global gas reserves, and 33% of  global oil reserves.''   That would be 82 percent of global coal reserves gone, wiped off the  balance sheets; 49 percent of global gas reserves gone; and 33 percent  of global oil reserves gone.   This asset collapse ahead would explain why fossil fuel companies  have fought so hard against shareholders who sought honest reporting of  this risk, and it could explain why such reports as have been produced  look like exercises in ``cooking the books'' to avoid actually  acknowledging a risk of this scale.   More recently, a group of economic analysts published a separate  review of what the bursting of this carbon bubble would look like for  fossil fuel companies. The report's analysis is pretty stark. It  estimates that a potential $12 trillion--$12 trillion--of financial  value ``could vanish off their balance sheets globally in the form of  stranded assets.'' The report notes that this is over 15 percent of  global GDP.   This economic report posits a market scenario in which lower cost  producers unload their fossil fuel reserves while they still can into  this collapsing market--``selling out'' their assets, in the language  of the report--unloading their fossil fuel assets even at fire-sale  prices to get what value they can while they still can.   In this analysis, the report says, ``regions with higher marginal  costs . . . lose almost their entire oil and gas industry (for example  . . . the United States).''   In this environment in which there is a rapid crash in fossil fuel  prices, as sellers saturate the market at whatever low price they can  get to get some money for their reserves before they evaporate and get  wiped off their balance sheets, the market moves rapidly and regions  like ours--like the United States, with higher marginal costs--lose  almost their entire oil and gas industry.   Obviously, for the United States to rapidly lose almost its entire  oil and gas industry would create a dramatic economic shock, spilling  over into other industries and into the economy at large, making this  what the authors of this report call a ``systemic'' economic risk.   There is a recommended solution to avoid this shock in asset prices,  and that is for the United States to begin decarbonizing, to invest  more in renewables, and to broaden our national energy portfolio away  from this asset collapse risk and into renewable energy. The paper  concludes that ``an exposed country can mitigate the impact of  stranding by divesting from fossil fuels as an insurance policy,'' and  it goes on to say specifically about the United States of America that  ``the United States is worse off if it continues to promote fossil fuel  production and consumption than if it moves away from them.''   Let me revert to the earlier economic piece I mentioned because it  concludes with very similar advice. I quote from the first article:         If climate policies are implemented early on and in a       stable and credible framework, market participants are able       to smoothly anticipate the effects. In this case there would       not be any large shock in asset prices and there would be no       systemic risk. In contrast, in a scenario in which the       implementation of climate policy is uncertain, delayed, and       sudden . . . this might entail a systemic risk because price       adjustments are abrupt and portfolio losses from the fossil-      fuel sector and fossil-based utilities do not have time to be       compensated by the increase in value of renewable-based       utilities.    Both economic analyses agree that transitioning to renewables is a  hedge against this fossil fuel asset collapse risk, but this earlier  paper also notes something else. It also notes that this transition to  renewables, away from the asset collapse risk, need not be a painful  transition. To quote the report, ``a transition to a low-carbon economy  could also have net positive aggregate effects.'' On one side, you have  the risk of a major fossil fuel asset collapse creating a sufficient  economic shock for there to be systemic risk to the economy. On the  other side, you have the prospect of net positive aggregate effects.  Who in their right mind would not turn toward net positive aggregate  effects? A large and sudden economic shock affecting 15 percent of  global GDP and precipitating systemic economic risks will, of course,  be very painful.   This is stark advice. Whether we can actually heed this advice  depends on the Congress of the United States being able to put the  interests of the United States first over the interests of the fossil  fuel industry. Given that Congress's fossil fuel industry overlords  will likely object and given that we seem incapable in Congress of  either seeing through their massive conflict of interest or ever  telling them no, it is not presently likely that Congress will heed  these warnings or take these precautions.   After all, the warnings of natural crashes ahead have so far been  completely ignored due to fossil fuel industry pressure. So why expect  that we would heed the warnings of economic crashes ahead?   In the days when war loomed over Europe but England would not  prepare, Winston Churchill quoted a poem. The poem's image is of a  train bound for destruction, rushing through the night, and the  conductor is asleep at the controls. The poem begins:       Who is in charge of the clattering train?      The axles creak, and the couplings strain.    Inside the train cars, the poem describes the occupants of the doomed  train:       Lull[ed into] confident drowsiness.    But then comes the end:       [T]he pace is hot, and the points are near,      And Sleep hath deadened the driver's ear;      And signals flash through the night in vain.      Death is in charge of the clattering train!    That is how the poem ends. Let us hope that we wake up before our  collision, that the many warning signals nature is flashing at us do  not flash through the night in vain, and that we do not hurtle into  these foreseen collisions with our fossil fuel industry overlords  having deadened the driver's ear with their money and their power.  [[Page S3750]]    We have been lulled into confident drowsiness, and it is time to wake  up.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
