 Mr. President, when the Senate considers nominees to the  U.S. Supreme Court, it is particularly important that we act fairly and  consistently, using the same set of rules, no matter which political  party is in power.   When President Obama nominated Judge Garland 8 months before the 2016  Presidential election, I met with him and maintained that he was  entitled to a hearing. Others argued that the winner of that year's  Presidential election should be allowed to choose the nominee, and that  is what happened. My views did not prevail, and the standard was  established that a nominee to the Court would not be voted on prior to  the election in a Presidential election year. This year, a vacancy has  also occurred, notably much closer to the election.   Prior to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death, I stated that, should a  vacancy on the Supreme Court arise, the Senate should follow the  precedent set 4 years ago and not vote on a nominee prior to the  Presidential election. Since her passing, I have reiterated that in  fairness to the American people--who will either be reelecting the  President or selecting a new one--the decision on the nominee to fill  the Supreme Court vacancy should be made by whoever is elected on  November 3.   Because this vote is occurring prior to the election, I will vote  against the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett. To be clear, my vote  does not reflect any conclusion that I have reached about Judge  Barrett's qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. What I have  concentrated on is being fair and consistent, and I do not think it is  fair nor consistent to have a Senate confirmation vote prior to the  election.                            ____________________
