 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd  Austin and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, GEN Mark Milley, spoke at  the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in France. In the audience  were veterans--some were over 100 years old--who stormed those beaches  79 years ago on D-Day. D-Day was a critical moment in World War II. It  was the beginning of the liberation of Europe, and it was the beginning  of the end of Nazi tyranny.   Looking out over a sea of headstones of fallen American patriots,  Secretary Austin said:         It's easy to forget how desperate the battle was . . . but,       on D-Day, courage won out over terror, daring over cruelty,       and liberty won out over tyranny.    Today, that same eternal battle is being fought in another place, in  Ukraine, which has begun a heroic counteroffensive to finally drive out  Vladimir Putin and the Russian invaders and to preserve democracy in  that nation.   Next month, Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire and I will travel to the  NATO summit in Lithuania. The location--in a nation that was once under  Soviet occupation--is both historic and poignant. Success in Ukraine's  counteroffensive and the country's long-term security will once again  be on top of the NATO agenda. We also will welcome the security  alliance's newest member, Finland. I hope, by the time we convene in  Lithuania, Hungary and Turkey will have ratified Sweden's succession  without any further delay--another plus for the future of the NATO  alliance.   Let me also state clearly that I believe Ukraine's future is in the  European Union and the NATO alliance, and until the day that Ukraine  can join NATO, the United States and other key allies must help Ukraine  with security guarantees, as we do with other key non-NATO allies. It  is clear that Ukraine can never trust Russia. It is in the interest of  the United States and democracy itself that we ensure Ukraine can  always defend itself, that any aggressor will think twice before ever  again trying to threaten its people or its territory.   President Biden knows what is at stake in this fight against tyranny.  So do our NATO allies. And I want to particularly note Minority Leader  McConnell. Echoing Ronald Reagan, Senator McConnell has spoken  forcefully about the need for continued bipartisan support for Ukraine.  That is the ultimate strength of the American role in the NATO  alliance: that we speak with one voice. And, of course, Ukrainian  President Zelenskyy understands that what is at stake in Ukraine is  bigger than just his nation; it is literally a battle for freedom and  democracy themselves.   In his remarks at Normandy last week, Secretary Austin said:         Free soldiers will fight more bravely than the armies of       tyrants.    He is correct, but the free people of Ukraine must not be left to  fight this war alone. The United States and nations of the free world  must provide the resources and equipment and training necessary for  them to prevail against Putin and his cowardly enablers. The free  people and soldiers of Ukraine are fighting today to preserve the peace  and international order for which those young Americans gave their  lives at D-Day. We must stand with them with resolve until Ukraine is  free again.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today, I would like to honor an  organization that generations of Illinois families have relied on:  Mujeres Latinas en Accion--or Latina Women in Action.   Mujeres is the longest standing Latina-led organization in the entire  country. And this year, they are celebrating 50 years of empowering and  emboldening Latinas across our State--as well as their families.   Founded in 1973 by the late Maria Mangual, Mujeres was first  established as a shelter for young women escaping violence in the  Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago, IL. Back then, some wrote off Mujeres'  work as radical and unnecessary, but these critics didn't deter Maria  or the dedicated women who supported her cause from building an  enduring and indispensable organization. In the five decades since,  Mujeres' mission, services, and footprint have only expanded to help  uplift women from all walks of life.   And today, Mujeres does it all. They host support groups to help  young families with parenting skills. They operate a 24-hour crisis  line--and referral service--to assist survivors of domestic and sexual  violence, both of which, tragically, increased during the COVID-19  pandemic. They have developed an education training program for women  hoping to launch or expand their small businesses, as well as a  community engagement and mobilization program, to amplify the voices of  Latina immigrants and survivors of trauma. And, importantly, Mujeres is  now a leading advocate in the effort to ensure pay equity for Latinas  in the workplace. What is more, as Mujeres' mission has evolved over  the years, so, too, has size of their operation. They  [[Page S2046]]  have opened new sites beyond Pilsen, in Brighton Park and North  Riverside--so they can reach even more women and families.   The Brighton Park facility, which opened in 2019, was the product of  a partnership between Mujeres and Esperanza Health Centers. This  facility offers everything from adult medicine and women's health  services, to pediatrics and psychiatry, and even behavioral health care  services to residents, regardless of their economic or immigration  status. Over the years, Mujeres has established itself as a vital  resource for thousands of Illinois families. Every year, they provide  critical care and services to more than 8,000 clients, in both English  and Spanish.   I am forever grateful to Mujeres for their commitment to improving,  and even saving, the lives of women in Illinois. I would like to thank  Amalia Rioja, who introduced me to Mujeres 25 years ago, as well as all  of the trailblazers who have carried Maria Mangual's legacy forward,  including Liz Prieto, Linda Coronado, Virginia Martinez, Norma Seledon,  Maria Pesqueira, and Linda Xochtil Tortolero.   I cannot wait to see what Mujeres accomplishes over the next 50  years.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
