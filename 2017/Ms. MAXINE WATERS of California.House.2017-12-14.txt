 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R. 2396, the  Privacy Notification Technical Clarification Act.   Contrary to the bill's title, this bill is far from a technical  clarification. So I want to be very clear about what this bill would  actually do.   H.R. 2396 would reduce the meaningful and clear disclosures that  financial institutions must currently provide to their customers every  year, even if those companies share their customers' nonpublic personal  information broadly with nonaffiliated third-party companies.   Unlike other privacy bills Congress has considered, this bill comes  with no guardrails whatsoever to discourage the company from broadly  sharing consumer-sensitive personal information.   While the bill provides several alternative mechanisms to deliver  privacy reminders, one option would result in the customer receiving no  written disclosure at all.   The current annual privacy notices serve as a reminder describing a  customer's right to restrict the sharing of their nonpublic, personal  information to nonaffiliated third parties and information about how to  exercise this right if they so choose.   This privacy right was created in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which  was signed into law in 1999. I served on the conference committee, so I  know firsthand that the initial and annual privacy notices in the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act were enacted partly in response to public  concerns about the sale of personal data for marketing purposes that  were highlighted in a number of legal actions brought by State  attorneys general at the time.   In 1999, for example, there was a settlement between the Minnesota  attorney general and U.S. Bank resolving allegations that the bank  misrepresented its practice of selling highly personal and confidential  information about its customers to telemarketers.   These concerns are just as relevant today. In fact, I find the timing  of the consideration of this bill very troubling, as it is being  brought to the floor just months after the massive Equifax data breach.   In the Equifax breach, 145.5 million Americans had their Social  Security numbers, dates of birth, and other sensitive financial and  personally identifiable information exposed to thieves.   Equifax is not the only major credit bureau to experience a large  data breach. About 2 years ago, Experian, one of the other three major  credit bureaus in this country, had a breach that exposed millions of  T-Mobile customers' information.   These breaches are on top of a long list of other breaches we have  seen at other companies where sensitive customer information was  compromised. Consumers have called on their Representatives in Congress  to enact tougher laws that would strengthen their control over their  personal information, not weaken it.   Consumers are increasingly wary about the unfettered sharing of their  personal information by financial firms to nonaffiliated third parties  that can result in consumer profiling, fraud, aggressive target  marketing, and identity theft.   Unfortunately, this bill goes in the opposite direction. Instead of  working to strengthen consumers' privacy protections, H.R. 2396 would  ease obligations on financial institutions to provide notices to their  customers describing their privacy practices and policies, and  importantly, fully explaining to these customers their right to  restrict the sharing of their information to nonaffiliated third  parties.   This is commonly referred to as a consumer's right to opt out of  having a financial institution share their information to companies  that are outside of their common corporate structure or organization.  These nonaffiliated third-party companies are generally not ones that  the consumers have an existing relationship with, meaning that they  have not received a product or service from the company in the past.   The proponents of H.R. 2396 may say the bill has nothing to do with  Equifax, or that Equifax would not be covered, if the amendment being  offered later today is agreed to. But the bill would roll back privacy  notice requirements for many financial institutions that engage in  vehicle financing, including megabanks like Wells Fargo, even if they  broadly share their customers' nonpublic, personal information with  other companies.                                time  0930    Let's discuss Wells Fargo and their auto lending practices and their  work with nonaffiliated third parties. Earlier this year, the  Democratic staff of the Financial Services Committee produced a report  on Wells Fargo's egregious misconduct, which has consulted in extensive  consumer harm.   For example, Wells Fargo charged over 570,000 consumers for  automobile insurance policies they did not need, which resulted in at  least 20,000 customers, including Active Duty servicemembers, having  their vehicles inappropriately repossessed. These auto insurance  policies were provided through a nonaffiliated third-party company  called National General Insurance.   The bank has also demonstrated a clear pattern of misusing millions  of their customers' information to open accounts in their name without  their permission.  [[Page H9907]]    So why should Congress consider relaxing the privacy requirements for  a recidivist bank like Wells Fargo?   Let me also address arguments that suggest customers don't read these  notices anyway. That is a quote that we hear oftentimes.   As I have discussed, I think consumers are paying closer attention  now after the Equifax incident. Proponents say that a company posting a  link on their website isn't so bad, and the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau allowed for it.   But the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau provided an alternative  to the annual privacy notices for companies that do not share data in  ways that trigger consumers' opt-out rights under the law. Over the  last decade, Congress has heard repeatedly from banks and credit unions  that if a company does not share personal information with an  unaffiliated third party that allows consumers to opt out from having  it shared, and if they do not change their privacy policies, they  should be exempt from the annual notice requirements. In those  instances, the customer does not have the ability to opt out of having  the information shared.   After several years of research and debate, we made that targeted  change in the last Congress. Since then, other companies, specifically  captive auto finance companies, have made the case they should have  more flexibility satisfying the annual notice requirement because they  have a unique and close relationship with automobile dealers they work  with that still requires them to send the annual notice.   This unaffiliated third-party relationship triggers a consumer's  right under the law to opt out and not have their information shared. I  offered an amendment in committee that would have granted this targeted  relief, but it was rejected.   So, while I appreciate that H.R. 2396 provides flexibility to captive  auto finance companies, the bill is not limited to them and goes much,  much further. Mr. Speaker, over 30 consumer, community, privacy, and  civil rights groups have publicly opposed this bill, including U.S.  PIRG, and so do I. This is an area where more study is needed before  policymakers craft sweeping changes.   The bottom line is that I believe we should not open the door too  widely at this time to give this same degree of flexibility to all and  every financial institution, including recidivist banks like Wells  Fargo.   Furthermore, there needs to be more, not less, privacy protections  and consumer control relating to personal information following the  massive data breach at Equifax this year.   Mr. Speaker, for all of these reasons, I urge opposition to H.R.  2396, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), a senior member of the  Financial Services Committee and the ranking member of the Small  Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I have heard, more than once, Members speaking for consumers, saying:  These privacy notices are not that important. Nobody reads them. They  throw them in the wastebasket.   Well, I don't know how Members would know that, and I don't think  that we should be satisfied that consumers are being represented that  way with indications that they don't really care about these notices  and the opportunity to opt out so that their information won't be  shared.   But let me tell you what consumers are saying to us. I have, here,  letters that have been sent by consumer organizations that really do  care about what is happening with this bill today, and I would like to  share that information with you.   Let me just tell you who these consumer organizations are and whom  they represent:   There is Americans for Financial Reform. Americans for Financial  Reform is a nonpartisan and nonprofit coalition of more than 200 civil  rights, consumer, labor, business, investor, faith-based, civic, and  community groups formed in the wake of the 2008 crisis, working to lay  the foundation for a strong, stable, and ethical financial system, one  that serves the economy and the Nation as a whole.   Then there is Allied Progress. Allied Progress is a consumer watchdog  organization that uses hard-hitting research to stand up to Wall Street  and powerful special interests and hold their allies in Congress and  the White House accountable.   Then there is Center for Digital Democracy. The Center for Digital  Democracy is recognized as one of the leading consumer protection and  privacy organizations in the United States; and since its founding in  2001 and, prior to that, through its predecessor organization, the  Center for Media Education, CDD has been at the forefront of research,  public education, and advocacy, protecting consumers in the digital  age.   Then there is Consumer Action. Through multilingual financial  education materials, community outreach, and issue-focused advocacy,  Consumer Action empowers underrepresented consumers, nationwide, to  assert their rights in the marketplace and to financially prosper.   There is the Consumer Federation of America. The Consumer Federation  of America is an association of nonprofit consumer organizations that  was established way back in 1968 to advance consumer interests through  research, advocacy, and education. Today, nearly 300 of these groups  participate in the federation and govern it through their  representatives on the organization's board of directors. CFA is a  research, advocacy, education, and service organization.   Then there is Consumer Watchdog. Consumer Watchdog is a nonprofit  organization dedicated to providing an effective voice for taxpayers  and consumers in an era when special interests dominate public  discourse, government, and politics, and they describe themselves as  deploying an in-house team of public interest lawyers, policy experts,  strategists, and grassroots activists to expose, confront, and change  corporate and political injustice in every way, every day, saving  Americans billions of dollars and improving countless lives. For  decades, Consumer Watchdog has been the Nation's most aggressive  consumer advocate, taking on politicians of both parties and the  special interests that fund them.   Then there is the National Association of Consumer Advocates. The  National Association of Consumer Advocates is a nonprofit association  of more than 1,500 attorneys and consumer advocates committed to  representing consumers' interests. Our members, they say, are private  and public sector attorneys, legal services attorneys, law professors,  and law students whose primary focus is the protection and  representation of consumers. They have represented hundreds of  thousands of consumers victimized by fraudulent, abusive, and predatory  business practices.   As a national organization fully committed to promoting justice for  consumers, NACA's members and their clients are actively engaged in  promoting a fair and open marketplace that forcefully protects the  rights of consumers, particularly those of modest means. NACA also has  a charitable and educational fund incorporated under 501(c)(3).    There is another very prominent consumer organization, the National  Consumer Law Center, working on behalf of low-income clients. Since  1969, the nonprofit National Consumer Law Center has used its expertise  in consumer law and energy policy to work for consumer justice and  economic security for low-income and other disadvantaged people,  including older adults in the United States. This organization's  expertise includes policy analysis and advocacy, consumer law and  energy publications, litigation, expert witness services, and training  and advice for advocates.   This organization works with nonprofit and legal services  organizations, private attorneys, policymakers, and Federal and State  government and courts across the Nation to stop exploitative practices,  help financially stressed families build and retain wealth, and advance  economic fairness.   Then there is Privacy Times. Privacy Times is the leading  subscription-only newsletter covering privacy and freedom of  information law and policy. It is read largely by attorneys and  professionals who must stay abreast of the legislation, litigation, and  executive branch activities, as well as consumer news, technology  trends, and business developments. Since 1981, Privacy Times has  provided its readers with accurate reporting, objective analysis, and  thoughtful insight into the events that shape the ongoing debate over  privacy and freedom of information.   Then there is the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Privacy Rights  Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer education and advocacy organization  located in San Diego, California, their mission is to engage, educate,  and empower consumers to protect their privacy. They engage in  outreach, provide educational materials and services to individuals  nationwide, and have an active media presence. The PRC uses the  information we learn directly, they say, from consumers to form the  basis of their advocacy work.   Then there is Public Citizen. Public Citizen has a team of  researchers. They uncover the facts. Their staff brings their findings  to the public through the media as well as one-on-one interactions.  Their advocates bring the voice of the public to the halls of power on  behalf of consumers.   Then there is Public Knowledge. Public Knowledge promotes freedom of  expression and open internet and access to affordable communication  tools and  [[Page H9911]]  creative works. They work to shape policy on behalf of the public  interest.   Then there is Reinvestment Partners. Reinvestment Partners' mission  is to advocate for economic justice and opportunity. They do this by  providing direct services to people, revitalizing places, and  advocating for just policies. Founded as a project of Legal Services in  1986 as the Community Reinvestment Association of North Carolina, the  agency has worked to ensure fair lending to underserved communities in  order to build and protect wealth. In 2012, they changed their name to  recognize the expanded diversity of their programs and their local and  State and national outreach.   And then there is U.S. PIRG. U.S. PIRG is an advocate for the public  interest, working to win concrete results on real problems that affect  millions of lives and standing up for the public against powerful  interests when they push the other way. They say: ``The problems we  face don't care if you are liberal or conservative, if you live in a  red or blue State. They affect each and every one of us.'' That is why,  for decades, they have taken a nonpartisan, facts-driven, results- oriented approach to their work.   Mr. Speaker, I do not like hearing that our consumers don't care,  that they don't need a yearly notification about their privacy rights,  that they simply throw this information that describes their rights  into the wastebasket; and I am so pleased that, over the years and  through the history of this Nation when too many consumers have been  ignored, taken advantage of, didn't know what their rights were, all of  these organizations that I have taken time to share with you today work  on behalf of consumers. They work not only in organizing and educating,  but they send this information to their Members of Congress. All of  these organizations have sent in this information not only about their  backgrounds, but about this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Again, it is interesting how my colleagues on the opposite side of  the aisle describe their consumers. These are people, they say, who  don't want to be inundated with useless information. They are saying  that the privacy information is of no use.   It is interesting that Mr. Loudermilk said he read his privacy  notice, unlike most other Americans who don't read their privacy  notice. I think that is very interesting to describe himself as someone  who read his privacy notice, but able to speak for all other Americans  who don't read their privacy notice.   What is very interesting also about his comments is he refers to the  consumer groups as special interests, while he is representing the  banks and the financial institutions, the real special interests.   Why is it Representatives who come to this Congress to represent  people who vote for them somehow see their responsibility to protect  the real special interests, such as the financial institutions who have  lobbyists running up and down these Halls every day, who make  contributions to Members of Congress, rather than the consumers who are  represented by the kinds of groups that I have taken time to describe  here this morning, because these individuals and the average citizen do  not have paid lobbyists from financial institutions and banks  representing them here.   So it is also interesting that Mr. Loudermilk talked about how many  of these consumers are going to be buying automobiles because of the  tax fraud bill that he is referring to that is being advanced by the  opposite side of the aisle. The only thing that bill is going to do for  consumers, which will hurt our economy, is create a $1.5 trillion debt.   Well, he said that consumers were going to be buying more cars. Yeah,  the wealthy will be, the ones who are given the breaks in this tax  bill. The wealthy may be buying more automobiles, but the very people  who are represented by these consumers that I have shared the  information on this morning, they won't be able to buy automobiles  because they are going to be harmed. It is only the wealthy, only those  who are making extraordinary amounts of money, and corporations, that  are going to benefit from the tax bill.   I don't even know how and why he talked about it in the same breath  that we are talking about our consumers being able to be respected with  privacy information that they would get because we have laws that give  them the right to have this information.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other  Members, so I yield myself the balance of my time to close.   It is very simple. The consumer groups that I took time to help  people to understand who they are and what they do, representing the  consumers, are the folks who are concerned about people knowing their  rights. This is what they work at doing.   Those of us who align ourselves with consumer groups care about the  average citizen. We care that the average citizen gets the kind of  information that is going to make their lives much easier.   The people on the opposite side of the aisle represent banks and  financial institutions. We are not opposed to business, and we work  with businesses in various ways.                                time  1015    We are opposed to rip-offs. We are opposed to fraud. We are opposed  to denying consumers the opportunity to know their rights.   But those Members of Congress who come here and basically mimic and  mock the consumers by talking about those consumers who wait by their  mailboxes for privacy information certainly are not representing the  citizens of their district.   I can tell you this: When you take a look at who the real special  interests are, who is representing the interests of the special  interests, who in this House stands up for banks, financial  institutions, and Wall Street and hedge funds, you look at the opposite  side of the aisle, time and time again, and you will find them putting  all of their time and their effort into representing those special  interests.   For those of us who stand on the side of the average citizen, yes, we  align  [[Page H9913]]  ourselves with consumer groups. No, we don't dismiss them as  unnecessary people just messing around in the business of big business.   These are the representatives, again, of people who don't have fancy  lobbyists walking these Halls and following the Members of Congress,  getting into their area and influencing them.   Mr. Speaker, I stand today with our consumers. I applaud all of our  consumer groups and I stand on the side of our consumers being able to  know their rights and all of the work that went into providing this  opportunity in law. I stand with them and I resist any effort by the  opposite side of the aisle to deny the right of our citizens to be  notified about their rights and their ability to opt out if they do not  want their information shared with these unaffiliated groups.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud. I know that we are doing what our  citizens want us to do, why they sent us to this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Clay's  effort to make the bill better. He is absolutely correct, we have been  attempting to work together to see if there was a way that we could  deal with the issue at hand and absolutely ensure that our consumers  not only have a right to information that explains to them what their  rights are and how they can opt out when their information is being  sold, really, to unaffiliated organizations.   Mr. Speaker, just in case people are not following exactly what we  are talking about when we talk about opt-out rights, let me draw your  attention to the fact that you oftentimes are receiving loads of mail  in your mailbox, everything from somebody who is selling pet food to  clothing, to services, to all kinds of products, and you don't know why  they are sending you all this junk. Well, they are sending you this  junk because somebody sold your information to all of these  organizations because you didn't know that you had not opted out. You  maybe didn't know what your rights are. But citizens have a right to  have that information, and they have a right to be respected and not  thought to be simply throwing it into the wastebasket.   It doesn't matter whether it is for all businesses in the United  States or just for automobile dealers. It is about every citizen having  the right to have their privacy protected and not having people sell  their information to unaffiliated organizations that will cause them to  be pressured or solicited over and over again and their mailboxes  filled with information because their privacy information has been sold  to one of those unaffiliated organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I think that Mr. Clay is attempting to streamline the  bill. I appreciate the efforts that he has put into attempting to do  this, but this does not correct the problem. This undermines the  efforts of all of these consumer groups that worked for years to get  these notices sent to our consumers.   Mr. Speaker, despite the fact that we have tried and we have worked  and we have listened to each other, I would ask for a ``no'' vote on  the amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final  amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to  committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final  passage, as amended.   My motion would prevent institutions that have engaged in a pattern  or practice of unsafe or unsound banking practices and other violations  related to consumer harm from being able to evade important consumer  protections.   When companies repeatedly exhibit indifference to consumer protection  and demonstrate that they are incapable of complying or are unwilling  to comply with U.S. laws and regulations, they should not be allowed to  benefit from those bad actions.  [[Page H9915]]    As I have already mentioned, under this bill, as amended, companies  like Wells Fargo would be free to share or sell customer information  with any company, with minimal reminders to their customers.   We all know that Wells Fargo has engaged in illegal student loan  servicing practices, inappropriate checking accounts, overdraft fees,  unlawful mortgage lending practices, overcharging veterans for  refinanced loans, enrolled customers in life insurance policies without  their consent, delayed mortgage closing dates until after the  expiration of the borrower's interest rate lock to levy additional  fees, and charged over 570,000 customers with auto insurance policies  they did not need, which resulted in at least 20,000 customers,  including Active-Duty servicemembers, having their vehicles  inappropriately repossessed.   Companies like Wells Fargo are why I introduced H.R. 3937, the  Megabank Accountability and Consequences Act, to make sure that lenders  that have engaged in abusive practices face real consequences for their  wrongdoing. It is time we truly hold companies that demonstrate a  pattern of harming consumers accountable. These institutions must no  longer be allowed to abuse hardworking Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my motion, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
