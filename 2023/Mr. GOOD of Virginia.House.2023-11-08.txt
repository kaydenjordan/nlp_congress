 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my  amendment that would ensure that no taxpayer dollars are used to  implement a vaccine mandate. This amendment applies across the Federal  Government as well as to the District of Columbia since the  [[Page H5619]]  District falls under the oversight of the Congress and uses taxpayer  dollars for its operation as the seat of the United States Government.   We cannot forget how the COVID lockdowns were exploited by the  government to infringe on the personal liberties of Americans. These  tyrannical lockdowns and mandates were used to inflict unneeded  economic damage on small towns in rural America and on businessowners  across the country.   The government crushed the economy during COVID with unjustified  lockdowns, lockouts, restrictions, mandates, and more. The government  harmed and mistreated our children during COVID by closing schools,  requiring masks, and enforcing vaccines on those who were never truly  at risk from the virus. The government suppressed information and  perpetuated lies. The government prevented doctors and healthcare  providers from doing what they believed was best for their patients to  combat COVID.   The government trampled on basic liberties such as the freedom of  speech and expression, the freedom of worship, the freedom of assembly,  the freedom to make a living or to operate your business, the freedom  of movement and travel, the freedom to educate your children, and much  more.   The government lied about the risk of the virus. The government lied  about the effectiveness of the vaccine. The government lied about the  need to wear a mask. The government treated everyone like those who  were truly at risk, the elderly and those with extra comorbidity  factors.   The government forced the termination of frontline medical personnel,  first responders, law enforcement, and military personnel for not  getting a vaccine, regardless of whether or not they were at serious  risk or had already had the virus, and therefore, had natural immunity.  The government stripped away the right to privacy, medical freedom, and  bodily autonomy. The government didn't follow the science.   History will judge the government harshly for the harm done to the  American people, especially to our children, during the pandemic.   President Biden mercifully, finally declared the COVID-19 public  health emergency over just on May 11 of this year. This was long past  due.   Unfortunately, though, vaccine mandates are still in place in some  places across the country. In fact, nearly 100 universities across the  country still require a COVID-19 vaccine just to attend school this  year, for college students who were never at serious risk for the  virus.   It is time we protect taxpayers from unwillingly funding more  restrictive mandates. More importantly, it is time we protect  Americans' most basic fundamental liberties.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I agree with my colleague from the  other side that, yes, this amendment would prohibit the requirement of  the COVID vaccine in Washington, D.C.--not just the COVID-19 vaccine,  though. Can you believe they really still want to require the COVID-19  vaccine now, nearly 4 years later?                                time  1600    We are talking about vaccines more generally and more broadly. We  need to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority.   Unfortunately, D.C. has demonstrated they certainly need the  congressional oversight that is afforded to this body in the  Constitution.   Mr. Chairman, COVID-19 restrictions hurt millions of Americans,  countless businesses, and many communities in our great Nation. Too  many people were forced to make a choice between freedom--basic  fundamental freedom--and keeping their job.   The virus was going to do what the virus was going to do. We all got  it. There was nothing we could do to prevent us from getting it. The  Federal Government was the worst offender, imposing draconian measures  and mandates to stop the spread. We all remember that.   How many employees were fired because they made their own personal  medical choices; not to mention our servicemembers who were  dishonorably discharged for exercising their freedom not to get the  vaccine.   Taxpayer dollars should never flow to any entity that forces people  to take an experimental shot. We must safeguard personal freedoms.  Isn't that the fundamental responsibility of this government and  Congress?   We need to protect the right for all Americans to make the best  medical decisions for themselves. We must say, in no uncertain terms,  never again. Never again would we allow government to do what they did  to the American people during the COVID pandemic.   My amendment simply blocks funding from going toward any  authoritarian vaccine mandate.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of Mr. Gooden  of Texas, and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the Biden administration promised  us that they would be the most transparent administration in our  Nation's history.   Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, they have not followed through  on that promise. In fact, the White House visitor log policy provides  the American people the ability to see who is lobbying this  administration.   However, the Biden administration has made significant efforts to  ensure this policy is nearly impossible to take  [[Page H5620]]  effect as intended. Despite Republicans sending correspondence to the  administration requesting the disclosure of this information, the White  House has not followed through and remains highly secretive. While they  released some portions of visitor logs, the American people deserve  full transparency.   Here are just a few examples of the Biden administration's secrecy.  The White House has deliberately omitted Hunter Biden's visitor logs  from the database.   They have made it apparent that no records of visitors to the  Delaware residence exists. When asked to disclose the details, they  denied any intent to publish visitor access logs at the President's  Delaware home.   Mind you, the President has spent well over 200 days of his  Presidency at that location, which was also investigated when  confidential classified documents were found.   Their failure to disclose all visitor logs between the White House  and the President's Delaware property have directly contradicted this  administration's claims of being the most transparent administration.   These failures prove the administration's commitment to restore  integrity, transparency, and trust in government is merely lip service.  We have seen this across all levels of the Biden administration,  whether it is the press secretary selectively allowing only cherry- picked questions, or the White House hiding the visitor logs to his  retreat in Delaware where he was keeping classified documents.   This amendment will require the White House to be transparent and  prohibit them from failing to disclose visitor logs in a timely and  accurate manner in any way.   We can no longer allow the Biden administration to use a lack of  transparency as a shield to mask their actions from public  accountability.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would help my friend across the  aisle with the examples that I just gave. They have deliberately  omitted Hunter Biden's visitor logs, and they certainly have omitted  visitor logs from the President's residence in Delaware where he spent  over 200 days.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.
