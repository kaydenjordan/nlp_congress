 Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize and  congratulate an immigrant advocate, and now MacArthur genius, Cristina  Jimenez Moreta. Like me, she is a CUNY alumni and she grew up  undocumented.   Since founding United We Dream in 2008, Cristina Jimenez Moreta has  become a powerhouse champion for immigrant groups across the country.  By elevating the stories of DREAMers and putting faces and names to a  discussion that was, at times, dismissive and dehumanizing, she changed  the dialogue surrounding undocumented young people.   Her work has impacted the lives of young immigrants nationwide, and  in honor of her significant contributions, she was recently selected as  one of 24 MacArthur Fellow winners worldwide in 2017.   I congratulate Ms. Jimenez on her MacArthur Fellowship, and I applaud  her decision to use the grant money to further the development of other  undocumented young people.   Cristina, your work is paramount now more than ever now that we brace  as a nation to give rich people a big tax write-off that will put our  country in jeopardy, a big gambling casino effort that has seen a  failed attempt in the past with trickle-down economy.   ``Because we are not one. We are not 100. We are millions. Count us  well.'' ``Porque no somos uno. No somos cien. Somos millones. Cuentanos  bien.''                            ____________________
