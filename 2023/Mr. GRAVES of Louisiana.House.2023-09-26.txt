 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, in 1996 this Congress came  together to work on a bipartisan basis and enact work requirements for  welfare programs.   Mr. Chairman, let me be very clear. The United States needs a social  safety net. We need a social welfare program--let me say it again--as a  safety net, as a program that is there to help those on a temporary  basis at a time of need to offer a handout.   Under President Clinton, under Republicans and Democrats working  together in 1996, and I make note, Mr. Chairman, then-Senator Joe Biden  voted in support of installing work requirements for welfare programs  such as for the SNAP program, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program, commonly known as food stamps.                                time  2320    Under the program or under the law change, the work requirements  simply meant that you needed to go to a job assistance center, a job  training center, somewhere to gain the skills to connect you with  available jobs.   More recently, Mr. Chair, just months ago, Republicans and  Democrats--and I want to make note the majority of Democrats in this  Chamber, the majority of Republicans in this Chamber and our President  Joe Biden signed into law strengthening those work requirements; for  example, raising the requirement up to age 55 that work capable  individuals without dependents would be responsible for 20 hours of  work in order to be eligible after an extended period for programs like  food stamps.   This body came together and established a hard cap on the percentage  of individuals that a State may be able to exempt.   What has happened is we have watched as the States have abused a  loophole, a loophole that simply says if there are insufficient jobs,  you don't have to comply with the work requirement. Eighteen States  today--18 States--have said that they have insufficient jobs. Mr.  Chair, that is ridiculous.   We have one of the lowest workforce participation rates in modern  history. We have 8.8 million jobs available according to the Bureau of  Labor Statistics. Jobs are available. Let's be clear. For those who are  going to come out and say that this is mean, this is mean-spirited,  this is cruel--let's be clear, Mr. Chair, the objective of work  requirements--I am certain that Bill Clinton had as President, that  then-Senator Joe Biden supported, that more recently President Joe  Biden signed into law--the objective here is following models that have  shown getting people to job assistance centers, job training centers,  volunteering in  [[Page H4540]]  their community, volunteering in their church, going to school helps  improve employability. It helps get people back in the workforce,  taking them off of government dependence and becoming members of our  society that determine their own future.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Chair, I will respond to my friend's  comments. I actually agree with what he said, and, fortunately, he is  not making any reference to my amendment.   Let's be clear on what happens here. These are Federal funds; so,  yes, absolutely, the Federal Government should be determining it. This  has nothing to do with State's rights. We don't let the States cut the  check for the Federal Government. That is inappropriate.   Number two, no one is taking these benefits away. Let's keep in mind,  taxpayers are funding these programs, and all we are doing is we are  simply asking for 20 hours a week of volunteer time in return for  receiving these very generous taxpayer-funded benefits.   Lastly, Mr. Chair, the outcomes show, study after study shows this  results in getting people back in the workforce. This should be our  objective. Why in the world would we want to force people to stay on  social welfare programs? That is cruel. We shouldn't be doing that to  anyone. It is entirely inappropriate.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
