 Madam Speaker, while the longest government  shutdown in our country's history finally ended over the weekend, its  effects continue to plague working families.   For 35 days the President held hostage the paychecks, financial  security, and health and wellbeing of hundreds of thousands of Federal  workers, including 5,200 from Michigan.   The President's stunt did nothing to advance real border security  discussions and resulted in a colossal waste of time and resources. He  cost the American economy $11 billion; ironically, nearly twice as much  as he wanted for an ineffective border wall.   As the President threatens another shutdown, I rise today to demand  that he never again use this cruel tactic, and to, instead, come to the  table, the negotiating table in good faith.   Democrats support effective border security solutions, and we are  here to talk so long as working families are not used as pawns in the  political process.
