 Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to this bill.   I hate bullies. This bill is about bullying children.   Children struggle with identity, gender, and otherwise. As a parent,  I need all the other adults, teachers, coaches, and lawmakers to help  me and my wife to protect our children, support them, give them a sense  of purpose and belonging.   This is the opposite of that. You are picking on children.   Your government has become so intrusive in our lives. You are in our  doctors' offices banning reproductive freedom. You are in our  classrooms banning books and what teachers can and can't say.   Now, you are in my daughter's locker room requiring physical exams of  children? It is so profoundly disgusting and inappropriate.   It is un-American. Don't tread on us. Let us be.   We have an economy to fix, a public safety crisis to address, a  border to secure, a budget to balance, roads to pave, and bridges to  build.   Focus. Stop bullying children.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about freedom in the  context of the Supreme Court's decision to extend their decisionmaking  timeframe as to whether or not this country is going to ban a pill that  has been approved by the FDA for over 20 years. This is a safe pill,  and it is about reproductive freedom.   Make no mistake, it is also about control. This is about stripping  Americans of their reproductive freedom, and I think immediately to my  own 13-year-old daughter and her freedoms.   We need everyone in this body to object to this national ban and to  come together to restore freedom to millions of girls and women across  America. This is a defining moment in our country. We need the majority  of us to stand on the side of freedom.                            ____________________
