 Mr. Speaker, against science and common sense, many  traditional government schools continue to shut children out of the  classroom.   The Biden administration has repeatedly put the political agenda of  teachers' unions above the needs of children.   Throughout this pandemic, the Biden administration has ignored the  concerns of parents and has, instead, crafted its COVID-19 school  guidelines in accord with the demands of union bosses.   The Biden administration's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  consulted American Federation of Teachers, AFT, President Randi  Weingarten for help in shaping guidance on school reopening. Entrusting  a union boss and major campaign donor to make public health decisions  is completely unacceptable.   Teachers' unions took full advantage of the pandemic. They bullied  and coerced the Biden administration until they got almost everything  they asked for. Anytime the Biden administration resisted their  demands, these unions had a meltdown, publicly shaming the  administration, staging sick-outs, and making their demands even more  elaborate and unreasonable.   According to CDC guidance, schools can safely stay open. The data  proves that schools are not and have never been a major vector of  spread. Yet, even with all the scientific data, teachers' unions are  holding their ground at the cost of students' well-being.   This pandemic has taken a major toll on young people. Children, who  are at the lowest risk of being made seriously ill by COVID-19, have  been forced out of the classrooms by the demands of teachers' unions.   Forcing students to learn behind a screen has led to devastating  consequences. According to a report by Curriculum Associates, the  number of students testing at two or more grade levels below their own  grade has significantly increased since the pandemic. The numbers are  worse for students who are already at risk.   For example, 49 percent of third graders who come from low-income  areas are now two or more grade levels behind in reading and math. This  is an increase of 10 to 12 percent since before the pandemic began.   Because of school closures, many students have also been suffering  from isolation, depression, and anxiety. It was alarming to read that  the number of ER visits for suspected suicide attempts by teenage girls  rose from early 2019 to early 2021 by 51 percent.    This is a public health crisis in and of itself yet one that is being  ignored by many of the decisionmakers at both the national and local  level in favor of special interest groups like the AFT.  [[Page H12]]    That is why Republicans at the Education and Labor Committee have  been fighting so hard to keep schools open. We know the stakes are  high.   This pandemic has made it abundantly clear that teachers' unions, as  well as the education establishment, have too much power. Neither union  bosses nor bureaucrats in Washington should be able to keep our  children from the classroom. Access to education is an important right  in this country, one that teachers' unions are belittling with their  outrageous demands.   What has the outsized influence of teachers' unions produced? Less  school choice, falling education standards, explicit material in school  libraries, critical race theory-inspired curriculum, and years of  learning loss.   Teachers' unions have become far less about protecting teachers or  students and far more about promoting a left-wing political agenda.  This was made clear when the teachers' unions in several major cities  joined forces with the Democratic Socialists of America to demand an  eviction moratorium and an end to voucher programs as conditions for  reopening schools.   The longer we let these union bosses take advantage of this pandemic,  the worse off our students will be. Students should no longer take a  back seat to politics or special interests.   It is time to stop catering to teachers' unions and to start serving  the needs of students.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Trooper  John Horton of the North Carolina Highway Patrol. On January 3, he  passed away in a tragic accident in the line of duty. He was a 15-year  veteran of the unit and was assigned to Rutherford County.   His two younger siblings, James and Joe, served alongside him at one  point in the Highway Patrol. They were the first and only trio of  siblings to ever work simultaneously in the Highway Patrol in North  Carolina's history.   My prayers go out to Trooper Horton's family, his wife, and six  children. May his memory and service to his community serve as an  inspiration for future generations of law enforcement officers to come.                            ____________________
