 Mr. Speaker, during a House Select Subcommittee on the  Coronavirus Pandemic hearing yesterday, former Director of National  Intelligence Ratcliffe testified that a lab leak is the only  explanation credibly supported by our intelligence, by science, and by  common sense.   On Monday morning, a new Senate report concluded there were two leaks  from the Wuhan lab in 2019 and this Nation had funded gain-of-function  research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.   At the same Tuesday hearing, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of  State David Feith revealed that the State Department tried hiding  evidence of U.S. funded gain-of-function research, arguing it could  open a Pandora's box.   In other words, they concluded it would be easier to lie, therefore,  endanger the American people and the world because telling the truth  would expose a lot of difficult questions.   These revelations are further proof of what many Americans already  know to be true: Dr. Anthony Fauci misled the public continuously  during the pandemic about the origins of this virus and the risk of  gain-of-function research.   People in our own government aided this for various reasons,  selfishly wanting to defraud and endanger the public while they pursued  their own goals. Director Ratcliffe's and Mr. Feith's testimony, as  well as the Senate report, should disturb every lawmaker in this  Chamber.                            ____________________     Thank you, again, to my colleague from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson), for leading this time for us to further inform the American  people on these key matters.   Really, this is what House Republicans have demonstrated so far in  this majority here in the last 3 months or so.   The priorities of the American people are our priorities for their  well-being, their prosperity, and we are achieving that in the  legislation we are pushing through.   Unfortunately, that priority is not shared by our President, and a  lot of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are focused on a  lot of other things that are very destructive to our economy,  destructive to the well-being of what has really made this country  strong economically and morally.   Our economic base pivots mainly on energy, continued development of  it, developing newer, better technologies which in this country, when  we have the entrepreneurship, the freedom and means to continue to  innovate instead of getting railroaded into things that don't work.   A lot of that is this massive bent toward electrifying all of our  energy-consuming devices, whether they be automobiles or appliances,  things that we use for manufacturing, industry, what have you.   I just have to tell you, remind you, that our power grid, our  electricity grid, especially in my home State, is this close,  especially on a hot summer day, toward collapsing.   It is not enough, certainly, to take into account the big ideas there  are to electrify cars, trucks, leaf blowers, stoves, and this is over  the protests of the very people who are going to be expected to buy  them and replace them.   Have you seen cities and municipalities moving in the direction of  banning all new gas stoves? Well, gas stoves work awfully well for  people, for homeowners that wish to have that choice.   When we see government continuing to take choices away from people,  you are not seeing it from House Republicans.   You are seeing it from the left. You are seeing it from this White  House. You are seeing it from the policies that come from the Democrat  leadership. People need to realize where this comes from.   Legislation that was passed in the seventies, NEPA as part of  Endangered Species Act, as part of the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act,  those are good things, were good things at the time.   They have been weaponized over the last 30 or 40 years to stop  projects that people want from getting done, whether it is widening  their highways to have better transportation infrastructure; whether it  is agriculture. You  [[Page H1883]]  know, incredibly, we are seeing that in this country, we might have  empty store shelves of certain products that people come to expect;  certainly we are seeing much higher prices for food.   What is the key to this? Energy. We don't have low-cost energy,  reasonable energy, and we have stopped exploring for new oil and gas.   We stopped building power plants. Indeed, in my district, they are  trying to tear down hydroelectric plants that make CO2-free  power.   We all love CO2-free stuff, and they want to tear out this  infrastructure. Our only nuclear power plant left in California, Diablo  Canyon, got a 5-year reprieve by the legislature recently.   There are people already trying to put a stop to that 5-year reprieve  of it being shut down--more CO2-free power, 9 percent of the  grid.   So the weaponization of the environment has been pretty successful so  far in stopping important projects. Instead, we get red tape, bloat,  all sorts of things from the government instead of the projects people  need in order to continue.   Western civilization is defined by our ability to produce not only  what we need but to help others around the world. We are unable to do  that effectively if we keep going in this direction.   A bill we passed last week, H.R. 1, was critical toward moving back  this 2\1/2\ to 3-year funk we had under President Biden and also  pivoting off of COVID shutting down our lives, largely.   I can even extend that to the importance of forest management because  the smoke plume from that affects the whole country when you have a  million-acre fire like I had in my district.   H.R. 1 has these key components toward helping with energy. One key  component to help with forest management is to be able to do the types  of thinning and work that is going to make the forests healthy. When  you are talking about the Forest Service lands, they are an asset of  the American people and they need to be saved.   The lunacy we have seen with the extremists manipulating  environmental laws and, of course, court decisions that aren't really  based so much on what the intent of the law was 50 years ago is really  harming our country. It is really harming the people, causing  unnecessarily high costs of everything, and taking choices off your  table, taking choices out of your garage, et cetera, et cetera.   H.R. 1 is a good start on that. We need our colleagues in the Senate  to pass that and get it to the White House and, hopefully, convince the  President to do the right thing; not just shut down more energy.   Folks, we have got to have you pay attention to this stuff and be on  our side on this because we are actually on your side and not trying to  take away your choices, your livelihoods, and harm you economically.
