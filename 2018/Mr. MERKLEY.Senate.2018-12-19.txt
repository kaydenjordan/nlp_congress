 Madam President, I praise my colleagues from the  Atlantic coast of New Jersey and Pacific coast of California for today  putting our entire Senate on record and on a pathway to recognizing the  deep darkness of this national scar on our justice system and on our  psyche.   Work well done today in the U.S. Senate. Thank you.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to address a current-day scar, a  wound in America--a wound in terms of how we are treating children  arriving on our borders and seeking asylum.   George Washington said America is a nation open ``to receive not only  the opulent and respectable stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted  of all nations and religions.''   This sense of the vision of America was repeated 100 years later  through Emma Lazarus's poem that is carved into the foundation of the  Statue of Liberty. Phrases of that poem include: ``Give me your tired,  your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. . . . Send  these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,'' but that spirit is lost  right now in the USA.   We are a nation almost universally of immigrants, and yet we are  treating those children fleeing persecution as if they are criminals  when they arrive at our borders.   I went down this last weekend with Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and  Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota, with Representative Judy Chu of  California and Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas. Four of us  visited two family internment camps--one in Dilley and one in Karnes-- and all five of us went to the Tornillo child prison in the desert in  Texas outside El Paso.   This war against children--this Trump war against children--was most  dramatically demonstrated back in May and June when the U.S. Government  implemented a ``zero tolerance'' policy that, in fact, said, if you  assert your international rights and come to the border of the United  States, we will treat you as a criminal. We will lock you up. We will  rip your children out of your arms, and who knows if you will ever see  them again.   I went down June 3 of this year to shine a light on this and find out  what was really going on. I saw children in cages. I tried to enter a  facility--a former Walmart--that I was told had hundreds of kids locked  up in it. I was denied entry because of the administration's desires to  keep the effects of  [[Page S7845]]  their child separation policy secret. There was an outcry from people  across America saying the United States does not do this. We do not  inflict trauma on children as a direct and deliberate strategy of  sending a message to the world that we do not want you, if you are  fleeing persecution, to come to our shores. We do not deliberately  inflict trauma on children.   In addition to the public outcry, there was court action. The  administration agreed and said: OK. We will stop doing child  separation. We will quit ripping children out of their parents' arms,  but the President said, if we can't rip children out of their parents'  arms, instead, we will lock them up. We will lock them up with their  parents--still treating them as criminals as they await asylum here. In  fact, the bill to that effect passed the House of Representatives, and  35 Senators in this Chamber signed on to this bill to expand this  system of family internment camps at the request of the administration.   I came to this floor. I pointed out the long and shameful history of  family internment camps in America, and I proposed a different vision.  I put forward a bill entitled the No Family Internment Camps in America  Act. I noted it would be a fierce fight if those who want to proceed  with internment camps attempted to do so. This body dropped that  effort--stopped that effort. That is good, but the administration is  still determined to pursue this, and they have been moving funds to  people to expand family internment camps in places like Karnes and  Dilley. So we went there to look at these family internment camps--one  with fathers and sons; one with mothers and daughters.   You know, the right thing to do as families await asylum hearings is  for them to get that hearing on a timely basis of 6 to 12 months and  have them under a Family Case Management Program of not locking them up  in prison. Locking up children in prisons does deep, traumatic damage  to these children, so we must continue to fight this internment camps  strategy.   The four Members of Congress who were there at Dilley met with a  woman. She and her daughter have been locked up in Dilley going on 6  months. Yesterday was the daughter's 15th birthday. The Quinceanera is  a big celebration--if you come from a Latin American tradition--of a  young girl becoming a young woman. We asked the camp: Are you going to  recognize this girl's birthday, this very significant 15th birthday,  this quinceanera?   No, we can't do anything special to recognize one child.   We said: Well, why not have a policy of recognizing each child on his  or her birthday, so you are doing the same for everyone?   They said: No, too much trouble. We will have a monthly gathering and  list the names of those who had birthdays that month. That will  suffice.   It is a symbol of the dehumanization with which we are treating  people locked up--families we are locking up who have fled persecution  and are awaiting an asylum hearing.   That young woman is suffering significantly. We met with her mother.  Her mother told us she is not sleeping well, she is not eating well,  and she was really depressed over the fact that this very significant  day would go unrecognized. We should never be locking up children for  long periods of time.   There is an agreement--a settlement--that said children will not be  locked up for more than 20 days. It is called the Flores settlement. It  was a settlement that came out of the fact that we recognized that  locking up children hurts them, traumatizes them, that it should never  happen, and it shouldn't happen for more than 20 days.   Well, it is happening more than 20 days and not just with the mother  and her daughter who are locked up there. They fled persecution by a  drug gang--a gang that was extorting the family to make payments from  their beauty supply business or beauty parlor. When she couldn't pay,  the gang came to her house and assaulted her daughter. She told us they  fled the next day.    We need to improve the programs with which we are trying to help  stabilize those countries and help decrease the power of those drug  gangs, but, certainly, when those fleeing persecution come here to our  shores, let's treat them with respect and dignity.   This is a birthday card that several dozen Members signed yesterday  that we are sending to this young woman locked up. The card says:  ``Feliz Quinceanera.'' It is signed inside by dozens of Senators. It  says: From your friends in the Senate of the United States. We want her  to know--we want every child who is locked up in these child prisons  under the Trump war on children to know that we are working to end this  war.   We went on to Tornillo--the child prison that was initially  established to be an emergency shelter for 1 month for 450 children. It  has now been extended 3 times, and it has been expanded to hold not 450  children but 3,800 children.   At this moment, they cranked up the number of people there to 2,700,  and they are purposely keeping this as a ``temporary shelter'' so they  can bypass all the laws related to incarcerating children; they can  bypass the requirements for education; they can bypass the Flores 20- day standard.   I asked: How many children are here over 20 days of these 2,700, a  couple of dozen?   The director said: No, more than 2,000 of the 2,700 children here are  over the 20 days. Then we were told that 1,300 of those children  already have a sponsor. They already have the sponsors who have filled  out all the paperwork and have done their fingerprints and everything.  They could be released immediately, if the administration would  complete the paperwork.   He told us that 1,300 children could be in homes and schools and  parks in 5 to 7 days from now if the administration would complete the  paperwork. We proceeded to hold a press conference, and we said this is  unacceptable that the paperwork is not being completed and these  children are being locked up here.   We held this on Saturday. We said this Tornillo prison camp should be  shut down. This is not the spirit of the USA and certainly is not being  used as a temporary shelter for 1 month.   I have good news to report because yesterday the administration said  they are changing the rules. They expect to release several thousand  children within the next few days--that is the right thing to do--and  we may shut down Tornillo.   So let's keep the attention of America on this. Let's keep the  spotlight on it. Let's not let this war on children continue with our  money, on our territory, under our government, deliberately inflicting  trauma on children. It must end.   The Family Case Management Program, which was an alternative to  locking people up, had a report from the Department of Homeland  Security inspector general who said 99 percent of people show up for  their check-ins and there was 100 percent attendance at court hearings.  There was a closeout report for the program because the administration  shut it down, and the closeout report called the program a success. It  said 99.3 percent attendance for court proceedings overall, 99 percent  compliance with monitoring requirements, including check-ins, and it  costs $38 a day compared to many hundreds of dollars for internment  camps or prison camps.   Let's restart a program that made sense--a program that worked. We  have seen this series of attacks on children--child separation, family  internment camps, child prison camps. Let's put America back on track  and treat children coming to this country fleeing persecution with  respect and dignity as they await their asylum hearings.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor with my  colleagues from Massachusetts and Delaware to address the grave threat  to America and to our planet from carbon pollution and climate chaos.   Over the last 2 weeks, representatives from nearly 200 countries have  gathered together in Poland to continue the fight against climate  chaos. They know that in each and every country we are seeing the  impacts across this planet. There are more powerful hurricanes, like we  have seen here in the United States, more destructive wildfires, like  those we see in the Northwest of the United States, record breaking  heat waves, air quality deterioration, loss of glaciers, loss of global  ice, Arctic ice, insect-borne diseases that spread, and coral reefs  dying. We are in trouble.   The scientists tell us we are now driving the sixth great extinction  on planet Earth. It is being driven by human conduct, and a big factor  in that is our burning of fossil fuels. We are, in fact, facing the  greatest threat humankind has known on the planet. When you begin to  damage your own home, you really are in a situation that needs to be  immediately addressed.   It was back in 1959 that Edward Teller, a famed scientist, gave a  speech to the 100th anniversary of the petroleum industry. He said:  This energy that you have unleashed has done amazing things on the  planet. It has given so much ability for humankind to magnify their  efforts.   There was a lot of positive in that, but then the scientist, Edward  Teller, went on to say: But there are a couple of challenges here, one  of which is that there are only so many fossil fuels in the ground and  so, at some point, we will run out.   Of course, we know that there are a lot more fossil fuels in the  ground now than we knew about in 1959.   He said that there is a second problem. When you burn this stuff, it  creates an invisible, odorless gas. So it doesn't really sound like a  challenge, but it traps heat. He said that because it traps heat, it  will melt the poles, it will raise the oceans, and that will be a  problem for humankind because humankind lives along the waterways.   He didn't go into more details than that, but it was one of the first  direct commentaries--in 1959--about how the age of fossil fuels was  going to produce significant problems for human kind.   Now, that speech he gave in 1959. That was 59 years ago, and what  have we seen in the ensuing period? We have seen a roughly 100-point  increase in carbon pollution on the planet. Or to take my lifetime, for  example, in 1956, when I was born, we had about 312 parts per million  of carbon.   I will just put this chart up. What we see here on the red is the  rising line of carbon, going back to roughly when I was born. About in  here, 1956 until now, we see that it is accelerating, but essentially  there is a 100 parts-per-million increase. We started at about 312 when  I was born. We are at about almost 412 now at the very peak. That is a  30-percent increase in my single lifetime, just a little flash of time  in terms of the life of this planet--a 32-percent increase in carbon in  the atmosphere, and it is having a significant impact.   The most obvious way to look at this impact is the global temperature  year after year. So here we see the 10 hottest years on record. We see  that only one of those years, 1998, was before the turn of the century.  The rest of them have all been since the turn of the century. In fact,  17 of the 18 hottest years on record have occurred since the year 2000.  Not only that, but look at the dramatic, dramatic change for 2014, and  2015, and 2016, and 2017--these last four years--and how much hotter  the planet is than it was just a few years before. That should trouble  all of us.   We have seen all of this when global leaders came together in 2015 in  Paris--the largest gathering of world leaders in human history. They  said we have to put limits on what we are doing. We all have to apply a  strategy of each reducing our carbon dioxide production. I would like  to say that they have been successful, but they have not. Total global  carbon production is still going up and, because of that, we are still  in deep trouble.   If we didn't have the information just from these bars of the hottest  years on record, we could turn to a more complicated analysis, or  several of them, that have come out just recently. Just back in  October, we had the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, bringing  the work of scientists across  [[Page S7880]]  the planet together, and it painted a very stark picture of where we  are right now and how this will only get a lot worse in the years  ahead.   Or we can turn to the Trump administration's report that came out the  day after Thanksgiving. On Thanksgiving, we give thanks for a lot of  things. The day after, the administration informed us that we here on  the planet have a big problem. What did they say in that report? Again,  this is the Trump administration speaking: ``Earth's climate is now  changing faster than at any point in the history of modern  civilization, primarily as a result of human activities.''   Or we could turn to a third report that just came out called the  ``Global Carbon Project,'' and it says that after plateauing for  several years, in 2018, global carbon emissions rose 2.7 percent. So we  are back on an upward trajectory. We hit a recordbreaking 37 billion  metric tons.   How did the United States do? Well, similarly, our carbon emissions  here in the United States went up about 2.5 percent.   Over the last 2 years, the Trump administration has tried to do  everything it can to make the situation worse. There were rules in  place to cut methane leaks because methane is much more of a potent  global warming gas than is carbon dioxide. So you never want to let it  out of the pipe. But they worked to weaken those rules. They worked to  weaken vehicle emission standards so we get more pollution for each  mile, rather than less pollution.   I did find one thing of interest; that is, when Judith Garber, the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International  Environmental and Scientific Affairs, went over to Poland to give a  report for the United States. She bragged about our carbon capture  utilization and storage technology, and how one powerplant in Texas is  capturing more than 90 percent of the emissions from its blue gas  stream. So she was holding this up as a vision of what the United  States is doing to contribute to the technology in the world and to  help things be better.   What she didn't say is, the previous week, on December 6, the Trump  administration issued a draft rule exempting new powerplants from  carbon capture. That would have been a much more complete story about  the record of this administration.   Of the 20 nations represented at the recent G20 summit in Argentina,  only the United States refused to sign a nonbinding statement saying  countries were committed to fighting climate chaos. All we had to do is  say, yes, we are aware it is a problem, and we are committed to  fighting it, but the United States turned that down. Over in Poland, we  joined with Russia and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait--three oil-rich  nations--to weaken a statement recognizing the international report  about the challenges we face.   We need global leadership. Without our help, countries still came  together in Poland to write a rule book to try to go forward without  the involvement and leadership of the United States. They worked very  hard on that rule book, and it addressed things like transparency and  accountability; it addressed issues related to carbon credits; it  addressed issues that were designed to develop a strategy for technical  experts and exactly how you count carbon in your country. It wasn't a  perfect rule book, but we now have one, and we can make improvements on  it in the future.   Think about how much faster we would go forward in tackling this  problem if we had American leadership. We need this leadership. The  world needs this leadership to tackle climate chaos. It is not  something you can do just as good a job 10 years or 20 years from now  as you can now because you can't get this carbon out of the atmosphere  easily once it is in there. It stays for hundreds of years. It keeps  adding to the trapping of heat for hundreds of years. We need to act  now.   We are facing the big challenge of feedback loops. What do I mean? Up  in the Arctic, when you have less ice, you have blue ocean, the  sunshine goes into the water, and it heats it up more than if it were  reflecting off ice. So it gets warmer and warmer and warmer.   How about this? Just a couple weeks ago, a picture was published of a  lake in Alaska that was boiling--not with heat, but with methane;  methane bubbling up out of the permafrost underneath the lake at such a  rapid pace, it was a heavy boiling motion on the top of the water. That  is a feedback loop that should scare us all because of the enormous  heat-trapping properties of methane. All across the planet, as it gets  warmer, permafrost and heat start off-gassing this methane.   So there we are. We have to move fast. We need American leadership to  be fully engaged in the vision of Mission 100, going to 100 percent  clean and renewable energy in the fastest possible time. We have to  quit subsidizing fossil fuels and start subsidizing renewable energy or  at least put them on a level playing field with each other. We need a  green new deal to completely rebuild our energy economy in the United  States of America and create all kinds of jobs--all kinds of working  American jobs: sheet metal jobs, electrician jobs, pipefitting jobs,  jobs of every kind--as we rework the energy economy to build that  vision of 100 percent renewable energy. Think how many jobs you would  create if you just proceeded to renovate your house. Now think of the  tens of millions of jobs if you renovate the entire energy economy of  the United States of America.   We need American leadership to work in partnership with other nations  so every nation holds each other accountable to this vision of  transitioning to renewable energy.   We need American leadership to say to Germany: Yes, you have done  some things very well on solar, but why are you building a Nord Stream  2 pipeline to bring massive amounts of natural gas from Russia for the  next-generation dependence on fossil fuel?   We need to say to Japan: You are putting your entire energy economy  onto liquid natural gas. How can you meet your Paris obligations? How  can you be a partner with the rest of the world if you are not willing  to pursue renewable energy?   We need leadership in America that says to Australia: You are  doubling down on coal while your outback is burning in the middle of  your winter, and your Great Barrier Reef is half dead over the last  couple of years from water that is too warm and too acidic due to  climate chaos.   We need American leadership to tell China: Yes, you are investing in  renewable energy at home. Great. Speed it up, but why are you financing  200 coal-powered plants around the world? That is not acceptable. Shut  that down.   We have to have American leadership. This is not a question between  economic development and the environment. Quite the contrary. In this  case, renovating our energy economy creates a strong environment. It  allows us to go to the cheapest form of energy on the planet, solar and  wind.   Why is it the cheapest? Because there is no fuel. The fuel for solar  is the Sun. We don't have to pay for that. The fuel for wind are the  breezes that blow. We don't have to pay for that. In fact, just a few  months ago Xcel Energy did a request for proposals for new electric  generating capacity, and it came out at 2 cents per kilowatt hour for  solar and 3 cents for wind. That is less than burning coal in an  existing fossil fuel plant.   If you believe nothing about the damage to our planet because it is  just too terrifying, and you don't want to hear that bad news, then at  least turn to the economic opportunity of taking America forward to the  cheapest, cleanest energy we can possibly have.   Wells Griffith, the administration's top adviser cop, said: ``We  strongly believe that no country should have to sacrifice economic  prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental  sustainability.'' That is the big lie. That is the big Koch brothers  lie to the planet; that somehow we must sacrifice our economy in order  to pursue cleaner energy, when in fact the opposite is true.   American leadership has helped take the world forward in all kinds of  technology. Some of those famous moments was our leadership in  splitting the atom and creating atomic energy, putting a man on the  Moon, creating the internet, taking on significant diseases, and  leading the world in wiping them out--diseases like polio. We need that  kind of leadership today, leadership to work in partnership with the  world to save our planet.   I yield to my colleague from Florida.    I appreciate so much the comments of my colleague from  Florida.   I had the chance to go down to Florida at the end of October at a  rally to address the challenge of red tide, algae that was growing in  the ocean that produces a toxin. The toxin is so powerful that it was  causing a lot of respiratory problems for people who live along the  gulf coast, and it was killing a lot of animals. People were talking  about manatees, dolphins, turtles, and fish washing up on the beach.  Not only did they have the toxins from the red algae, but they had the  stench from the dying sea life.   The sense of people who gathered to talk about this was that dramatic  action is needed; that this was completely compromising the quality of  life, the health of the oceans, and the ability to harvest food out of  the ocean. People were saying they were actually taking inland  vacations; that is, leaving the coast until the air would get better.  They said that, unfortunately, the circumstances had been in that bad  condition for 10 months of the last 12 months--meaning they might not  actually want to go back, at least not keep a home there.   I thought of the parallel from your State in Florida to my State in  Oregon because we have an area in Southern Oregon that has been deeply  afflicted by fire smoke the last two summers. The smoke has tainted  furniture being sold. It has shut down outdoor events. It has stopped  people from hiking the Cascade Trail. It is affecting the economy.  House prices are changing. People are thinking twice about booking  for--there is a different set of economic impacts. These are only the  indirect impacts.   There is the direct impact on the Panhandle of Florida. I just saw  the pictures of complete devastation when the hurricane came across  earlier this year. Of course, we saw the pictures of complete  devastation for some of the communities that the forest fires on the  West Coast burned to a crisp.   So our two States and our citizens know there is a problem. Not  everyone wants to face the underlying cause of methane and carbon  pollution driving it, but everybody knows there is a problem.   We are fortunate to have your scientists--your NOAA scientists, your  NASA scientists--and all the satellite information they are feeding us  so we can study it and stand on the floor of the Senate and say: We do  know the cause, and it is our responsibility as leaders of this Nation,  leaders in the Senate, to proceed to make sure we act aggressively in  partnership with the world.   I just want to say I thank you so much for your service in this  Chamber and your knowledge about the scientific facts and willingness  to never look away from them and to confront what those facts mean for  the policies we need to adopt.
