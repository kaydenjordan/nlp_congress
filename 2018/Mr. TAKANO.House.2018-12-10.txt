 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the House amendment to S.  2248, the Veterans Benefit and Transition Act of 2018. This bipartisan  measure contains legislation championed by my House and Senate  colleagues on both sides of the aisle and is a testament to the  bipartisan relationships we cultivate and preserve on both the House  and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees.   I thank Chairman Roe and all members of the House and Senate  Veterans' Affairs Committees, both Democrats and Republicans, for their  hard work putting together this legislative package that will improve  the benefits and support our country owes America's veterans.   I want to specifically acknowledge my Democratic colleagues, Ranking  Member Walz, now Governor-elect of Minnesota--and, yes, Chairman Roe,  it is very cold there--Congressman Scott Peters, Congressman Correa,  Congresswoman Pingree, Congressman Himes, and Congresswoman Bustos, who  have made valuable contributions to this legislation.   I would also like to take this time to thank Dr. Roe for his  leadership as chairman of this committee in this Congress. I look  forward to working with Dr. Roe as ranking member of the 116th Congress  so that we can continue to function as a productive committee in the  116th, free from partisan gridlock, on behalf of the veterans whom we  represent.   Now, as a former teacher--actually, a current teacher--and advocate  for improving educational and training opportunities for veterans, I am  pleased this legislation contains several provisions written by my  colleagues that will improve the lives of our student veterans and  those of our Gold Star spouses.   This package also includes a provision that helps our reservists and  National Guard members access the valuable help that the vocational  rehabilitation program can provide.   I would first like to highlight legislation written by Mr. Peters,  our colleague on this committee. This measure contains his bill, H.R.  5538, that would provide parity to our National Guard and Reserve  servicemembers involuntarily mobilized to Active Duty under 12304b of  title 10 in support of commands that conduct combat missions.   As our country continues to utilize our Guard and Reserve members as  an operational reserve force, it is critically important that we  modernize our statutes to treat our Guard and Reserve members who have  served shoulder to shoulder with Active-Duty servicemembers on multiple  deployments with parity while they serve in uniform.   This bill allows Guard and Reserve members to stop the clock on the  12-year limit to use vocational rehabilitation programs while they are  supporting active combat missions. Currently, the clock is stopped for  most other instances in which National Guard and Reserve are mobilized,  but this particular authority was overlooked.   This is an important fix because the Department of Defense continues  to increase the use of its 12304b authority. With this provision,  Congress has the authority to be proactive in addressing the needs of  our servicemembers.   Now, let me turn to Congressman Himes' bill, H.R. 3634, the Securing  Electronic Records for Veterans' Ease Act of 2017. It is included in  this measure as well.   For student veterans, the VA does not currently provide sufficient  information about the exact amount of housing stipend that a  beneficiary will receive under the GI Bill benefits; but many veterans  rely on their housing stipend to pay for housing while they are  attending school, making it necessary for them to show proof of their  housing allowance as proof of income. Without this proof of income,  veterans often find themselves unable to secure housing before the  start of school.   Now, this is a commonsense piece of documentation that VA can  electronically provide to allow our veterans to easily use their earned  benefits, and I am pleased this great idea by Congressman Himes was  included in this package.   Congresswoman Bustos' legislation, H.R. 5882, the Gold Star Spouses  Leasing Relief Act, would allow the spouse of a deceased servicemember  to terminate a housing lease following the death of his or her loved  one.   Servicemembers and their families are often stationed far from home  due to the needs of the service. In the sad and difficult time after  the passing of a servicemember, spouses should not be locked into a  rental lease far away from their home and support network and face an  additional financial burden to return home.   This small detail can make life a lot easier for a grieving spouse,  and I am pleased to see my colleague's bill included in this package.   Congressman Lou Correa, our colleague on this committee, introduced  H.R. 4335, the Servicemember Family Burial Act, which makes permanent  VA's practice of providing burials and headstones for the family of  servicemembers who predecease them.    When an Active-Duty servicemember loses a spouse or a child, it is  always in tragic and difficult circumstances. VA should continue to  seamlessly provide this benefit with dignity, sensitivity, and  compassion.   I want to thank Congressman Correa for sponsoring this legislation,  and I am pleased to see it included in this measure.   I also wish to highlight legislation written by Congresswoman  Pingree, the Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act of 2017, which is included  in this legislative package.   The American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed  Veterans of America, the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, and  the Veterans of Foreign Wars testified before our committee that the  debt collection letters VA sends veterans are confusing, do not clearly  explain the reason for the debt or clearly describe the steps a veteran  must take to dispute or mitigate the debt.   This legislation would require VA to explain the reason the veteran  incurred a debt in plain language and clearly explain the steps they  can take to dispute or repay the debt.   It would also require VA to give veterans the option to opt-in to  electronic notification and require VA to determine the number of  veterans who are not receiving debt notification letters due to  incorrect addresses on file, which prevents veterans from taking action  because they have not been notified. This legislation forces VA to make  these changes within 90 days of enactment.   Finally, I wish to thank my good friend, Ranking Member Tim Walz, for  his leadership on this committee during the 115th Congress. The  Governor-elect of Minnesota leaves the United States House of  Representatives with a legacy of bipartisan legislative accomplishments  that will undoubtedly improve the lives of veterans for years to come.   I want to thank Chairman Roe and our Senate colleagues for including  his bill, H.R. 4245, the Veterans' Electronic Health Record  Modernization Oversight Act of 2017, in this measure, enabling this  committee to continue its oversight of the $16 billion Electronic  Health Record Modernization, or EHRM, program over the next 10 years.  [[Page H9800]]    Mr. Speaker, I say to the gentleman, Chairman Roe, we are going to do  intensive oversight of this project; I guarantee you that.   This legislation requires the VA to submit contract, technical, and  other documents to Congress and to provide updated documents on a  quarterly basis.   The legislation also requires VA to notify Congress about program  challenges, including incidents affecting patient safety, cost overruns  over $1 million, and a milestone delay of 30 days or more, bid  protests, or a data or privacy breach.   Now, we know that we will likely need to expand these reporting  requirements in the future to include other contract and technical  documents as the program matures and additional technical capabilities  are achieved. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the next  Congress to ensure that we maintain close oversight of this program and  hold VA accountable, if necessary.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the House amendment to  S. 2248, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa), my colleague, my good friend and fellow  Californian, and member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Maine (Ms. Pingree), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes), my good friend and also a member of the House  Intelligence Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.   I want to urge all my colleagues to join me in passing this important  legislation, S. 2248. I want to announce my intention to work with Mr.  Roe, my colleague from Tennessee, in the next Congress, that we will  preserve the sacred bipartisan space that we have here for America's  veterans in the Veterans' Affairs Committee. We have so much more to  do, and I hope it lays the groundwork for this Congress to continue to  heal and reach out to each other and serve America as well as our  veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1730
