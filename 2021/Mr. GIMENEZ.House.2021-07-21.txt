 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the freedom  fighters in Cuba and against communism, the very system of social,  political, and economic oppression that  [[Page H3798]]  has brought misery, poverty, and death to the Cuban people.   As the struggle of the Cuban people continues, I am calling on  President Biden and his administration to take decisive measures in  support of the Cuban protestors.   Specifically, I am calling on him to: condemn the communist Cuban  regime for their decades of oppression; condemn the communist Cuban  regime for any acts of violence against peaceful protestors; condemn  the evils of communism that have led to misery, poverty, and stifled  basic and fundamental human rights; support the mission of the  protesters in Cuba, which includes establishing free and democratic  elections, releasing all political prisoners, and establishing a free  and independent press; and commit to the United States continuing its  policy of maximum pressure on the communist Cuban regime until  fundamental democratic reforms take hold.   On a personal note, I immigrated to this country with my family when  I was a young boy, just 6 years old. I lived through the indoctrination  curriculum in elementary school. I witnessed my birth country crumble  to the woes of communism. Luckily, my family and I had the opportunity  to immigrate to this great country.   In just one generation, my family went from Cuba to Congress. I  believe with all my heart and soul that in no other country in the  world is that achievement possible.   I am heartened to see my fellow Cubans on the island wave the symbol  of freedom, our American flag, as they demand the same freedoms that we  take for granted.   For that reason, I will always stand firmly on the side of all who  yearn for freedom and democracy.
