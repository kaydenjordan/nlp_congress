 Mr. Speaker, today marks 50 years since  President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a bill into law officially  establishing the National Park Foundation.   The National Park Foundation works to enrich America's national parks  and programs, safeguard our heritage, and engage the next generation of  national park enthusiasts.   Celebrating 50 years, the National Park Foundation is the official  charity of America's national parks and nonprofit partner to the  National Park Service.   Chartered by Congress in 1967, the National Park Foundation raises  private funds to help protect more than 84 million acres of national  parks through critical conservation and preservation efforts. It works  to connect all Americans with their incomparable natural landscapes,  vibrant culture, and rich history. And, the National Park Foundation  helps to engage the next generation of park stewards.   In 2016, we proudly commemorated the National Park Service's 100th  anniversary. The National Park Foundation launched the Centennial  Campaign for America's national parks, a comprehensive effort to  strengthen and enhance the future of our parks.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly thank the National Park Foundation for  all that it does to support our national treasures for another 100  years.   Congratulations.                            ____________________
