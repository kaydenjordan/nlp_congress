 Madam Speaker, because of the tax cuts passed by  congressional Republicans and signed by President Trump, small-business  owners in Montana are expanding their businesses and giving raises and  bonuses to their employees.   An insurance broker in Harlem is giving a pay raise to all of his  employees and hiring another staff member. A small business in  Stevensville is giving pay raises to all of their employees, and a  local grocery store owner in St. Ignatius is giving employees a raise,  increasing the starting wage, and providing his workers with a bonus.   The leader on the other side of the aisle may deride these bonuses,  raises, and investments as crumbs, but they make a real difference to  the folks I represent back in Montana. I look forward to sharing more  good news about how the tax cuts congressional Republicans and  President Trump enacted last year are benefiting Montana.                            ____________________
