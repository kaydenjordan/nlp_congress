 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize a great  American, a man whose accomplishments during the 20th and 21st  centuries are legend already.   Senator Robert Dole was a war hero who fought against Nazi forces in  the horrific battles on the Italian front and was gravely wounded.  Following the 20th century's Allied victory against tyranny, he went on  to serve as one of America's finest statesmen. He was strong, faithful,  honest, and indefatigable.   My friendship with Senator Dole was forged during the 17-year quest  to secure a fitting World War II memorial here in our Nation's Capitol  that honors the 16 million Americans who put it all on the line when  the world needed them most.   Our Nation needs leaders like Bob Dole today. He understood that  extreme partisanship could not bring about the common good. Instead, we  must work together to deliver the promises of the American Dream.   He left us with this wise advice: ``America needs unity to rediscover  its greatness.''   Godspeed, Senator Dole. You will be greatly missed and remembered  always.                            ____________________
