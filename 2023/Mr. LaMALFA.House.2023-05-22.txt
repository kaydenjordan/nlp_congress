 Mr. Speaker, our government was founded on the principle  of rule by the people's elected Representatives, indeed, a Republic.   The principle guided our Nation for many years and allowed the United  States to become first among nations. Sadly, the uncontrolled growth of  the Federal bureaucracy has usurped our constitutional foundation.   Instead of rule by elected Representatives, Americans are mostly  ruled by bureaucrats. Federal bureaucrats and agencies, with the aid of  activist judges, have successfully subverted many of our freedoms and  the God-given rights of Americans found in the Constitution.   Almost every bill in the Bill of Rights has been successfully  curtailed or subordinated to the wishes and desires of unelected,  faceless bureaucrats.   Our Founders did not intend for the citizens of the Nation to be  ruled by rubber-stamped decrees from agencies like the EPA or the ATF.   To add insult to injury, although we do have a mix of good people  that are there, they are often outstripped by those that don't seem to  care about what real people deal with. Their decrees often make no  sense and do nothing more than make a headache for people trying to do  basic, everyday things.   The Endangered Species Act, I remind you, does not trump the Bill of  Rights or the U.S. Constitution. We need to take our powers back.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 228.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is really a pleasure to serve with  Chairman Newhouse on the Western Caucus as well as in other capacities  here in the U.S. House.   Indeed, he has really invigorated the effort that the caucus is  making on having these key issues on all manner of things, not just  western but really, for the whole country, having so much to do with  resources and such.   As we contemplate here tonight what the Endangered Species Act's  original intention 50 years ago was when passed by Congress, and  really, for those of us in production, agriculture, energy, minerals,  just about anything that uses the basic building blocks of the economy  and the things that our modern society needs, the Endangered Species  Act has been weaponized against that.   What it has turned into now due to activism in the courts, the  endless lawsuits and the way the courts reinterpret things is nothing  close to what Congress would have passed back in the early 1970s.   Had they passed that, I think they would have been ridden out of town  on a rail because it was so destructive toward the cornerstones of our  economy and what has made America strong and independent in so many  areas.   We agree with the purpose originally. It is to protect and recover  vulnerable species. I think the focus at the time, really, was on the  bald eagle with expansion from there to many other species that we deem  valuable.   The world has well over a million species in it, and they are  discovering more all the time; a lot of it in the insect world and  such.   To think that we are going to just completely move all human beings,  especially Americans, into caves or something like that and say we  can't affect the environment or touch it in any way is really  unrealistic. Mankind has a piece in the world as well. That is even a  biblical truth.   The Endangered Species Act, what it has turned into, is really  harming the ability for people to get what they need.   Also, the focus hasn't really been on recovering species, which I  think was well intended, because we have heard my colleagues talk about  the ratio here of recovery. It is extremely low, especially if you put  a ratio of dollars spent and pain inflicted on agriculture, on mining,  on domestically produced products versus the number of species  recovered. It is way out of whack.   You heard my colleague from Minnesota a minute ago talking about the  recovery of the wolves. They have an incredible number of wolves in the  upper Midwest, but the ESA can be misinterpreted and misused and abused  to say we need to have wolves everywhere: in Oregon, in California, in  Washington.   For that matter, should we introduce them into the Golden Gate Park  and the Santa Monica Pier to make sure they have their share as well?   If you want to see a wolf, you are still going to be able to see a  wolf in the areas where they have been more indigenous for a long time,  and they have successfully recovered.                                time  2110    This is what we put up with. They introduce them in areas where now  livestock and people making a living in rural areas in Wyoming,  Montana, northeast California, and Oregon have to suffer with the  ideology of just introducing them everywhere and saying this is now  going to make them not on the list anymore.   In my northern California area, for example, we had very important  levee projects needed to be done for flood control around the north  central area of Sacramento Valley, places like Hamilton City, Yuba  City, Marysville, Sacramento, areas like that.   Well, they seemed to shop for a species du jour to stop projects, and  what they settled on was the valley elderberry longhorn beetle, which  not that many years ago U.S. Fish and Wildlife actually recommended for  it to be delisted. In the meantime, however, they won't make a decision  and take it off the list.   Now, mind you, you don't even find the beetle in some of these areas,  but because the habitat for it exists in some of these areas, the law  has been interpreted to be, well, if there is habitat there, if there  is an elderberry bush and a beetle might come along and land in it or  dwell in it, we have to leave that bush there. If you take that bush  out in order to redo a levee, then we have to plant 50 or 70 more  bushes somewhere else.   In one case here, we had to take out a couple hundred acres of  orchard land  [[Page H2497]]  to have this mitigation area because they wanted to fix the dang levee  that was already in existence and keep a town from flooding at the next  rain because they are not maintaining the river in between the levee  banks from all the siltation and such going on there. But that starts  another whole narrative.   The beetle doesn't get delisted, and the levee work doesn't get done  farther south in the Yuba City-Marysville area. This was going on 20,  30 years ago. A lot of great work has been done since then, but it has  been made much more expensive and much more arduous because of the  threat of lawsuit and the ESA.   I will remind you that years ago lives were lost and hundreds of  millions of dollars of damage were done by a levee blowing out in that  southern area of my district in Yuba City-Marysville on the Marysville  side. With all that damage, three lives were lost, and finally the  State of California lost a lawsuit for, I think, $400 million because  they were derelict in doing the work to maintain the levees, all  because of this.   What I am talking about here as well is the ability to keep food on  the table. This chart I have shows that California is responsible for,  in some of these crops, 100 percent, well above 90 percent of the crops  that Americans consume that come primarily from California.   We have the ESA stopping us from keeping farmland safe from floods  but, also, at the same time building the water storage projects that  are important to store water. Now, we were blessed this year with a  tremendous amount of rain and snowpack, and we are really happy about  it, but that doesn't happen every year. That is why we build these  long-term water projects that store water for 5 years of drought, like  Shasta Lake, Lake Oroville, and others. If we don't have those  projects, we don't ride through that time.   They try to stop those projects from being further built, and they  also seek to tear down projects like the Klamath dams, make  hydroelectric green power with no CO2. Much work needs to be  done to keep crops on the table, to keep the electricity and the wires,  keep the minerals coming to produce all the things we need to keep  energy, all of that. The ESA needs to be revisited and actually focused  on truly recovering species but not used as a weapon to stop things  people need, our economies need, rural economies especially. That is  some of the work we do in the Western Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate, again, Chairman Newhouse's leadership on  this and the opportunity to speak on it here tonight. There is much  more that I could say; you know me.    Mr. Speaker, I am a farmer in my real life. I hope I  talk plainly enough to get my thoughts across.
