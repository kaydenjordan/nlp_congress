 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the need for  bipartisan immigration reform.   Until Congress addresses our broken immigration system; secures our  border; provides a pathway for people who have been here a long time to  be able to eventually earn full citizenship; and provides a way for  people who are here illegally and required to register, get right with  the law, and get in line behind those who have come legally, it will  remain a problem in cities and communities across our entire country.   There has been a failure of leadership in this body, the United  States Congress, to actually address our broken immigration system.  There has been a failure from both sides to provide a pathway forward  for a problem that only Congress can solve, and that will only get  larger until we take it up here.   Last week, I visited the ICE detention facility in Aurora, Colorado.  I witnessed and talked to family members and mothers who had been taken  away from their American children over something as minor as a speeding  ticket.   We can, and we must, do better as a nation. We need an immigration  system that reflects that we are both a nation of laws and a nation of  immigrants. I call upon my Republican and Democratic colleagues to work  together to achieve this end.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule for providing debate on  the National Defense Authorization Act, often called the NDAA, and also  the  [[Page H5446]]  Gaining Responsibility on Water Act. First let me address that act.   They tried to create an acronym called the GROW Act, Gaining  Responsibility on Water, trying to make it seem like it actually might  help things grow, when it actually picks winners and losers in water-- and the losers are the environment, the State of California, and many  others.   There are also a lot of problems around the process for the GROW Act.  It bypassed hearings and markups. In fact, up until this bill was  published on the Rules Committee website, only lobbyists and a few  Republicans even knew what many of the provisions in this bill were.  This kind of backroom dealmaking is one of the reasons the general  public holds Congress in such low esteem.   There is an immense amount of opposition to this legislation,  including from conservation groups, fishing groups, Native American  Tribes, and the State of California.   Mr. Speaker, I have several letters that I include in the Record in  regard to opposition to H.R. 23. One of the letters is signed by groups  ranging from the American Bird Conservancy to the Animal Welfare  Institute, to the Humane Society and a number of others, discussing how  this bill would dramatically weaken protections for salmon, birds, and  other fish and wildlife.   Another letter that I include in the Record is from a former  colleague of ours, now the attorney general of the State of California,  Xavier Becerra, and, finally, a letter from the Governor of California  as well.                           Please Oppose H.R. 23                                                      July 11, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the undersigned       organizations, we write to urge you to oppose H.R. 23       (Valadao, R-CA). This bill would dramatically weaken       protections for salmon, migratory birds, and other fish and       wildlife in California's Bay-Delta watershed and would       threaten thousands of fishing jobs in California and Oregon       that depend on the health of these species. In addition to       gutting critical federal environmental protections in       California, H.R. 23 also preempts a wide range of state       environmental laws and would prevent the State of California       from protecting and managing its own water and wildlife       resources. In addition to these provisions focused on       California, the bill also includes titles that would reduce       public and environmental reviews of new dams and water       infrastructure across the Western states. Both the Obama       Administration and the State of California opposed similar       legislation in recent years, including opposition to H.R.       3964 (Valadao, R-CA) and H.R. 5781 (Valadao, R-CA) in 2014,       and H.R. 2898 (Valadao, R-CA) in 2015.        California has just emerged from a devastating drought, and       the state is taking proactive steps to protect cities, farms,       and the environment from future dry spells. However, several       provisions in H.R. 23 would undermine California's efforts by       permanently preempting critical state laws that protect       salmon and other native fisheries and the jobs they support.       In addition, this legislation would effectively repeal and       preempt state and federal laws and a binding settlement       agreement that require restoration of the San Joaquin River       and its native salmon runs, instead permanently drying up 60       miles of California's second longest river. H.R. 23 not only       preempts state law as applied to federal water projects in       California, but it also preempts the application of state       laws to the State Water Project and virtually all water       rights holders in California's Bay-Delta watershed. This       extensive preemption of state law in H.R. 23 is contrary to       over a hundred years of Reclamation law and would set a       dangerous precedent for other Western states.        H.R. 23 would also override the Endangered Species Act,       increasing the risk that winter-run Chinook salmon and other       native fish species are driven extinct. Further, H.R. 23       could devastate wildlife refuges that provide habitat for       millions of birds that migrate along the Pacific Flyway by       undermining the refuges' water rights and threatening       critically important funding sources. H.R. 23 would also       eviscerate the 1992 Central Valley Project Improvement Act,       eliminating instream flows to benefit salmon and funding for       habitat restoration projects, which help to mitigate the       adverse effects of the Central Valley Project. The impacts       from these provisions would reverberate along the entire West       Coast, affecting fishing jobs and related industries in       Oregon and Washington that depend on salmon from California's       Central Valley and threatening populations of waterfowl and       shorebirds that migrate to and from Alaska and Canada each       year.        In addition to these provisions focused on gutting       environmental protections in California, H.R. 23 also       includes several titles that would weaken the public's right       to know and environmental protection across the western       United States. For instance, the bill's dam permitting       provisions would give the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation       unprecedented control over the environmental review process       and could undermine the ability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife       Service and N.O.A.A. Fisheries to share expertise and inform       the development of major infrastructure investments. These       provisions would make it difficult, if not impossible, for       responsible agencies to meaningfully analyze proposed       projects and could limit the public's ability to weigh in on       infrastructure that could affect communities for decades.        H.R. 23 has not been the subject of a single committee       hearing to receive public input from the State of California,       hunting organizations, sport and commercial fishermen,       tribes, or conservation groups, even though the bill could       greatly interfere with state water rights and cripple the       ability of state and federal agencies to manage limited water       resources for all beneficial uses. Last year Congress passed       legislation addressing California's water operations in the       Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016       (P.L. 114-322). H.R. 23 would undermine that legislation,       which supporters claim requires that state and federal water       projects are operated in compliance with state law and the       Endangered Species Act.        H.R. 23 also threatens thousands of fishing jobs in       California, Oregon, and beyond that depend on healthy salmon       runs from the Bay-Delta. The closure of the salmon fishery in       2008 and 2009 resulted in thousands of lost jobs in these       states. The livelihoods and recreational interests of salmon       fishermen, Delta farmers, fishing guides, tackle shops, bird       watchers, waterfowl hunters, and communities across       California and along the West Coast depend on the       environmental protections that H.R. 23 would eliminate.        For these reasons, we respectfully urge you to oppose H.R.       23. Thank you for your attention.

Re H.R. 23 (Valadao).      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House Minority Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.         Dear House Speaker Ryan and House Minority Leader Pelosi: I       am writing to express my opposition to H.R. 23, the Gaining       Responsibility on Water Act of 2017. This legislation would       exempt California from the long-standing principle that       Congress should defer to the individual states in the       management of their water resources. While H.R. 23 purports       to affirm state authority to regulate the waters within their       borders as to other western states, the legislation singles       out California by abrogating California water resource law       and effectively federalizing the State's water resource       management to the injury of the State's fish and wildlife       resources.        Like its predecessors H.R. 1873 and H.R. 3964, H.R. 23       would transgress state sovereignty in at least three       important respects. First, the legislation would mandate that       the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) and the California       State Water Project (SWP), the largest water projects in the       State, operate to outdated water quality standards for the       Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta developed over twenty-two years       ago, and would preclude state authorities from altering such       standards notwithstanding the cumulative scientific evidence       that these standards are insufficient to protect the State's       fisheries. Second, the legislation would prohibit the       California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and       the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) from       exercising their state law duties to protect fishery       resources and public trust values, not only as to CVP and SWP       operations, but as to all water right holders in California.       Third, the legislation would overturn settled principles of       cooperative federalism by materially altering the San Joaquin       River Restoration Settlement Act, an act that implements a       settlement reached by the United States, several       environmental organizations, and local water users resolving       a dispute over application of state fishery law to federal       facilities on the San Joaquin River. California supported the       compromise settlement and the implementing legislation and is       a partner in the San Joaquin River Restoration Program.        These proposed constraints on California's ability to       manage its natural resources conflict with historic       principles of western  [[Page H5447]]       water law. In California v. United States (1978) 438 U.S.       645, 654, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed California's       ability to impose state law terms and conditions on federal       reclamation projects, and declared that, ``[t]he history of       the relationship between the Federal government and the       States in the reclamation of the arid lands of the Western       States is both long and involved, but through it runs the       consistent thread of purposeful and continued deference to       state water law by Congress.''        California law grants the SWRCB the continuing authority to       review and reconsider all water rights for the purpose of       determining whether their exercise would violate the       reasonable use requirement of the Article X, Section 2 of the       California constitution and California's common law doctrine       of the public trust. According to the California Supreme       Court, ``[t]he state has an affirmative duty to take the       public trust into account in the planning and allocation of       water resources, and to protect public trust uses whenever       feasible.'' (National Audubon Society v. Superior Court       (1983) 33 Ca1.3d 319, 446.) The California Legislature has       adopted these principles as ``the foundation of state water       management policy.'' (Cal. Wat. Code, 85023.) H.R. 23 would       abrogate California's ability to apply its water resource       laws while purporting to maintain and protect the ability of       other western states to manage their water resources. H.R. 23       provides no explanation as to why California should be       subject to such disparate treatment as to its sovereign       authority to manage its natural resources.        In addition, H.R. 23 takes these steps in violation of       settled constitutional principles of state sovereignty.       Relying upon separation of powers principles set forth in the       Tenth Amendment and elsewhere in the U.S. Constitution, the       U.S. Supreme Court in New York v. United States has held that       ``even where Congress has the authority under the       Constitution to pass laws requiring or prohibiting certain       acts, it lacks the power directly to compel the States to       require or prohibit those acts.'' (New York v. United States       (1992) 505 U.S. 144, 166-167.) In Printz v. United States,       the U.S. Supreme Court expanded its ruling in New York and       held that ``[t]oday we hold that Congress cannot circumvent       that prohibition by conscripting the States' officers       directly.'' (Printz v. United States (1997) 521 U.S. 898,       935.)        By compelling the SWP, a state-funded and managed water       project, to operate based upon congressionally-mandated Delta       water quality standards, rather than allowing California to       develop standards that reflect the most recent scientific       information regarding the Delta, H.R. 23 is ``requiring'' a       state agency to comply with a federal policy. By preventing       the SWRCB, the DFW, and other state agencies from taking       actions to protect fishery and other public trust values,       H.R. 23 is ``prohibiting'' the State from enforcing state       law. These provisions of H.R. 23 violate settled state       sovereignty principles. Congressional passage of H.R. 23       would have, in effect, unconstitutionally ``dragooned'' state       agencies and state officials ``into administering federal       law.'' (Printz, supra, 521 U.S. at p. 928.)        I urge you to oppose H.R. 23. Congress cannot justify the       legislation's disparate treatment of California's sovereign       authority to manage its natural resources and cannot compel       California to act as its regional agent to enforce       congressional policy. I ask that you affirm the long-standing       congressional tradition of cooperative federalism and dual       sovereignty in water and reject H.R. 23's attempt to       federalize water resource management in the California.            Sincerely,                                                    Xavier Becerra,      Attorney General.                                   ____                                           Office of the Governor,                                                      July 10, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: I write to oppose H.R. 23, the ``Gaining       Responsibility on Water Act of 2017.''        Water defines the west and for over a century Congress and       the courts have consistently recognized that state law       determines how water is developed and used. Western states       have successfully resisted any attempted intrusion into this       essential attribute of their sovereignty, including in the       operation or construction of water projects involving the       federal government. This bill overrides California water law,       ignoring our state's prerogative to oversee our waters.       Commandeering our laws for purposes defined in Washington is       not right.        It is also not smart. California is the sixth-largest       economy in the world, and its future depends on the wise and       equitable use of its water. Making decisions requires       listening to and balancing among the needs of California's       nearly 40 million residents and taking into consideration       economics, biodiversity and wildlife resources. All of this       is best done at the state and local level--not in a polarized       political climate 3,000 miles away.        Undermining state law is especially unwise today as       California, with input from all stakeholders, is poised to       make its boldest water infrastructure investments in decades:       funding surface storage, updating an antiquated delta water       conveyance, and adopting water-use efficiency targets.        I ask you to respect California's rights and shelve this       bill.            Sincerely,                                               Edmund G. Brown, Jr.     Mr. Speaker, the only winners under this bill are actually  a few large agricultural producers who will take all the water, leaving  none for many others. This bill is a water grab, plain and simple. The  so-called GROW Act provides no new water, but it takes the existing  water and gives it to those with the best lobbyists here in Washington.   Instead of this highly partisan bill, we should be taking steps to  actually grow the water supply for everybody, with water recycling,  with water conservation, water efficiency, many other nonideological,  nonpartisan fixes, water infrastructure that can actually help deliver  water to small farmers, protect our environment, and, yes, our  legitimate agricultural producers as well.   Unfortunately, instead, we are stuck with this so-called GROW Act,  which jeopardizes fishing jobs, preempts State conservation laws,  overrides the Endangered Species Act for salmon and wildlife, weakens  critical safeguards under the NEPA process, and undermines water  rights. In doing so, this bill would permanently destroy California's  rivers, Bay-Delta Estuary, needed fisheries, and the thousands of jobs  that depend on those natural resources.   This bill is not a balanced protection. It picks winners and losers  and hands over water rights to those who are present for the backroom  deals in Washington.   Let's go back to the drawing board. I come from the State of  Colorado, and we know how important water is. Let's find a way to find  a bipartisan path to grow the water supply across the Western United  States.                                time  1245    Let me address the other bill that is contained in this rule, the  NDAA, National Defense Authorization Act. For 56 straight years, the  United States Congress has come together to craft policies and  recommendations for the United States Armed Forces and to put those  policies into law under the authorizing statute for our military.  Without question, this bill is one of the most consequential and  important items that Congress undertakes each year.   Personally, I have found objections to policies, and I have been a  fan of other policies contained in these bills while I have been in  Congress. And I want to commend the work of my colleagues, Democratic  and Republican, who serve on the Armed Services Committee for their  important work on this legislation so important for our national  security.   Many of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have served or  do serve in our military. Members of the committee are dedicated public  servants, they are experts in their field, they travel and learn and  hear from experts, and they set aside many of their political  differences to do what it takes to keep America safe and secure,  something that Republicans, Democrats, Independents are all committed  to. We need to make sure that we give our military the tools they need  to safely carry out the tasks that the Commander in Chief and elected  officials ask them to undertake.   I commend the committee for putting forth a bill that takes  constructive steps in filling military readiness gaps, requiring  strategies from the administration and the Department of Defense with  regard to contingencies in several countries, and acknowledging and  planning for the real climate change threat that is posed to our  national security.   Yet the work of the NDAA is not limited to members of the Armed  Services Committee. The Members of this body as a whole, Democrats and  Republicans who don't serve on that committee, have submitted over 400  amendments to do what each one of us believes would, in some way,  improve this bill and strengthen our national security.   But the work of NDAA continues, and before this week is over, I  expect to see the Rules Committee make in order an even greater number  of these amendments. We took the first step in this rule by making a  few dozen amendments in order, and we will continue that work in Rules  Committee this afternoon as we thoughtfully go  [[Page H5448]]  through the 400 amendments so a representative number of those from my  Democratic and Republican colleagues who don't have the opportunity to  serve on the Armed Services Committee can present those ideas for  consideration by the full House.   But for all the hard work that the Armed Services Committee has done,  what we have before us this week is essentially an argument that needs  to be solved by the Budget Committee and can't, frankly, be solved by  the authorizing committee.   What we are doing is we are having a very strange debate in this  body. We are having effectively a budget debate within the defense  bill. We are discussing authorization levels, when we know that the  real discussion and battle over tradeoffs will be around the funding  levels, not so much the authorization levels.   One of the tricks that we worry about is by blatantly disregarding  the proper use of the overseas contingency fund and by deliberately  flouting limitations set by the Budget Control Act, this Armed Services  authorization bill has been completely overtaken by the debate on the  Federal budget.   So this week we see a debate about the inability to pass a budget,  adhere to a budget, and balance our budget, and, rather, we are  operating kind of in this lala world of, if we had all the money in the  world, here is what we would do, but as my Democratic and Republican  friends know, we live in a world of tradeoffs, and we as Democrats and  Republicans will need to decide what those tradeoffs are. That is not  being done in this bill, and, in fact, it is one week less that we have  to have those important discussions about how to actually secure  America and protect our country.   If the debate over armed services wasn't such a serious topic, I  would, frankly, give the Republicans kudos for building such an  elaborate and complex budget scheme. It is very clever, more so than  the traditional overseas contingency gimmicks that have been presented  within recent years. It took me a little while to even understand what  this budget gimmick was, and I am going to now seek to explain it.   The Defense spending budget is capped at $549 billion by the Budget  Control Act of 2011. $549 billion is the maximum that would be spent on  defense. This bill authorizes $621 billion as its discretionary base  budget authority. That means that the bill we are debating today goes  $70 billion in spending above the spending caps that Congress agreed  on. That is all deficit spending. That means Congress will increase the  deficit by $70 billion under this bill, but it gets worse.   The United States has been embroiled in conflict abroad since 2001,  and many administrations, Democratic and Republican, have requested  another pot of money that we call the overseas contingency fund. These  funds, as the name indicates, are supposed to be used for paying costs  that are incurred due to U.S. engagement in contingency operations, not  baseline operations. And they are exempt, rightfully so, from the  budget caps, because we never wanted to constrain our ability to  provide funding for an unforeseen contingency situation that becomes a  necessity for our national security.   This year, however, the bill provides for $74 billion for this  overseas contingency fund, a full $10 billion above what was even  requested by the President.   Now, a reminder, the Republicans haven't actually produced a budget  this year, so we can't exactly make a comparison between the  President's budget and the Republican majority's budget. I think one of  the reasons they might be afraid to is they will show substantially  increased deficits with these tax-and-spend Republican policies that  have come to typify the Republican approach to grow our government with  every new spending bill.    What the NDAA does is it takes this overseas contingency account,  which is often called the slush fund for the Pentagon, it adds $10  billion to that fund, but instead of paying for future contingencies,  that will pay for baseline operations. Some of that $10 billion goes to  the unfunded priorities of the Pentagon, things it couldn't quite fit  in the $621 billion, which already increases Federal spending by $70  billion.   So it is just throwing money, Federal money, your taxpayer money, Mr.  Speaker, hand-over-fist, without a plan, indebting future generations  for spending money today. The Pentagon gets more big ticket items they  want.   And, likewise, it is hard to argue with funds being allocated to  operations and maintenance. We are all for maintenance, we are all for  readiness, but we are all for understanding the tradeoffs that we have.  We cannot simply continue to spend irresponsibly, indebting future  generations.   At some level, Mr. Speaker, and I think this kind of throwing  additional money well above and beyond the budget caps reaches that  level, we make our Nation less secure rather than more secure by making  us economically beholden to foreign nations and indebting future  generations of Americans.   Congress has set limits on how much we can spend on defense versus  nondefense. So when we run out of money under this NDAA plan, either we  are going to be forced to spend more, which is what you and I can  predict what will happen, of course that is what is going to happen, or  they are somehow going to find the money elsewhere, which I can pretty  much assure you, Mr. Speaker, is not going to happen. That is a  prediction that I am giving you.   And not having seen a budget, by the way, this is, we think, why  Republicans haven't come up with a budget, because they know they can't  make enough devastating cuts to possibly pay for this military  increase, and they certainly don't want to put their name to paper on  those cuts. And we all know what is going to happen. They won't make  those cuts, spending will go up, debt will go up. I mean, that is what  we know will happen. We have been here before, seen that movie.   Now, again, theoretically, Draconian cuts can be made to schools and  Head Start and NASA and medical research, money fighting the opioid  epidemic, homeland security, police. Yeah, theoretically they can  devastate everything inside of our country, leaving a hollowed-out  core, a well protected hollowed-out core, but I know Republicans aren't  cruel enough to do that. Instead, they are going to kick the can down  the road and indebt future generations and make our country less secure  by borrowing money from China and Saudi Arabia to fund today's  military, making us economically beholden to the very foreign powers  that represent a real geopolitical threat to American interests.   That is why budgets matter, that is why these budget gimmicks that  are being used through the overseas contingency fund matter, and that  is why we need to have a budget debate, not a fake budget debate in the  context of a national defense debate, which is what is being done here  today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego), a distinguished member of the Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in April, President Trump and congressional Republicans  rolled back the FCC's rule to protect Americans' personal information  and their internet browsing history. By doing so, they effectively sold  personal privacy to the highest corporate bidder.   Today is Net Neutrality Day of Action, protesting the FCC's proposal  to end equal access to online content, which would destroy the internet  as we know it. What better day to also protect the future of our  privacy by undoing the Republicans' reckless rollback that placed cable  profits above our privacy and consumer protections.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Rosen's Restoring  American Privacy Act, H.R. 1868. This bill will restore Americans'  privacy protections and tell internet service providers they can't sell  their customers' personal information without the knowledge and consent  of the customers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 5 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Vermont.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill has several other policies I want to address. For one, it  ties our participation in the critical New START with Russia to a  separate Europe-focused treaty that Russia is not in compliance with.   The New START is a nuclear arms reduction treaty between our Nation  and Russia, and we should not remove ourselves from that, from an  agreement that allows us to inspect and gather information about  Russia's nuclear facilities.   In addition, this rule, if adopted, would fail to extend the Special  Survivor Indemnity Allowance, causing it to expire in May of 2018. The  Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance is a program that was originally  created in the NDAA, and goes a long way to helping to mitigate the  problems that recipients of the Defense Department's Survivor Benefit  Plan face.   There are other provisions of this bill which I object to in their  current form but are going to be debated through amendments very likely  over the course of the next week. For instance, the bill currently  prevents the transfer of any detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention  facility. This detention facility that is extralegal should be closed,  not repopulated, and we certainly will have that debate this week.   This bill, unfortunately, also authorizes far too many funds and  continues to overfund our nuclear weapons activities, costing taxpayers  hundreds of billions of dollars, in fact, as much as $1 trillion over  the next 30 years, for a stockpile of weapons that, even if  substantially cut, would be enough to end life on the planet.   I testified before the Appropriations Subcommittee with regard to  this matter and argued how can we possibly go before the taxpayers back  home and say we need to overfund our nuclear arsenal to destroy the  world seven times instead of five, or five times instead of three.   One would think that ending life on the planet once would be more  than enough, and it is hard to argue from taxpayers that they should,  in fact, pay for this planet's destruction multiple times.   We also continue to use force in our ongoing operations in Iraq,  Syria, and elsewhere. I join my colleagues from the other side of the  aisle in calling for an updated Authorization for Use of Military  Force. To date, Congress has taken zero meaningful actions toward  achieving that, yet we hear on this floor regularly from my friend from  Alabama and others that Republicans and Democrats need to do that,  especially before we put another soldier in harm's way.   That is the role of this body, and it is time to stop avoiding the  task of writing an Authorization for Use of Military Force. Have that  debate and make it happen.   These are the types of questions we should be debating, but instead  we are continuing to avoid those and plunging our Nation deeper into  debt without a real budget plan.   Instead of focusing on real questions about how to improve our  defense, the general debate on this bill will largely focus on budget  tricks. This debate on this budget should happen on the floor, in the  Budget Committee, in a budget passed by this body.   One of the amendments I offered with my colleague, Ms. Lee, that we  will be debating, would cut 1 percent of the money authorized in that  bill. That would help. It would be a starting point. It would still be  a spending level above the budget caps, but at least 1 percent in the  record, reckless deficits from this Republican spending bill.   At some point we have to make decisions about tradeoffs, about the  directions of our budgets, our entitlements, our discretionary, our  revenues, our defense, and our nondefense. We can't resign ourselves to  plunging future generations into further debt.   My amendment with Ms. Lee is a small, first step taking a stand  against unsustainable budget levels that make our Nation less secure  rather than more secure. It is the wrong way to do things. It is the  wrong time to have this debate. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  this rule so we can go back to the starting board and discuss the items  that my Republican colleagues agree are important in terms of the use  of the Authorization for Use of Military Force, ending the budget  gimmicks, and figuring out how to balance the budget, rather than  plunge our Nation deeper into debt.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Mr. Chairman, at a time when we need to balance our budget and  prevent a legacy of debt from being left to the next generation, it is  really time to ask ourselves: Not only should we blast through the  budget caps, but can't we afford to at least make a small and important  step towards protecting our fiscal security as a nation, which is a  critical part of our national security?   By spending beyond our means, we make ourselves economically beholden  to other nations like China and Saudi Arabia. That makes America less  secure rather than more secure.   As structured, the NDAA is fiscally irresponsible. We have had a  number of discussions about that, that outside of the context of a full  budget discussion, it is hard to talk about exceeding the Budget  Control Act by 72.5 billion, an additional $10 billion of base  spending. It is a broader discussion about the budget that needs to be  had.   What my amendment would do, very simply, Mr. Chairman, is give  authority to the President of the United States and the Secretary of  Defense and the Secretary of Energy to reduce the overall amount of  money authorized in this bill by 1 percent.   It excludes personnel and health accounts from being included in  these reductions. A 1 percent reduction still leaves us well above the  original Defense cap spending levels that I actually support.                                time  2045    If I had my way, I would keep those budget numbers for defense  spending, but I think this 1 percent is a very reasonable compromise  for those of us who believe that we need to at least show a symbolic  gesture towards fiscal responsibility as we head into the budget  negotiations.   In this bill, there are many overfunded accounts. Accounts are funded  at levels above and beyond what our own military requested. A 1 percent  reduction in that context is extremely reasonable. It is $6.2 billion  out of this bill. I have no doubt that there are many ways to find the  excess money in the bill that we would leave up to the military to  reach that spending level.   We can consider numerous programs. This doesn't have to be across the  board. We can consider programs where the bill authorizes procurement  levels that exceed the President's request and the military's request.  My colleague from Massachusetts pointed this out during the bill's  markup when he introduced an amendment to reduce the number of littoral  combat ships from three to the Navy's own request of one. We are  effectively blocking the Navy from making a fiscally reasonable  decision.   There are dozens more--helicopters, aircraft, and missiles--than the  President even requested in his budget. So we are not going to cut  every one of those items. Many of them have found their way onto the  unfunded priority list which the Pentagon provides the Congress.   In a perfect world, if we had all the money in the world, we could  have included all those items. But at some point, we have to make some  decisions about the direction of our military budget, and we can't  allow ourselves to be convinced that somehow we can sustain this level  of spending. We can't.   Frankly, even with this 1 percent cut, the level of spending is  unsustainable and plunges us further into debt; but I think, hopefully,  that is the least that Democrats and Republicans in Congress can come  together around as a simple first step.   My amendment is a very small first step. We don't have to choose  between protecting the homeland and fiscal restraint. When Congress is  imposing spending that the military itself doesn't even want, here is a  vehicle to hand the military the ability to rein in some of that  unnecessary spending that reduces our national security rather than  improves it.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment and take  this modest step towards fiscal responsibility.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman asked why aren't there cuts for  other agencies. That is not the bill we have before us. We have the  National Defense Authorization bill before us. I have supported similar  cuts in various agencies when we have had those appropriations bills on  the floor.    This is the biggest bill on the authorization side, and then, of  course, the companion appropriations bill. This is over 40 percent of  our discretionary expenditures, and the authorization for 40 percent of  our discretionary expenditures is in this bill. So a 1 percent cut is  very meaningful in this bill.   That doesn't mean that 1 percent cuts in other areas aren't  meaningful, too. They are.   There is no single other area that is as important, fiscally, as this  area, and I think it would set a positive tone for reining in out-of- control spending.   There are many accounts that are funded at levels above President  Trump's request. So if the gentleman is saying somehow that this cut  would leave anybody unprepared, he is basically saying that President  Trump's budget would leave the military unprepared or leave people  poorly equipped.   The truth is there are many of us who support vastly lower spending  levels and believe that those are sufficient for national defense. That  is not even what this amendment does. It simply reduces spending just  over $6.2 billion. It still blasts through the budget cap.   Mr. Chair, the ranking member has indicated that he supports this  bill, and I deeply respect his expertise in military preparedness. I  encourage my colleagues to unanimously adopt my amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
