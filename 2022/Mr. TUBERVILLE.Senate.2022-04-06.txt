 Madam President, Russia's invasion into Ukraine is  changing the global order, the likes of which the world has not  witnessed since the end of the Cold War. Vladimir Putin launched an  unprovoked and brutal war--one that left the United States and our  allies shocked and enraged. The global response to Putin's provocation  was a mix of sharp words, hastily delivered weapons, and targeted  sanctions, but even as we speak, the actions from the Biden  administration are still too weak.   As airwaves were flooded with messages of support and solidarity with  Ukraine, one major power was very vocal in their support against  Ukraine, and that was China.   China vocally took Russia's side very quickly. The two countries  share a land border, but they also issued a statement of solidarity on  February 4, just 20 days before the invasion. And there is no doubt  that China is looking at the Western response to the war unfolding in  Ukraine, and it plans to consume its neighbor, Taiwan, in the same  fashion.   Yesterday, an article in the New York Times detailed the lengths  China is going to in order to convince its people that their support  for Russia is righteous and their hatred of the West is justified. The  article goes on to outline China's pro-Putin propaganda, stating:         Chinese universities have organized classes to give       students a ``correct understanding'' of the war, often       highlighting Russia's grievances with the West. Party       newspapers have run a series of commentaries blaming the       United States of America for the conflict.    China's political posturing should be taken very, very seriously. The  CCP is building the foundation for its future actions. Since 1949, the  Chinese Communist Party has been eyeing Taiwan and patiently waiting.  They have not attacked because the United States and other free nations  have strengthened the tiny island. That is the essence of deterrence.  We want Xi Jinping to look out his window each morning and think: Not  today.   Our President's response to Russia's invading Ukraine has not  inspired confidence in the Pacific. Joseph Wu, Taiwan's Foreign  Minister, recently stated:         When we watch the events in Ukraine evolving . . . we are       also watching very carefully what China may do [to us] in       Taiwan.    Alarmingly, the White House is indifferent to the warming relations  between China and Russia. When asked about a recent call between  President Biden and President Xi, regarding the war in Ukraine, White  House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, in part:         China has to make a decision for themselves about where       they want to stand.    In July, President Biden's climate czar, John Kerry, said that he is  ``genuine friends with China'' and continued to praise President Xi.   Let's get this straight. Russia and China both stand against the  United States. Neither country is our friend--period. Both seek to  expand authoritarian world order and diminish American leadership. The  key difference is that Russia is a small bully, but China is a huge,  huge threat.   China's growing economy affords its growing ambition. China became  the world's largest exporting nation in 2009, and today, China controls  the world's supply of titanium, rare earth metals, shipbuilding, and  clothing manufacturing, among others.   China seeks to control the South China Sea and all the trade that  flows through it. China wants to replace the dollar as the global  reserve currency and aims to exceed the military might of the United  States.   And there is no secret--there is no secret at all--that China wants  Taiwan's semiconductor industry.   Semiconductors power our everyday life. If it has an on-and-off  switch, it has a chip. Chips are even found nearly everywhere, from our  credit cards to our phones, to the processors in our weapons, and even  in our satellites.   For the sake of our national security, we need to increase domestic  investment and produce these chips on American soil.   Currently, the Taiwan-based Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is  responsible for over 90 percent--90 percent--of these chips, one small,  little island.   Over the last decade, China has made investments in their domestic  semiconductor industry, but Chinese-produced chips don't match the  quality of those in Taiwan.   While Taiwan's semiconductor industry is second to none, American  markets have experienced a surge in private sector investment and  domestic production.   In the past year alone, private sector investment in domestic  semiconductor manufacturing increased to $127 billion, with all signs  indicating continued growth and investment in the years to come here in  the United States.   And that is the way growth and innovation should happen, through the  private sector, not Federal funding. Continued reliance on offshore  suppliers for these chips poses too great a threat and risk to the  supply chains from the CCP.   As we saw with Putin in the years prior to his invasion of Ukraine,  Chinese leaders are clear about their plans for Taiwan.   Just last year, the CCP warned of ``drastic measures'' if Taiwan  declares independence. Taiwan is independent. Beijing refuses to  recognize and reckon with reality.   To deter Chinese aggression, the United States must have our forces  in the Pacific modernized and ready at any time. That is why it was a  major win that last year's NDAA secured funding for a robust missile  defense system for Guam to counter CCP-launched cruise or ballistic  missiles. Guam is our first line of defense from these, home to 160,000  Americans who are forward-deployed to defend the west coast and our  country. Guam is the first island to defend.   However, as the CCP has continued to grow its military capabilities  over the last decade, our own military has been hampered by cuts to  defense spending, leaving our artillery antiquated and our defense  capabilities weakened.   President Biden has been no different, offering up disappointing cuts  to defense priorities in both of his first two budgets. These cuts most  certainly caught the attention of our adversaries. This is yet another  example of how sorely out of touch with reality the Biden  administration is when it comes to defense. We cannot--we cannot-- continue to ask our men and women in uniform to do more with less,  especially with China watching everything that we do.   While the world focuses on Eastern Europe, we must remain focused on  Beijing. China is watching every move we make with regard to Putin, and  they are taking notes.   We cannot allow Vladimir Putin's war to set a dangerous precedent. We  must not make the same mistakes with Taiwan that the administration  made with Ukraine, and that begins by sending a strong, clear message  to our allies and adversaries that America will always be the world's  most foremost superpower.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
