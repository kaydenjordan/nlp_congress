 Mr. President, I am joined today with two of my esteemed       colleagues from my office, Mr. Bubba Gesser and Henson Webre. And I am       here in thanksgiving. I know it is not Thanksgiving. It is Christmas.       But I am here in thanksgiving with a small ``t,'' and I want to thank       Congress on behalf of the American people.        I want to talk to you for a second about the Mississippi River-Gulf       Outlet. We call it MRGO. Here it is here, this straight channel--a       canal, you might call it. This is the Mississippi River here.        In the 1950s and the 1960s, Congress authorized the Corps of       Engineers to build the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet, to dig it. The       idea at the time--and it seemed a good one--was that the Mississippi       River-Gulf Outlet, being 75 miles long and a straight line, would make       it cheaper, easier, and more efficient for ships rather than going up       the Mississippi River, which winds a good bit. They could go up the       MRGO, as we call it--straight line, 75 miles--and they could save money       by getting to the Port of New Orleans quicker.        The original canal or channel--MRGO--was about 650 feet wide. As I       said, we thought it was a good idea. I am not blaming the Corps of       Engineers. The Corps of Engineers was asked to do this. Our decision to       dig the MRGO turned out to be a mitigated disaster in more ways than       one.        First, the MRGO got bigger, it got deeper, and it got wider. The       original 600 feet in some places became 3,000 feet. It was a huge       undertaking, and it caused massive destruction to our wetlands. We dug       out more dirt to build MRGO--once again, right here; here is the       Mississippi River--than they dug out to build the Panama Canal, and we       destroyed tens of thousands of acres of wetlands.        In addition, because it was pretty much a straight line and there was       no current, unlike the Mississippi River, saltwater began to move up       the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet, MRGO, causing enormous erosion and       saltwater intrusion.        When we had Hurricane Katrina in the early 2000s, 2005, well, MRGO       became a superhighway for storm surge. I mean, the surge just came       straight up this outlet--MRGO--swamping St. Bernard Parish, swamping       New Orleans, breaking the levees. There have been estimates that MRGO       increased the storm surge and the destruction by 25 percent.        We made a mistake building MRGO. After Katrina, we tried to correct       our mistake, and we have been well on the way to correcting it.        First, Congress directed the Corps of Engineers to block the MRGO. It       is still there, but we built about a thousand feet of barrier here of       rock. Once again, this is MRGO, and here is the Mississippi River. So       we blocked the channel so nobody can use it, but still, that wasn't       enough.        Congress also directed the Corps of Engineers to come up with a       Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet restoration plan, how we are going to get       rid of MRGO and repair the damage that it did, and that is why I am       grateful. In our Water Resources Development Act--which this Senate       just passed, along with the National Defense Authorization Act--we have       at long last done something that I have been working on since I got       here from day one. I know Senator Cassidy, my colleague, has been       working hard on it. We authorized the Corps of Engineers to begin       implementing the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet restoration plan.        What does that mean? That means that the Corps is going to fill it in       and try to start repairing the wetlands and other ecological and       environmental damage that was done when we built this channel. And it       will not cost the people of Louisiana one single penny. The Corps of       Engineers has agreed to fund the entire project. That is why I say I       rise in gratitude and thanksgiving. I want to thank this Congress, and       I want to thank the Corps of Engineers.        In the last few minutes I have, Mr. President, I am still in       gratitude and thanksgiving. Most of my people in Louisiana celebrate       Christmas, and to those who do, I just want to wish them a merry       Christmas. I am so proud of my State. We don't take it for granted. God       has blessed Louisiana, and having blessed us once, I think God blessed       us a second time. We are at the top of the gulf coast. We are in the       middle of the gulf south. We straddle one of the mightiest rivers in       the entire world, the Mississippi River, right here. We have more oil       and gas than most nations. My people are experts in endeavors like oil       and gas exploration, petrochemical manufacturing, shipbuilding,       agriculture, aquaculture, tourism, food, manufacturing, education,       healthcare--and I could continue. My people--I have lived in five other       States and a foreign country, and I have never, ever met people like my       people in Louisiana. They are hard-working, they are God-fearing, and       they are fun-loving.        I kid my two colleagues from Texas, Senator Cruz and Senator Cornyn,       all the time. I say, ``Senators--actually, I say ``Cruz and Cornyn,''       but we are supposed to refer to them as Senators.        I say: Ted and John, you know, you represent Texas.        I love Texas. Wonderful State. Texas gets an extraordinary amount of       good publicity. And I am happy for them. God bless. But I also tell my       friends Senators Cruz and Cornyn: Look at it another way. Texas is 5\1/      2\ times bigger than Louisiana, but we are 10\1/2\ times more       interesting, and that is because of my people, the people of Louisiana.        So my wish this Christmas to my people is, first, enjoy your family,       worship your God, worship our God, and may your sunrises be full of       hope and your sunsets be full of peace.        I yield.
