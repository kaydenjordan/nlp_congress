 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, by all accounts, America has made a  remarkable recovery in the last 2 years. When President Biden entered  office, we faced the worst public health crisis in the history of our  country, the most daunting economic challenge since the Great  Depression, and a global upheaval that disrupted every aspect of our  lives.   Two years later, America is coming back. Thanks to the work of our  Democratic majority, the cost of living is finally coming down. But we  are not out of the woods yet.   If you travel in my State of Illinois, which I have been doing over  the last several weeks--especially in Central and Southern Illinois-- you will notice the same sign hanging in one business after another:  ``Help Wanted.'' You can't help but notice in my hometown of  Springfield, there is a franchise of Chicken Fingers that is going to  be opening soon. There is a sign outside the soon-to-be completed  building that says $15 an hour, please call us to work in fast food.   While businesses are reopening their doors and demand for goods and  services is rebounding, America is still struggling with a shortage of  workers. I hear it everywhere, particularly in the healthcare sector,  where the shortage of nurses and medical professionals really creates a  hardship in the center city, as well as in urban areas, small towns,  and large cities alike. This shortage of medical professionals is a  national emergency, which I will address at another time.   In addition to that, we have to ask ourselves, what is the reason for  the shortage? Make no mistake, the decision of the Trump administration  to cut down legal immigration to the United States is one of the  reasons. We usually have about 1 million immigrants a year, legal  immigrants, come to work. During the Trump years, a total of 4 years,  it was 1 million. So they cut the number by three-fourths. We wonder  why we are still looking for workers.   Let's be very honest about it. Whether in the city of Chicago,  Springfield, or downstate Illinois, these immigrant workers are willing  to take jobs many Americans will not take. They work harder at them and  really do their best to help their families get started in this  country. That is the story of America, and it is a story that needs to  be repeated because immigration labor at this point is critical not  just in the cities but in the agricultural areas, as the Presiding  Officer from New Mexico knows well. We need workers, and we need good  ones, and immigrants can be part of that workforce.   At the same time, there is a fundamental problem in our economy that  we need to be addressing honestly. The work-life balance is out of  whack. Today, fewer and fewer Americans are willing to work long hours  for survival wages, especially when they have urgent, personal family  responsibilities at home, like caring for an infirm parent or a  newborn.   Last month, I received a letter from one of my constituents in  Illinois. It speaks to the problems facing parents and caregivers, as  well as many others.   She wrote:         My husband and I both have good jobs. . . . We have three       children. [The cost of childcare accounts for] over a quarter       of our monthly take home [pay]. All of our other bills       combined don't even equal that. I can only imagine the burden       on other families. . . . No wonder unemployment is so high.       How are people able to afford or even find childcare[?]    This constituent asks if Congress has any plans to revive the  enhanced child tax credit that we included in the American Rescue Plan.  I wish I could tell her yes, but sadly the new Republican majority in  the House of Representatives does not even mention this as a priority  in the future. Daycare and childcare and caregivers are a critical part  of family life for so many Americans. Yet, the Republicans, at least in  the House of Representatives, are ignoring the reality.   Beyond the child tax credit, her letter makes one thing clear: Our  safety net has too many holes in America, and if a parent working a  full-time job can still fall through that, then clearly we have work to  do.   I think about that constituent's story as we approach the 30th  anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act this Sunday. Back in  1993, this law passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. In the  decade since, more than 315 million workers have relied on that to take  care of themselves and their family members. It is hard to imagine, but  in the days before the Family and Medical Leave Act, America had zero  Federal job protections for workers with a new baby or a sick family  member at home.   This law was a massive victory for working families, but today, it is  just not enough. The Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees 12 weeks  of unpaid leave for workers. How does that help pay for the diapers,  the formula, medications? Well, it just doesn't. Worse yet, many full- time workers are excluded from the law's basic job protections. In  Illinois alone, nearly 60  [[Page S218]]  percent of working adults don't qualify for unpaid leave under the  Family and Medical Leave Act--6 out of 10 workers.   Here is the bottom line: If you want to get America back to work, you  need to back them up. The Family and Medical Leave Act is a promising  foundation, but it just isn't enough. We need to modernize the American  safety net for a new generation of workers.   Think about this: Over the next decade, adults over the age of 65 are  projected to outnumber children in America for the first time in our  history. That is going to make life even more challenging for the 53  million Americans who are today already serving as caregivers for a  family member or partner. This is particularly challenging for young  Americans. One in four family caregivers is a millennial who, on  average, spends 21 hours a week caring for a loved one at home. That is  more than half of a full workweek, and they don't see a dollar for it.   These Americans, many of whom are also balancing a full-time job with  full-time responsibilities as a caregiver, really need our help. They  deserve it--at least a living wage to start with. Our Federal minimum  wage is a starvation wage. There is not a single part of the country  where $7.25 an hour is enough--not even close. Let's raise it.   While we are at it, let's also revive that enhanced child tax credit  that reduced child poverty in America by one-third. Think about that.  Kids living in poverty--the total was reduced by one-third just from  the child tax credit. That is breathing room for a lot of parents to  make ends meet.   If we really want to help Americans get back to work, we should start  by building on the success of the Family and Medical Leave Act.   (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 242  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')   Mr. Durbin. I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 241         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. HELEN EDWARDS ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER.         (a) Designation.--The Department of Energy Integrated       Engineering Research Center Federal Building located at the       Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois,       shall be known and designated as the ``Helen Edwards       Engineering Research Center''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       Federal Building referred to in subsection (a) shall be       deemed to be a reference to the ``Helen Edwards Engineering       Research Center''.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Duckworth, Mrs.          Gillibrand, Ms. Smith, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Welch):   S. 242. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and  title 5, United States Code, to permit leave to care for a domestic  partner, parent-in-law, or adult child, or another related individual,  who has a serious health condition, and to allow employees to take, as  additional leave, parental involvement and family wellness leave to  participate in or attend their children's and grandchildren's  educational and extracurricular activities or meet family care needs;  to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Madam President, today I am reintroducing the Caring for  All Families Act. It will expand protections of the Family and Medical  Leave Act and ensure that a broader range of caregiving relationships  are covered.   In 2020, the Department of Labor found that one in six people taking  leave to act as caregiver was not protected by the Family and Medical  Leave Act's definition of ``family.'' It really begs the question: How  many of these people decided to drop out of the workforce altogether?  How many of them were fired because they missed a shift because their  child woke up with a fever or because an elderly relative was rushed to  the ER? No one should ever have to choose between caring for a loved  one or losing their job.   The Caring for All Families Act will help protect these workers by  adding domestic partners, in-laws, grandparents, and other significant  relationships to the FMLA's definition of ``family.''   Importantly, this legislation will just be a starting point. While it  would expand job protections to millions of workers, it would not  resolve one crucial flaw in our safety net. America is the only  industrialized Nation in the world that does not have guaranteed paid  family leave. I am going to repeat that. America is the only  industrialized Nation in the world that does not guarantee paid family  leave. That is shameful.   For the millions of working Americans who have or will be caregivers  at some point in their lives, what are they supposed to do? Take on  debt? Work even more hours? No. We cannot settle  [[Page S232]]  for a system that abandons working families when they need it the most.  The American people deserve a safety net that prevents them from  drowning, a safety net that provides the peace of mind they need to  reenter the workforce, and offers them the assurance that their  government has their back.   So let's start. Let's pass the Caring for All Families Act and then  get to work to ensure access to paid leave for all American workers.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record:   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 242         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

HELEN EDWARDS ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER.         (a) Designation.--The Department of Energy Integrated       Engineering Research Center Federal Building located at the       Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois,       shall be known and designated as the ``Helen Edwards       Engineering Research Center''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       Federal Building referred to in subsection (a) shall be       deemed to be a reference to the ``Helen Edwards Engineering       Research Center''.                                  ______    Madam President, today I am reintroducing the Caring for  All Families Act. It will expand protections of the Family and Medical  Leave Act and ensure that a broader range of caregiving relationships  are covered.   In 2020, the Department of Labor found that one in six people taking  leave to act as caregiver was not protected by the Family and Medical  Leave Act's definition of ``family.'' It really begs the question: How  many of these people decided to drop out of the workforce altogether?  How many of them were fired because they missed a shift because their  child woke up with a fever or because an elderly relative was rushed to  the ER? No one should ever have to choose between caring for a loved  one or losing their job.   The Caring for All Families Act will help protect these workers by  adding domestic partners, in-laws, grandparents, and other significant  relationships to the FMLA's definition of ``family.''   Importantly, this legislation will just be a starting point. While it  would expand job protections to millions of workers, it would not  resolve one crucial flaw in our safety net. America is the only  industrialized Nation in the world that does not have guaranteed paid  family leave. I am going to repeat that. America is the only  industrialized Nation in the world that does not guarantee paid family  leave. That is shameful.   For the millions of working Americans who have or will be caregivers  at some point in their lives, what are they supposed to do? Take on  debt? Work even more hours? No. We cannot settle  [[Page S232]]  for a system that abandons working families when they need it the most.  The American people deserve a safety net that prevents them from  drowning, a safety net that provides the peace of mind they need to  reenter the workforce, and offers them the assurance that their  government has their back.   So let's start. Let's pass the Caring for All Families Act and then  get to work to ensure access to paid leave for all American workers.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record:   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 242         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
