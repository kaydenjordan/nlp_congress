 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2345) to require the Federal Communications Commission to study  the feasibility of designating a simple, easy-to-remember dialing code  to be used for a national suicide prevention and mental health crisis  hotline system, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2345         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Suicide Hotline       Improvement Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act--        (1) the term ``Commission'' means the Federal       Communications Commission;        (2) the term ``covered dialing code'' means a simple, easy-      to-remember, 3-digit dialing code; and        (3) the term ``N11 dialing code'' means an abbreviated       dialing code consisting of 3 digits, of which--        (A) the first digit may be any digit other than ``1'' or       ``0''; and        (B) each of the last 2 digits is ``1''.       SEC. 3. STUDIES AND REPORTS.         (a) Primary Study.--        (1) In general.--The Commission, in coordination with the       Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and       the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, shall conduct a study       that--        (A) examines the feasibility of designating an N11 dialing       code or other covered dialing code to be used for a national       suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system;       and        (B) analyzes the effectiveness of the National Suicide       Prevention Lifeline as of the date on which the study is       initiated, including how well the lifeline is working to       address the needs of veterans.        (2) Requirements.--        (A) Commission.--In conducting the study under paragraph       (1), the Commission shall--        (i) consider--         (I) each of the N11 dialing codes, including the codes that       are used for other purposes; and        (II) other covered dialing codes;         (ii) consult with the North American Numbering Council; and        (iii) review the information provided by the Assistant       Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs under subparagraphs (B) and       (C), respectively, of this paragraph.

SEC. 4. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act. This Act shall be carried out using       amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2345, the National  Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018. This critical legislation  seeks to designate a new, easy-to-remember, three-digit dialing code  for a national suicide prevention hotline.   We all know by heart to dial 911 during an emergency, and we have  faith and confidence that somebody who can help will be on the line. It  shouldn't be any different for someone in a mental health crisis.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide  is on the rise across the country. Sadly, more than half of those who  die by suicide do not have a known mental health condition.   We also want to make note of the number of servicemembers and  veterans in need of prevention services. We will work with our minority  on this study to review how these patriots can seek help, whether  stateside or overseas.   You never truly know what battles an individual is fighting, and that  is why a national three-digit suicide hotline could help make the  difference between life and death.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to advancing this potentially lifesaving  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Stewart), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, this is important legislation. It is  completely bipartisan in nature.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Bilirakis), a distinguished member of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this bipartisan piece of  legislation has reached the floor of the House. I hope and trust that  it will be voted on in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion, and I  commend the sponsors, a Republican and a Democrat, for working together  on this needed legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4881) to require the Federal Communications Commission to  establish a task force for meeting the connectivity and technology  needs of precision agriculture in the United States, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4881         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Precision Agriculture       Connectivity Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Precision agriculture technologies and practices allow       farmers to significantly increase crop yields, eliminate       overlap in operations, and reduce inputs such as seed,       fertilizer, pesticides, water, and fuel.        (2) These technologies allow farmers to collect data in       real time about their fields, automate field management, and       maximize resources.        (3) Studies estimate that precision agriculture       technologies can reduce agricultural operation costs by up to       25 dollars per acre and increase farm yields by up to 70       percent by 2050.        (4) The critical cost savings and productivity benefits of       precision agriculture cannot be realized without the       availability of reliable broadband Internet access service       delivered to the agricultural land of the United States.        (5) The deployment of broadband Internet access service to       unserved agricultural land is critical to the United States       economy and to the continued leadership of the United States       in global food production.        (6) Despite the growing demand for broadband Internet       access service on agricultural land, broadband Internet       access service is not consistently available where needed for       agricultural operations.        (7) The Federal Communications Commission has an important       role to play in the deployment of broadband Internet access       service on unserved agricultural land to promote precision       agriculture.       SEC. 3. TASK FORCE.

No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act. This Act shall be carried out using       amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud, today, to rise in support of H.R. 4881,  authored by my colleagues, Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection  Subcommittee Chairman Bob Latta and Congressman Dave Loebsack.   New and exciting technologies are improving efficiency in nearly  every sector of our economy. Rural America should not be left behind.   The bill before us today focuses on the broadband needs of rural  economies, our farmers and ranchers, to help take advantage of  precision agriculture with improved internet access, GPS, and emerging  technologies.   Cutting-edge innovation like the Internet of Things, drones, and  self-driving machines can assist in monitoring crops, reading soil, and  more. Precision agriculture connects rural communities to the 21st  century economy.   This bill is a prime example of how the Energy and Commerce Committee  is leading the way to close the digital divide. I thank Mr. Latta and  Mr. Loebsack for their good work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Latta), the sponsor of the legislation and the distinguished  chairman of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I hope that everyone supports this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5709) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for  enhanced penalties for pirate radio, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 5709         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Illegal Radio       Abuse Through Enforcement Act'' or the ``PIRATE Act''.       SEC. 2. PIRATE RADIO ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENTS.         Title V of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 501 et       seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new       section:       ``SEC. 511.

Such effort       shall include identifying, locating, and taking enforcement       actions designed to terminate such operations.        ``(2) Additional monitoring.--Within six months after       conducting the enforcement sweeps required by paragraph (1),       the Commission shall conduct monitoring sweeps to ascertain       whether the pirate radio broadcasting identified by       enforcement sweeps is continuing to broadcast and whether       additional pirate radio broadcasting is occurring.        ``(3) No effect on remaining enforcement.--Notwithstanding       paragraph (1), the Commission shall not decrease or diminish       the regular enforcement efforts targeted to pirate radio       broadcast stations for other times of the year.        ``(f) State and Local Government Authority.--The Commission       may not preempt any State or local law prohibiting pirate       radio broadcasting.        ``(g) Revision of Commission Rules Required.--The       Commission shall revise its rules to require that, absent       good cause, in any case alleging a violation of subsection       (a) or (b), the Commission shall proceed directly to issue a       `Notice of Apparent Liability' without first issuing a       `Notice of Unlicensed Operations'.        ``(h) Pirate Radio Broadcasting Database.--        ``(1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this section, and semi-annually thereafter,       the Commission shall publish a database in a clear and       legible format of all licensed radio stations operating in       the AM and FM bands. The database shall be easily accessible       from the Commission home page through a direct link. The       database shall include the following information:        ``(A) Each licensed station, listed by the assigned       frequency, channel number, or Commission call letters.        ``(B) All entities that have received a Notice of       Unlicensed Operation, Notice of Apparent Liability, or       Forfeiture Order by the Commission.        ``(2) Clear identification.--The Commission shall clearly       identify in the database--        ``(A) each licensed station as a station licensed by the       Commission; and        ``(B) each entity described in paragraph (1)(B) as       operating without a Commission license or authorization.        ``(i) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) Pirate radio broadcasting.--The term `pirate radio       broadcasting' means the transmission of communications on       spectrum frequencies between 535 to 1705 kHz or 87.7 to 108       MHz without a license issued by the Federal Communications       Commission, but does not include unlicensed operations in       compliance with part 15 of title 47, Code of Federal       Regulations.        ``(2) Facilitates.--The term `facilitates' means providing       access to property (and improvements thereon) or providing       physical goods or services, including providing housing,       facilities, or financing, that directly aid pirate radio       broadcasting.        ``(3) Knowingly and intentionally.--The term `knowingly and       intentionally' means the person was previously served by the       Commission with a notice of unlicensed operations, notice of       apparent liability, or citation for efforts to facilitate       pirate radio broadcasting.''.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act or the amendment made by this Act. This       Act and the amendment made by this Act shall be carried out       using amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume because, in my  judgment, this is an important bill that we should all support.   The Preventing Illegal Radio Abuse Through Enforcement Act, or PIRATE  Act, combats the very serious issue of unlawful broadcasting, often  called ``pirate radio,'' and gives the Federal Communications  Commission additional powers to issue fines on any person who willfully  and knowingly broadcasts radio transmissions over AM or FM frequencies  without a license from the Federal Communications Commission.   I thank my colleague, Congressman Tonko of New York, for joining me  in offering this bipartisan legislation.   New Jersey, where I live, has one of the largest concentrations of  pirate radio operators in the country. Pirate radio signals have been  found to interfere with the emergency alert system and Federal Aviation  Administration operations, causing significant harm to public safety.  They also disrupt the business of licensed broadcasters who comply with  the multitude of FCC regulations. Minority-owned broadcasters are  disproportionately harmed by pirate radio operators in urban areas.   Knocking down pirate radio broadcasts prevents these bad actors from  interfering with the licensed broadcasters public safety officials rely  on to transmit communications during times of emergency. These unlawful  broadcasts are interfering with the news and information programming  people count on and needlessly clogging the information highway at  important times.   It is time to take these pirates off the air by hiking the penalties  and working with the Federal Communications Commission on enforcement.  Chairman Pai and Commissioner O'Rielly have been able partners in  [[Page H6598]]  making sure these broadcasts are stopped. This bill will give the FCC  even more tools to take down these illegal broadcasts.   This act increases fines tenfold for illegal pirate operations to  $100,000 in an effort to boost the deterrent against these broadcasts.   The bill further holds those who facilitate pirate operations liable,  while also streamlining the enforcement process. It also takes a  further step in instituting enforcement sweeps by requiring the FCC to  conduct biannual enforcement sweeps in the top five radio markets with  significant illegal pirate operations, which would include the New  Jersey and major New York media market.   I commend Chairman Pai for his leadership on this issue. Since 2017,  the FCC has significantly cracked down on this illegal activity, and  this bill will ensure future commissions continue this rigorous  enforcement, helping to ensure that these illegal operators stay off  the air.   The issue of pirate radio operators is a more pressing public issue  than it seems. We have to clean up the airwaves to make way for public  safety announcements, Federal Aviation Administration conversations,  and other important information. Radio frequencies are not toys for  unlicensed broadcasters.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3994) to establish the Office of Internet Connectivity and  Growth, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3994         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the ACCESS BROADBAND Act,  which Congressman Tonko and I introduced last year. This bill would  streamline the Federal grant programs related to broadband deployment,  and track how Federal funds are used to a greater extent than is now  the case. I thank Congressman Tonko for his leadership on this  important issue.   Broadband internet is the lifeblood of the American economy, a  critical tool for students, and an incubator for the next great  innovation. This bill takes the right steps to ensure Federal broadband  resources are working to expand access in underserved areas.   Being able to have access to the internet means being able to unlock  tremendous potential, and we have to make sure that all Americans share  in this success. Many local economies are relying on Congress to get  this right.   In many areas of the country, the cost to deploy broadband  infrastructure is prohibitive, which creates a need for Federal funding  in cases where a market solution is not possible.   With several different broadband support programs across several  Federal agencies, there is no single, comprehensive system tracking  where and how Federal funds are being spent.   Access broadband creates an office within the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration, with the task of  simplifying the application process for the various support programs,  coordinating between the various agencies, and tracking the use and  effectiveness of Federal broadband funding.   By ensuring coordination, the office will help prevent overbuilding  of broadband and make sure Federal funds are going where they are  needed most, which should be unserved and underserved areas of the  country.   This bill and the other bills we have been considering reflect the  broad and encompassing jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce  Committee and the important day-to-day work and oversight we maintain  over a significant portion of the Federal Government.   This type of work counts and these bills are important. Energy and  Commerce accomplishments like reauthorizing the successful CHIP  program, the Ray Baums Act, safely disposing of nuclear waste, and  improving consumer protections, have been the pillars of our  accomplishments this Congress, and this has occurred in a bipartisan  capacity.   Bills like the ones we are considering today, keep the wheels of many  critical government functions moving. The ACCESS BROADBAND bill is  excellent legislation and will improve broadband for many Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
