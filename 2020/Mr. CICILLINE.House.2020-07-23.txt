 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong  opposition to this amendment. This amendment would seek to ignore a  U.S. Supreme Court federal standard and allow the Mashpee Wampanoag  Tribe to open an off-reservation casino right on the border of Rhode  Island.   Under the Indian Reorganization Act, the U.S. Department of Interior  is only allowed to take land into trust for tribes recognized before  1934. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe became federally recognized in 2007.  This amendment will set a dangerous precedent and undermine both a U.S.  Supreme Court ruling and disregard the U.S. Department of Interior's  most recent ruling.   An off-reservation casino would result in an overwhelming economic  loss to my state's economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a great  blow to my state, hitting the travel and tourism industry particularly  hard. Casinos in Rhode Island generated $300 million in annual revenue  before closing due to the pandemic. An off-reservation casino would  further devastate the financial loss to my state currently facing a  12.4 percent unemployment rate in June, higher than the national  average. We as a Congress should not be circumventing the court's  decision and allow a one-time carve out for the building of a casino  that is bad for Rhode Island. Regardless of this amendment, the Mashpee  Tribe will still be a federally recognized tribe and will continue to  receive federal benefits.   Make no mistake, this amendment does not aim to help the Mashpee  Wampanoag Tribe, but instead help lobbyists secure a win for their own  interests. This amendment will do more than just greatly damage the  Rhode Island economy, it will put Congress on a path of hand-picking  winners and losers over the court's decision. This amendment would  signal it's okay for lobbyists and hedge funds to be the decision  makers in Congress, and not the representatives of the people. I urge  my colleagues to join me in strongly opposing this amendment.
