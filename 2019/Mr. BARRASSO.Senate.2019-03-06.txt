 Regular order.   Mr. MARKEY--where he got that bogus number of $93 trillion? That is a  completely made-up number by the Koch brothers.    Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come to  the floor to answer those specific questions, and I would point to an  op-ed that I wrote for the New York Times last year. Perhaps the  Senator from New York doesn't read his hometown newspaper, but there is  an editorial in the New York Times of December 18: ``Cut Carbon Through  Innovation, Not Regulation.'' It is a plan. Cut carbon through  innovation, not regulation.   The question is, Do we believe the climate is changing? Do humans  have an impact? The answer is yes to both. As a matter of fact, I  wrote:         [The] climate is changing, and we, collectively, have a       responsibility to do something about it.    It is right here in the New York Times from December 18.         Second, the United States and the world will continue to       rely on affordable and abundant fossil fuels, including coal,       to power our economies for decades to come.    We need to also rely on innovation, not new taxes, not punishing  global  [[Page S1690]]  agreements. That is the ultimate solution.   I will point out that this is something that I had written and  submitted and published long before the so-called Green New Deal was  ever introduced into Congress either in the House or in the Senate.   I go on to say:         People across the world are rejecting the idea that carbon       taxes and raising the cost of energy is the answer to       lowering emissions.    Because we know, as I go on:         In France, the government just suspended a planned fuel tax       increase after some of its citizens took to the streets in       protest.    It was every story on the news.         And in the United States, the results of [the] November       elections showed that these plans and other government       interventions are just as unpopular.        Voters in Washington State rejected the creation of an       expensive tax on carbon emissions. In Colorado, a ballot       measure to severely restrict drilling was defeated. And in       Arizona, voters rejected a mandate to make the state's       utilities much more dependent on renewable energy by 2030--      regardless of the cost to consumers.    I would point out that all three of those States elected liberal  Democrats to Congress on election night.   In further answer to that question, I would point to USA TODAY, March  4, 2019. Today is the 6th, so we are talking Monday. Today is  Wednesday. This is this week's paper, front page:         To a warming planet's rescue: Carbon Capture.    To the rescue of a warming planet.         In the race against climate change, scientists are looking       for ways to pull CO2 out of the Earth's atmosphere       and store it away.    And what they point to is bipartisan legislation passed by this body,  passed by the House, and signed into law by President Trump focusing on  carbon capture and sequestration. It talks about a program called 45Q.  That is the FUTURE Act. One of the cosponsors from the other side of  the aisle is on the floor right now. His name is mentioned, my name is  mentioned in finding the solution.   There are Republican solutions and ideas that are focused on  innovation, not regulation, not taxation, focused on freedom and the  innovation that we have had.   So I just come to tell you, Mr. President, that there are solutions,  and the Republicans will continue to offer them. We had a hearing most  recently just last week on something called the USE IT Act--again, to  capture carbon and to sequester it. We have been working on new-age  nuclear power, working with leaders around the world. We passed that,  and it was signed into law--an innovation bill for nuclear power, new- age nuclear power that will be in small reactors, safer reactors,  cheaper to use, no carbon whatsoever.   So there are absolute solutions, and Republicans are going to  continue to come to the floor, but we are not going to support  something that would bankrupt the country, something that would raise  the cost of energy for families, something that would drive people to  the point of having to spend money they don't have, having our country  borrow money we don't have, all at a time when you say, what is the  cause? There are suggestions and numbers that have been raised. I  haven't heard any numbers from the other side of the aisle.   So I come to the floor to tell you that Republicans have continued to  offer solutions, and I have been offering some of these solutions for  10 years. It took us a while to get these into law, but they are  working. They are working and have been identified as working. Even  President Obama's former Secretary of Energy, Ernie Moniz, who came and  testified to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said there are  two things that would make a big difference. One is the new-age nuclear  work that we are doing, and the other is carbon capture and  sequestration. Those are large-scale products that work.    I see other colleagues on the floor. Do I have the floor right now?    Well, as long as I continue to have the floor, I would  like to point out that we have a booming economy in this country. In  just over a year, tax relief has helped create 3 million new jobs.  Manufacturing jobs have increased for 10 straight months. There is the  fact that we have more jobs available than there are people looking for  jobs. We have a booming economy. I want to do nothing that is going to  harm these people all across the country who are working to have an  opportunity in such a strong, healthy, growing economy.   This Green New Deal--this Big Government takeover of the economy--it  is masked as an environmental proposal. To me, it is radical. The  president of the Laborers' International Union of North America calls  it a ``bad deal.''   Take a look at America. We are leading the world in reducing carbon  dioxide because of the technological and innovative techniques we have  had. We know from what we hear about the Green New Deal that it is  prohibitively expensive, with predictions of up to $93 trillion. The  entire net worth of the United States--of all the homes and all the  families and everything--is only $112 trillion, and this alone would  cost $93 trillion. You can go by how much it is going to cost each  individual family. It is completely unaffordable. It is not something  that is workable. But it is so far outside the America mainstream even  if it were affordable.   So what we have seen here is the Democrats take another hard left  turn. Under this Green New Deal, in just 10 years, the Nation's energy  system would undergo a Washington makeover. The Green New Deal would  end the use of energy resources that currently provide power for three  out of five homes and businesses in the United States. Think about the  harm that would cause the economy. This Green New Deal mandates the use  of expensive power sources that can't keep the lights on. Wind and  solar are important. We need more renewable energy in this country. But  right now, wind and solar provide less than 8 percent of our  electricity.   Should we increase the use of renewables? Absolutely. But eliminating  affordable coal and natural gas would be a costly mistake--and not only  that, it is impossible to do. The electric grid can't handle it.   Last month, there was an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal titled  ``The Green New Deal's Impossible Electric Grid,'' written by Robert  Blohm of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. He writes  that if the electric grid relies solely on renewable energy sources,  ``the grid itself may collapse.''   That is not all we lose if the grid collapses. Our transportation  system is in the crosshairs. The Green New Deal seeks to transform how  Americans travel. It calls for an extensive and expensive national,  high-speed rail system to replace air travel.   The State of California attempted to build a high-speed rail line  between Los Angeles and San Francisco. It turns out the price was too  high even for California. The Governor, Gavin Newsom, just recently  canceled the line between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Why? He said  because of the massive cost. But it is all part of the Green New Deal.  The question is, If California can't afford to build high-speed rail  between two major cities, how can we afford to build a system that  crisscrosses the country? We can't.   The Green New Deal doesn't stop at energy and travel; it extends to  every building in the country. Homeowners are going to be forced to  retrofit their houses, and businesses would have to do the same.   This is what massive government overreach looks like.   The rest of the world is going to continue to pollute even if the  country were to adopt something as extreme as the Green New Deal. It  would cancel all of the gains we have made in the United States by the  fact that our emissions continue to go down. In 2017, we produced just  13 percent of global emissions here in the United States--just 13  percent. China and India together--33 percent. And they are rising over  there. Without dramatic changes from India and China, global emissions  are going to continue to climb. So even if all the Green New Deal's  costly mandates went into effect, with the punishment to our country  and our economy, there would still be no real effect on the Earth's  temperature.   So, look, it is no surprise that the Democrats are trying to duck  this big green bomb. Senate Democrats may even decide to vote present  to avoid  [[Page S1691]]  voting for their own extreme proposal that a dozen of them have either  signed on to or cosponsored, including just about every Democratic  Senator who is running for President. They have all signed on. They are  all cosponsoring it.   This green dream is unreachable, but there is a proven way to reduce  our emissions, which is why I talk about what we are wanting to do in a  positive way with nuclear energy, with carbon capture, things that have  gathered the attention of the New York Times and were on the front page  of USA TODAY on Monday.   So we are going to continue to work with the FUTURE Act and with the  USE IT Act. The committee is going to continue to work in a bipartisan  way because Republicans are committed to finding solutions through  innovation, not taxation, not regulation--solutions that do not hurt  our strong and healthy, growing economy.   I yield the floor.
