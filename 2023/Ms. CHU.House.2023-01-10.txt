 Mr. Speaker, as chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific  American Caucus, or CAPAC, I rise to address the creation of the Select  Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and  the Chinese Communist Party.   CAPAC strongly supports strengthening our economy and national  security, and we have always recognized that there are legitimate  concerns with the actions of the Government of the People's Republic of  China. This committee could address these issues productively.   However, I rise to remind all Members that this committee should not  be used as an open invitation to traffic in blatant xenophobic, anti- China rhetoric that we know results in physical violence against Asian  Americans.                                time  1300    We certainly saw this with Trump's labeling of COVID as the ``China  virus'' resulting in 11,500 hate crimes against AAPIs in this country.   This committee cannot be used to promote policies that result in the  racial profiling of Asian Americans but should directly focus on  specific concerns related to the Government of the People's Republic of  China.   We know the danger for Asian-American communities if the committee  devolves into xenophobic rhetoric and scapegoating.   Back in the 1980s, when the economic competition between the U.S. and  Japan reached a boiling point, Vincent Chin was out at a bar in Detroit  celebrating his upcoming wedding when two laid-off autoworkers shouted:  It is because of you that we lost our jobs. These men harassed Vincent,  chased him, and bashed him in his head with a baseball bat, beating him  until he died. Neither of them served a day in jail and only paid a  $3,000 fine. Instead of attending his wedding, Vincent's family  attended his funeral.   This is part of our country's history, and what this shows is what we  say and how we say it matters. We know how dangerous the consequences  can be if we don't get this right.
