 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1083) to require a strategy for engagement with  Southeast Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1083         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Southeast Asia Strategy       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Southeast Asia is the fulcrum of the Indo-Pacific       region, providing both a geographic and maritime link between       East and South Asia.        (2) The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a       regional intergovernmental organization, remains central to       the Indo-Pacific region's institutional architecture and to       United States foreign policy toward the region.        (3) The United States has reaffirmed that the security and       sovereignty of its Southeast Asian allies and partners,       including a strong, independent ASEAN, remain vital to the       prosperity and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.        (4) The United States has committed to deepen longstanding       alliances and partnerships with a range of Southeast Asian       nations, including by promoting our shared values, democracy,       human rights, and civil society.        (5) Since the end of the Second World War, United States       investments in strengthening alliances and partnerships with       Southeast Asian nations have yielded tremendous returns for       United States interests, as working with and through these       alliances and partnerships have increased the region's       ability to address common challenges.        (6) ASEAN member states are critical United States security       partners in protecting the freedom and openness of the       maritime domain and preventing violent extremism and the       trafficking of weapons of mass destruction.        (7) ASEAN member states have contributed significantly to       regional disaster monitoring and management and emergency       response through initiatives such as the ASEAN Coordinating       Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, an       inter-governmental organization that facilitates coordination       and cooperation among ASEAN member states and international       organizations in times of emergency.        (8) According to the 2018 ASEAN Business Outlook Survey,       ASEAN member states are vital to the prosperity of the United       States economy and exports to ASEAN economies support more       than 500,000 jobs in the United States.        (9) The United States and ASEAN have established a new       strategic partnership that will enhance cooperation across       the economic, political-security, and people-to-people       pillars of the relationship.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to--        (1) deepen cooperation with ASEAN and ASEAN member states       in the interest of promoting peace, security, and stability       in the Indo-Pacific region;        (2) affirm the importance of ASEAN centrality and ASEAN-led       mechanisms in the evolving institutional architecture of the       Indo-Pacific region; and        (3) establish and communicate a comprehensive strategy       toward the Indo-Pacific region that articulates--        (A) the role and importance of Southeast Asia to the United       States;        (B) the value of the United States-ASEAN relationship;        (C) the mutual interests of all parties;        (D) the concrete and material benefits all nations derive       from strong United States engagement and leadership in       Southeast Asia; and        (E) efforts to forge and maintain ASEAN consensus,       especially on key issues of political and security concern to       the region, such as the South China Sea.

(2) A description of efforts to--        (A) deepen and expand Southeast Asian alliances,       partnerships, and multilateral engagements, including efforts       to expand broad based and inclusive economic growth, security       ties, security cooperation and interoperability, economic       connectivity, and expand opportunities for ASEAN to work with       other like-minded partners in the region; and        (B) encourage like-minded partners outside of the Indo-      Pacific region to engage with ASEAN.        (3) A summary of initiatives across the whole of the United       States Government to strengthen the United States partnership       with Southeast Asian nations and ASEAN, including to promote       broad based and inclusive economic growth, trade, investment,       energy innovation and sustainability, public-private       partnerships, physical and digital infrastructure       development, education, disaster management, public health       and global health security, and economic, political, and       public diplomacy in Southeast Asia.        (4) A summary of initiatives across the whole of the United       States Government to enhance the capacity of Southeast Asian       nations with respect to enforcing international law and       multilateral sanctions, and initiatives to cooperate with       ASEAN as an institution in these areas.        (5) A summary of initiatives across the whole of the United       States Government to promote human rights and democracy, to       strengthen the rule of law, civil society, and transparent       governance, to combat disinformation and to protect the       integrity of elections from outside influence.        (6) A summary of initiatives to promote security       cooperation and security assistance within Southeast Asian       nations, including--        (A) maritime security and maritime domain awareness       initiatives for protecting the maritime commons and       supporting international law and freedom of navigation in the       South China Sea; and        (B) efforts to combat terrorism, human trafficking, piracy,       and illegal fishing, and promote more open, reliable routes       for sea lines of communication.        (c) Distribution of Strategy.--For the purposes of assuring       allies and partners in Southeast Asia and deepening United       States engagement with ASEAN, the Secretary of State shall       direct each United States chief of mission to ASEAN and its       member states to distribute the strategy required by       subsection (a) to host governments.        (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Armed Services of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Armed Services of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on H.R. 1083.  [[Page H1945]]     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan Southeast Asia  Strategy Act, of which I am a proud Democratic lead on the bill.   In 2017, Congresswoman Wagner and I cofounded the Congressional  Caucus on ASEAN to strengthen our Nation's relationships in Southeast  Asia. ASEAN and its member nations are of critical importance to the  United States. Enduring organizations like ASEAN will be key to  maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific.   The United States is already making key investments in the region  alongside allies and partners like Japan, Australia, and India-- notably, the recent Quad commitment to fund, manufacture, and  distribute vaccines across Southeast Asia.   The Southeast Asia Strategy Act will build on these investments by  reinforcing ASEAN centrality as U.S. policy and directing the Secretary  of State to develop a comprehensive plan for engaging the institution  and the region it represents.   This legislation comes at a crucial time for Southeast Asia, notably  amidst the deteriorating situation in Myanmar following the recent  military coup.   Given the significant and rapidly developing events in the region,  Congress must send a message of the importance of the region by passing  this bill.   It is also important that the administration nominates a U.S.  Ambassador to ASEAN as quickly as possible. It is also imperative that  the administration consistently sends senior officials to regional  summits. Our Nation needs a voice in Southeast Asia now more than ever.   I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation and help build stronger  ties between the United States and the peoples of Southeast Asia. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   H.R. 1083, the Southeast Asia Strategies Act, introduced by Mrs.  Wagner, is important legislation that will recommit the United States  to strengthening and deepening our ties to southeast Asia and the ASEAN  economic union. This bill will reinforce the United States' cooperation  with countries in the Indo-Pacific region and lay the groundwork for  improved engagement and increased prosperity for America and its  partner nations.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 241) to reauthorize the Tropical Forest and Coral  Reef Conservation Act of 1998.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 241         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Tropical Forest and Coral       Reef Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.         Section 806(d) of the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef       Conservation Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 2431d(d)) is amended by       adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(9) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2022.        ``(10) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2023.        ``(11) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2024.        ``(12) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2025.        ``(13) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2026.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 241.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 241, the Tropical  Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2021,  introduced by Mr. Chabot.   In this Congress, the House Foreign Affairs Committee aims to  reprioritize and redouble our legislative efforts related to the  environment, conservation, and climate change. Climate change already  poses a significant threat, and what we do now will significantly  impact how damaging climate change will be in the years to come.   If we do not act now, we will fail to mitigate the adverse effects  posed by climate change. We will see growing food insecurity, migration  and conflict, threatening our shared interests and security.   President Biden has already set a positive, ambitious agenda for  international climate action. His first summit, the Climate Leaders  Summit, will take place this very week, on April 22, during which the  United States will reclaim its leadership role in galvanizing  international support for protecting our planet.   We will continue to work closely with other nations in the lead-up to  the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow this November and beyond,  understanding that nothing short of an international response can meet  this incredible challenge.   We have our work cut out for us, no doubt, which is why I am pleased  to  [[Page H1946]]  bring forth this excellent bipartisan measure that would reauthorize  the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Act. This highly  successful debt-for-nature program has yielded tangible environmental  benefits and returns on investment since first enacted in 1998. It  offers eligible countries the opportunity to reduce debt owed to the  United States when they invest in local ecologically and economically  vital forest and coral reef ecosystems.   It is a win-win situation. According to the Congressional Research  Service, since 1998, restructured debt agreements have saved more than  67 million acres of tropical forests in countries such as Botswana,  Brazil, the Philippines, and Indonesia. They help strengthen civil  society in conservation and environmental protection efforts and build  public-private partnerships in developing countries, thereby advancing  U.S. international development and democracy objectives.   Furthermore, these agreements help reduce the debt in these  developing countries, lessening fiscal pressures, promoting capital  market reforms, and stimulating economic growth while helping to  protect the environment.   The world's forests are nature's lungs, and the ocean's coral reefs  support a quarter of all marine life. This legislation puts in place  economic incentives that can help drive good environmental stewardship,  while promoting robust democracies and economic growth overseas.   I am pleased to support this important bill and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 241, introduced by Mr. Chabot, is a bipartisan  bill that reauthorizes the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation  Act.   The debt-for-nature swaps created by this program have been highly  successful in generating support for tropical forest or coral reef  conservation activities in exchange for relieving debt owed to the  United States Government. This bill is a win-win, protecting forest and  coral reef ecosystems, lessening the fiscal burden of low-income  countries, and stimulating economic growth in local communities.   I hope my colleagues, both Republican and Democrat, will join me in  supporting this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
