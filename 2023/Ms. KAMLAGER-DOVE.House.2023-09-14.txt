 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of my  district's own, Margaret Tate, who celebrated her 90th birthday this  year.   Ms. Margaret Tate was born on February 11, 1933, in Shreveport,  Louisiana. She was one of 13 children. She moved to Los Angeles at 8  years of age and went on to graduate from Centennial High School in  Compton.  [[Page H4303]]    She married William Tate in 1953 and shared 36 wonderful years with  him before his passing. After raising four children, she went on to  work as the manager of her family business for 30 years.   Margaret's vitality is credited to her constant prayer and steadfast  commitment to God, church, family, and community.   She is well known for her love of family and is a strong and faithful  mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother.   As she celebrates 90 years, Ms. Margaret maintains an active role in  ministries at St. Anselm Catholic Church back home in our district, the  37th, where she has been a member for 55 years. She also participated  in programming at the Inglewood Senior Center.   I hope you will join me in wishing Margaret Tate a happy 90th  birthday and a year full of happiness, health, and love.                   Marking the 50th Anniversary of Hip-Hop     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the work  of James Samuel Harris III, aka Jimmy Jam, and Terry Steven Lewis.   This year marks the 50th anniversary of hip-hop. When I introduced my  resolution honoring this golden milestone earlier this summer, I was  humbled to have Jimmy Jam's support of this effort.   For over 40 years, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis have made a career out  of giving a voice to the Black experience through music. They have  worked with famous Black artists like Janet Jackson, Lionel Richie,  Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin, and Mariah Carey, among many others.   Together, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis wrote 41 top 10 hits in the  United States. Last year, they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall  of Fame in the Musical Excellence category.   I commend Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on their lifelong career in the  music industry and will continue to support Black musicians through my  work in Congress.                       Celebrating the Renaissance Tour     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the triumph  of Beyonce's Renaissance World Tour, and the only reason I am saying  this this week is because I experienced the Renaissance.   Decked in silver from head to toe, Beyonce's Renaissance tour lays  bare the experience of Black womanhood and tells us to leave our  insecurities at the door. We are crazy in love with the restorative  power of music.   The Renaissance tour has already grossed hundreds of millions of  dollars, becoming Beyonce's highest grossing tour yet.   This summer was dominated by female artists. Both Beyonce and Taylor  Swift sold out shows at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, where hundreds of  thousands of my constituents celebrated with them and where Swifties  and the BeyHive showed their power.   The Renaissance and Eras tours are stimulating economies across this  country, keeping businesses open, and keeping hearts healthy-- everything this Congress is not doing. Even more than that, these  concerts create safe spaces for women and the LGBTQ community.    We must continue to support the arts through our work in Congress,  not by shutting down the government, but by ensuring that future  generations of female artists can share their gifts with the world.                            ____________________
