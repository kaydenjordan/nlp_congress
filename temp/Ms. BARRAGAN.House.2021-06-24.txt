 Mr. Speaker, we are living in a climate emergency. The  carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have reached the highest levels  in human history.   In California, we have our worst drought in decades. Last week, we  were hit by a heat wave that stretched from the West Coast to the Great  Plains. This combination of unforgiving drought and relentless heat  sets the conditions for another severe wildfire season. New Federal  data shows the number of new wildfires this year is at a 10-year high.  [[Page H3086]]    In recent years, our country has also faced record floods, deep  freezes, and hurricanes. And deadly wildfires have hit States beyond  California.   Climate disruption is here. Congress has a responsibility to act  boldly in response. The American Jobs Plan is a once-in-a-generation  opportunity to meet the moment with a transformative investment in  infrastructure.   We have the opportunity to build a clean-energy future that uplifts  the communities who now suffer from the impacts of the fossil fuel  industry. We must do it.    We must also recognize that communities of color have been hit first  and worst by climate change. They must be at the front of the line for  these investments. They must be represented in discussions on any  infrastructure agreement.   We can afford to protect our planet, clean our air and water, and  provide a better quality of life for communities all over the country.   We cannot afford an infrastructure bill that doesn't have climate at  its center. We cannot afford a bill that doesn't invest in  infrastructure that will create millions of jobs and serve the needs of  our communities.   We need: clean energy, a resilient electric grid, electric vehicle  charging, green affordable housing, zero-emissions public transit,  climate smart ports, and more.   Our constituents did not send us here to back down when faced with  climate deniers and deniers of taking any meaningful climate action.   If we don't do it now, when will it ever happen? This is our  opportunity. Now is the time to stand up for the health and the well- being of our communities and our planet to say: No climate, no deal.                            ____________________
