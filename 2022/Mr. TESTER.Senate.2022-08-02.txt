 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I stand in front of this body, yet again,  to urge the passage of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring  Our PACT Act.   Before I get into my remarks, Senator Moran is on the floor, and I  listened to a good portion of what he had to say.   I just want to say thank you, Senator Moran. As a team member on the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, for the last year and a half, we have been  working in good faith to get a bill that addresses the challenges of  toxic exposure that our veterans, quite honestly, have endured since  World War I. With the burn pits and Agent Orange and radiation exposure  that this bill addresses, I would just say that we would not be here  today if we had not both committed to work together to get to a result  that, hopefully--I was a little more sure last week than I am today,  but, hopefully, we will get to a point where this bill passes.   We have talked about this bill a lot, and we have talked about what  it does. Basically, what it does is to make sure that the veterans who  have been exposed to toxins--in this case, burn pits but also, as I  said before, Agent Orange and radiation--are made whole again.   So we get these folks; we train them to be warriors; and we send  these men and women off to war. We tell them to go out and protect our  freedoms and protect this country. They do it, and, oftentimes, things  happen that change their lives. Sometimes those are injuries we can  see, and sometimes we can't see them. In this particular case, with  toxic burn pits, they come home, and they have developed disorders  because they have breathed these toxins in.   If anybody has ever been around a burning barrel that has plastics in  it, you know exactly what I am talking about. You breathe these toxins  in, and it causes cancer, and it causes lung issues.   The problem is that these folks couldn't get away. These burn pits  were right outside the camps; they were right next to the chow line;  they were right next to the beds they slept in, and they had to breathe  this garbage, sometimes day and night. It has resulted in some pretty  serious injuries that have resulted oftentimes in death.   Now, the reason I say that is that, over the last year and a half,  the Senate's Veterans' Affairs Committee has had several hearings, and  we have had witnesses come forth who have been impacted by burn pits  and toxic exposure. I can tell you that some of those folks aren't with  us today. The toxins got them. So not only was the veteran's life  ended, which is unfortunate in and of itself, but also the family who  was dependent on that veteran had their lives turned upside down.   So it is time that we set that record straight and make sure that  those folks who have been impacted by war are taken care of. I hope  that there is nobody in this body who thinks that that is unreasonable  because the truth is, I think most of the folks in this body have been  to the Middle East and have seen what a different world that is and how  it makes me damned glad to be a Montanan and to be an American.   But we have got the ability today to step up and do the right thing.  There have been a lot of claims made over the last week or two. I would  go into those claims and refute those claims, but, quite frankly, I  don't see the sense in it. If the folks here haven't read this bill and  if they haven't read the letter that I sent out to every Senator in  this body earlier today, I would ask that you would. If you have any  questions, come run me down, and I will answer any of them.   The fact is, we have done this whole process in a very transparent  manner--with no surprises, no last-minute stuff put into this bill, no  slush funds. This is a bill that will work for this country; that will  work for the taxpayers in this country; and that will work, most  importantly, for the veterans and their families.   We have an opportunity, as I said last week, to do the right thing  today. We have an opportunity to have the American people be proud of  the Senate and the work they do. I would hope we would get a resounding  vote on this bill, and I would hope that we wouldn't amend it and for  it to have to go back to the House because that, once again, would  delay benefits and do real damage to this bill.   So I would ask my fellow Senators, when they come to the floor and  vote, to think about the veterans who are standing outside the Capitol  out here, to think about the veterans in your home State, and to think  about the veterans whom you met while they were on Active Duty on your  codels. Remember them, and do the right thing: vote to pass the  Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act.   I yield back all remaining time.                           Vote on Motion to Concur     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, the Toomey amendment does place an  arbitrary limit on the amount of funding that Congress can spend each  year in support of veterans, those are called caps. Don't take my word  for it. That comes from the Appropriations Committee and the Budgets  Committee. And when you place caps, that results in rationing of care.   Look, just like every other mandatory account that the VA has, you  come forth as part of the President's budget; the VA has to justify it;  Congress, Congress, Congress details the estimates and needs for the  funds, for the purpose, whether it is toxic exposure or anything else;  it will be reviewed as part of the standard appropriation process.   I would recommend, if you don't trust your appropriators, to put  somebody else on the committee, because that is what this all comes  down to, is the appropriators. I would ask you to vote no on this  amendment.                           Vote on Motion to Concur     The Blackburn amendment would provide automatic  eligibility to community care for any toxic-exposed veteran for any  condition. However, I want to make it clear that if a veteran should  ever need care the VA cannot provide, they are automatically eligible  in that case.   We can talk about the cost. We can talk about the accountability. We  could talk about the timelines of going into the private sector.  Unfortunately,  [[Page S3851]]  we don't have those times, and we don't have those metrics, but what we  do know is this. The VA is a leader in healthcare in treating our  veterans for diseases and conditions as a result of their military  service, and more than that, time after time after time again, we have  heard that veterans prefer getting their care from the VA. We should  not privatize the VA. That is what this amendment is about. I would  appreciate a ``no'' vote.                           Vote on Motion to Concur     Mr. President, 15 years ago, when I was appointed to the  Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I had a Vietnam veteran come up to  me and say: ``You are not going to treat this generation of veterans  like you have treated us.'' This bill rights that and makes that  veteran's request come true. Why? Because we are dealing with toxic  exposure. In fact, we are even dealing with it with Agent Orange and  the burn pits.   This fully pays the cost of war, and I would encourage everybody in  this body to vote for this motion.    Madam President, 86 to 11. 86 to 11. We have been  fighting for this for decades--for decades. And I will tell you that  the last few days have not been particularly easy for me, and they have  been even more difficult for the veterans around this Nation who  thought they had a benefit on June 16 and then found out that it wasn't  there.   But today, the Senate took the historic step of delivering healthcare  and benefits to all eras of veterans by the passage of the Sergeant  First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address  Comprehensive Toxics Act, otherwise known as the PACT Act.   For hundreds of thousands of veterans of all generations, for our  all-volunteer military, this bill puts us on a path to finally paying  the cost of war.   Look, I take my cues from the veterans as chairman of the Senate  Veterans Affairs Committee. When I first introduced this bill last  year, we set out with a clear goal to right the wrongs of decades of  inaction and failure by us--the U.S. Government--to provide all eras of  toxic-exposed veterans the VA care and benefits that they have earned.   We knew the only way to do this was to put forth a comprehensive  package that took care of our past, present, and future veterans. I am  grateful--and I mean this--this wouldn't have happened without my good  friends Ranking Member Jerry Moran, John Boozman, and Martin Heinrich.  We all worked together to make sure that this toxic exposure package  came together so we could have the vote we had today, with help from  both sides of the aisle.   I am thankful for the leadership of President Joe Biden who addressed  this issue in his State of the Union speech and got the ball rolling;  to the VA Secretary, Denis McDonough, for his leadership as Secretary  of the VA, and the House Veterans Affairs Committee chairman, Mark  Takano, and so many others that I can't even list them all, so I am not  going to start down this line.    This bill is legislation we envisioned when we set out to right  wrongs of our toxic-exposed veterans. The PACT Act recognizes that  responsibility, and it recognizes the cost of war.   Veterans service organizations across this country and the veterans  they represent and the advocates have understood this for a long time.  That is why not only have they been incredible partners in this, but  that is why this has been the No. 1 issue for veterans service  organizations in this country--the No. 1 issue.   And, in fact, so important to them and the folks that pretty much  left here--the Chamber--but it is so important to them that they were  willing to sleep on the steps of the Capitol for the last 5 days. Now,  you might not think that is a big deal, but it isn't exactly nice in  Washington, DC, the 1st of August or the end of July.   And last night, we had one heck of a thunderstorm, rolled me right  out of bed. Those folks were out there. They were making their names be  heard. They were making the policies be heard that they fought for.   And I am just going to say one more thing: If you take a look at our  military, the finest in the world, there is a reason for that. There is  a reason for that. And that reason is these folks are willing to get  the job done, and they did. And that is why we got a vote of 86 to 11.   That is why folks said: Enough is enough. We are not doing any more  games; we are going to vote on this bill. That is what the folks sent  us here to Washington, DC, to do, and we did it.   And I couldn't be prouder of the U.S. Senate, but I am also more  proud of the folks who served this country in the military and their  families. I got on this floor earlier today and said: The longer we  delay, the longer we are going to deny healthcare for our veterans and  veterans are going to continue to be in crisis and they are going to  continue to die. Now, we have passed the bill that rights that wrong,  that is going to help these veterans across the board. And I think we  are going to see improvement in all sorts of things--not only the  diseases caused by toxic exposure, but the mental health that is also  associated with service to this country.  [[Page S3853]]    We put politics aside. We delivered results through action, through  real action. And we said thank you to the men and women who have served  in our military. Thank you for what you have done for this country.  Thank you for protecting our freedoms. Thank you for keeping us safe.   And most importantly, we told them you held up your end of the  bargain; we held up ours.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
