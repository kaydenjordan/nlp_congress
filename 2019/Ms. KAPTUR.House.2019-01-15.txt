 Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan  Congressional Caucus on Poland, it is with a truly heavy heart that I  rise this morning to express deepest sympathy to our NATO ally, Poland,  and its countrymen and women on the brutal slaying of visionary Gdansk  Mayor Pawel Adamowicz.   Mayor Adamowicz had served his city since 1998 as it championed the  values of liberty, equality, and democracy. I hold profound respect for  his enduring dedication, perseverance, and honorable service to his  community and nation. He loved Gdansk as a beacon for a free Poland and  gave his life to it.   What a deep tragedy this is for his grieving family, his wife, his  children, his associates, for the Polish nation, and for freedom-loving  people everywhere.   Far too much blood has been shed on Polish soil for the world to  ignore such a heinous crime that took his life.   I visited Gdansk in both 2009 and 2013, and through these visits, I  gained an even deeper respect for its noble history and its place on  Earth, including the location where Nazi shelling at Westerplatte began  the cataclysmic invasion of Poland starting World War II.  [[Page H553]]  This year, we will commemorate the 80th anniversary of that moment.    Then more recently, Gdansk's redemptive transformative role in world  history with the courageous Solidarnosc worker strikes that trip-wired  the collapse of tyranny across Central Europe, imposed by the Soviet  Union, ushering in the possibility of freedom for the millions who  suffered under dehumanizing repression for over half a century.   In our modern era, Gdansk became that symbol of liberty. It formally  partnered with the city of Cleveland, Ohio, which I am privileged to  represent, along with Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, in a sister-cities  relationship. As part of my own congressional district, I am deeply  honored and proud of this relationship.   In Mayor Adamowicz's memory, I and this Congress must stand ready to  strengthen this alliance of liberty, certainly at this moment in  history. In his memory, our Poland Caucus must pursue an annual liberty  exchange in his name to nurture aspiring young Polish leaders who  follow in his footsteps in pursuit of liberty and security for Poland.   Let his death serve as a constant reminder of how precious freedom  remains. I am certain Polish law enforcement officials will examine the  circumstances surrounding the perpetrator's actions with a diligent  eye. They must ascertain whether there are any linkages that exist with  outside influence or propaganda that might have catalyzed this heinous  crime.   I know I speak on behalf of all Americans and of millions of Polish  Americans across our country, including in Ohio, to remind all freedom- loving people that the United States stands with Poland now at this  hour of mourning.   During these uncertain times, we must work to strengthen our  transatlantic and NATO alliances through increased diplomatic,  cultural, and military exchanges.   May the soul of Mayor Pawel Adamowicz rest in peace, and may the  worth of his noble life inspire the young leaders of Poland to pursue  his visionary leadership.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for the  recognition and the opportunity to speak.   Madam Speaker, this vote is a tribute to the thousands of Federal  patriots who have shown up to work for the past 25 days, working with  no pay. This must end today. I call on my colleagues in this body to  vote to support our hardworking public servants.   This bill is a clean continuing resolution. It comprises short-term  funding through February 1 for all the agencies and departments  currently shuttered for no good reason. Those include the Department of  Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the State Department, the  Interior Department, the Agriculture Department, the Department of  Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of  Transportation, and many more agencies.   The President is not serving this Nation; he is not serving it well  as he uses his authority to harm our Republic. Civil service workers  are the bonds that hold our country together.   The Commander in Chief is hurting our Nation and holds our entire  government hostage to his harebrained notion that you can stop drug  trafficking and migration with a wall. The drug traffickers must be  laughing up a storm. They already ship it here hidden in legal cargo.  They dug tunnels under the 650 miles of border that already exists.  They figured that out. And they have been flying contraband material  over our border. They boat illegal contraband in here from our coastal  ports, and they ship it from China through even the Postal Service, and  we don't have a mechanism to detect fentanyl in the mails.   To secure our Nation and our border, our Nation first needs to open  all our government agencies for the American people who are paying the  bills, open those departments and pay the men and women who dedicate  their lives to protecting our borders and protecting us. Once the  government is open, we can spend the next weeks discussing how best to  fund mechanisms that will truly improve our security. This could  include thorough inspection of all cargo.    This could include enhanced electronic surveillance  between ports of entry. This could include additional personnel at all  ports of entry to increase checks. And, frankly, in communities like I  represent, it should involve increasing DEA agents to take care of the  gangs that are trafficking in these illegal materials.   But most importantly, we need a President who understands you don't  stop the drug trade or undocumented migration of individuals by  shuttering the entire Department of Homeland Security or furloughing  the border agents or making them go to work with no pay. He has got the  wrong answer for what America needs to address in border security.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight yet another grim  economic headline, another broken promise on jobs and trade from  President Trump to the people of northern Ohio, and more pink slips by  another factory shuttered.   Keystone Tailored Manufacturing will close by March. Approximately  150 employees will lose their jobs.   Keystone has made men's suits at the site since 2015. Before that, it  was a Hugo Boss men's suit plant. Since 2010, workers fought to keep  the facility from closing twice. There won't be a third time.   As Mark Milko, the area director for the Workers United union put it:  ``It doesn't look like there is anything to fight to save.''   Madam Speaker, this company plans to shift these jobs to Canada.  There they can save $15 a suit on imported buttons, zippers, shoulder  supports, and tariffs--because Canada isn't involved in a trade war  with China that the President has started. Under NAFTA, they can then  turn those suits right back around to sell here in America for nothing.   This President's trade strategy is a disaster. American workers  suffer the ultimate sacrifice. Our Nation must put someone in charge  who knows what they are doing.                            ____________________
