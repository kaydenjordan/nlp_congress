 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and  legacy of Emlen Tunnell, who was born in Bryn Mawr almost a century  ago, and became a standout football player at Radnor High School.   Last month, the U.S. Coast Guard named a Sentinel-Class Cutter for  Tunnell to recognize his accomplishments as an NFL pioneer and a hero  in the U.S. Coast Guard. During World War II, Mr. Tunnell received the  Silver Lifesaving Medal for rescuing one shipmate from a fire during a  torpedo attack and another after he fell into frigid water off  Newfoundland.   After the war, Tunnell became the first Black player for the New York  Giants, as well as the first Black talent scout, and first Black  assistant coach in the NFL. In 1967, Tunnell became the first Black man  inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.   When the cutter was commissioned last month, Tunnell was described as  someone who didn't set out to be a trailblazer, just a great human  being who wanted to make a difference in the world.   We are so proud to honor Emlen Tunnell today.                            ____________________
