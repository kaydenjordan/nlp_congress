 Mr. President, while the Strengthening America's  Security in the Middle East Act is clearly far from perfect, the  majority of the legislation addresses several key priorities that are  particularly important to me: formalizing long-term security aid to  Israel, supporting our Jordanian allies' fight against the Islamic  State, and sanctioning the Syrian financial system over the Assad  regime's human rights abuses.   These provisions represent important measures to concretely support  our allies and address serious national security concerns. The  legislation as a whole also preserves Obama administration  international agreements that promote regional security while providing  the Trump administration with more tools to levy sanctions against  human rights abusers in the Assad regime in Syria.   I also strongly oppose the BDS movement. However, I have long had  concerns about the Combating BDS Act and similar legislation, which  could be interpreted to change longstanding U.S. policy towards Israeli  settlement activity and could have negative implications on domestic  freedom of speech protections. Those concerns are rightly being  litigated in Federal court. This bill does not protect a state or local  BDS law from being challenged in court by an individual on  constitutional grounds.   While this was among the more difficult votes I have taken,  ultimately the national security and other benefits of the entirety of  this legislation could not be ignored or passed up.                            ____________________
