 Mr. Speaker, on the first Saturday of  the month, we celebrated National Trail Day.   In recognizing our local, State, and national trails, we can bring  attention to the importance of our trails, build a world where everyone  feels welcome to enjoy the great outdoors, and provide the perfect  opportunity to set off on a hike.   I am proud to represent the only national forest in Pennsylvania, the  Allegheny National Forest. This multiuse forest is a staple in our  region, providing recreation as well as employment opportunities.   The ANF has more than 200 miles of hiking trails, 53 miles of cross- country skiing trails, and 18 miles of interpretive trails, offering a  variety of hiking experiences for outdoor enthusiasts of all types.   My district is also home to Marion E. Brooks Natural Area trails in  Elk County, the Mid State Trail in Tioga County, and the North Country  National Scenic Trail, which spans from New York to North Dakota.   Mr. Speaker, these hiking trails provide an opportunity to experience  the beauty of our land. As the weather warms up, I encourage all my  colleagues to get outdoors and explore their hometown hiking trails.                            ____________________
