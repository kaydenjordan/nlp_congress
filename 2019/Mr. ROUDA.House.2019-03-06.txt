 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this bipartisan  amendment, which would codify disclosure requirements for paid  Congressional fellowships sponsored by nongovernment sources.   It has been a privilege to work with Congresswoman Foxx and her  office on this amendment to enhance transparency in Congress, and I  thank her for her attention to this matter.   I look forward to continuing to work with Congresswoman Foxx and my  other colleagues across the aisle to advance bipartisan initiatives.   I am eager to work with Democrats and Republicans to find common  ground and deliver practical, commonsense solutions for the American  people.   By passing this bipartisan amendment, we can show our constituents  that we are serious about improving transparency and accountability in  the people's House.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the people of Orange County sent me to Congress  because they were disillusioned with the nature of our politics,  whether it is the toxic partnership or the vice grip of special  interest money on our political system.   I offer these amendments today to improve this landmark bill by  regulating political ads and restore voters' confidence in our  elections.   Our government has, for too long, preferred to shield special  interests instead of our constituents; and that ends by getting out of  politics and passing the For the People Act.   In an age of advanced cybersecurity threats, more States are looking  to one of the oldest technologies in existence, paper. Currently, the  majority of States utilize some form of paper ballot for elections,  with more taking steps to adopt paper-only systems.   My amendment would require the use of recycled paper for Federal  elections, a critical step to increasing the sustainability of our  elections. Recycled paper production emits 40 percent fewer greenhouse  gases, uses 26 percent less energy, and creates 43 percent less water  waste than non-recycled paper.   The impact of requiring the use of recycled paper for ballots is  significant when you consider the amount of paper used in the United  States. In fact, Americans use approximately 85 million tons of paper a  year, about 680 pounds per person per year.   Recycling just 1 ton of paper can save 17 trees, 7,000 gallons of  water, 380 gallons of oil, 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space, and 4,000  kilowatts of energy, reducing greenhouse gases by 1 metric ton of  carbon.   As security concerns continue to inspire moves to replace electronic  voting methods with paper ballots, we must be mindful of the  environmental impact.                                time  1915    Using recycled paper for our ballots would improve not just our right  to vote, but also save the environment.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his comments, but  with all due respect, I don't believe the facts support those  statements.   It is quite clear that many States are already using recycled paper  in their ballots, and recycled paper often can be cheaper than the  paper chosen by certain States. This is a small request that goes a  long way in supporting environmental health across our great country  and continuing to fight climate change.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, while I appreciate the comments and concerns  about the potential increase in cost to local and State institutions in  administering the vote, I would point out that my Republican brethren  were quick to pass a tax bill that added $2 trillion to our deficit,  while simultaneously not addressing requests by local municipalities  and States for additional funding to make sure that we had proper  voting taking place for all voters across the U.S.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.  [[Page H2497]]     Mr. Chair, every election, hundreds of thousands of votes  are not counted simply because of bad ballot design. These citizens  fulfill their patriotic duty, but their voices are silenced by  confusing voter instructions and poor ballot design. This cannot  continue.   Although most Americans associate bad ballot design with the 2000  Presidential race and hanging chads, unnecessarily complex and  misleading ballots still plague our elections today.   Confusing ballot design has a significant and well-documented effect  on our elections, disproportionately affecting low-income and elderly  voters.   You shouldn't need a magnifying glass to read a candidate's name and  you shouldn't need a Ph.D. to understand voter instructions. My  amendment simply directs the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to  study the best ways to design both paper and digital ballots. By  reviewing uncounted vote data and conducting usability tests, the U.S.  Election Assistance Commission can provide States with better ballot  design guidelines.   This study, which would be due in January 2020, is a commonsense way  to ensure that more Americans' votes are counted next election and in  every election to come.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   It sounds like we are in agreement, because he supports studies that  have made these ballots improved over time. As we just saw from the  most recent election cycle, it is clear that we still have work to do.  So we have agreement that we want better ballots at all locations, and  I am glad Mr. Davis is joining me in support of that.   I also would recognize that this does not require States to follow  the suggested potential improved ballot, but makes it clear that there  are better ways to do it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, each year, too many Americans lose their voter  registration status when they move without updating their voter  registration address.   My amendment is a commonsense measure which directs the Postmaster  General to include a notice on the Postal Service's hard copy change of  address form simply reminding voters to update their voter registration  following a change of address.   The online change of address form on the Postal Service's website  already includes a reminder to reregister with your new address. This  amendment would simply ensure that voters who use the hard copy change  of address form also get a reminder to update their voter registration.   No one should be denied the right to vote simply because they forgot  to update their voter registration address following a move.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, if my colleague is ready to yield back and  proceed to a vote, then I am certainly willing to do so as well.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1930     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
