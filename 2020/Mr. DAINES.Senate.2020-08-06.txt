 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Trista Hovde of Richland County for her outstanding  achievement in earning a position on the North Dakota State/Provincial  National High School rodeo team.   Trista, a junior at Sidney High School, traveled with her fellow  teammates to Guthrie, OK, to compete in the 72nd National High School  Finals Rodeo. She partook in the barrel racing, girls' cutting, and  reined cow horse competitions.   The NHSFR boasts the title of the largest rodeo in the world,  featuring over 1,650 contestants from 43 States as well as Canada,  Australia, and Mexico. Participating in the NHSFR is a tremendous honor  and I know that she has made both her community and Montana very proud.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Trista for her tireless  dedication to the rodeo community and her unique contributions to  Sidney and Montana. Her drive and ambition serve as an inspiration to  all young Montanans to strive to do the best that they can in  everything they do. I look forward to following Trista's rodeo career  and all of her future accomplishment.                            ____________________
