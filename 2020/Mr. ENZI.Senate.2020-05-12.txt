 Madam President, I would like to say a few words to send  best wishes to a good friend of mine on her next adventure, LoLeta  Marie ``Leta'' Record Tanner. I recently learned that Leta will be  moving to Texas from our great State of Wyoming to live with her son.  While I am overjoyed that she can be with her family, I am deeply  saddened that Wyoming will no longer be the physical home to such a  dedicated, strong, and loving person.   Leta was born in Gillette, WY, in 1930. She graduated from Campbell  County High School and then traveled to Denver, where she graduated  from a small community college. A dedicated public servant and  Wyomingite through and through, Leta served for more than 15 years in  the Campbell County Assessor's office and district court and 12 years  as a member of the Gillette City Council. She also worked for former  Wyoming Senator Al Simpson for 10 years, both in his northeast State  office and in Washington, DC.   While her political career alone is impressive, Leta was always  involved and giving her time to Wyoming. Leta is a dedicated member of  the ranching community and the community at large as a member of  Campbell County Cattle Women, Campbell County Wool Growers Auxiliary,  and a member of Women in Business, just to name a few. She loved  nothing more than working on the ranch with her family, and has worked  tirelessly to support the next generation in agriculture.   In 2002, Leta was the Campbell County Woman of distinction. She has  done many wonderful things for the Gillette community and the State of  Wyoming. She has been a generous supporter of family-oriented  performance at the Cam-Plex Heritage Center in Gillette since 1996. In  2013, her donation to Gillette College in support of their Agriculture  Education Center and Rodeo complex made it a reality. This state of the  art facility features an indoor rodeo practice area, classroom, lab,  and 20-stall loafing sheds. It is quite possible that, without Leta's  support, this world-class facility and many other projects would not  have come to fruition. The dorms at Gillette College will forever bear  the name Tanner Village. Her willingness to help the community grow and  thrive will never be forgotten.   I am reminded of a few words my mother taught me: ``Do what's right.  Do what's best. Treat others as you'd wish to be treated.'' Leta  certainly embodied these principles and will continue to do so.  Although she will be leaving our great State, Leta's legacy will live  on and continue to be an example of just what is possible for  Wyomingites of all ages.   Leta, thank you for your years of tireless service to Wyoming. Diana  joins me in sending our best wishes to you and your family. Stay in  touch. Wyoming will always be your home. Thank you and God bless.                            ____________________
