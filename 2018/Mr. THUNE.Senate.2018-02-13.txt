 Mr. President, when we set out to do tax reform, we had  two big goals we wanted to achieve for the American people.   First, we wanted to provide them with immediate relief on their tax  bills, which we did, by lowering tax rates across the board, doubling  the child tax credit, and nearly doubling the standard deduction.  Thanks to lower rates and the new withholding tables, Americans across  the Nation will start seeing bigger paychecks this month. Yet our  objective went beyond tax cuts, as important as that relief is to the  American people.   We wanted to create an economy that would produce the jobs and  opportunities that would provide Americans with security and prosperity  for the long term. Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our Tax Code was  not helping to create that kind of an economy. In fact, it was working  against it. Businesses, large and small, were weighed down by high tax  rates and growth-killing tax provisions and all of the regulatory and  compliance burdens that went along with them, and our outdated  international tax rules left America's global businesses at a  competitive disadvantage in the global economy. That had real  consequences for American workers.   A small business owner who struggled to afford the annual tax bill  for her business was highly unlikely to be able to hire a new worker or  to raise wages. A larger business that struggled to stay competitive in  the global marketplace, while having paid substantially higher tax  rates than its foreign competitors, too often had limited funds to  expand or increase investment in the United States.   So, when it came time for tax reform, we set out to reform the  business side of the Tax Code to benefit American workers. We knew that  for American workers to have access to good jobs and opportunities, the  American economy had to thrive, and that meant American businesses had  to thrive, so we took action to lessen the challenges that faced  American businesses.   We lowered tax rates across the board for the owners of small- and  medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We expanded the ability of  business owners to recover the investments they make in their  businesses, which will free up cash that they can reinvest in their  operations and their workers. We lowered our Nation's massive corporate  tax rate, which, up until January 1, was the highest corporate tax rate  in the developed world. We also brought the U.S. international tax  system into the 21st century by replacing our outdated worldwide system  with a modernized territorial tax system so American businesses would  not be operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign competitors.   The goal in all of this was to free up businesses to increase  investments in the U.S. economy, to hire new workers, and to increase  wages and benefits. I am happy to report that is exactly what they are  doing. Even though tax reform has been the law of the land for less  than 2 months, businesses are already announcing new investment, new  jobs, better wages, and better benefits for workers.   Tech giant Apple announced that thanks to tax reform, it will bring  home almost $250 billion in cash, which it has been keeping overseas,  and invest it in the United States. It also announced it will create  20,000 new jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced it will be adding 2,500 jobs  at a Michigan factory in order to produce the pickups it had been  making in Mexico. Nexus Services is hiring 200 more workers. JPMorgan  Chase is adding 4,000 new jobs and opening 400 new branches. Boeing is  investing an additional $100 million in infrastructure and facilities  and an additional $100 million in workforce development. Regions  Financial Corporation is investing an additional $100 million in  capital expenditures. FedEx is investing $1.5 billion to expand its  FedEx Express hub in Indianapolis. ExxonMobil is investing an  additional $35 billion in the U.S. economy over the next 5 years--and  on and on.   We are starting to see similar results, not just from larger and  medium-sized companies but from smaller companies too. For example,  Jones Auto and Towing in Riverview, FL, is putting two new tow trucks  into service,  [[Page S895]]  which means new jobs for local workers.   There are all of the companies that are boosting their base wages:  Bank of Hawaii; Charter Communications, Incorporated; Berkshire Hills  Bancorp; Rod's Harvest Foods in St. Ignatius, MT; Walmart; Cigna  Corporation; Great Western Bancorp in my home State of South Dakota;  Webster Financial Corporation; Capital One; Humana. The list keeps  going and going and going.   Then there are the companies that are increasing their 401(k)  matches, boosting wages, creating or expanding parental leave benefits,  and improving health benefits.   Tax reform is already working for American workers, and as the  benefits of tax reform accrue, we can expect more jobs, more benefits,  higher wages, and more opportunities for American workers in the  future. That is what tax reform was designed to do--to unleash the  entrepreneurial spirit in this country and provide incentives for  American businesses to expand and grow their businesses. In doing that,  they will create those better paying jobs, those higher wages, and a  better standard of living for American workers and American families.  It is having the desired effect, and we are seeing it every single day  in this country.   This is not only a short-term thing; this will have a long-term  effect and be a change that will be good for the American economy and  American workers.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
