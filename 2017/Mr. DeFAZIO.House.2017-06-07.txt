 Mr. Speaker, today the House will consider the ``Wrong''  CHOICE Act. The Republicans would take us back to the good old days.   Remember the good old days? Enron, the collapse of Wall Street  because of millions of bad mortgages and virtual collateralized debt  obligations, and other schemes that pyramided the problem to a point  where it caused the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression.   Now Goldman Sachs populates the White House. They run the Treasury.  Now they want to deregulate Wall Street again with a so-called CHOICE  Act.   Now, there are problems with overregulation of the community banks  and small banks; they didn't cause the problem. But they want to say,  ``No, let's just deregulate everybody again,'' not targeting the  problem. So they are going to repeal the Volcker Rule. They are going  to do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   No more requiring lenders to be certain that people are borrowers who  can repay their loans. No, the credit card companies, the payday  lenders, the debt collectors, there are no abuses there. We don't need  a watchdog overlooking them.   And then, finally, they do away with something called orderly  liquidation authority. Back to the good old days when firms on Wall  Street were too big to fail. We can't have in place a process that  would allow us to remove overpaid executives who crash their firm and  to make the stockholders pay instead of the taxpayers.   That is what this bill does today. It is the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I will be unable to vote today on H.R.  2213, the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act. If I would be  present, I would vote against the bill.   While this bill purports to fast track the hiring of Customs and  Border Patrol (CBP) agents in order to ensure our national security, it  would actually water down hiring practices and allow potential  vulnerabilities in the country's largest law enforcement agency. H.R.  2213 would allow certain CBP applicants to bypass polygraph testing.   In 2010 Congress passed the Anti-Border Corruption Act, which  mandated CBP applicants pass a polygraph test as part of their hiring  process. This bill was an essential step after an influx of corruption  cases were revealed within the agency--ranging from drug trafficking to  accepting bribes. Decreasing hiring standards as proposed by H.R. 2213  would do exactly what the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010 fixed.   Instead of finding common-sense ways to expedite the hiring process  without compromising the integrity of the agency, H.R. 2213  irresponsibly cuts corners in an attempt to keep President Trump's  campaign promises of quickly increasing border patrol agents.   I am absolutely committed to regaining control of our country's  borders and have continually fought to restrict individuals who would  do our citizens harm--both through terrorist attacks or drug  smuggling--from entering the United States. This ill-conceived  legislation does nothing to ensure increased border security.
