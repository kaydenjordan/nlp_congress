 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 853.  [[Page S444]]     Mr. President, the coronavirus pandemic has  devastated economies and industries at every single State across the  country. In Nevada, our hospitality travel and tourism sectors have  been especially hard-hit.   These businesses are economic engines for our communities, employing  hundreds of thousands of workers and pumping billions of dollars into  our economy each year, but they are facing incredible challenges right  now due to COVID.   This amendment ensures that the Senate will prioritize support for  the hospitality industry and its workers as it crafts legislation to  provide coronavirus relief and recovery to communities across the  United States.   Almost half of all job losses since the pandemic began have been in  the travel, leisure, and hospitality industries, and the situation gets  more dire every day we don't act.   Communities across this country have suffered as nearly $500 billion  in travel spending and an estimated $64 billion in Federal, State, and  local revenues have evaporated. Our communities cannot afford to see  these industries decimated.   That is why I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment  to expand support for our struggling hospitality industry and provide  relief for the workers in the industries hardest hit by this pandemic.
