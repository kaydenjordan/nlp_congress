 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Pocan for  yielding.   To Members of the body, the occupation must end, and there must be a  just solution for both peoples. We cannot keep turning a blind eye to  the practices that rob people of their generational homes or detaining  children. Israeli and Palestinian families want to raise their children  in safety and in peace, and we have got to take firm, diplomatic steps  to support those goals.   While the evictions in west Jerusalem and the hostilities around Al  Aqsa Mosque seem to have provoked the latest escalation in violence. We  have got to take a hard look at how the situation has changed in recent  years. The Biden administration must reverse Trump's detrimental  actions and take steps to ensure that U.S. aid to Israel cannot be used  for the seizure or destruction of Palestinian homes. We have also got  to continue humanitarian aid to Palestinian territories.   The use of war-grade weapons and the killing of civilians must stop.  I have always strongly supported a rights-based approach and a two- state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the current  situation makes it more crucial than ever to pursue viable pathways  toward equality, self-determination, and peace.   I sincerely thank Mr. Pocan and the Progressive Caucus for putting  this Special Order hour together. I hope and pray that the death and  self-destruction will end and that we may work toward a peaceful  solution centered on the humanity and the rights of all involved.
