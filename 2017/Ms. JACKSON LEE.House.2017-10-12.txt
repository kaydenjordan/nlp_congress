 Mr. Speaker, Puerto Rico has no power. The U.S.  Virgin Islands has no power. St. Johns is completely collapsed in the  U.S. Virgin Islands. The people are dying from contaminated water.   Mr. President, how can you abandon the American people?   This bill is going to provide FEMA assistance to keep giving so they  can have it. It is going to give $16 billion to the senior citizens in  my district, who have paid their flood insurance, who are desperate to  get their houses repaired, to get the mold out after being impacted by  Hurricane Harvey.   Yes, I woke up this morning to the outrage of the fires and people  dying in California. That is what is in this bill.   I can't imagine that a President would make this comment of walking  away, but I am here to fight for those who have been impacted by  Hurricane Harvey. We are still suffering. Senior citizens are out of  their homes. We have been evicting people in public housing. We need  community development block grants. The Army Corps of Engineers is  greatly needed.   The funding that we ask for is not in here, block grants is not in  here, and as well the restoration that we need. We will fight. I will  not turn my back on Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands and vote ``no''.  I will vote ``yes''----    And help Americans, but Hurricane Harvey has to be  in the next bill.    * * *    Madam Speaker, we are now a few days after the most  violent and largest massacre in modern American history in Las Vegas,  Nevada.   Many that you encounter has a story, amazingly, about who was there  during that week. They obviously were not at that site, but they may  have been in Las Vegas for work or otherwise. It will be on the minds  of Americans for a long time.   Just this past Monday, I stood with Sheriff Acevedo, my chief of  police, my sheriff, my constable; mothers who have lost loved ones and  children; and a woman who had been abused and her significant other  carried around a heavy weapon to scare her, threaten her, and abuse  her.   Why we can't have gun safety regulation, I don't know, but I believe  after Sandy Hook and after Pulse nightclub, we must pass real gun  safety legislation. We must ban assault weapons, ban the bump stocks.  We must have universal background checks.   Madam Speaker, it is a shame that we cannot save lives. We need gun  safety now, not money in your pockets.                            ____________________
