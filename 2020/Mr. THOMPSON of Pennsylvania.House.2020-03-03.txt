 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  March as National Nutrition Month.   A well-balanced, nutritious diet is important for all Americans, and  access to fresh, quality ingredients and food shouldn't be a luxury.   Last Congress, I had the honor of serving as the chairman of the  Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department  Operations. During my time as chairman, and through all of my years on  the House Agriculture Committee, I have met with many advocates,  stakeholders, and other individuals who understand the role that  nutrition plays in the lives of all Americans at every stage of life.   Nutrition plays a particularly important role in the lives of our  Nation's children, however. During critical development years, children  are particularly dependent on foods that are packed with nutrients. In  some unfortunate cases, the meals that students receive at school may  be the only time they eat during the day.   It is important that we do what we can to ensure schools have the  resources that they need to provide students with delicious and  nutritious options.    In January, the USDA announced two new proposals to expand  nutritional options for our Nation's school children. The new rules  allow schools to offer a greater variety of vegetables, options to  customize school breakfasts, and the ability to purchase items a la  carte.   This added flexibility will not only bolster the consumption of  nutritious food in our schools, it will also help reduce food waste.   At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how nutritious school  lunches are, if students aren't eating them, they are not nutritious. I  am hopeful that this recent change will encourage more of our Nation's  young people to make increasingly healthy, well-rounded food choices.   In addition to a greater variety of fruits and vegetables, we can  help restore nutritious dairy options in schools. My bill, the Whole  Milk for Healthy Kids Act, would allow both flavored and nonflavored  milk back into our Nation's school cafeterias. Additionally, the School  Milk Nutrition Act would further expand milk options for students and  help reverse the decline of milk consumption in schools.   While we can all be advocates for healthy diets and good nutrition, I  would like to specifically recognize the registered dietitian  nutritionists who are one of our most valuable resources in the pursuit  of reliable food and nutrition information.   Next week, on March 11, we celebrate Registered Dietitian  Nutritionist Day and thank these individuals for their role in building  strong, healthy families and communities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  the great work of the Special Olympics.   Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting with Special Olympics  athletes from Souderton Area High School, a Unified Sports school.   Schools that participate in Unified Sports pair students with and  without disabilities to promote inclusion through a shared love of  sports. Athlete Kevin Lezynski and his unified partner Jon Booz stopped  by my office recently to share their experiences with the Pennsylvania  Special Olympics.   The Special Olympics is a fantastic organization representing more  than 5 million athletes that teaches the value of good sportsmanship.  Because of the Special Olympics, individuals with intellectual  disabilities are given opportunities to not only strengthen their  physical fitness, but to strengthen the lifelong friendships made with  fellow athletes along the way.   I would like to wish Kevin and Jon the best of luck in their future  competitions, and to all of the other brave  [[Page H1465]]  Pennsylvania Special Olympics athletes and their Unified Sports  partners.                            ____________________
