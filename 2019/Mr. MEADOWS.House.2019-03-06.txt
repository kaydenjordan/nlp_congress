 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, let's be clear: H.R. 1 takes money from hardworking  American taxpayers and puts it straight in the pockets of politicians.   Let me be abundantly clear: This bill that the Democrats have  proposed provides taxpayer funding for Federal campaigns, Mr. Chair.   By voting for this bill, the Democrats are voting to take the  American hardworking taxpayers' money and actually give it back to be  used for their own campaigns. By voting for this bill, the Democrats  are saying, ``We deserve to stay elected.''   This is a money grab for politicians. This unfairly benefits elected  incumbents. It protects career politicians. Under the guise of campaign  finance reform and dark money reform, this 600-page bill does nothing  but fill the campaign coffers of people who have already been elected.   Not only that, this bill now includes a tax stuck in last night as a  manager's amendment in Rules. Yes, they are wanting to tax American  citizens to make sure that they get reelected and put money back in  their own campaign.   Mr. Chair, if this is how the majority party believes that we are  going to get transparency in Congress, it is not doing it. It is not  living up to that.   I find it even interesting, because it seems to trample on our First  Amendment rights to speak freely and voluntarily participate in the  process that we hold as a privilege of electing our elected leaders. To  top it off, Mr. Chair,  [[Page H2401]]  they want you and every hardworking American taxpayer to pay for it.   Now, I can see it coming up, because it is going to come very soon,  and they may talk about all the wonderful virtues of this particular  bill, but when they vote for it, they are actually voting to send  taxpayer moneys to get me reelected. So I look for that endgame when we  say: Democrats vote to give $3.5 million to reelect the Freedom Caucus  chairman.   I don't think that that is what America is all about.
