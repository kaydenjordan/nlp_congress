 Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor the life  and memory of Commissioner Dale Dees from my hometown of Fernandina  Beach, Florida.   Mr. Dees reminds me of an Alan Jackson country song, ``Small Town  Southern Man.'' He was always proud of what he had, and he was raised  on the ways of gentle kindness.   Mr. Dees was a lifelong resident of Fernandina Beach. He came from  humble beginnings, and yet he was a man of great influence. His  sincerity made everyone feel special.   As a young man, he enlisted in the United States Army, serving Uncle  Sam. Once he completed his tour of duty, he devoted himself to his  family's dry cleaner business and revolutionized dry cleaning in  Fernandina Beach by opening a drive-through option. Eventually, he  would open the town's first gun shop. He was a self-made businessman,  and he understood the value of hard work.   His pride and joy was his family. Sharon was his beloved wife of 62  years and was his soulmate. Together they were blessed with two  children, Mike and Michelle; son-in-law Shawn; two grandchildren, and  great-grandson Kamden.    Dale exemplified the meaning of leadership, and he saw public service  as a duty. He served two terms as commissioner for Fernandina Beach and  strived to make a difference in the lives of everyone in the city.   Fernandina Beach has lost a pillar of its community. Dale will be  dearly missed, and our condolences are with his family. He truly was a  small town Southern man.                            ____________________
