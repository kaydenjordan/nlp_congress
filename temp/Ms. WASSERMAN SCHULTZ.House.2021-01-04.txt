 Madam Speaker, I find the protestations of our  friends on the other side of the aisle rich, when 2 days from now they  plan to actually vote in favor of overturning the results of an  election that their party's nominee lost. So, please, spare us the  protestations about the undemocratic process that you are opposing  here.   Further, I rise to urge adoption of the rules package for the 117th  Congress. This package includes innovative proposals to modernize the  House and facilitate good policymaking.   It will establish the Select Committee on Economic Disparity and  Fairness in Growth, which will work to combat income inequality and,  critically, require committees to address inequities in marginalized  communities.   I recently proposed the creation of an advisory panel on equity and  justice in Federal spending, so I am pleased that this package  recognizes the need to dismantle the effects of systemic racism and  creates a process to address intractable inequities.   As a longtime proponent of diversity in hiring, I am glad we are  making the Office of Diversity and Inclusion permanent.   I am also pleased that the rules exempt climate legislation from  budgetary restrictions, clearing the way for  [[Page H29]]  ambitious Federal investments to combat climate change. As an  appropriator, I am eager to deploy the power of the Appropriations  Committee to fight climate change and work toward environmental  justice.   Finally, I applaud the inclusion of gender-neutral language.    Madam Speaker, finally, I applaud the  inclusion of gender-neutral language that embraces all gender  identities and reflects that this Chamber is not just a man's world  anymore.
