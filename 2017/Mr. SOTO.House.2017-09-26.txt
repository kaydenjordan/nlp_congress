 Mr. Speaker, first, to the President: Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands are in crisis. People are dying, and the time for action  is now.   Send our ships. Send our planes. Send our soldiers and our personnel  over. We need water and food and medicine. These are Americans, and we  can't turn our backs on them.   To Mr. Speaker: We need a FEMA supplemental package without delay,  and include not only Texas and Florida, but the Virgin Islands and  Puerto Rico with the same funding per capita as the States. They need  resources just like our great State of Florida.   To the Governors in many States from whom folks from Puerto Rico and  the Virgin Islands will seek refuge in the meantime: Be prepared--your  schools, your hospitals, shelters. Families in these areas, open your  homes to our friends and to your neighbors.   The United States Government must act with urgency beginning today.                            ____________________
