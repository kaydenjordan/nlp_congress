 Madam President, I rise today to talk on a subject that  is of great importance to me and of great importance to employers,  workers, consumers, and--really--everyone across this country; and that  is, the need for substantive reform of our country's Federal  environmental review and permitting process.   Now, this is a subject I have talked about a lot. I have championed  efforts to make sure that our environment and economy benefit from a  functional Federal environmental review and permitting process, and I  am now and once again leading environmental review and permitting  reform efforts through the Environment and Public Works Committee, and  I am working with my fellow Republican Senator, who is the ranking  member over on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Barrasso from  Wyoming, and we are working across the aisle with our counterparts.   Permitting reform is much more than just legislative text. It is more  than just updates to laws that have been on the books for years or  about replacing counterproductive measures implemented by the Biden  administration. It is an essential element in giving our Nation what we  need to be successful in the future.   Without permitting reform, American energy will continue to be  stalled, jeopardizing our security here at home as well as for our  allies abroad. Without permitting reform, communities across America  will struggle as they are denied access to the good-paying jobs that  they need and are capable of doing.   Without permitting reform, America will not build at all. The same  country that mined the coal, that made the steel, and that built the  democracy and led the way for industry across the world will be held  back by endless review processes, continuous and continuing court  challenges, and crippling regulations that limit our ability to be the  world leader that we know we are.   In my State of West Virginia, which is synonymous with energy  generation, we have long seen the negative effects created by a  permitting process that is designed to stall rather than to produce or  create. There are multiple real-world examples of how our broken  environmental review and permitting process is holding up my State of  West Virginia's ability to move forward, and it is impacting multiple  sectors important not only to the people of my State but also to our  national economy.   In the transportation sector in West Virginia there is Corridor H.  Corridor H is a critically important highway that West Virginia needs  to help commerce flow and to jump-start the economy in the central part  of our State and to encourage our growing tourism industry.   In the manufacturing sector, there is Nucor Steel, an innovative,  cutting-edge steel and steel products company that can't, as yet, build  their plant as quickly as the Biden administration keeps creating new  emissions guidelines.   And, in the energy sector, there is the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a  304-mile-long natural gas pipeline that is on the brink of completion-- over 90 percent completed. Yet it is unable to deliver its needed  contribution to American energy independence due to the regulatory  burdens and endless legal challenges that have gone on longer than the  actual construction of the pipeline itself.   These are just three examples in the State of West Virginia. Think  about the national impact created by outdated permitting processes, the  damage inflicted on our communities and our economy, and the  opportunities we are losing because of an administration that champions  redtape, feeds frivolous lawsuits, and whose Agencies celebrate delays  that lead to the total abandonment of critical--critical--projects.   It just doesn't make sense, quite simply. Even the renewable energy  projects and manufacturing efforts central to the Biden  administration's Agencies are being held up in permitting purgatory.   President Biden has long pledged that he will build our country back  better. Well, news flash, Mr. President. You can't ``build back  better'' if you can't build at all.   The fallout created by a broken environmental review and permitting  process further strains our sputtering economy, drives up energy prices  for consumers, negates good-paying jobs for hard-working Americans,  and, really, jeopardizes our ability to build into the future.   Now, as my constituents in West Virginia would say, well, what are  you going to do about it?   Well, from conversations we have already started in the EPW  Committee, I will soon be introducing legislation, in tandem with my  colleague Senator Barrasso, that delivers on the environmental review  and permitting process reform that our country needs. This legislation  will benefit all projects--renewable, conventional, surface  transportation, manufacturing, all of the above.   This legislation will mandate enforceable timelines with clear time  limits and predictable schedules for environmental review and  consequences when Agencies fail to reach these decisions in a timely  fashion.   This legislation will fashion guidelines that process and decide  legal challenges to projects expeditiously, instead of creating a sea  of endless litigation.   The legislation will actually amend the Clean Air Act, the Clean  Water Act, and NEPA, and fix the obstacles holding our country back  from the prosperity we deserve, while maintaining--of course,  maintaining--environmental protections.   I will emphasize, as I have many times in the past, that any  tangible, lasting environmental review and permitting solutions must be  accomplished through regular order.   Backroom deals will not cut it. In fact, they will only lead to  confusion among the American public and buyer's remorse among the  participants.   We have forged the blueprint for bipartisan compromise through the  EPW Committee time and time again, and this process should be no  different.   I encourage my colleagues in both Chambers, on both sides of the  aisle, as well as President Biden, to heed the calls from communities  across the country on the urgent need for environmental review and  permitting reform and to join in our efforts to deliver the  modifications that America's employers, workers, and consumers need.   I look forward to the continued debate on environmental review and  permitting reform, while always maintaining our shared goal of moving  America forward.   With that, I yield the floor, and I see my colleague--who has been  very instrumental in all of this, as we worked together with our  colleagues--Senator Barrasso.            Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The       yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is       what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has       reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something       without has reminded him that it can be gained. Consciously       or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and       with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow       brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United       States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward       the promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this       vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should       readily understand why public demonstrations are taking       place. The Negro has many pent up resentments and latent       frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let       him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on       freedom rides--and try to understand why he must do so. If       his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways,       they will seek expression through violence; this is not a       threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to my       people: ``Get rid of your discontent.'' Rather, I have tried       to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be       channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct       action. And now this approach is being termed extremist. But       though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as       an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I       gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label.       Was not Jesus an extremist for love: ``Love your enemies,       bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and       pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute       you.'' Was not Amos an extremist for justice: ``Let justice       roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing       stream.'' Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel:       ``I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.'' Was not       Martin Luther an extremist: ``Here I stand; I cannot do       otherwise, so help me God.'' And John Bunyan: ``I will stay       in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my       conscience.'' And Abraham Lincoln: ``This nation cannot       survive half slave and half free.'' And Thomas Jefferson:       ``We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are       created equal . . . `` So the question is not whether we will       be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will       we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists       for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of       justice? In that dramatic scene on Calvary's hill three men       were crucified. We must never forget that all three were       crucified for the same crime--the crime of extremism. Two       were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their       environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for       love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his       environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are       in dire need of creative extremists.        I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need.       Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I       suppose I should have realized that few members of the       oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate       yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the       vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong,       persistent and determined action. I am thankful, however,       that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the       meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to       it. They are still all too few in quantity, but they are big       in quality. Some--such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry       Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton       Boyle--have written about our struggle in eloquent and       prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless       streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach       infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of       policemen who view them as ``dirty nigger-lovers.'' Unlike so       many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have       recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for       powerful ``action'' antidotes to combat the disease of       segregation. Let me take note of my other major       disappointment. I have been so greatly disappointed with the       white church and its leadership. Of course, there are some       notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each       of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I       commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on       this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship       service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic       leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College       several years ago.        But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly       reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do       not say this as one of those negative critics who can always       find something wrong with the church. I say this as a       minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was       nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its       spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as       the cord of life shall lengthen.
