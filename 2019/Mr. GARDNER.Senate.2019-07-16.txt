 Madam President, I thank our colleague from Vermont for  the accommodation of this extra time.   USMCA is incredibly important to the State of Colorado. Colorado is a  pro-trade State. We have about 750,000 trade-related jobs in Colorado.  Of those 750,000 jobs, almost 250,000 are related to trade with Mexico  and Canada. Nearly a quarter million of Colorado's workers are there  because of trade with Canada and Mexico. It is a nearly $5 billion  share of our economy--that is, the total number of goods, services, and  exports to Canada and Mexico. That was a couple of years ago, so that  number has obviously increased.   Of the potatoes Mexico imports from the United States, nearly half  come from Colorado. If you look at beverages, 97 percent of the  beverages Mexico imports come from Colorado. If you look at crowns,  closures, seals, 96 percent of those items exported or imported by  Mexico come from Colorado. If you look at miscellaneous leather  products, the hides and other products that Mexico imports, 87 percent  of them come from Colorado.   We know NAFTA has created thousands of jobs in Colorado. We know it  has added thousands of dollars to people's incomes. We know USMCA is a  better, stronger opportunity for us to gain even more jobs, more  income, and more opportunity for the people of Colorado. So I thank  Senator Hoeven for bringing people together on the floor to talk about  the importance of free trade and particularly the passage of USMCA.   I hope our colleagues in the House will hear this call to a brighter  economic future, more trade opportunities, and greater U.S. leadership  by moving the USMCA, adopting it, and putting it forward so the Senate  can act on it and getting this agreement into law so we can actually  once again start rebuilding opportunities with trade.   I am strongly supportive of this effort. It is good for Colorado, and  it is good for this country.   I thank my colleague from North Dakota and my colleague from Vermont.
