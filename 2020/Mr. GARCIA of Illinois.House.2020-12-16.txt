 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor  Guadalupe and Maria Lopez, who were taken from us by COVID-19 in  Chicago only a few weeks ago.   Like thousands during this pandemic, their children--Erica, Richie,  and Andy--weren't even able to say a proper good-bye.   Guadalupe and Maria were loving parents, grandparents, and active  members of the community who raised their family in Archer Heights in  Chicago.   Lupe, as most people knew him, was a beloved 911 dispatcher for 33  years. Chicago police officers described him as a ``voice of security  and reassurance'' who guided them on the radio through some of the most  dangerous situations. Colleagues remember him as always ready to help  jump-start a car or change a tire, even after a long, stressful shift.   Maria owned an income tax service in my neighborhood of Little  Village. She served the community and, particularly, immigrants with  kindness and dedication.  [[Page H7162]]    Lupe and Maria's marriage was a love story, and their children and  grandchildren were the center of their universe. They are reunited in  Heaven.    My wife, Evelyn, and I are keeping the Lopez family in our prayers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, we are close to finalizing a  relief package, but I ask my colleagues: Relief for whom?   A relief package without survival checks is not a relief package at  all, nor is a relief package that leaves out millions of immigrants and  their families. Any deal that we strike must include survival checks to  families and immigrants, and mixed-status families must be included.   Earlier this year, countless families that I represent were denied  stimulus checks, including U.S. citizens whose spouses are immigrants.  We even excluded children who may have an immigrant parent.   How in the world did we exclude U.S. citizen children?   In this season of sacred holidays, I implore all of us to be  compassionate and not punish kids for their parents' status. Families  are struggling to put food on their tables and keep roofs over their  heads.   Circumstances are dire. We need to put money directly into working  families' pockets. I urge my colleagues that any relief package must  include survival checks for everyone, including immigrant children.                            ____________________
