 Mr. Speaker, right now crime throughout  America is on the rise. One year ago, Democrats across our country  began their calls to defund the police. And now, today, we are seeing  the sad reality that their words and actions have had deadly  consequences throughout American communities.   Last year, over a dozen U.S. cities set dismal new records for the  number of murders that have occurred in their streets. What we are  seeing right now is more drugs, more carjackings, more violence, and  more crime. And through all of it, our police officers have been forced  not only to battle this new wave of lawlessness, but also they have  been fighting to keep the funding that provides the training and the  equipment that they need to keep us safe.   It is actually very simple to see, we cannot afford to defund the  police. We cannot afford to leave our communities vulnerable to crime.  It is time for liberals to take public safety seriously. It is time to  back the men and women in blue. And it is time to stand up for law  enforcement.                            ____________________
