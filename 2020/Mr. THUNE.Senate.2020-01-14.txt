 Madam President, this week we expect to vote on a War  Powers Resolution related to operations in Iran. I am pleased that the  President's demonstration of strength has restored our position of  credible deterrence. Some have challenged that the President's action  was escalatory, but the reality is that Iran had become increasingly  bold. The United States responded in self-defense, and, as the  President has said, it appears that Iran is standing down.   Hopefully Iran's tragic error in shooting down a civilian passenger  plane has served as a sobering check on the regime's activities. We  have seen thousands of Iranians rallying in the streets in recent days  protesting the bringing down of the passenger plane and calling for  change. I hope the people of Iran are able to organize and demonstrate  in safety and that their hopes and prayers for change are answered.   Soleimani's death provides an opportunity for Iran to rethink its  direction, to move away from brutally oppressing its citizens and  fomenting violence throughout the Middle East. We should encourage such  rethinking by continuing to make it clear through the sanctions the  President has imposed and other measures that we will not accept  Iranian aggression against Americans or our allies.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Louisiana (Mr. Cassidy), the Senator from North Dakota (Mr.  Cramer),  [[Page S176]]   the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from Wisconsin  (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Kennedy).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr.  Johnson) would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 2:15 p.m.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:04 p.m., recessed until 2:15 p.m. and  reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mrs.  CAPITO).                            ____________________
