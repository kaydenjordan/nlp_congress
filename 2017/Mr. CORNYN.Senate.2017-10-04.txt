The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Cochran), the Senator from Nevada (Mr.  Heller), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    Mr. President, beginning today, the Senate Budget  Committee will take the next step in our effort to enact pro-growth tax  reform, this time by marking up a budget resolution.   The committee's work follows the release last week of our unified  framework--the tax blueprint on how to create jobs and how to put more  money back in the pockets of the hard-working Americans who earn it.   Even though the framework is just 1 week old, there are some who are  imagining the worst-case scenario. Rumors are spreading like wildfire.  Last week, the Tax Policy Center fanned the flames when it published a  report analyzing the plan--which, I want to emphasize, hasn't been  written yet. Let me say that again. The Tax Policy Center published a  report criticizing a plan which hasn't been written yet.   This alleged or so-called nonpartisan think tank has looked into its  crystal ball and now claims to be able to see the future, and it said  the future doesn't look very good. The tax plan, it says, will be a  resounding flop. Well, give me a break. I, for one, am sick and tired  of this sort of pessimism parading as expertise--people talking about  things they know nothing about and claiming to be the experts. It is  pretty common here, in Washington, DC, you might have noticed.   It is not helpful to assume the worst prematurely and to condemn this  important exercise before we are even starting, and it is irresponsible  to masquerade biased, partisan analysis as somehow objective.   As the Wall Street Journal wrote a couple of days ago, in response to  the Tax Policy Center's economists, they made at least two baseless  claims: first, that our proposal would ``reduce federal revenues by  $2.4 trillion over the first ten years and $3.2 trillion over the  subsequent decade''; second, the top 1 percent of taxpayers would  ``receive about 50 percent of the total tax benefit.''   These statistics were pretty quotable and indeed raged like a prairie  fire across the news media in our country, especially when the media is  predisposed to believe the worst, without any question or semblance of  skepticism. After all, the Tax Policy Center's report made for easy  headlines, reciting the same tired refrains we have all heard before  that are all too predictable; that, somehow, our tax plan is only  designed to help the rich.   Apparently, the temptation was just too great to resist, even though  the report didn't have a real author since no self-respecting economist  wanted his or her name attached to it. As the Wall Street Journal  pointed out, however, last week's tax blueprint was just that--a  starting place, a plan, a framework, and nothing more. It excluded many  important data points which would be important to a real analysis.   For example, the income ranges for the three consolidated tax  brackets, those weren't in the blueprint. The value of the expanded  child tax credit and when it would be phased out, that wasn't in the  blueprint either, and you would need to know that information in order  to make a reasoned, logical analysis. The blueprint also doesn't  mention tax rates for small businesses and what deductions will be  eliminated as part of the base broadening.  [[Page S6299]]    As we all know, an army of lobbyists, lawyers, and other folks have,  since 1986, larded the Tax Code with a wide variety of deductions,  credits, and other special preferences. What we need to do is clear out  some of that thicket so we can lower the rates for everybody, so  everybody gets a tax cut, and I mean everybody.   It is not going to be easy because we can imagine that army of  lobbyists descending upon Capitol Hill trying to protect the special  deals they were able to carve out of the Tax Code since 1986, but we  have to do it.   None of these facts that would be important in order to conduct a  reasoned and objective analysis was included in the framework, but all  of them would have great potential to greatly move the final numbers.  These, and many other details, are essential for any honest fiscal  assessment of changes in our Tax Code.   When will we begin to see some of those numbers? We need to pass the  budget resolution out of the Budget Committee this week--which we will.  Then, after Columbus Day, we will come back and have a debate and a  vote-arama to pass the budget resolution, which will equip us with the  technical tools we need in order to pass a reconciliation bill.   Then the real work is going to be occurring in the Finance Committee  on this side of the Capitol, where we will take the chairman's mark-- the original bill which Senator Hatch will introduce at the committee-- which will fill in a lot of these details. I predict that will be  sometime around the third or maybe fourth week of this month.   Then we are going to have an amendment process. The real question in  my mind is, Will our Democratic colleagues participate and make this a  bipartisan bill? I hope they will.    I also want to mention two other related points that deserve mention  but which were left out of the Tax Policy's report. One is, the  committees in Congress will actually have the ability to come up with  the details I mentioned. That will happen in the Ways and Means  Committee in the House and in the Finance Committee in the Senate.  There will be, as there should be, discussion, deliberation, and  compromise as the normal legislative process works out.   There have been many around Capitol Hill who have said we don't have  enough ``regular order.'' What that means is, we need to conduct the  normal legislative process and have the committees actually do what  they are designed to do--which is to have hearings and vote on  amendments and pass the bill out so it is available to be heard on the  floor of the Senate. Then the Senate has a chance to amend it, vote on  it, and debate it.   The second point I want to make is, any analysis of tax reform must  consider what will be the impact on economic growth that will result  from it. As the Journal stated, if the rate of GDP growth speeds up  from the Obama administration's pace of 2 percent a year to 3 percent,  incomes would rise and revenues would increase to the Treasury by some  $2.5 trillion. That is what is most often underlooked, including by  some of the people who score these bills.   If we are successful in passing pro-growth tax reform and tax cuts  and we can get this sleeping giant of an economy awake and roaring  again just to get it to 3 percent--which is below the average growth of  the economy over the last three decades--just at 3 percent, it would  put $2.5 trillion more in the Treasury. That would be great because it  would help us not only pay our bills, it would help us pay down the  deficit and the debt.   Obviously, these are important factors to acknowledge. The best way  to accomplish meaningful tax reform is to lower rates and simplify  provisions across the board, to give Americans more take-home pay and  have to spend less time hiring somebody just to complete their tax  return. We can't simply throw up our hands, do nothing, and accept the  status quo because American workers and job creators can't afford the  status quo.   I am optimistic about the framework that has been released and look  forward to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee in the  days and weeks ahead. What we have now is a useful starting point, and  we need to fill in the blanks--and we will--so then we can have a  debate based on the facts, not based on somebody's wild, fevered  imagination about what the tax bill might look like.   One last point on that. We have the highest tax rate in the world for  corporations and businesses. This used to be something that even the  President of the United States, Barack Obama, back in 2011 acknowledged  and said we need to reduce that in order to be competitive globally. We  know too many of our jobs are moving overseas.   I mentioned yesterday that IBM, one of the largest businesses in the  world, has more employees in India than they have in the United States.  Now, there are probably varied reasons for that, including our Tax  Code. Some of it is access to highly trained workers, lower costs of  operation, and the like, but our Tax Code is a self-inflicted economic  wound for our country, and the people who pay the price are the people  whose wages are stagnant or people who are looking for a job and can't  find one. We need to put more money back in their pocket, let them keep  more of what they earn, and get this economy growing again.
