 Madam President, in a moment, I am going to make a motion  by unanimous consent to call up, and hopefully confirm, significant  appointments in the Department of Defense.   We are in the midst of a war in Europe right now. It is hard to  imagine that, and yet it is the case. Every day we see atrocities  committed by Vladimir Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine, but every  day we also see the concerted effort of the United States and NATO  allies and other nations to provide dramatic support for the Ukrainian  defense force and the Ukrainian people.   We honor the Ukrainians' resolve and heroism, and we feel proud of  the role that the United States and other nations are playing in  providing defense. And I hope we will take additional defense support  up on the floor in the days to come. However, this is not easy work to  do.   One of the positions that I am going to be seeking a UC on is the DOD  Assistant Secretary for Sustainment, Christopher Lowman, who is a  Virginian. He and his family live in Fredericksburg.   Mr. Lowman is, according to the committee, completely  noncontroversial and very much desired in this position.   He was born in Germany, in a military family, grew up in Virginia,  went to college in New Jersey. He was a U.S. marine beginning in 1984,  and then after his Active Marine service, entered the Army civil  service as an Army maintenance management intern in 1989. And he has  been with the Army ever since.   His specialty is logistics. So this Assistant Secretary of  Sustainment is kind of the peak logistics officer in the Pentagon.   He previously was the Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of  the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology. OK. That is a  title that is--you know, what does that actually mean? I will tell you  what it means. When the United States is trying to get historic amounts  of military aid across a contested border from allied countries into a  war zone, we need people who know logistics. It may not be the sexiest  part of the military mission, but it is part of the mission that is  absolutely critical, and it is part of the mission where the U.S.  military is second to none in the world.   If you wonder why the Russian military's grand plans to topple  Ukraine in just a couple of days came to naught, you first say it is  Ukrainian heroism, and you second say it is the support of our allies,  but, third, you have to point out the Russian military has demonstrated  that they haven't mastered logistics. The inability to maintain supply  chains, the inability to do proper maintenance of tanks and other  vehicles is one of the reasons that the Russians have not been able to  accomplish their aims. So what this war in Europe is demonstrating is  militaries that have the capacity to do logistics and provide supplies  to people on the front end of the fight are critical to success.   Given the fact that the United States is the key to pulling together  the international effort to provide support to the Ukrainian defense  force, and given the fact that that mission depends upon having the  best logistics in the world, why would we leave the chief logistics  official at the Pentagon position vacant in the middle of a war when  the United States is playing this heroic role?   For that reason, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following  nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 477, 599, 777, 779, 780, 781, 861,  and 886; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without  intervening action or debate; that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; that any statements related to  the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate resume  legislative session.    Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?   It strikes me that the Senator's objection is you do not want to have  this candidate--the bloc of them advanced without a vote. If I can  guarantee that you get a vote on these nominations, will you drop your  objection?    Yeah. I mean, I know you will vote no. You have made it  plain. But if I can guarantee you would get a vote, will you drop your  objection?    Yeah.    Yes.    And that is what my point is. We are not fast-tracking  these without a vote. This is a motion to allow a vote en bloc on the  floor. So you will have an opportunity to vote against Mr. Chaudhary or  all of these. This is not a motion to immediately approve them without  a vote. It is just a motion to bring them up so that you and others can  vote on these nominees. That is all I am seeking.   And so my request, basically, would guarantee you a vote on all of  these nominations if you drop your objection.    It would be a--yes. It would be en bloc, but it is a  recorded vote, is my understanding.   And, again, Madam President, just to clarify, my motion is only that  the Senate be allowed to vote on these nominees: Alex Wagner for  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force; Ashish Vazirani for Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense; Christopher Lowman, Assistant Secretary of  Defense; Lester Martinez-Lopez, Assistant Secretary of Defense; Agnes  Schaefer, Assistant Secretary of the Army; Franklin Parker, Assistant  Secretary of the Navy; Musetta Tia Johnson, Judge of the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Armed Forces; and Ravi Chaudhary, Assistant Secretary  of the Air Force.   I understand my colleague will vote no, but all I am moving is for  the Senate to be able to have a vote on these nominees.    My motion is to consider them, yes, en bloc; but it would  be a recorded vote, is my understanding.    I appreciate the objection being heard, and I would just  say to my colleague, I hope we could work out a deal that would enable  us to have a floor vote where my colleague could vote as he chooses on  these nominees. This was not an attempt to bypass a vote; it was just  an effort to have a vote where everybody can be recorded on the  nominees. I hope we can work that out.    I yield back all time on the Democrats' side.                                Vote on Motion
