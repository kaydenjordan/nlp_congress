 Mr. Speaker, let me start out by saying: To  God be the glory. I want to first thank God for giving me this great  opportunity. I want to thank my family; Pastor John Pitts; a special  thank you to my colleagues Brenda Lawrence, Congressman Brad Sherman,  Sheila Jackson Lee, Chairman Cedric Richmond; all of the Congressional  Black Caucus; and all of the Michigan delegation. To the leader and to  all of my supporters, volunteers, my church family, the 13th  Congressional District, and the State of Michigan, I say thank you.   This truly is a humble feeling to stand here and be sworn in amongst  the men and women who do the work every day for the United States of  America.   The voices of constituents of the 13th Congressional District have  been heard, and I am now seated as their Representative of the United  States of America. It is time to get to work. I am ready to roll up my  sleeves during this lame-duck session, do what is expected of me, and  join my colleagues in getting the job done for the 13th Congressional  District and for the United States of America.   God bless the 13th Congressional District. God bless the United  States of America.                            ____________________
