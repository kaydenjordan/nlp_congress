 Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 469         Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives       request the Senate to return to the House the joint       resolution (H.J. Res. 76) entitled ``Granting the consent and       approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the       State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to a enter       into a compact relating to the establishment of the       Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.''    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
