 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, when you serve as the Secretary of  Treasury, you are charged with a variety of responsibilities, and right  at the center of your duties is to address taxes. This is an area that  the nominee to head the Treasury Department, Mr. Steven Mnuchin, waded  into very early on after his nomination became public.   News leaked on November 29 of last year that Mr. Mnuchin was the  President-elect's choice for Secretary of the Treasury. The very next  day, Mr. Mnuchin appeared on a CNBC program and confirmed his  selection. During an extended interview with CNBC, he introduced what I  have come to call the Mnuchin rule. I will quote Mr. Mnuchin directly  with respect to what he said: ``Any reductions we have in upper income  taxes would be offset by less deductions, so there would be no absolute  tax cut for the upper class.''   I will repeat that last part of the Mnuchin rule: ``no absolute tax  cut for the upper class.''   Mr. Mnuchin is the President's nominee for Treasury Secretary. This  is a position that has been held by American economic giants like  Alexander Hamilton, Albert Gallatin, Salmon Chase, Henry Morgenthau and  Lloyd Bentsen. When a nominee for Treasury Secretary makes a pledge  like Mr. Mnuchin's, it really ought to mean something. It ought to  stand for something.   Unfortunately, it already looks as though the Mnuchin rule is on the  ropes. The very first act of the 115th Congress and a unified  Republican government, repealing the Affordable Care Act, shatters the  Mnuchin rule.   The Affordable Care Act repeal scheme that Republicans kicked off  months ago, in my view, is a Trojan horse of tax breaks for the most  fortunate. Nobody outside the top 4 or 5 percent of earners would get  any of that break. Most of it would go to households in the top 1  percent of earners--even then, the top one-tenth of 1 percent--and it  is paid for by taking insurance coverage and tax cuts for health care  literally out of the hands of millions of working people.   Then it is back for another whack at the Mnuchin rule later this  year. Last week, the New York Times published a story talking about Mr.  Mnuchin, which said that ``his guarantee appears impossible to fulfill  either under the tax overhaul that the House Republicans are pushing or  similar, sketchier proposals that Mr. Trump has offered.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the article titled ``Treasury Nominee Vows No Tax Cut for Rich. Math  Says the Opposite.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               [Feb. 9, 2017]     Treasury Nominee Vows No Tax Cut for Rich. Math Says the Opposite.                            (By Patricia Cohen)         The newly christened ``Mnuchin rule''--the assurance given       by the Treasury nominee Steven T. Mnuchin that ``there would       be no absolute tax cut for the upper class''--seems as if it       was made to be broken.        Mr. Mnuchin initially made the statement during an       interview on CNBC in November,  [[Page S1097]]       after President Trump chose him for the cabinet. At Mr.       Mnuchin's confirmation hearing, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon       Democrat, rebranded the comment as a ``rule,'' transforming a       throwaway line into a formal pledge.        Whether it will be kept may become clearer in two or three       weeks--the timing Mr. Trump mentioned Thursday for delivering       a ``phenomenal'' tax plan.        Although Mr. Mnuchin said any rate reductions at the top       would be offset by the closing of fat loopholes, his       guarantee appears impossible to fulfill either under the tax       overhaul that the House Republicans are pushing or similar,       sketchier proposals that Mr. Trump has offered.        Redesigning the tax code with an eye fixed on lower rates       has been a Republican mission for decades, and one that Mr.       Trump adopted. That prospect, combined with a promised       regulatory retreat, has pumped up the stock market and fueled       optimism among business leaders.        At the same time, the president has raised expectations       among his working-class supporters that ``the rich will pay       their fair share,'' and that ``special-interest loopholes       that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and for       people like me, but unfair to American workers'' will be       eliminated. Mr. Mnuchin, soon to be one of the       administration's top economic policy officials, promised ``a       big tax cut for the middle class.''        Yet analyses of the president's and the House Republicans'       plans consistently conclude that the wealthy will receive the       largest tax cuts by far.        Start with the House blueprint, which at the moment is the       closest thing to a working draft that exists. The nonpartisan       Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and       Brookings Institution, found ``high-income taxpayers would       receive the biggest cuts, both in dollar terms and as a       percentage of income.''        How big? ``Three-quarters of the tax cuts would benefit the       top 1 percent of taxpayers,'' if the plan were put into       effect this year, it said. The highest-income households--the       top 0.1 percent--would get ``an average tax cut of about $1.3       million, 16.9 percent of after-tax income.''        Those in the middle fifth of incomes would get a tax cut of       almost $260, or 0.5 percent, while the poorest would get       about $50.        That split would worsen down the road, the Tax Policy       Center says: ``In 2025 the top 1 percent of households would       receive nearly 100 percent of the total tax reduction.''        Those wary of any potential liberal bias could turn to the       conservative-leaning Tax Foundation. Its analysis found a       smaller gap between the wealthy and everyone else, but a gap       nonetheless. The foundation concluded that four out of five       taxpayers would see only a 0.2 to 0.5 percent increase in       after-tax income, while those in the top 1 percent of the       income scale would save at least 10 times as much, or 5.3       percent. That's nearly $40,000 extra for those at the top,       compared to $67 for those smack dab in the middle of the       income scale.        ``The Mnuchin rule is already being broken as Republicans       look to strip away hundreds of billions of dollars in       Affordable Care Act tax credits for working Americans to pay       for a giant tax break for the wealthy,'' Senator Wyden said.       ``Bottom line is it's unfair to cut benefits that the middle       class depends on, all so the wealthy pay a lower rate.''        Mr. Mnuchin did not respond to a request for comment.        Republicans argue their plan makes everyone a winner--that       lower taxes will unleash an enormous swell of economic       growth, raising wages, incomes and tax revenue all around.        The historical record does not offer much support for the       claim that slashing taxes for the most affluent creates       growth. Yet even assuming the rosiest of forecasts, the top 1       percent, according to the Tax Foundation, would still receive       close to a $l00,000 tax cut--32 times as much as a middle-      income family.        Mr. Mnuchin has offered his own formula for adhering to the       standard he laid down, explaining that ``any reductions we       have in upper-income taxes would be offset by less       deductions.''        That would require some otherworldly mathematical magic,       however.        Consider the list of proposals that would reduce taxes on       the rich:        Cut the top income to 33 percent, from 39.6 percent.        Cut taxes on capital gains, 70 percent of which flow to the       top 1 percent.        Eliminate the estate tax, which applies to a tiny number of       people, couples that have estates bigger than $10.8 million.        Eliminate the 3.8 percent surtax on high earners'       investment income that has been used to subsidize health care       for poorer Americans.        End the alternative minimum tax, which currently limits       deductions for high earners.        Lower taxes on cash flow and income that passes from small       businesses to their owners, which also primarily benefits       wealthier Americans.        Now, what deductions could be eliminated that would offset       all those cuts at the top? There aren't many, said Alan       Viard, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise       Institute. If Republicans insist on lowering taxes on top       wages, capital gains, estates and cash-flow and pass-through       income as advertised, ``there's not a lot of latitude to       limit itemized deductions further,'' Mr. Viard said.        Any plan to curb itemized deductions would be partly offset       by Mr. Trump's plan to increase the standard deduction.       Curtailing mortgage deductions for the most expensive homes       is probably a good idea, Mr. Viard said, but that isn't going       to do much to raise revenue from those at the top of the       income pyramid, and the deduction is already roughly limited       to the interest paid on $1 million in mortgage debt.        Such alternative ideas, however, assume that the Mnuchin       rule will have a meaningful impact on what the White House       will propose or Congress will debate. Not everyone is       convinced that it will. As Mr. Viard said, ``I don't know how       much interest there is in fulfilling that statement by       Mnuchin, however it's interpreted.''     After breaking the Mnuchin rule once, the majority is now  planning to fast-track a second tax break for the wealthy. This one  will be even larger; in fact, it could be 10 times bigger or more. My  guess is that a lot of Americans are wondering what has happened to all  the campaign talk about fixing the Tax Code and really going out there  and standing up for the working people. As the Republican nominee, the  President said he was the guy to repair the country's broken tax  system. The particulars of the Trump plan were buried deep in the  business pages and on his Web site, but the broad strokes of the  message were pitched in rallies across the Nation: Donald Trump alone  knew how to do the job because he had taken advantage of the rules  himself, and he was ready to crack down on those who weren't paying  their fair share.   One of the few specifics Donald Trump offered on the stump was that  he would close the carried interest loophole. That, of course, has been  a favorite of investment fund managers. It would be great if it were  actually true. In reality, the promise turned out to be pretty much  just a head fake. Rather than closing the loophole and asking  investment fund managers to pay their fair share, the Trump plan  actually gives them a 25-percent tax cut. In fact, the Trump plan  slashes tax rates for corporations and the wealthy across the board at  a cost of trillions of dollars.   The President and Mr. Mnuchin might defend this plan by claiming it  is a tax cut for the middle class, so I want to spend just a few  minutes checking in with that part of the plan. If we read the fine  print, we will notice that one of the Trump tax plan's big casualties  is something called head of household status. That is a particularly  important benefit for a lot of middle-income taxpayers because it  reduces their bills. What would it mean for head of household status to  go away? Millions of working Americans, mostly single parents, would  get hit with tax increases.   Furthermore, the Trump plan eliminates key personal exemptions for  millions of other middle-income families. It pushes a lot of families  into higher tax brackets than they are in today. The administration  touts its proposals for a larger standard deduction and a new child  care tax credit as the cure-all for its tax increases on the middle  class and on working people, but the math just doesn't add up. Families  who are struggling to get ahead today are going to pay higher taxes  tomorrow.   So let's recap the Trump tax plan: a multitrillion-dollar tax break  for the wealthy and corporations and a gut punch of higher taxes for  working families.   At this point, it would be generous to say that the Mnuchin rule is  now on life support. If we wanted to design a tax plan to push more  Americans out of the economic winners circle, the Trump plan is what  you would come up with. When I look at the Trump tax plan that Mr.  Mnuchin would be in charge of spearheading, it looks to me as though  the administration has zero interest in cleaning out the rot that is  right at the heart of America's tax system.   Here is what it is all about, in my view. The Tax Code today is a  tale of two systems. If you are a wage earner--a welder in Portland or  a nurse in Louisiana--your taxes come straight out of your paycheck.  They are compulsory--no special deals. You can even see the numbers  right on your pay stub. Once or twice a month, out it comes. There are  no special tax-dodging strategies or loopholes to winnow down the tax  bill for the welder in Portland or the nurse in Louisiana. You can't  set up a John Doe, Inc., in a Cayman Islands P.O. box to shield your  income from taxes.  [[Page S1098]]    But the rules are different for the powerful and the well connected.  At their disposal are huge armies of lawyers and accountants who  specialize in tax games. They specialize in tax tricks. With the right  advice, the most fortunate individuals and corporations in the country  can decide how much tax to pay and when to pay it. If anybody wonders  why people in America feel the tax system is rigged and the rules are  stacked against them, this is a big part of the answer. I intend to  talk more about that, but I want to come back to highlight the  difference between the welder in Portland and the nurse in Louisiana.   When those hard-working Americans are out there working for a wage  and once or twice a month have their taxes taken right out of their  paycheck, they know they aren't getting anything special. It is  compulsory. It is mandatory. They see it on their paychecks. Yet they  get lots of news coverage and articles and the like, and they will see  that for those who are fortunate, instead of paying taxes in a  mandatory and compulsory way, they pretty much get to decide what they  are going to pay, when they are going to pay it, and maybe nothing at  all. It seems to me that as we look at the nominee for Treasury  Secretary, we get a pretty good example of how it does play out in  terms of taxes for those fortunate few and how his taxes stand in sharp  contrast to that welder in Portland or that nurse in Louisiana.   Not long after ending a 17-year run at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Mnuchin  opened a hedge fund called Dune Capital in 2004. He set up an outpost  in Anguilla and the Cayman Islands. That is not a move you make for the  infrastructure or the ease of the commute. It is about a zero-percent  tax rate.   During Mr. Mnuchin's hearing, he claimed that having those overseas  funds benefited American nonprofits. When he testified in front of the  Finance Committee, he said: You know, the main thing we are doing with  these overseas funds is we are helping churches and pension funds. But  documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission show something  quite different. In some cases, 100 percent of his investors were from  outside of the United States, and setting up overseas allowed Mr.  Mnuchin to help them avoid paying taxes. What was the end effect? Dune  Capital was heavily invested in movies. So millions of dollars in  profits from Hollywood exports, like the movie ``Avatar,'' were  funneled to an offshore web of entities and investors, giving him the  chance to skirt a U.S. tax bill.   At a more recent point in his career, Mr. Mnuchin's bank was up for a  merger. The deal had the potential to be a personal windfall for him  and a small circle of others. A foundation Mr. Mnuchin chaired  reportedly used tax-exempt dollars to fund a write-in campaign pushing  for the deal's approval. During the public comment period on a  potential merger, this is pretty much the equivalent of stuffing the  ballot box.   Now, as a nominee for a Cabinet position, Mr. Mnuchin could be in  line for a special elective Federal tax deferral on money made by  selling stocks and bonds. That is the very definition of getting to pay  what you want, when you want. We hear a frequent and common defense  when these kinds of tax tricks are brought into public view. It is true  that the people who use them are following the laws on the books, but  the outrage in our tax system, as I have said on this Senate floor, is  what is legal. That is the real outrage with the American tax system,  and it is outrageous that the Senate has allowed obvious gamesmanship  to stay legal. It is outrageous that the administration and its chosen  nominee for Treasury have shown no interest in changing it.    When you are the Treasury Secretary, one of your paramount  obligations is overseeing taxes. The last time the United States  overhauled its Tax Code--this was in 1986--the Reagan Treasury  Department played a huge role in that effort, and one of the core  principles of that reform was treating wages and wealth the same way.  Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a tax reform bill based  on fairness. It said that the wage earner--that nurse in Louisiana or  welder in Portland--their income and the income of those who made their  money in finance and on Wall Street and the like would be treated the  same. I see no indication that this administration is prepared to  repeat that formula.   The campaign promise to fix the broken, dysfunctional Tax Code-- Donald Trump's campaign promise--lured in a lot of voters. When I heard  that Mnuchin rule the first time, I said that sounds pretty good--no  net tax break for those who are the most fortunate. That sounds pretty  appealing. The tax plans that the administration and Republicans in  Congress have on offer now will not undo the disgusting unfairness that  is right at the heart of the American Tax Code. In fact, it is only  going to get worse.   This issue has to be at the center of the debate on Mr. Mnuchin's  nomination. I am particularly troubled by the fact that the evidence  shows that the Mnuchin rule is already on the ropes.   I intend to oppose this nominee. I urge my colleagues to do the same.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, there are communities across this country  that are still waiting for the recovery from the great recession to  show up. In many of those towns and cities, the storefronts are boarded  up, the factories are shuttered, and, in what could be the most lasting  scar of the crisis, homes--many homes--have been foreclosed. A lot of  people in those communities cast their votes in November based on a  Trump message that real change was coming.   Heads are going to be spinning tonight with the news from the Senate.  In just a few minutes, this body will vote to confirm as Treasury  Secretary Steven Mnuchin, known by many as the ``foreclosure king.''  That is whom the President chose as his Treasury Secretary. Mr. Mnuchin  turned the bank he bought into a cash cow, and they set a land speed  record for foreclosures.   I have supported nominees for this position from both parties. I  voted for Paul O'Neill. I voted for John Snow, and Hank Paulson, who  served under President George W. Bush. I don't expect to see eye to eye  on each issue with every Treasury Secretary. I do expect to have  confidence that the Treasury Secretary is going to work on behalf of  all Americans--all Americans--and not just the well healed, not just  the fortunate, not just the powerful.   After considering Mr. Mnuchin's qualifications and background, I just  don't believe he would be that kind of Treasury Secretary. In Mr.  Mnuchin's response to questions from members of the Finance Committee,  he denied that his bank, OneWest, engaged in a practice known as robo- signing. The public record says that is just dead wrong. In fact, a  OneWest vice president who worked under Mr. Mnuchin, Erica Johnson- Seck, admitted under oath that she ran an office that churned out  roughly 6,000 sets of foreclosure documents a week.   She said she personally signed more than 750 disclosure documents a  week without even reading them, and there was no notary present during  the process. That is a violation of the law. When asked how much time  she spent executing each foreclosure document, Ms. Johnson-Seck  replied:         I changed my signature considerably. It's just an E now. So       not more than 30 seconds.    Now, on the eve of the Finance Committee mark-up for Mr. Mnuchin, the  Columbus Dispatch in Ohio reported documented examples of robo-signing  in Ohio. Now, on the eve of Mr. Mnuchin's confirmation vote in the  Senate, another such story has broken. This time it is in the State of  Washington, more evidence of robo-signing that directly contradicts  what Mr. Mnuchin told the Finance Committee and the public.   Mr. Mnuchin also withheld foreclosure data requested by two  Democratic members of the Finance Committee, Senators Brown and Casey.  He did, apparently, give similar information to Senator Heller, one of  the committee's Republican members. That is on top of $100 million  worth of property and more than a dozen positions with various business  entities missing from his disclosures to the Finance Committee.   My own view is, if not for the committee's minority investigations  team, I don't believe any of that information, none of it--$100  million, the other disclosures--would have ever come to light.   I am going to turn from missing disclosures and misleading testimony  to a broken promise. The day after news of Mr. Mnuchin's nomination was  leaked, he appeared on television and, in effect, debuted a new tax  policy. I have come to call it the Mnuchin rule, and I will quote Mr.  Mnuchin directly with respect to what he said.   Mr. Mnuchin said: ``Any reductions we have in upper income taxes  would be offset by less deductions, so there would be no absolute tax  cut for the upper class.''   I will repeat the last part of the Mnuchin rule: ``no absolute tax  cut for the upper class.''   When I first called this the Mnuchin rule during the Finance  Committee's hearing on his nomination, Mr. Mnuchin said he took it as a  great compliment, comparing it to the Volcker rule and the Buffett  rule. Well, you would think a fellow who proudly embraced having a rule  named after himself would actually stick to it.   The Mnuchin rule didn't last for very long before it was abandoned.  The very first act of the 115th Congress in a unified Republican  government, repealing the Affordable Care Act, would shatter the  Mnuchin rule. Then it is set to take another hit later this year. That  is with the majority working on plans to fast-track a second, even  bigger tax break for those who are the most fortunate. The Trump plan,  in fact, would hit millions of middle-income families with tax  increases by wiping out key personal exemptions and eliminating head of  household filing status.   So I want to be really clear what this means to people in Oklahoma  and Oregon and all across the country, working families: Working  families would get hurt by the Trump plan. They would lose key personal  exemptions. They would eliminate the head of household filing status  while those who were more fortunate would be in a position to get tax  breaks, additional tax breaks beyond what they already have in the Tax  Code.   The fact is, the Tax Code today is a tale of two systems. For the  firefighter in Coos Bay, OR, or the retail worker in Roseburg, your  taxes come straight out of each and every paycheck. That is the way it  works in Oklahoma, the way it works all across the country. The Tax  Code for working people is compulsory. Once or twice a month, your  taxes come directly out of your paycheck--no special dodges, no special  loopholes. Nobody is able to hide their pay in a Cayman Islands account  if they are a firefighter or a retail worker.   But there is a very different Tax Code in America for the well- connected and the powerful. They have a whole array of lawyers and  accountants who specialize in helping them shrink their tax bills. And  with the right advice, the fact is, those people can, to a great  extent, decide what they are going to pay, when they are going to pay  it, and sometimes be in a position to not pay much, if anything at all.   The fact is, the tax system today punishes working Americans because  it treats them very differently than it treats the most fortunate. And  the administration and the majority in Congress don't seem to be doing  much in terms of fixing this disparity.  [[Page S1121]]    The Mnuchin rule just hasn't held up. It is beyond being on the  ropes. It is not going anywhere at all. In fact, the early proposals  only make this extraordinary unfairness, the unfairness at the heart of  America's Tax Code, even worse.   So what we have is another Trump nominee who, in my view, doesn't  meet the test of standing up for working families in those communities  all across the country who are waiting for economic recovery to show up  in their neighborhood. They are the ones who have seen the factory  close and seen the foreclosures and seen their neighbors laid off. And  they would like to see people in these positions advocate for them,  advocate for them because they need somebody who is going to stand up  for them, and they were told in the campaign that is what they were  going to get.   The fact is, Mr. Mnuchin is yet another Trump nominee who, instead of  standing up for those working families, has a different set of  priorities and, in addition to that, has the ethics alarm bells  sounding.   He appears to be withholding information requested by Members of this  body. My view is, he misled the Finance Committee and the public about  his bank's foreclosure tactics. The Mnuchin rule--the first promise he  made, the very first promise he made on policy, which he was proud to  have described as a rule named after him, already has been broken.   So I am not going to be supporting Mr. Mnuchin to lead the Treasury  Department. I urge my colleagues as well to reject this appointment.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time  has expired.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Mnuchin  nomination?
