 Mr. Speaker, I am joined today by Jared Huffman from  California. And eventually, I think, Brendan Boyle from Philadelphia,  the home of the new NFC champions, is also going to join us.   What we are going to talk about is: What are the Republicans afraid  of? What is it they are hiding? What is it they think is going on with  respect to this investigation of the President and his ties to Russia?   It starts from the very beginning. This time last year, we asked the  President: Are you going to turn over your tax returns so that people  can see what is in your tax returns; whether you have relations with  the Russians, or who knows who?   Every President for the last 40 or 50 years has turned over their tax  returns. But, of course, the President did not turn over his tax  returns and has refused to turn over his tax returns.   The first thing you ask is: What is in there? What are you hiding?   Now, what we see is a concerted effort by the Republicans in the  Congress and in the White House to smear and disparage hardworking law  enforcement officers in the FBI, in the intelligence community, and the  Department of Justice, who have been tasked with trying to figure out  whether or not Russia involved itself criminally in our elections last  year and whether or not there is any implication of the Trump campaign  with respect to those particular efforts by the Russians.   We need to make sure that Russia does not hack into our elections,  does not participate in a way that favors one party over another or one  candidate over another.  [[Page H673]]    These investigations started and the first thing the President did  was fire Jim Comey from the FBI. Through a process, the Justice  Department then appoints a special prosecutor, a special counsel, to  continue this investigation.   Since that has occurred, there have been a couple of indictments and  a couple of plea agreements. Michael Flynn, who was the intelligence  head for the President, has faced part of this investigation. There was  Paul Manafort and Richard Gates, who were involved in the campaign, and  then George Papadopoulos.   But that is just the tip of the iceberg. All these people, both on  the Trump campaign side and all of these Russians, have played some  kind of a role, and this investigation must be pursued.   My friends on the Republican side of the aisle can complain, can  stomp their feet, can throw mud at the individuals who are asked to do  these investigations, but these investigations must continue so that  the people understand exactly what happened and to make sure that the  Russians are not allowed to participate and infiltrate and affect our  elections once again.   There are just a couple of questions: What are you afraid of? What  are you hiding? Is there a coverup of some kind here?   The bottom line is: just let our law enforcement individuals do their  detective work, do what they were asked to do, and leave them alone and  let it be done. If it exculpates and proved that nothing happened, then  great. But if there is some wrongdoing here, America needs to know  about it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from northern California (Mr.  Huffman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California for  his comments. He was talking about a memo.   One of the former chairmen of the House Intelligence Committee, a guy  named Mike Rogers, was also a panelist, I think, on a CNN program.  Apparently, this memo is going to be released today against all sorts  of norms with respect to the Intelligence Committee and classified  information. His words were, releasing a memo like this is farcical.   It is a mistake. It starts to undermine so many things with respect  to our intelligence community, the trust that we have with our allies,  and all of it to kind of put up this smoke screen. They go after the  law enforcement agents, who are the detectives on the beat. Now they  are releasing information that is incomplete and, in Mike Rogers's  words, ``farcical,'' to try to distract, divert, avoid the real  conversation, which is: What did the Russians do? How did they play in  the elections? Was there any kind of cooperation, collusion, whatever  it might be, with the Trump campaign?   We know that Bob Mueller was appointed. He has been a lifelong  Republican. Everybody embraced his position as special counsel when it  first came about, but quickly the President was  [[Page H674]]  thinking about firing him. Now people want to smear all of this: It is  a mistake.   The real question is: What are you hiding?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan  F. Boyle), my friend from Philadelphia, who is a pretty happy camper  because his Eagles are going to be playing in the Super Bowl on Sunday.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  the history lesson he just reminded us about. His words are ones that I  don't think I can add anything to.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman),  my friend, if he has anything else to add.   But I just want the Speaker to know and I want this Chamber to know  that we are not going to go away. We are not going to allow things to  be hidden. We are not going to allow things to be covered up. This has  got to run its full course, just as my friend said.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 56 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, January 30, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.
