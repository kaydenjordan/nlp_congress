 Mr. Speaker, here we are, 4 legislative days after  passing a $1.3 trillion omnibus bill that is going to blow the deficit  through the roof. And what are we going to do today? Oh, don't worry.  We are going to fix it all. We are going to vote for the balanced  budget amendment. That is right. This is going to tie our hands. This  balanced budget amendment will cure everything that ails Congress. It  is going to balance the budget. It is going to make us balance the  budget.   Mr. Speaker, there is a dictionary over here in the House of  Representatives, 30 feet from me. I suggest we go in there and rewrite  the definition of ``audacity,'' because it is that quality of Congress  that leads them to believe that 4 legislative days after they blow the  budget they can pass a balanced budget amendment and think that will  convince America that they are serious about balancing the budget. That  is the definition of audacity.   Look, this is an unserious vote. We know this balanced budget  amendment is going nowhere in the Senate. But this is a very serious  topic. This is the Constitution we are talking about amending. This is  the document we swore an oath to uphold, support, defend. Our Founding  Fathers died for it.   What is wrong with this balanced budget amendment? Well, first of  all, let me tell you, it has got a loophole you could drive a truck  through. Section 1, the very first part of this balanced budget  amendment, says, if three-fifths of the whole number of each House of  Congress pass a budget that is unbalanced, that is fine, but you have  got to get three-fifths vote. Okay. Higher threshold. That will cause  us to balance the budget. Three-fifths is hard to get, isn't it?  [[Page H3158]]    How many? What is three-fifths? Sixty percent. How many Members of  Congress voted for that omnibus bill 4 legislative days ago? 60.5  percent in the House. How many in the Senate? More than that.                                time  1100    This balanced budget amendment wouldn't have stopped the omnibus  bill. There is something worse in this balanced budget amendment. Any  year that we are at war, it does not apply. Let's think about that.   The first day of Congress, we elect the Speaker. We are going to  elect a new one this time. We elect the Speaker. We adopt the rules.  The third order of business will be to declare war so we don't have to  follow the balanced budget amendment. That is a loophole right there,  but it is a dangerous one.   Some people say: Well, at least we will start declaring wars. We  haven't declared a war since World War II. Maybe it will get Congress  to do its job, its constitutional duty.   Well, I don't think so. We have been at war in Afghanistan for 17  years, and this article in the balanced budget amendment says: Well,  you don't have to be at war as long as there is a conflict with our  national security at stake. Oh, you can forget the balanced budget  amendment.   What does that mean? For the last 17 years, this balanced budget  amendment wouldn't apply to the war in Afghanistan or Iraq, where we  have racked up trillions of dollars of debt. The balanced budget  amendment would do nothing to stop that.   Look, I am not against the concept of an amendment to the  Constitution that limits the growth of government. This government is  so much bigger than it was when our Founders started this country, and  for many years thereafter, but that is not what this balanced budget  amendment does. It is not carefully crafted.   The thought that our Founders put into the Constitution has not been  put into this document. It has not even been debated in a committee.  Yet, today, we are going to vote on it. How ridiculous is that?   So here is what I think we need to do. Instead of having a balanced  budget amendment that encourages you to go to war, that is toothless,  that encourages you to raise taxes instead of cut spending, we need a  balanced budget amendment that somehow limits the growth of government.  Frankly, what we need are people here that are serious about balancing  the budget, not another document, not an unserious proposal.   So I would just say this. I know this is a popular concept to have a  balanced budget amendment. I am not going to urge a ``yes'' vote or a  ``no'' vote or a ``present'' vote. I am going to vote ``no'' because it  is an unserious approach to a serious topic, and it should be called  ``the CYA,'' not ``the BBA,'' but I just want my colleagues to think  deeply and long about this amendment.   Please read it. Please read it before you vote on it. It is right  here. It is only three pages. Please read it. Think deeply before you  cast your vote to alter this sacred document.                            ____________________
