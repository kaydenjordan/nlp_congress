 Mr. President, on June 5, 2017, the Senate adopted S.  Res. 176, a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of the  reunification of Jerusalem. I am a cosponsor of this resolution.  Unfortunately, I missed the vote due to a delayed flight. If I were in  Washington, DC, during the time of this vote, I would have cast my vote  in support of this resolution.                            ____________________
