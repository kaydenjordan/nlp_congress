 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 194th birthday  of the best beer in the world, Yuengling, whose birthday was yesterday,  April 18.   Yuengling is the oldest and most iconic brewery in America. Founded  in 1829 by David G. Yuengling, this family-owned business has been  producing quality beer for almost two centuries and six generations  while employing thousands of Pennsylvanians along the way.   From its humble beginnings as a small brewery in Pottsville, it  remains in Pottsville, and is now a large brewery, serving millions who  enjoy it across the country.  [[Page H1875]]    Yuengling has a rich history and has survived through Civil War, two  world wars, Prohibition, the Great Depression, and recessions. In the  words of its owner Dick Yuengling, a friend of mine, ``The brewery is a  survivor.''   Just recently, I met with the sixth generation Jen Yuengling, who  gave a great speech on the history of Yuengling at Bucknell University,  the open discourse forum. Her passion for the brand will stand the test  of time.   Today, let's raise a pint to the Yuengling family and to the best  American brewery and beer there is made in America. Cheers.                            ____________________
