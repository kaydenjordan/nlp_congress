 Madam Speaker, March is Women's History Month, and I am  proud to honor some remarkable women in my district this month.   Today, I would like to honor Judge Louise Williams, who was elected  in 1973 as the first female district judge in Lancaster County. She  served for 26 years, and also was the first female Black district judge  in Pennsylvania. But she did so much more than that.   She was a member of the Lancaster City Council for three terms,  served as council president during two of those terms, and she was also  appointed to the State Board of Pardons, where she became the first  victims advocate, serving 18 years there. She was involved in many  other community organizations, including terms as president of the  Lancaster NAACP, and of Girls, Inc. of Lancaster County.   Ms. Williams was a trailblazer for women in our community and always  found ways to give back to our community and encourage others. She is  one of the most respected civic figures in our district. It is an honor  to recognize her today.                            ____________________
