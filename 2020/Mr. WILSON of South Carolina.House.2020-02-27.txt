 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1,  rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, last week, I was grateful  to participate with the delegation for the Commission on Security and  Cooperation in Europe, co-chaired by Congressman Alcee Hastings and  Senator Roger Wicker, in Vienna, Austria. We attended the OSCE  Parliamentary Assembly's 19th Winter Meeting.   The delegation engaged with OSCE officials and parliamentary members  from 57 nations. Ambassador Jim Gilmore and his wife, Roxane, were  effective assuring allies and potential adversaries of American  commitment for peace through strength.   It was especially meaningful to meet with the courageous Ukrainian  delegation, led by Mykyta Poturaiev, which appreciates President  Trump's providing Javelin missiles to stop Russian aggression.   Bulgaria was well-represented, with a delegation led by Desislava  Atanasova. Today, America celebrates Bulgarian National Day with  Ambassador Tihomir Stoychev at the Library of Congress across the  street in Washington.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
