 Madam President, I would like to rise and speak to the  infrastructure bill that is before us and, specifically, about a  component of the infrastructure bill. My colleague, earlier, Senator  Tuberville from Alabama, said that when he goes home he speaks to  people in his State, and he always gets a consistent message. I, too,  get that consistent message: better jobs, greater safety for their  family, and a better future for our country. And this infrastructure  package addresses those concerns.   Now, the infrastructure package is about roads and bridges and  highways, ports and waterways, increased access to broadband in areas  that don't have it now, flood mitigation, coastal restoration. These  are things that will contribute to better jobs, more safety, and a  better future for our country.   But, first, let me dispel some myths. There are some misconceptions  out there about this bill. One misconception is that it is somehow the  same as the $3.5 trillion bill that people have heard about that  Democrats have proposed, increasing taxes to a record basis and  increasing our national debt when obviously we are pushing up on the  debt limit. This is not that bill.   This bill is about roads and bridges and broadband and flood  protection. That bill is about everything else. This bill is about  improving the quality of life for our families and improving the future  for our country. That bill is about a sugar high on an economy which is  already in an inflationary mode. These are two different bills. So I am  speaking about the one that has 86-percent approval in two straight  polls by the American citizens.   The other concern is that this will contribute to inflation. Again,  that is confusing it with the $3.5 trillion wish list that my  Democratic colleagues have. No, the bill that we are proposing, with  $550 billion in new spending over 5 years for roads, bridges, and  highways, is judged to not be inflationary, to actually improve our  economy over time. Lastly, that somehow this infrastructure bill that  we propose is somehow Republicans playing along with Democrats in a way  that is bad for our country.    Let me point out that President Trump proposed a $1.5 trillion  infrastructure bill. We put up $550 billion in new spending. He  proposed $1.5 trillion. Only 5 percent of his was paid for, whereas  ours is paid for.   To make the point, this is something that Republicans have proposed  in the past, that Democrats have proposed in the past, and this version  is something which Democrats and Republicans can support. It is paid  for, and it does help the American people. How does it help the  American people? It gives them better jobs, increases the safety of  their families, and gives a better future for our country.   Let me give some ideas about how that can occur. There is $110  billion for roads, bridges, and highways, not just to repair some, to  construct some others, but also for the safety of those that are being  rebuilt or being built--$110 billion.   We speak about jobs and safety and a better future. Clearly, we  talked about safety. Think about the jobs that will be created by this  construction of these highways. Think about the better future because  these roads and bridges will last for decades. Some person who is now a  child will drive over a bridge as an adult, and her life will be better  because of the highway that this money paid for.   There is $10 billion for ports and waterways, those liquid highways  that take our goods from our country to around the world and bring  those goods from around the world back to our country, along the way  creating jobs for hundreds of thousands of Americans.   By the way, transporting products by water is the most  environmentally sound way to transport goods.   This investment in our ports and waterways--again, creating jobs,  increasing the safety--also gives us a better future for our economy, a  better future for our workers, a better future for our families, and a  better future for our country.   There is $16 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers for, among other  things, to address coastal erosion, which is occurring nationwide. My  State has lost more land mass than any other State in the Nation. My  State has lost as much land as is in the entire State of Delaware. But  other States are losing land, too.   I saw a picture recently of the Gold Coast, that very swank area in  the city of Chicago on Lake Michigan, and it showed how the coastline  had eroded over time, and now, waves from Lake Michigan are lapping up  onto the road in front of these very expensive apartment complexes.  This is not on the Atlantic, the Pacific, or the Gulf of Mexico; this  is on a Great Lake. I saw another picture of the beach off of North  Carolina, which in the last 150 years has receded--I think it is 500  feet. So homes that formerly had a distant view of the water now have  waves coming up to their lawn. That is happening nationwide--no place  more than my State in Louisiana.   This bill makes a significant investment in coastal erosion and  protecting those people who live on the coastlines. It will create jobs  as this is addressed. It will increase the safety of those folks who  live in such areas. It gives a better future for our country.   There is $65 billion for broadband, prioritizing those places without  service and those places with poor service. I think of a place in my  own State; for example, Opelousas, LA, a small town on I-49. Think of a  parent there who wants her daughter to be able to study Mandarin  Chinese. There might be people there who speak Mandarin Chinese, but  they are not the people teaching school. If she has broadband internet,  she gets the same educational experience as someone who lives in New  Orleans or Baton Rouge or Shreveport. We need to give every child in  this country the same access to that educational opportunity.   I am a doctor. Most people know that. I also think of the expansion  of telehealth and telemental health. Right now, our country has a  shortage of adolescent psychiatrists. If we have rural broadband or  broadband in areas of our cities which are currently poorly served, the  adolescent psychiatrist can be in her office in Lafayette, LA, doing a  visit, an interview with a child who lives in DeRidder. A place that  won't have a pediatric or adolescent psychiatrist has access to real- time visits because of the money that is in this bill.   Economic development. I once spoke to somebody who was thinking of  setting up a distribution center in North Louisiana in a place ideally  situated to get all the towns around, but it did not have broadband  internet. With this bill, that economic development project takes root  because now that investor has the ability to manage inventory to  receive orders and to communicate with drivers, all because rural  broadband has been made a reality--creating jobs, increasing safety,  giving that community and our country a better future.   Let me just mention one more thing in the economic aspect and safety  aspect of this. There is money for sewer, water, and for drainage. If I  think of the four corners of my State, but I am sure every person could  think of the four corners of their State--and I think  [[Page S5550]]  of Hawaii as being a round State, so I am not sure I even think of  those four corners--but if I think of New Orleans, Shreveport, Monroe,  and Lake Charles and all points in between, there was a pent-up demand  to address water and sewer and drainage. This bill puts the money out  there, which can be combined with other appropriations, which can meet  the needs for those folks in my community.   I also want to emphasize some of the environmental aspects of this  bill. We have billions being put forward to Superfund and brownfield  sites. Now, Louisiana has 27 priority sites of those nationwide  requiring funding for the Superfund or brownfield.    We also have 4.75 billion to cap abandoned oil wells. That will  improve conditions not only in Louisiana but across the Nation.   It also includes the bill I wrote with Senator Coons of Delaware  called the SCALE Act. The SCALE Act helps build this carbon dioxide  pipeline that will take CO2 from these manufacturing plants  that are producing a product that emits CO2, and it would  build pipelines to sequester that carbon dioxide beneath the ground or  to allow that CO2 to be used in another product line,  putting to work pipefitters, decreasing the carbon intensity of our  environment, and giving a better future for our planet--jobs, safety,  and a better future.   I have already mentioned the $16 billion going to the Army Corps of  Engineers for coastal restoration and other projects.   This bill is an example of what Congress should do. It is focused  upon jobs and safety and a better quality of life. This is good for the  American worker. It is good for American families. It is good for the  United States of America.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in 1996, the health law section of  the American Bar Association was created to enhance the practice of  health law and improve the understanding and development of Federal and  State health laws and regulations. The members of the ABA health law  section represent all aspects of the healthcare and life sciences  industry, comprising a diverse group of lawyers in the private sector,  government service, and academia. The health law section provides  thought leadership on all issues within the healthcare industry and  advocates for sound public policy. In addition, its members have played  prominent roles in developing programs to train advocates for victims  of breast cancer, in providing pro bono legal services to individuals  through medical-legal partnerships, and in seeking improvements in the  delivery of mental healthcare and treatment of substance use disorders.   I ask that the Senate recognize the tremendous accomplishments and  contributions of the members of the American Bar Association health law  section and extend its best wishes for many years of continued service  to the healthcare and life sciences industry.                            ____________________
