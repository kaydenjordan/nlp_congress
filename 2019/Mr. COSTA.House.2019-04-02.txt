 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, today I rise to talk about America's  healthcare system and the importance of protecting the Affordable Care  Act.   Residents in my home State of California benefited greatly from the  ACA. When it became law in 2010, California was one of the first States  to implement it. At that time, 22 percent of my residents had no  healthcare insurance whatsoever and 17 percent were uninsured.   The ACA greatly decreased that number by less than 10 percent, a big  difference, while also providing coverage for those with preexisting  conditions, which we all feel strongly about.   Now the President wants to strike down those protections and  eliminate the last benefits. That is wrong. These repeated attempts to  repeal the ACA are irresponsible, especially when there is no real  proposal to replace it by the President of the United States or my  Republican colleagues.   If he succeeds, one in seven people in California will lose their  healthcare. That is a fact.   Yes, there are improvements that can be made to the Affordable Care  Act, and we should address those deficiencies, and that is what I am  committed to doing. The Congress and the administration should work  together to fix the law and to make it better.                            ____________________
