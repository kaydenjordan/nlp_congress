 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1433, bipartisan  legislation to reauthorize the Helen Keller National Center Act.   This center is unique. In fact, it is the only one of its kind. Since  1967, the center has helped individuals with combined vision and  hearing loss by providing them, as well as their families and service  providers, with specialized, intensive services to help them lead  successful and independent lives. This includes, but isn't limited to,  career and technical education.   Simply put, the center offers hope and dignity to those it serves.  This center is on the forefront of research in developing new and  innovative ways for those that are deaf-blind to live a full and  independent life. The end goal is allowing those with combined vision  and hearing loss to work and thrive in communities of their choice.   The Helen Keller National Center is living up to the legacy of its  namesake. Helen Keller is the epitome of perseverance. She overcame  every obstacle to lead a successful life that impacted the lives of so  many.   She once wrote, ``A happy life consists not in the absence but in the  mastery of hardships.'' There is so much we can learn from Helen  Keller's commitment to serving others despite her own trials.   This bipartisan bill will ensure that the Helen Keller National  Center continues to help deaf-blind youth and adults triumph over  adversity, just as Helen Keller did more than 50 years ago.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and, in doing  so, empower those who are deaf-blind to live full, successful, and  independent lives. This bill will help ensure these students and adults  have all the resources they need to reach their fullest potential.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of reauthorizing  the Helen Keller National Center Act.   Helen Keller's story is an example of determination and hard work.  Not only did she overcome her difficulties, but  [[Page H7912]]  she worked tirelessly to better the lives of others. In doing so, she  showed the world there were no boundaries. That is how the center looks  at its work and those who it serves.   As a parent of a child with a disability, this issue is very near and  dear to my heart, so I am glad to have this time today to share my  thoughts and experiences. I know firsthand the importance of each child  with a disability having every possible opportunity to succeed and  thrive. Any parent of a child with any disability can tell you that  their top priority is to provide the very best for their children's  education and growth.   I will work tirelessly in and out of Congress for the disability  community. This is one of many reasons why I support this bill. Today's  bipartisan legislation will allow the center to continue its invaluable  research and developmental programs in several areas, including  communication techniques and teaching methods.   All of this leads to improved program offerings and, ultimately,  better lives for deaf-blind Americans and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1433.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Bridging the Gap for New  Americans Act. I applaud our colleagues in the Senate for approving  this bill this summer by unanimous consent. I also acknowledge our  colleague, Mr.   John Katko, for his work on a companion bill in the  House.   S. 3157 directs the Secretary of Labor to conduct a study on barriers  to employment for legal immigrants and refugees who earn their  professional credentials somewhere other than the United States. The  study will also include policy recommendations for better helping these  immigrants and refugees obtain skill-appropriate employment in the  United States.   Obstacles for foreign-educated immigrants and refugees who are  legally in the United States but are unemployed or underemployed  include language barriers, credential recognition difficulties,  regulatory hurdles, and a lack of professional networks to offer  assistance.   This underutilization of skills, or brain waste, is costing the  United States billions of dollars per year in lost individual earnings,  economic output, and tax revenue.   The healthcare sector is especially impacted by this challenge. Two  million immigrants with college degrees in the United States have been  relegated to low-wage jobs or unable to find work, often because of  licensing, credential recognition, and other barriers. This leaves  immigrants and refugees unable to contribute fully to the economy,  reach their full potential, or secure the American Dream.   In addition to providing recommendations for addressing these  challenges for individual immigrants and their families, S. 3157 will  benefit all Americans and our economy. With too many jobs still going  unfilled and a rapidly evolving labor market, it is vital we address  this issue now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 3157, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Katko), my friend.                                time  1615
