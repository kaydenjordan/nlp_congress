 Mr. President, we have had a lot of long nights here, and  I just want to take a moment again to really give my gratitude to the  staff. A lot of folks go into making the Senate work. We can see a lot  of them down here. I can't imagine the days that they have been  pulling, as we have been pulling long nights. Many of them get here  early in the morning and they go a long way. So I want to thank them,  from the stenographers to many of the Senate staff who make it work.   I also want to thank the pages again. These are young folks who have  to carry a full load of classes and course work--hard stuff. I don't  understand why they haven't come to me to help them with their calculus  homework. But the reality is they are working a full class load of  courses as well as being here with us around the clock. They probably  aren't caught by cameras. They aren't even getting C-SPAN glory. But  your presence here really means a lot, and I am grateful for that as  well.   I rise specifically to speak about the President's nomination of  Congressman Price to be his Secretary of Health and Human Services.   I want to take a step back and talk about the profound history that  the United States of America has in terms of our bringing together the  resources of this country to combat public health crises. We have a  country where every generation has been able to step up and take on  things that threaten the common health.   There was a time in this Nation when we had actual child death rates  that were tragically high, and that for an industrializing nation, our  water, the quality of our milk, women dying in child birth, and  children dying was a common thing. But we had this bold understanding  that in America, a Nation that believes in life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness, the common health is important. And we took steps  that, frankly, in a booming industrial economy, the private sector  couldn't do. We took steps to protect the public health, and we made  great strides.   It was a Republican President, actually, in 1953, Dwight D.  Eisenhower, who actually created what was then a version of what is now  the Department of Health and Human Services. Specifically, it was  called the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.   Now, the very first Secretary was a woman, and her name was Colonel  Oveta Hobby. She had served as the director of the Women's Army  Auxiliary Corps during the Second World War. She was, in my just great  reverence, someone who served and fought for health and safety and  security during World War II.   As Secretary, Secretary Hobby had an expansive and expanding role. It  was a demanding role. She was coordinating the distribution of polio  vaccine, overseeing countrywide hospital expansions, overseeing Social  Security and the Federal education policy. She had a huge role, one  that was so full that one newspaper joked that ``when she [actually]  learns her job, Oveta Hobby may trim her week to just 70 hours.'' This  was someone who went out there as an agent of the government to lift up  the welfare of all of our citizenry, the health and well-being of  everyone, again pushing toward those ideals.   In the United States, we really do believe in this idea of life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, freedom from deprivation,  freedom from illness, the belief that we can have life and have it more  abundantly. To Secretary Hobby, this was her duty to her country-- someone, again, who served valiantly in World War II.   In the collection of papers from Secretary Hobby's lifetime, Rice  University includes that she was a great humanitarian and that she  believed there was a role--a ``common thread,'' to use her words--to  service to her country toward the empowerment of health for all. She  set a standard, a powerful standard, as the first Secretary of Health  for the greater good that we, acting collectively, could do to ensure  the health and well-being of our Nation.   In fact, it was an understanding from President Dwight D. Eisenhower  all the way down to Secretary Hobby that if we ensure people's health  and access to health care, it is not just an individual concern, but  actually, societally, we become better and we become stronger. The  healthier all children are, the more likely they are to go out there  and compete. If you are battling sickness, it undermines your economic  well-being. In the world of infectious diseases, the words of Martin  Luther King are true: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice  everywhere; in fact, an illness somewhere is the threat of an illness  to people everywhere. This was the brilliance of Republican President  Dwight D. Eisenhower, and it is how this great Department began,  setting the standard, understanding that in many ways we are all in  this together when it comes to our health.   So for me, this is another point in history. It is a challenge to us  as to who we will be as a Nation. Will we continue to be a country that  believes, as a fundamental birthright in the richest Nation on the  Planet Earth, that everyone can access the highest quality health care,  the best access to quality doctors with wide avenues to pursue the rich  abundance of life because we have the best health care system on the  Planet Earth?   I actually was happy to hear President Trump on the campaign trail  talk specifically about this issue, tell us we were going to have a  health care system better than the one we have now, specifically  calling it ObamaCare; that we were going to have one that is amazing,  one that is going to be covering more people. I think the word that was  used was ``terrific''; it was going to be terrific. He specifically  spoke about some of the bedrock elements of our current health care  system that Republicans and Democrats  [[Page S1045]]  both agree are things we want to preserve, protect, and in fact make  better. He specifically talked about Medicare and Medicaid, defending  them: They wouldn't be taken away; they wouldn't be undermined; people  wouldn't be kicked off.   So with this excitement, hearing that we have a President committed  to these ideals, creating a terrific health care system, we stand on  this history in our country where we know our greatness, and it is an  affront if we don't have a system that takes care of our most valuable  natural resources: the people of this country and a global, knowledge- based economy. What helps us compete is the quality of our workforce.   I am telling you right now, I have learned in my professional life  that when children are sick, they don't learn; when a mother is sick,  it throws the whole family into crisis; if someone can't afford their  medication, it is not just a sin to this country's values, it is a sin  morally.   So when President Trump nominated his person to be Health and Human  Services Secretary, we might imagine they would reflect the values that  he espoused during his campaign and reflect the values he has talked  about as President. But instead, he has chosen someone who is  diametrically opposed to the things he says he is for--preservation of  Medicare. More than this, he has advocated a view on health care that  unequivocally would take millions of Americans off of health coverage,  thrust millions of Americans into economic crisis, and put the health  of many millions of Americans in jeopardy. Usually people say these  things hyperbolically, but this is quite clearly a matter of life or  death.   For years, Congressman Price has told us who he is. He has led the  charge in the House of Representatives to repeal the Affordable Care  Act and take coverage away from millions of Americans while advocating  specifically for the privatization of Medicare and the gutting of  Medicaid. For years, Congressman Price has advocated for anti-choice,  anti-contraception access, anti-commonsense measures, and supported  efforts to defund and eliminate proven programs like title X family  planning, programs like Planned Parenthood which, through their  Medicare reimbursements, often in many communities is the only access  women have in their communities for cancer screenings or to get  contraception.   Congressman Price has been one of the loudest voices on tearing down  many of the things that now Americans overwhelmingly say ``Hey, now  that we've got this, we don't want to lose it,'' whether that is not  having insurance companies dictating to you whether you get health  insurance or not having pharmaceutical companies ratchet up prices so  much that your lifesaving drugs are out of reach.   Then finally, at a time when we cannot afford to have people who have  conflicts, we have a Congressman right now for whom other House Members  are calling for ethics investigations because his personal financial  interests clearly have been in conflict. In fact, he seems to be  building a career as a Congressman working on health policy on one hand  while building a fortune trading health stocks directly related to that  work. This is a man who is so conflicted, a man who is so contrary to  what our President says he believes, a man who has been leading the  charge to take our health care back in an affront to the ideals that  literally stem from the founding history of our Department of Health. I  cannot support this individual.    But let me quickly go through some of these things. We now have to  have an honest conversation in our country about this idea of repealing  the Affordable Care Act without replacing it because objective  organizations like the Congressional Budget Office, conservative  organizations like the American Enterprise Institute, and fellow  Republican Senators of mine have acknowledged that to repeal the  Affordable Care Act would throw into crisis millions of hard-working  Americans who have been able to get coverage because of the health  insurance marketplace and the Medicaid expansion. Millions of Americans  can now go to a doctor when they feel sick instead of going to an  emergency room. By the way, as a local mayor--when people use emergency  rooms as their primary care facility, it is extraordinarily more  expensive; it is fiscally irresponsible.   Because of the ACA, millions more Americans can now access basic  health and preventive services that can lead to lifesaving  opportunities that did not exist before. Millions more Americans have  the peace of mind of knowing that they are no longer one illness away  from financial ruin.   Let me put up a chart for a second about the history of people having  insurance.   This is the percentage of uninsured in the United States--going  along, about 18 million uninsured. And then what happens? The uninsured  rate has been driven down. Enrollment in the individual market  continues to rise but has now decreased since 2014.   In late December 2016, Standard & Poor's--hardly a Democratic  organization, but a market-based organization--released an incredibly  optimistic report for the future of the individual market in the  Affordable Care Act. But Congressman Price, on the other hand, has  repeatedly introduced legislation and resolutions to repeal critical  elements or the entirety of the law responsible for these successes  without any regard for consequences. He has done this again and again  and again and again, eight times. He authored a bill last year that  would repeal critical parts, like the Medicaid expansion provision that  has expanded access to care for millions, tax credits that would help  millions buy insurance. And Congressman Price has introduced  legislation that would fully repeal the Affordable Care Act.   I want to let you all understand that, to me, this is a point in our  American history where this isn't arguing over opinion; these are facts  about what Congressman Price has done. If he were successful in any of  those eight attempts to rip down the Affordable Care Act, we now know  objectively from organizations like the independent Congressional  Budget Office that it would mean 18 million people losing their health  insurance in the first year alone, 32 million of our fellow Americans  by 2026. Objectively, there would be increases in premiums in the  market by 20 to 25 percent; 4.4 million of those Americans who would  lose coverage would be children; and 11 million of the most vulnerable  would lose their Medicaid coverage.   There is a man named Andy Slavitt who is a former Acting  Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid--again, what our  President says he wants to preserve. He put together a list because so  many people were calling him, writing him: What are going to be the  consequences if they repeal the Affordable Care Act without replacing  it? What are the consequences? And he just went through a list: Small  businesses, farms, self-employed Americans represent 20 percent of the  coverage of the exchange. These are individual entrepreneurs, many of  whom, by the way, experience something called job lock, where they are  afraid to become entrepreneurs because if they lose their jobs, they  lose health insurance. Twenty percent are covered by the exchange, and  127 million Americans--127 million Americans--have preexisting  conditions. They would be put at jeopardy, and insurance companies  would be able to deny them coverage.   Seniors, Medicare beneficiaries, have saved $2,000 on prescription  drugs because of the ACA--$2,000; 30 million Americans are on  individual policies and Medicaid; 2.8 million Americans with drug  disorders would lose coverage; 1.25 million Americans with mental  health disorders would lose coverage--1.25 million Americans with  mental health disorders. In other words, the ACA put mental health care  on parity with physical health care. A 42-percent reduction in  uninsured rates for veterans has resulted. He said that bad debt--bad  debt, bankruptcy--would go up by $1.1 trillion because health care  bills would again be the lead cause in this country of bankruptcy. In  other words, before the ACA, the No. 1 reason people were declaring  bankruptcy was because of medical bills. After the ACA, that can't  happen. There are steps to prevent that from happening, at least to the  extent of $1.1 trillion.   The Medicare trust fund, which has been extended, will have several  years reduced off its life expectancy. Taxpayers will lose $350 billion  added to the deficit and $9 trillion would be added to the debt if it  is repealed--2.6 million jobs lost, especially in communities like  rural hospitals, where they  [[Page S1046]]  depend upon the ACA to keep doors open and hospitals running. Anyone  who likes free preventive services like mammograms and better cancer  treatment, preventive services that literally save lives by early  detection, gone.   Young adults, 3.1 million right now on their parent's plan because of  extending the years. Women who want to buy health insurance will pay  more than men in premiums because, amazingly, at times insurance  companies would be charging you more simply because of your gender and  105 million people had lifetime limits on what insurance companies pay.   This is a list from one of the great experts who knows factually what  would happen if we were to turn back the clock. Let me drill down a  little bit more. As head of Health and Human Services, Congressman  Price would be responsible for insuring the continuance of Medicaid.   Americans like Kelley from New Jersey are able to access care right  now because of the Medicaid expansions under the ACA. I want to read  what she said. She said:         Thank you for supporting the ACA. I hope that you will       continue to fight hard for it. It's the ACA and Medicaid that       allow me to be able to seek medical treatments for my       scoliosis (which causes me to suffer from chronic pain) and       ensure that my newborn receives appropriate medical care when       need be.        I work full time and go to college but I still struggle to       pay the bills, as I'm only 18 and fast food doesn't pay much       even at 35 to 40 hours a week.    Here is someone going to college, raising a child, working full time,  and relying on the ACA so she can inch toward her American dream, being  a college graduate, getting a better paying job.   She concludes by saying:         I want my baby to have the health care she deserves so she       can be happy and healthy.    The Medicaid expansion under the ACA has extended access for millions  in our country, millions of hard-working people like Kelly and their  children, like her baby, across the country.   In New Jersey alone, hundreds of thousands of people gained coverage.  Uncompensated costs were driven down, and my State saved a billion  dollars, all because of Medicaid expansion.   Republican Governor of New Jersey: Medicaid expansion was the right  fiscal decision for our State and for our communities' families who  live in our State.   In Price's efforts to undo ACA Medicaid expansion, he has indicated  people like Kelly and her newborn baby are not a priority.   I know for a fact that hard-working people across the country and in  my community will suffer if Price is able to do what he intends to do  and has tried to do.   Let me go to another issue; that is, Medicaid. How about Medicare? As  Secretary Price, he will be responsible for overseeing Medicare, the  health care program that services 57 million American seniors and those  with disabilities.   Under the Affordable Care Act, we know that the quality of Medicare  coverage has improved. The life of the Medicare trust fund has been  extended, and we have begun to close the gap in prescription drug  coverage that too many seniors and people with disabilities--they know  about this. It is known as a doughnut hole. There is more work to do to  strengthen Medicare and to make prescription drugs more affordable for  everyone, including our seniors.   The changes we have done already have had real positive impacts on  the daily lives of Americans. Let me read another letter from Myra in  Willingboro, NJ. She wrote to tell me about the difference that  Medicare is having for her family as they live with chronic illness.  She said:         As your constituent and an advocate of affordable,       accessible health insurance, I would like to share how       adjustments to the health care system could impact me. As you       consider policy changes, I urge you to think about how your       constituents living with chronic conditions will be affected.        It is so important to my husband who lives with Parkinson's       disease and myself who is being treated for Chronic Lymphatic       Leukemia that our Medicare benefits continue without any cuts       in benefits. It is most important that we continue to be able       to visit doctors able to care for our specific needs and have       the expensive medications covered that are needed as we live       with these diseases.        As a support group leader for people living with       Parkinson's disease--    I pause here to say, my father suffered for years with Parkinson's,  died from Parkinson's. The support groups are essential, and the  medical challenges that this chronic disease brings are great.   I continue with her letter.         As a support group leader for people living with       Parkinson's disease and their caregivers, I know all the       members would echo my requests. Many people actually need       further assistance to purchase the needed drugs as their       policies do not cover them adequately presently. Often the       medication prices are prohibitive for folks. They have to       constantly check to see which drug plan will allow their       medication at an affordable price.        In addition, specific supports for caregivers is another       very important need for the Parkinson disease population.       Please consider assistance for these people who require       assistance throughout the day.    Let me tell you, this is a person writing to say keep what we have  and make it better because it is still not enough to meet the  challenges. Instead, we are considering making someone the Secretary of  Health and Human Services who doesn't want to improve, build upon, get  better but wants to throw out.    Take Tom, who believes that for his family, their lifeline to health  care access is an intrusion. This is Tom Price--excuse me, who believes  that this is an intrusion. He writes: ``I can attest that nothing has  had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the  federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.''   I want to put these words up. This is what the nominee to Health and  Human Services is saying about one of the most valued parts of our  health care in America. He is saying: ``I can attest that nothing has  had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the  federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.''   I would like to tell you that is an insult to Myra and her husband,  millions of American seniors, those on disabilities who rely on what he  calls an intrusion. Someone who is calling for an end to a program that  millions of Americans rely on, that the President himself swore that he  would do nothing to disturb, we are now putting the chief architect of  the destruction of Medicare from the House into a position where they  can wreak havoc on the health care of millions.   I want to go into that area of preexisting conditions. Imagine  yourself as someone who has a child with diabetes or that you are a  survivor of cancer and an insurance company can now look at you and  say: I am sorry. I am not going to cover you. The people driven by the  market, driven by profits, driven by the bottom line are going to look  at you and your humanity and simply say: Sorry, I am not going to cover  you. And you live in that place in America, that dark, painful place  where you know you are one illness away from destitution.   This is what Maureen wrote to me recently. She said:         Please do not repeal the Affordable Care Act. My 18-year-      old son has been fighting cancer for over a year. I am scared       to death of what his future will hold without the protections       of the ACA. He may be subject to a lifetime cap on insurance       payments or be rejected for health insurance entirely on the       basis of a preexisting condition. He is only 18. He could be       financially ruined before he even gets his adult life       started. After fighting cancer as a teen, it scares and       upsets me to think that his battles will continue throughout       his life in the form of financial hardships from the loss of       protections he currently has through the ACA.    She ends saying:         Please consider my family when voting on the ACA.    Please consider my family. There are millions of Americans who now  are living in this state of fear, looking at the rising and the  ascendancy of Congressman Price to a position--someone who has tried  again and again to end insurance for people with preexisting  conditions.   I don't understand what we are trying to achieve with putting someone  who believes that somehow the free market will take care of these  folks. I began with our history as a country: booming industrial  economy. The free market didn't take care of ensuring that our waters  and rivers were cleaned up. The free market didn't take care of  eradicating polio. We are a nation that has learned from our history  that we have a responsibility to each other, and in our common civic  space and in the  [[Page S1047]]  governments that are established amongst men and women, we have to do  better for folks who are victims or vulnerable to the vicissitudes of  the free market.   That is why we are stepping up to say that we can create a system  that serves all. We are the richest country on the planet Earth. What  even makes this worse than Medicaid under assault, Medicare under  assault, people with preexisting conditions, which are issues that are  simply around contraception.   Congressman Price would be expected to uphold protections currently  in place that prohibit insurance companies from charging women more  because of their gender and ensuring that insurance companies abide by  the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive care.   All that talk about preexisting conditions, many insurance companies  saw gender as a preexisting condition. As something as critical as  having access to contraception, Tom Price has voted time and time again  to restrict access to essential health care services and limit  reproductive rights.   Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, cost was a major barrier  for women seeking access to birth control. Congressman Price has  repeatedly opposed the provision requiring insurance plans to cover  contraception. This is what he said in an interview in 2012:         Obviously one of the main sticking points is whether       contraception coverage is going to be covered under health       insurance plans and at hospitals, and whether or not they're       going to be able to pay for it, especially low-income women,       where do we leave these women if this rule is rescinded?''    That is the question. Price's response was simple:         Bring me one woman who's been left behind. Bring me one.       There's not one.    I am sorry, in this case, Price is not right; Price is wrong. There  is not just one you could bring. There are millions of women who were  left behind and struggled with access to coverage before the Affordable  Care Act. For this man to stand there and cast a shadow over the basic  commonsense understanding that when you allow women to make their  reproductive health decisions and have access to contraception, you  give them power over their lives and their destinies. You actually  reduce unwanted pregnancies dramatically. This is an economic issue.  This is an empowerment issue. This goes to the core freedoms as a  country.   The Center for American Progress reported in 2012 that before the ACA  contraceptive provision went into effect, that ``a recent study shows  that women with private insurance paid about 50 percent of the total  costs for oral contraceptives, even though the typical out-of-pocket  cost of non-contraceptive drugs is only 33 percent. Surveys show that  nearly one in four women with household incomes of less than $75,000  have put off a doctor's visit for birth control to save money in the  past year.'' Because of the ACA's contraceptive provision, America has  changed. According to the National Women's Law Center, 55 million women  have saved $1.4 billion on birth control pills alone since 2013.    Listen to Rachel from West Orange, NJ, a couple towns over from where  I live. She benefited from the contraception provision of the ACA as  well as access to Planned Parenthood. This is what she wrote:         The Affordable Care Act is something that has made a huge       impact on my life. I come from a poor background, and there       is no additional money to spare on things like birth control,       which I take for my independence and legitimate medical       issues. Without birth control, I'm unable to get out of bed       for days at a time because of painful periods. This means       losing out time off work and opportunities because of a       serious medical malady.        I never thought I would be able to normalize my life       because I can't afford a $40 copay every month, in addition       to my expensive transportation passes, student loan payments,       and helping my parents pay their bills. However, with the       Affordable Care Act, I have access to free birth control that       allows me to live my life and succeed. It enables my       independence, and makes me a healthier individual. I am       terrified that any repeal of the Affordable Care Act will       harm my health, my career and my ability to lead a normal       life.    We want people to lead the life of their dreams--their health, their  careers. What she is asking for is not a luxury. It actually benefits  us all because we are empowering her to succeed. That makes this  country greater. Yet Tom Price, this nominee, has voted 38 times on  measures that would restrict women's access, including 10 times voting  to defund Planned Parenthood. At a time when there are fewer unwanted  pregnancies, when women have more power, more control over their lives,  Tom Price wants to roll things back.   Struggling women are fighting to raise families and go to college and  pay the bills and run businesses or be entrepreneurs, that they are  having constrictions placed on their lives--you empower women, you  empower this Nation.   In New Jersey, Planned Parenthood's 26 health centers provide access  to lifesaving care for women across the socioeconomic spectrum. I will  fight tooth and nail with all that I have for not rolling things back.  We are not going back. And a Congressman who has pledged to do just  that should not be the Secretary of Health and Human Services.   Tom Price has spoken out against sex education. I am a believer. I  said this when I was mayor, all the time. In God we trust--I am a man  of faith--but everybody else, bring me data. Sex education is actually  something that has a powerful economic benefit. When it comes to  advocating for better health options and outcomes, we know this is not  an idea or theory, but there is a connection between poor, incomplete,  or absent sexual education and increasing rates of teen pregnancy,  sexually transmitted diseases, sexual assault. Young people are also  disproportionately infected, without sex education, with HIV, and HIV  rates among young adults are truly problematic in this country. Kids  who are granted full information live healthier lives. But Congressman  Price advocates against that. He thinks sex education doesn't reduce  rates of teen pregnancies--it does; doesn't reduce rates of sexually  transmitted diseases--it does; doesn't reduce rates of sexual assault-- it does; doesn't reduce rates of HIV--it does. But he thinks that it  promotes promiscuity among young people.   I want to end with my last point. All of this is enough, but this is  the more astonishing part of my opposition because in this, I would at  least think we could get my Republican colleagues to join with me  because if you look at past Presidents, something less than this has  sunk nominations before. This doesn't have to do with health policy;  this has to do with conflicts of interest.   There was a great Senator who pulled himself out of consideration for  what, compared to this, is a mild issue that he moved to correct on  paying taxes on a benefit that he received. He pulled himself out of  consideration. He had that kind of dignity to say: You know what, I  have this small issue. I am pulling myself out of consideration.   But Tom Price is charging right ahead, while people in the House are  calling for his investigation. Some of my colleagues have already  addressed this, so I won't go into it much, but the SEC investigation  should be there. An independent watchdog from the Office of  Congressional Ethics should be there. We don't know because these  organizations, the SEC and the Office of Congressional Ethics, don't  announce when they are investigating somebody. But there are a whole  bunch of people saying that Congressman Price has potentially violated  something called the Stock Act, which was basically put in place so  that Congresspeople, who know things about regulations or issues  affecting companies, can't benefit off of that insider information to  profit themselves. I don't understand why, at a time that this is all  hanging over his head, that there should be an investigation, that we  should get to the bottom of it before we put him in the President's  Cabinet, Democrats and Republicans here, given past history and past  nominees who had to withdraw, why aren't we joining in a bipartisan way  and saying: Hey, there is a lot of smoke here, and the facts are kind  of screaming for attention.   Let me just be clear. As an example, last March Congressman Price  bought between $1,000 and $15,000 worth of shares in a company called  Zimmer Biomet. They are a medical manufacturer that specializes in hip  and knee devices. House ethics disclosures show that he invested in the  company just 6 days before introducing a bill that would have directly  benefited hip and knee replacement companies like Zimmer Biomet, H.R.  4848. Let's do this  [[Page S1048]]  again. He invests in a company 6 days before he introduces legislation  that would have benefited such a company. That is astounding, to me,  and it should raise alarms in terms of the codes of conduct of a  potential Cabinet nominee. He invested in a medical manufacturer of hip  and knee devices and shortly thereafter introduces a bill, the HIP Act.   What is more, though, is while Congressman Price has said that he was  unaware of the stock purchase because it was bought by a broker, his  financial disclosure forms show that he initialed the purchase to note  an error. He initialed the purchase. So to say he had no knowledge of  it is a stretch.   Congressman Price then added nearly two dozen cosponsors to the bill  over the next 3\1/2\ months. I am sorry, if a Senator here did that-- knowingly buying stock, then introducing a bill--I know this body would  look askance on that. More than that, I don't think you need to explain  much of this because it is so obvious that American folks at home are  knowing that you should not introduce legislation to self-deal to  yourself.   Let me give another example. Price also bought stock in an obscure  Australian biopharmaceutical firm called Innate Immunotherapeutics  through a private offering that was not made available to the public.  The private stock offering gave Congressman Price access to hundreds of  thousands of discounted stock.   At his Senate confirmation hearing, he asserted the stocks were  ``available to every single individual that was an investor at the  time,'' but this is how the Wall Street Journal reported it--not quite  a liberal periodical. It said:         In fact, the cabinet nominee was one of fewer than 20 U.S.       investors who were invited last year to buy discounted shares       of the company--an opportunity that, for Mr. Price, arose       from an invitation from a company director and a fellow       Congressman.        The shares were discounted at 12 percent off the traded       price in mid-June only for investors who participated in a       private placement arranged to raise money to complete a       clinical trial. The company's shares have since tripled       during the offering.    I am sure that Americans at home who are saving for their retirement  would love to have an insider deal like this, would love to be clued in  by company heads to an opportunity to triple their money, but clearly  something is wrong when a Congressman is doing that. That should cause  us to pause as a nation before we put him in as a Cabinet Secretary  over all of our health care.   It is a disturbing pattern when Congresspeople use their position of  power for personal gain with no regard for public interest. This type  of behavior would be unacceptable in most industries. It should be  unacceptable to Congress, to Senators on both sides of the aisle who  have to advise and consent.   Look, we are at a point in our country where we have taken steps  forward on health care. It has been controversial, I understand, but  there is no arguing with the fact that we are now at a point in America  where someone with a preexisting condition is not stopped from having  health insurance, where young people all over our country have the  security of knowing they can stay on their parents' health insurance  until they hit 27. We are at a point now where being a woman is not a  preexisting condition, where we have expanded access to contraception.  We are at a point in our country where the uninsured population has  gone down dramatically.   We cannot have someone whose attitude is not what I would hope it  would be, one of ``Hey, we accomplished a lot. Let's figure out a way  to make it better. Let's build on it.'' Instead, they not only want to  take back the gains I just mentioned, but they want to go further and  take back Medicaid and Medicare, privatize them, gut them, block-grant  them.   So this is not a close call. This is a Congressperson who for years  has told America what his intentions are. He just didn't have the power  to do it then because he was 1 out of 435. Frankly, if you include the  Senate, he was 1 out of 535 and had a Democratic President also to get  through. He couldn't get done what he wanted to get done. Now he is  going to go from being one voice on the fringe, yelling for getting rid  of Medicaid and Medicare, yelling against women's access to  contraception, yelling to put insurance companies back in charge of  your life, your destiny, and your health care--he is going to go from a  fringe voice, 1 out of 435, to now being the head of the Department of  Health, advising the President on things, frankly, that he has said, at  least, that he doesn't want to do: gutting Medicare, gutting health  care for seniors.   So I go back to where we came from--a Republican President, Dwight D.  Eisenhower, and the first head of the Health Department, an incredible  woman, World War II--served soldiers in World War II. And they had a  vision for this country, that, hey, what we have is not good enough.  Let's figure out a way to do better because a healthy society is an  economically strong society. A healthy society is a prosperous society.  A healthy society lives up to our common values.   We are the United States of America. We should set the national  standard for health care. When it comes to the most vulnerable amongst  us, whether it is a poor kid on a farm, whether it is someone in an  inner city, whether it is an immigrant, we are a country that  believes--like the old African proverb: If you want to go fast, go  alone, but if you want to go far, go together.   One of the great singers and artists and inspirations in my State is  a guy named Bruce Springsteen. He has a song where he says: We take  care of our own. Well, we have done well on that idea. We have gotten  better. We have made strides toward that standard.   We have work to do. We should be working together, both sides of the  aisle, to make our health care better, more inclusive, more accessible,  and more affordable. We have a lot more work to do. But I don't want to  go back. So help me, I will fight every day to prevent us from going  backward where there will be fewer people covered, more people, because  they can't afford things, suffering untold health crises.   I don't want to go backward to where women are denied coverage or  access to empowering things, basic things, fundamental things like  contraception.   I don't want to go backward with senior citizens who are in the  sunsetting years of their lives, when they should be free of stress and  worry and strain but suddenly are worried again and struggling and  suffering. I don't want to go back to those days; therefore I will vote  a resounding, full-throated no on Congressman Price because, as the  poet Maya Angelou said, if someone tells you who they are, believe  them. He is someone who has told us what he wants to do. We should stop  him from doing it.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Florida.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges of  the floor be granted to the following member of my staff: Juan Gomez.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
