 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able  to complete my remarks before the vote starts.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor  distinguished Washington State senator, Tribal leader, and my friend  John Richard McCoy.   State Senator McCoy dedicated his life and career to public service.  John served in the Air Force for two decades. He was a steadfast and  fearless leader for the Tulalip Tribes in the State of Washington. And  he was one of the longest serving Native legislators in Washington  State history.   His story is an inspiration and testament. He overcame unbelievable  odds. And most importantly, he showed what one person can achieve in  the service of others. John led a life and career that will be  remembered for generations.   He was born in 1943 in Washington. He was born in the middle of World  War II and started his career as a commercial fisherman in Puget Sound  before he joined the Air Force. He served in the Air Force for 20  years, retiring as a technical sergeant at Andrews Air Force Base in  Maryland, near here.   He was then recruited as a computer programmer before computer  programming was really hip and was assigned to staff the Reagan White  House situation room. His skills as a computer programmer and technical  expertise led the late Stan Jones--one of our other Tribal legends who  was then Chair of the Tulalip Tribes--to recruit him back to Washington  to help transform the Tribe's communications system. At the time, the  Tribe was struggling to build the infrastructure that was needed to  take advantage of economic development and continue to move forward  with their plans.   But John took this project and telecommunications infrastructure and  helped the Tribe build one of its greatest economic successes. The Quil  Ceda Village is about a 500-acre unique business park that was approved  in 2001. It was so successful that in 2005, the Puget Sound Business  Journal named him Executive of the Year for his contributions to the  successful project. He not only brought computers and high-speed  internet access to the village, he made the whole thing a reality for  the Tribe.   John McCoy never lost his ideas about public service. In 2003, he was  elected to the Washington State House of Representatives, and he served  our State legislature for 17 years. Senator McCoy served the 38th  Legislative District in Northwest Washington covering Tulalip, Everett,  and Marysville. During that time, he became a standout legislator for  the State of Washington. He was a tireless advocate for K-12 education,  healthcare, the environmental policies, and, most importantly, he was  outspoken on Tribal issues.   One important piece of legislation John championed and created was  the ``Since Time Immemorial: Tribal Sovereignty in Washington State''  curriculum which is now taught in all Washington State public schools.  ``Since Time Immemorial,'' endorsed by all of Washington State's 29  federally recognized Tribes, is a curriculum that focuses on their  history in the State of Washington. The lessons help students  understand the importance of treaties, the history of Tribes in the  Pacific Northwest, and the challenges of reservation life. It also  teaches students the influence of geography and where Tribes are  located in the State of Washington--and, importantly, the distinct  cultures of the 29 federally recognized Tribes in Washington State. The  knowledge our students are gaining about Tribes is invaluable. And this  is just one example of Senator McCoy's leadership in the State of  Washington.   He also helped expand dental care. He passed legislation requiring  telecommunications companies to provide call location information to  emergency responders. He helped emergency responders locate victims and  patients more quickly. And he passed a bill that allowed our State to  provide jurisdiction to Tribes over criminal and civil matter on Tribal  lands to Federal and Tribal governments. These were all important  roles, and we can never give enough thanks to him and his family for  his contributions.   He also served in leadership roles. Senator McCoy was elected by his  colleagues to serve as caucus chair for the then Washington State  Senate Democrats. He served as chair of the National Caucus of Native  American State Legislators, playing a Tribal leadership role  nationally. And something he always took pride in was not only serving  the Tribe he grew up in, but he took great pride in serving the rest of  Everett and Marysville. He never lost sight of what it meant to  represent the people of the 38th District. That is the kind of person  he was, dedicated to his Tribe, but also dedicated to all his  neighbors.   He retired from the Washington State Senate in April of 2020, and he  said, ``Through the changes in committees, leadership roles and even  chambers over the course of my legislative career, it was always an  immense privilege to represent my neighbors . . . I am deeply grateful  for that privilege.''   Senator John McCoy will go down in our State's history as one of our  most effective local leaders, someone who came up against roadblocks  and found ways to bypass those roadblocks to get progress for our  State.   He will be missed by all of us, especially his wife of 58 years,  Jeannie McCoy--my heart goes out to her and her family--his siblings;  his children: Angela McCoy, Sheila Hillaire, and Cara Tohanniep; and  his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   We all thank you for sharing your father with us. He will be missed  not only as a leader in our State, but also a leader that helped us  across the United States to better understand Indian Country and  certainly the leadership of the Tulalip Tribe.
