 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I rise in support of H.R. 4502. As chair of the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee, I am pleased to highlight the national priorities that  are funded in our division.   First, I would like to thank our distinguished ranking member, Mr.  Fortenberry, and the entire subcommittee for their continued bipartisan  cooperation.   The jurisdiction of our bill is far-reaching and touches the lives of  every citizen, and while we may disagree on matters of policy from time  to time, agriculture, rural development, the safety of our food and  drugs, and the livability and sustainability of our ecosystems here and  across the globe are indeed bipartisan concerns, and we truly approach  our work collaboratively to achieve the greater good for our country  and humanity.   However, our FY22 allocation is $26.55 billion, which is $2.85  billion over the fiscal year 2021.   The bill addresses three key priorities:   First, it ensures equitable participation in USDA programs.   Second, it addresses the impacts of climate change.   Third, it reinvests in staff and leadership offices at USDA.   The bill provides $4.7 billion for rural development initiatives,  including more than $900 million for broadband expansion to provide  economic development opportunities and improved education and  healthcare services in rural communities. The bill continues important  funding for the Community Facilities Program that supports everything  from libraries and fire stations to childcare centers and nursing  homes.   The bill provides $2.9 billion in farm and conservation programs,  $3.4 billion for agricultural research including a significant increase  for the 1890 land-grant institutions, $1.74 billion for Food for Peace  grants, and $245 million for the McGovern-Dole program, both in support  of our diplomacy.   Food insecurity continues to hurt millions of Americans. Our bill  fully funds the SNAP, WIC, and child nutrition programs and helps  increase access to healthy, nutritious food.   The Food and Drug Administration is funded at $3.47 billion in  discretionary funding, with increases that help combat the opioid  crisis, rare cancers, foodborne outbreaks, and heavy metals in baby  food.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my personal staff, Michael Reed,  Tynesha Boomer, and Danny Giddings; and the subcommittee staff, Martha  Foley, Diem-Linh Jones, Perry Yates, Joe Layman, Randy Staples, Justin  Masucci, and Echo Domingues for their hard work on the bill.   Also, I would like to thank Tom O'Brien from the minority staff. And,  of course, I thank Chair DeLauro and Ranking Member Granger for their  tremendous leadership.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I want to give a special shout  out to Michael Reed, who is retiring as my chief of staff and senior  policy advisor for appropriations after 18 years of extraordinary  service. We thank him mightily for his service, for his monumental  contributions to Georgia's Second District, and we wish him well as he  enters the next chapter of his life.   I am proud of this division and the entire bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support it. It is a good bill. It is good for America.
