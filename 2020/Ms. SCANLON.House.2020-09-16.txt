 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of the  longest running weekly newspapers in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Gay  News, which has been dedicated to lifting the voices of the LGBTQ  community since 1976.   PGN was founded by a pioneer for the LGBTQ community, Mark Segal, and  has provided reliable and accessible news ever since.   PGN has been at the heart of the fight for equality, diving into the  challenges facing LGBTQ people and lifting up their vices.   At the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, PGN was vital to ensuring  people had the information and resources they needed to make informed  decisions about their safety, health, and well-being.   Today, PGN is the largest East Coast LGBTQ newspaper, with over  25,000 weekly readers. In a recent interview, Mr. Segal said that this  journey was not without struggle. ``At times, we had to fight to keep  the doors open,'' but PGN pressed on.   In March, PGN was awarded a historical marker to honor the remarkable  impact this paper has had. Just last week, PGN was awarded the best  overall nondaily newspaper by the Society of Professional Journalists.   We are grateful for the leadership of Philadelphia Gay News and its  founder, Mark Segal.   To the entire PGN family, congratulations, and keep making good  trouble.                            ____________________
