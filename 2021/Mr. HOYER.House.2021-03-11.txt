 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning- hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes expected no  earlier than 6:30 p.m.   On Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate  and noon for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at noon for legislative business.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business,  with the last votes no later than 3 p.m.   Madam Speaker, we will consider several bills under suspension of the  rules. The complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the  close of business Friday.   In addition, we will consider two bills to honor Women's History  Month, including the Violence Against Women Act. This legislation is  essential to help stamp out domestic abuse, violence against women and  girls, and sexual harassment, and to provide victims and survivors with  the resources to recover and seek justice. In addition to that, the  House will consider a resolution to remove the deadline for  ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.   The House will also consider two bills to address our broken  immigration system. The first, H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise  Act, is to protect Dreamers and those with TPS and DED status. In  addition, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act is to create a pathway  for agricultural workers to earn legal status and to reform the H-2A  program, a bill which enjoys broad bipartisan support.   Additionally, the House will consider a bill to ensure that we  preclude cuts to Medicare, as well as farm supports and other programs  implicated by sequestration.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I agree with the Members, and I regret that we have had such a  necessity on too many occasions to change the schedule. We did so, of  course, to accommodate not only work done but also the very, very  unusual start that we have had to this session, a tragic start that we  have had to this session, dealing with issues that we would have  preferred not to deal with, but we had to as a result of the  insurrection that occurred on January 6, and other actions, including  the security that the gentleman referred to. That concerns us all.   As somebody who represents the Washington metropolitan region, the  openness of our Capitol is of particular concern to me because my  constituents all live within driving distance, an hour or less. So, I  share the view.   Madam Speaker, I want to assure Members that we are going to make  every effort and that we are trying to now finalize. We already have  April, May, June, and July as the schedule. I think that will not be  changed in any dramatic fashion. But when we have the final, I hope to  make sure that everybody, next week, before we leave here, knows what  is going to happen in April, May, June, July, before the August break.  Because I understand, when the schedule is changed, for whatever  reasons, however justified they may be, it does disrupt.    Although I heard some criticism last Wednesday that we didn't come in  Thursday, no Member came up to me complaining that we didn't come in  Thursday. I did hear some political rap about it, but I didn't hear any  Members say, ``Oh, jeez, I really wanted to come in Thursday.'' That  usually is the case.   Madam Speaker, I want to remind the gentleman that we got all of our  work done last week. All that was scheduled was done.   I will assure the gentleman that we are working very hard so that,  the next 4 months, Members can rely on it when they see on the calendar  that they have to be here or they don't have to be here, or that we are  going to consider this, that, and the other.   We are going to try to hew very, very closely to that because I do  appreciate that when you change the schedule, it is very disruptive for  people's lives, for people's businesses, for our constituents.    Madam Speaker, I would tell the gentleman that would  certainly be the ideal. There is no doubt about that. We would like to  get to that position.   We continue to consult the Capitol physician on his advice on what we  ought to be doing. It would be a lot simpler if every Member had been  vaccinated, I will tell my friend. Although, obviously, the information  as to who gets a vaccination and who does not is privileged and private  information, as it should be, I would ask my friend to urge his Members  to get the vaccination so that both sides will know that all of our  Members have been vaccinated. That will facilitate getting to where the  gentleman wants to get and where, I share his view, I want to get and  the Speaker wants to get. So, we will continue to talk about that.   Although we have a regular schedule, it is not the old schedule. It  is not the 15-minute vote or 17- or 20-minute vote that we had, which  was much more efficient, as you may have seen me quoted in the paper  the other day about virtual, that we prefer to come together in this  Chamber, in committee rooms, on this campus, to discuss with one  another, to work with one another. We think that is the ideal, and we  hope to get there as soon as possible.   We are making progress, obviously. We are getting a lot of Americans  vaccinated. We are not anywhere close to the 75 percent yet, but,  hopefully, we will be there soon.   I would think and hope we could get to 100 percent of Members and  make sure that our staff is vaccinated as well. The sooner we do that,  the sooner we can accomplish what the gentleman wants to accomplish.    Would the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Let me make a few comments. First of all, the gentleman mentioned  about the White House and the President. I am going down with the  President, who is going to sign the American Rescue Plan tomorrow, an  extraordinary piece of legislation that we are very excited about and  that is going to help literally millions and millions of Americans and  our entire economy, our families, and our children. So we are very  excited about that.   I was required to have a test. Now, I have had two shots, but I was  required to have a test this morning by the Capitol physician before I  went down to the White House. The gentleman says that you don't wear a  mask, but one has to have a test before one gets into the room.   Now, with respect to the 100 percent, I think we ought to have 100  percent. I think everybody in this body and every one of our staff  ought to have the vaccine to make sure that we are safe and that others  who deal with us are safe. The CDC guidelines, by the way, recommend  that people be vaccinated but that they avoid medium and large crowds.   Now, depending upon what the gentleman says, Madam Speaker, if you  have 300 people on this floor, that is a reasonably good-sized crowd,  and we are in great proximity to one another because of the size of  this Chamber.   The CDC also says--the Senate has not listened to the CDC. The CDC  says wear masks. So in terms of the gentleman's suggestion about the  CDC changing its rules, that is true, but they haven't changed their  rule on masks. They say wear a mask and try not to congregate in large  crowds.   However, having said that, we want to get to the same objective that  the gentleman references, and we are working towards that with the  consideration of the safety of our staff, the safety of our Members,  and the safety of security folks. We hope to get there sooner rather  than later, and we are working on it.    My point on the White House was that a Member may decide  that. And if they don't want to get a test, then they can't go to the  White House, for the safety of everybody there.    Madam Speaker, everybody in America wants to get back to  normal. Everybody in America. We agree with them, and we are hopeful  that we will get there sooner rather than later, and we are making good  progress.   We just, yesterday, invested a large number, billions of dollars, to  facilitate getting to where we want to be. And Americans want to be in  testing, vaccination, and tracing. So I don't want to have anybody  think we are in disagreement. We want to get there. We want to get  there safely. We want to get there consistent with good health  practices and the advice of the scientists and the physicians who treat  us. But we are talking about it as we were here this week, and we are  going to be talking about it next week because we all want to get to  the same place.    The gentleman was here in 2017, of course. There was a  bill that approximated the size of this bill. It was about $1.5  trillion, $1.6 trillion. This is a little more--substantially a little  more, $300 billion, $400 billion, but in the same ballpark. There were  no hearings on that bill. There were no amendments on that bill. It  came to the floor, and there were no amendments to that bill. None.  Zero.   Now, of course, 83 percent of that bill went to the top 1 percent of  Americans. This bill was just about the opposite; 85 to 90 percent go  to probably the bottom two-fifths in terms of income level and wealth.  Hundreds of amendments were offered, as the committees marked up their  instructions from the Budget Committee. Hundreds.   Amendments were, of course, offered in the Senate, as well. As my  friend knows, they had their vote-a-rama; they met for over 24 hours.  To indicate that this bill did not have a robust committee process in  which Republicans and Democrats could offer amendments and have them  adopted, I think, is not accurate, with all due respect, Madam Speaker.   Furthermore, this bill enjoyed the overwhelming support of the  American people. Madam Speaker, 77 percent of Americans--59 percent of  Republicans in the Morning Consult poll, 67 percent of Americans  supporting the minimum wage, which was rejected, of course, by the  parliamentarian in the Senate; 83 percent of Americans supporting H.R.  1, one of the bills that passed; 89 percent supporting comprehensive  background checks, which passed today; 72 percent of Americans  supporting equal protections for LGBTQ Americans.   The point I am making is, A, the bill to which my friend refers, the  American Rescue Plan, had very substantial consideration over days.   The Ways and Means markup took 2 days and many amendments offered. So  [[Page H1337]]  from the standpoint of the public's knowing what was going on, I would  suggest to my friend that that was very much greater than when the tax  bill--about the same--in the same range of, in that case, $1.5 trillion  with interest approaching the $1.9 trillion. So we think, very frankly,  that there has been a lot of discussion on that bill.   One of the things, Madam Speaker, that concerned me the most was we  worked in a bipartisan fashion on six prior bills. One passed on voice  vote, the CARES Act,  on the floor. Others passed with well over 150  Republicans and well over 150 Democrats--more than that, but well over  300 votes. They were all bipartisan. They were negotiated with the  administration--the Trump administration. The CARES Act, Madam Speaker,  was about exactly the same amount of dollars, and it passed on a voice  vote here.    What was the difference?   Trump was President. That was the difference in all five. And it had  been negotiated with him--or the Secretary of the Treasury, to be more  accurate.   But substantively there was very little difference in terms of the  broad nature of their impact, the dollar value of the bills, and the  diversity of their objectives. To that extent, they were very much like  this bill.   But, Madam Speaker, what was the difference?   The same thing that was the difference when we did the Recovery Act  in `09. The gentleman was here. He was elected in `08. He came here and  he voted ``no'' on the Recovery Act. Every Republican voted ``no'' on  the Recovery Act--$787 billion. In my view, it kept us out of a  depression. But that was not my view alone. It was Bernanke's view and  it was the Secretary of the Treasury's view. So we see the same thing  happen again. We went from bipartisan to partisan votes.   I, frankly, Madam Speaker, find it hard to believe that there wasn't  a single Republican who thought the investments in opening up schools-- some people say, well, you open up schools, that is the big cry now.   Yes, and we are doing something about it. They weren't open when we  took over, but they are coming to be open.   I think it is unfortunate, Madam Speaker, that some demean our  teachers. I will tell you, Madam Speaker, I have four great- grandchildren. All but one, who is too young, were taught virtually for  these many, many months.   And my granddaughter, their mother, raves about their commitment of  the teachers to those three children, and the work that they put in,  day after day after day.                                time  1300    So are they concerned about their own safety? Are they concerned  about the safety of the children? Are they concerned about other  children and children taking it home to their moms and dads or their  grandparents? They are. So we need to be safe.   But this bill, which all our Republican friends voted against, has  substantial billions in there to make the schools safe so that people  can go back with the confidence that they will be safe.   So I would simply say to my friend and others that they have talked  about openness. In the 115th Congress--that is the last Congress in  which there was a Republican majority--there was not a single open  rule, not one. In the 115th Congress, you had 103 closed rules. In the  last Congress, which we were in charge, we had that number to less than  52, 51.    Jim McGovern, the chairman of the Rules Committee, is very committed  to trying to make amendments, including amendments on the Republican  side, in order; and I have urged him to do that.   So, hopefully, we will move forward in a way that continues to allow  this House to operate effectively, and also give opportunity to your  side and our side to raise issues.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I don't think there is a socialist agenda on this  floor, any more than I think there is a fascist agenda on this floor.  And we hear socialist. When Gingrich was here it was liberals. Now it  is socialists; trying to distract from substance, trying to inflame.   It wasn't socialists that stormed the Capitol, and they weren't  carrying Biden signs, they were carrying Trump signs.   I am tired, Madam Speaker, of this socialist drivel. First of all, I  think a lot of them don't have the faintest idea what socialism is  versus dictatorship or authoritarian regimes.   And the schools weren't reopened when we took over. Trump was  President for 10 months.   The gentleman apparently wants to say in this bill, open the schools  no matter what. We don't care what your locals say. We don't care what  your PTAs say. We don't care what your superintendents of schools say.  Open the schools because we mandate it.   I don't think that is what the gentleman, Madam Speaker, in the past  has stood for, mandating what States do. Now maybe he thinks that we  ought to take over the local education systems and tell them to open.  We didn't do that.   What we did was, however, gave them $130 billion, over time--he is  right, not immediately--over time to spend to make those schools safe;  make their ventilation systems safe for kids; make the accommodations  in the schools safe for kids and teachers and parents who go there.   So, Madam Speaker, we get distracted by these assertions of some sort  of ideological patina that resonates with the right wing in America.  And we can do that, or we can talk about substance.   Yes, I mentioned Americans overwhelmingly said that the substance  that we had in this bill was what they liked. So, I would hope the  Republican whip would talk about the substance of these bills.   We can have differences. But over and over, in the newspapers and on  this floor, the socialist agenda resonates in your polls. It resonates  in some of the districts; we saw that. It was not true.   Social Security was called socialist when it was adopted; Medicare,  as well; Medicaid certainly, socialist, efforts to try to lift people  up.   And when the gentleman tries to make an analogy to a bill that sent  83 percent of $1.5 trillion to the top 1 percent in America as being a  bill to help the middle class, and working Americans, boy, that is a  stretch, Madam Speaker.   Now, I want to go back to the substance of what the gentleman has  raised. We want to see us working together. I see my friend from Texas  on the floor. He and I have had these discussions.   It is a shame that we accuse one another of this epithet or that  epithet and try to put one another in a corner. I lived through the  Gingrich era, and that was almost the entire rhetoric that I heard from  the floor all the time.   But if we are going to do that, it is going to be because people  really do want to work in a bipartisan fashion.   There was discussion--I know for a fact, I was here, and I saw  President Obama try to work in a bipartisan fashion on the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Yes, he put his bill on the floor-- excuse me--not on the floor, he put it on the table.   And I heard the meetings at the White House. I heard the meetings  here when the Republicans said: Well, he didn't try to talk to us; he  put this bill on the floor before he even talked to us. Not on the  floor, on the table. I know because I was sitting there in the room  when President Obama was trying to reach bipartisan agreement.   Zero Republicans, three in the Senate, helped on the American  Recovery Act, which kept us out of depression. And I wasn't surprised  that we had zero on this reconciliation bill, and I wasn't surprised  that it changed from the six votes previously, where Donald Trump said  this bill is okay; I am going to sign it; because nothing could have  become law without him signing it. And Republicans voted  overwhelmingly, in most cases, for it.    But now that we have a Democratic President, they have decided to  return to the ``no'' votes that they cast on the Recovery Act, on the  Affordable Care Act, which has helped millions and millions of people,  and so many other pieces of legislation.   I would urge, my friend, Madam Speaker, to, when we say we want to  work in a bipartisan way, let's try to do it. It is worth doing.    I have nothing to further to say, Madam Speaker.
