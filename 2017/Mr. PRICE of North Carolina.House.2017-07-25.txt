 Mr. Speaker, I rise to stress two  critical aspects of this legislation.   First, it would impose tough sanctions on Russia for its serious  international violations, the seizure of Crimea, its violent incursion  into Ukraine, its cyber interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Perhaps  most importantly, in the present context, it would prevent President  Trump from removing or softening existing sanctions without  congressional approval.   Second, the bill addresses Iran's unacceptable behavior in the non- nuclear realm, such as ballistic missile development, human rights  violations, financing of terrorism, without violating the nuclear deal  with Iran.   The JCPOA celebrated its second anniversary 2 weeks ago. It has given  the international community 24/7 access to Iran's nuclear sites,  provided an enforcement mechanism to ensure that Iran's nuclear-related  activity is solely peaceful, and elongated Iran's breakout time to over  a year. It has made the world a safer place.    Mr. Speaker, as the United States  continues to monitor the JCPOA and Iran's behavior, it is important  that Congress continue to refrain from actions that would violate the  deal, threaten the deal, or impose careless sanctions that--under the  guise of being tough on Iran--would make the United States less safe.   This legislation meets that test, and I urge its adoption.
