 Mr. Speaker, in the last few days, a new threat to  American freedom has arisen.   We all know today that most people, or many people, get out their  views on social media. There are positives and negatives to that, but  there is no question it is true.   Particularly with today's intolerance, in which people can be fired  for their views, I think it is very important that people be able to  voice their views anonymously.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, it has become apparent that some people  want to bar you from expressing your views anonymously, which I think  in many jobs and many occupations today could mean you are going to get  fired. There is no other way to express your views other than  anonymously.   As I understand it, our forefathers sometimes had to put out their  words or their ideas of a future government anonymously to escape  detection from the British. Voicing things anonymously is a long-held  American tradition.   Mr. Speaker, I hope the American people are aware that, like so many  other of our liberties, it is an attack by some politicians who want to  make sure that your employers and your college professors have the  ability to  [[Page H5883]]  know the way you think so they can take revenge on you.   The American people must keep the right to post their views  anonymously.                            ____________________
