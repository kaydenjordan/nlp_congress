 Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Armed  Services Committee for his bipartisan work with my senior Senator, Jack  Reed, year after year on the National Defense authorizations.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lucia  Simonelli, an AAAS fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for  the remainder of this Congress.
