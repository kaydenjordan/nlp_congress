 Madam Speaker, it has been just over 100 days since I was  sworn into office, and it is an amazing honor and privilege to  represent the people of North Carolina's 13th District.   Over the last few months, I have had the pleasure of hearing from so  many of my constituents through phone calls, emails, texts, townhall  meetings, and meetings all over the district.   Right now, the reality is that North Carolinians need help keeping up  with the rising costs of goods and services. Seniors and young parents  alike deserve the opportunity to build their families and put down  roots. However, with an unfair and overburdensome tax system, coupled  with the increasing cost of living, making ends meet is tough.   To show this, I commissioned an economic impact report using a sample  budget based on the median costs for basic necessities through the  Economic Policy Institute and the United States Census. The report  shows that working families are finding it hard to pay for things like  rent, groceries, childcare, and healthcare.   Madam Speaker, when you take a closer look at the budget breakdown,  it is a real wake-up call. A working family could spend about 19  percent of their income on childcare, 21 percent on housing, and 22  percent on healthcare.   I have collected testimonials and survey responses from hundreds of  constituents who shared their personal experiences dealing with the  rising cost of childcare and the rising cost of housing.   I heard from a former State employee and mother of three who shared  that she spends 50 percent of her income on childcare. She noted that  over the past several years, childcare prices have not decreased and  that salaries are not commensurate with inflation and the cost-of- living increases.   I also heard from a family whose youngest son, a recent college  graduate with a job at the median salary in North Carolina, can't pay  rent or purchase a small home in Raleigh or in the suburbs. They are  worried because we want our young people to succeed, but it is hard to  do so under the current circumstances.   Madam Speaker, it is clear, working families are struggling to keep  up. Working families deserve to know that their leaders are willing to  roll up their sleeves and find bipartisan solutions that will make a  real difference in their lives and their budgets.   I am working to do just that. In Congress, I am working in a  bipartisan way to level the playing field for working families by  lowering out-of-pocket costs and creating a fair tax system that  benefits everyone.   I am leading the charge against a proposal to implement a 30 percent  national sales tax instead of a Federal income tax. That would be a  disaster for working families.   I have cosponsored the COVER Now Act to lower healthcare costs. I  have cosponsored the Food Deserts Act which will increase access to  grocery stores and help address the cost of food. I have cosponsored  the Child Care for Every Community Act to expand access to affordable  childcare.   I have also just introduced today the ACRE Act to help lower mortgage  costs for rural communities and enable North Carolina farmers to have  greater access to credit through community banks.   Madam Speaker, as I stand here in this absolutely magnificent  Chamber, I am constantly reminded just how fragile our democracy is-- our government of the people, by the people, and for the people.   As the Representative for the people of North Carolina's 13th  District, I will keep working hard in a bipartisan way to find  solutions to get results for our families, our friends, and our  neighbors.                            ____________________
