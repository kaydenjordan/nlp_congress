 Madam Speaker, today's rule is an all-too- familiar pattern of the legislative laziness from my Democrat  colleagues.   Once again, Washington Democrats are hiding their spending from the  American people. They are smuggling their spending levels for the  upcoming appropriations process into a rule for a totally unrelated  bill so they don't have to debate or defend their out-of-control  spending habits.   Last year, Democrats did the exact same thing. The chairman of the  Budget Committee drafts a spending resolution; he skips over his  committee; and then they toss it into a rule, hoping no one notices.   At no point in the last 4 years of the majority have House Democrats  actually marked up a budget in the Budget Committee. Time and again,  House Democrats have acted with as little sunlight as possible because  they don't want to be held accountable for their record.   Americans know that Washington spending is driving inflation, and now  Democrats are calling for even more. Last year alone, House Democrats  voted for $7.5 trillion in new spending, including the $2 trillion so- called rescue plan that ignited the highest inflation in four decades.   Since President Biden took office and one-party Democrat control of  Congress took over in Washington, inflation is up 11 percent. Gas  prices are up 110 percent on their watch. President Biden's 2021  deficit was the second highest in history, $517 billion more than the  CBO said it should have been.   Democrats don't want to debate budgets. They certainly don't want to  debate the President's budget, which would spend $73 trillion over the  next decade, a 66 percent increase over the past decade. It would add  $16 trillion in new debt with well over $1 trillion annual deficits  every year.   Democrats don't want to talk about budgets because they are spending  like they simply don't exist. If Democrats won't show their cards,  allow me. The resolution that is tucked away in this rule has over $1.6  trillion in discretionary spending next year, a $132 billion, or 9  percent, increase over the most recent fiscal year 2022 omnibus. It is  $21 billion more in spending than even Biden's budget proposal.   Instead of hiding, I urge my colleagues to be crystal clear with the  American people about exactly what they have in store for them: tax  increases, high inflation, open borders, energy dependence, and an  ever-growing mountain of debt.                                time  1315
