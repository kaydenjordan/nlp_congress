 Mr. President.    The Treasury has been so thoroughly looted that we are  incurring debt at a record-setting and alarming pace. Never in the  history of our country have we incurred so much debt so fast.  [[Page S6009]]    Our national debt now exceeds $28 trillion. It is now at 128 percent  of our GDP. And we are asked by the Democratic Party to add $48 billion  without so much as a--could we have a debate in committee?--so much as  even a word spoken over this. We are just going to add $48 billion with  no discussion. It is a huge mistake.   Now, it has been alleged that, well, the thing is that the  restaurants are suffering because of COVID. No. They are suffering  because Democrat Governors locked them down. This is a manmade  phenomenon. The economic disaster that we are in, that restaurants are  in, is completely and entirely caused by Democrat Governors.   In my State, they are suing the Democrat Governor because he won't  let them open up. This is a manmade phenomenon. So if you reward a  manmade phenomenon, you will get more of it.   You reward Democrat Governors who shut these restaurants down, guess  what, they will shut them down longer. The longer you give money to  Democrat Governors for their lockdown policies, the more lockdowns you  will get.   We need to open up the country. We need to learn to live with this  disease. As tragic as it has been, we need to learn to live with it.   But the lockdowns have not worked. Closing the restaurants did not  work, did not change the trajectory of this virus one iota. The only  thing that is changing the trajectory of this virus now is the vaccine,  plus natural immunity. Closing the restaurants did nothing and is doing  nothing, except for devastating the bottom line of restaurants.   So with that, I would object to the unanimous consent.
