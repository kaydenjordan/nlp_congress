 Madam President, I hadn't planned to say anything  about the Violence Against Women Act, but given the remarks from my  colleague from Texas, let me just say that the bill that passed the  House last year is here in the Senate. While it is true that it did not  have a majority of Republican House Members supporting it, it did have  Republican votes in the House. It expands protections under the  Violence Against Women Act, and, like many bills that passed the House,  it had very broad support.   It is sitting right here in the Senate, along with legislation that  requires universal background checks to reduce gun violence, along with  legislation to get secret money out of politics and make sure we  refresh our democracy and reduce barriers to voting, along with many  other bills, including a long-overdue increase in the Federal minimum  wage.   I would suggest that the best way to find out whether or not it, in  fact, has majority support here in the Senate is to let us vote on it,  and anyone who  [[Page S1025]]  wants to vote against it, obviously, has a right to do so. It might  well surprise us and pass here, and then we would have addressed a very  important issue.                                 S.J. Res. 68    Madam President, I am here today specifically to talk in support of  the joint resolution offered by Senator Kaine of Virginia that directs  the President to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities against Iran  without an authorization from the Congress.   The Framers gave Congress, and Congress only, the power to declare  war. As James Madison noted, ``the history of all governments  demonstrates that the executive is the branch of [government] most  interested in war and [therefore] most prone to it.'' The Constitution  ``has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the  legislature''--meaning in the Senate and in the House of  Representatives. The Framers did that because they didn't want one  person--and one person alone--to be able to make such a momentous  decision for the entire country.   They wanted to have a clear check on the President's ability to send  our sons and daughters into harm's way.   The text of the Constitution cannot be more clear. Article I, section  8 states: ``The Congress''--not the President--``shall have Power . . .  To declare War.''   The resolution before us is equally clear. It reaffirms Congress's  power and ``directs the President to terminate the use of United States  Armed Forces for hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or  any part of its government or military, unless explicitly authorized by  a declaration of war or specific authorization for the use of military  force against Iran.''   That is what the resolution says. I hope my Senate colleagues see  this resolution for what it is: a clear and important reminder to the  executive branch of the power granted to Congress by the Constitution.  The much tougher votes would come on questions of whether to authorize  military action in Iran or any other circumstances. This resolution is  a simple reaffirmation of our solemn duty to make these decisions.   Whether or not we agree with President Trump's approach to Iran or  the decision to strike Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, we should all  agree that any decision to go to war should be made by Congress, not by  the President alone.   The President's ability to protect the United States and our forces  from an imminent threat--or any other power granted to the President as  Commander in Chief--cannot, and should not, be a blank check, not for  this President, not for any other President.   Why are we here at this moment, discussing this important issue?  Because just a short time ago, we almost stumbled into a war with Iran.  And make no mistake, the tensions may not be playing out on our TV  screens today, and they may not be making headlines at this particular  moment, but it is still a very dangerous and volatile time. The pot is  still boiling, and unless cooler heads prevail, it could boil over at  any moment. We cannot allow that to happen. We must not fall into  another unnecessary war in the Middle East. Certainly, no one should  take the United States to war without a full debate in the U.S.  Congress and a vote in the U.S. Congress.   How did we get here? The Trump administration came into office with  one organizing principle to undo everything the Obama administration  did: Undo the Affordable Care Act; get rid of the Paris climate  agreement; and, of course, get rid of the agreement to prevent Iran  from obtaining a nuclear weapon.   Reversing the policies of a previous President is a campaign slogan;  it is not a strategy for the national security of the United States. In  the case of Iran, the Trump administration put nothing realistic in its  place.   The fundamental idea behind the nuclear agreement with Iran was  simple and realistic. It recognized that Iran is a malign influence in  the region. But it also recognized that a nuclear-armed Iran engaged in  malign activities in the region is even worse. If our strategy could  contain the Soviet Union, we could also apply a similar strategy to  Iran.   The agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, known  as the JCPOA, came from a deliberate strategy and painstaking  negotiations to unite key powers--powers that are often in  disagreement--allies, competitors, and adversaries, including Britain,  France, Germany, the European Union, China, and Russia.   Together, we created and enforced a truly global sanctions regime to  bring Iran to the negotiating table to reach an agreement. It was that  unity and pressure that succeeded in reaching the agreement to prevent  Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.   It was working. Under the agreement, Iran committed to dismantling  large sections of its nuclear infrastructure, to severely limit its  production of uranium and plutonium, and it agreed to an intrusive,  around-the-clock international inspections. It was compliant with its  obligations under the nuclear agreement, and we were succeeding in  pushing back Iran's so-called breakout time--the time it would need to  build a nuclear weapon. Even this administration agreed with the  international community that Iran was complying with the agreement.  There was no need to beat the drums of war.   Then comes the Trump administration, with many of the same people who  got us into the unnecessary war in Iraq, and they took a different  path. Instead of working to build on the agreement to prevent Iran from  obtaining a nuclear weapon, they tore it up. They alienated our allies  who, even to this day, are still working to salvage that agreement.   Instead of building on the progress we had made, President Trump  launched a campaign of what he called maximum pressure, which has  resulted only in total failure.   Secretary Pompeo made 12 demands of Iran as part of the maximum  pressure strategy, and the administration has not achieved any of  them--not a single one. Instead, faced with increased economic  pressure, Iran predictably lashed out. Instead of dialing down its  malign activities in the region, it has intensified. Tensions have  increased.   Without any endgame or any sign that this administration will  negotiate in good faith--any sign of that--Iran has no incentive to  change course.   It is long past time that we have a strategy that recognizes simple  political geography. We must recognize Iran has a strong hand in Iraq.  They are neighbors. They share a long border. They are both majority  Shiite countries. Nothing we can do here will change those facts.   Instead of recognizing realities on the ground and smartly countering  Iran's natural advantages in the region, this administration's policies  actually strengthened Iran's hands. In short, it has taken a bad  situation and made it much worse. In this very combustible mix, a  single spark can ignite a war. That almost happened just a very short  time ago. We were on the brink.    We learned recently that the original action that set off the  sequence of escalation may have been based on a mistake. A rocket fell  into an Iraqi military compound where we had U.S. Forces providing some  training and took the life of an American contractor in Iraq. The Trump  administration claimed that the rocket was fired by an Iraqi militia  force backed by Iran. Just very recently, Iraq--our ally Iraq--says  that the rocket may have been fired not by Iranian-backed militia but  by ISIS. We don't know because the administration hasn't shared any of  that intelligence with us.   Acting on what may have been a false assessment from the start, we  then saw a series of escalatory acts. Then, when things appeared to be  cooling down, the President ordered the strike against Iran's top  military leader while he was visiting Iraq.   I think all of us know that no one in this Chamber is grieving the  death of General Soleimani. He has lots of blood on his hands. Make no  mistake, killing him has not weakened Iran's hand in Iraq in the long  term; it has strengthened it. There have been growing calls in Iraq to  expel U.S. Forces, including a vote by Iraq's Parliament, and  increasing pressure to throw all U.S. Forces out.   What was Soleimani's main objective in Iraq? What is Iran's main  objective in Iraq? To get rid of U.S. Forces there. So, in death,  Soleimani has gotten closer to his goal of throwing out U.S. Forces  than he did in life. That is not  [[Page S1026]]  a strategic success for the United States by any definition.   The administration justified its attack against Soleimani on the  grounds that he posed an ``imminent threat.'' At least that is what  they said at the beginning. Since then, we have heard a lot of other  rationales. They used that particular expression because it has a very  specific meaning under international law, and it was the only legally  justifiable rationale for ordering the execution of Soleimani.   The problem they have is that it just isn't true. Soleimani was a  very bad guy. He had blood on his hands. But it is not true that he  posed an imminent threat under the definition that is applied in the  use of force.   We know this because while the Trump administration took a very long  time to do it, when they finally provided the Senate with the  classified briefing on the situation, it was clear the evidence did not  support the claim of an imminent threat. In fact, the information  proved the opposite was true.   We have been here before. We have seen what happens when  administrations manipulate intelligence or mischaracterize  intelligence, which is closer to the case we are looking at now-- mischaracterizing intelligence in order to justify a particular course  of action.   In the case of Iraq, President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and many  other members of that administration were determined to go to war to  ``remake'' the Middle East. They searched for pretexts. They embraced a  source called Curveball. They cherry-picked the intelligence to justify  their predetermined plan.   We know the end of the story. We know the end of that story. Their  claims that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction were fake, but  the toll of the Iraq war was very real.   The cost in blood and treasure were nearly 4,900 American lives lost,  and counting; tens of thousands wounded, and counting; $2 trillion  spent, and counting. The amount we will spend caring for those who bore  the battle, and their families, will not be fully known for decades, if  ever. The death toll of Iraqi civilians is not precisely known but is  certainly horrific.   The biggest winner from the war in Iraq was Iran--Iran--that had  fought in an almost 9-year war against Iraq and was able to take  advantage of a weakened Iraq. It just goes to show the many unintended  consequences of action not thoroughly thought through.   Before we get into another war in the Middle East, whether by design  or by miscalculation, let's come to our senses. A war with Iran would  do incalculable harm to the United States and to people throughout the  Middle East. It will result in huge loss of American lives and the  lives of thousands of other innocent people.   That is why our Founders did not put the power to take our country to  war in the hands of one person. They did not empower the President to  take our Nation to war. President Trump has said that article II gives  him ``the right to do whatever I want as President.''   We know that is not true. We know that is not what the Constitution  says. We know that the Framers vested the power to go to war in this  Senate and the House of Representatives, and they did it for a reason.   For goodness sake, let us not betray our constitutional duty. Let us,  at the very least, have the courage to assert the powers the  Constitution entrusts in us.   I yield back the time.
