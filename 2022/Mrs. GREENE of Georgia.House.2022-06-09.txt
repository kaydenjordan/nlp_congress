 Madam Speaker, well, we don't agree on much  these days here in Congress but I know there is one thing we all agree  on. We all agree that we really like guns. See, we are the special  privileged elites. We are the ones in this Chamber being protected by  guns while the American people don't have men and women with guns  outside their homes. Of course, not at any gun-free school zone they  are not protected, nor at work.   But here at Congress, the same Congress that is voting to send just  millions and millions of dollars worth of guns to Ukraine so that they  can defend themselves is the same Congress working as hard as possible  to take away the Second Amendment rights from Americans. You see, our  job here is to protect rights like due process and the Second Amendment  rights of Americans, not strip them away.    Red flag gun laws violate Americans' due process rights and this is  the type of thing that we shouldn't be passing in this Congress,  especially while we enjoy the very privileged elite special protection  of guns.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. I really appreciate him bringing up these very important  details  [[Page H5443]]  that I highly doubt we will hear anything about from the January 6  Committee.   You know, there are some very interesting facts that came out today,  as a matter of fact. Reporting on the failure of this Chamber, this  Capitol to be secured.   And I will tell you something. On January 6, I was a brand new Member  of Congress.    January 3 was my first day on the job.    That is right. Three days.   And I looked at the Capitol and thought this was the most secure  building that I could possibly be in, at least in this city, possibly  in the country, because it is our Nation's Capitol. And tragically, we  found out that it was not. I was shocked by that.   What amazes me is the overwhelming amount of evidence that the  National Guard was requested to be here and it was continuously turned  down. And the biggest shocker to me is that there were three people  that turned it down. It was Chuck Schumer in the Senate, Nancy Pelosi  in the House, and Mayor Muriel Bowser.    The Sergeant at Arms.    Nancy Pelosi.    The Speaker of the House is the one in charge  of the House Sergeant at Arms.   And the House Sergeant at Arms and the Senate Sergeant at Arms turned  down the request for the National Guard to keep all of us safe from the  threats that they knew existed.    No, we will not hear that from the January 6  Committee that spent millions of taxpayer dollars supposedly  investigating January 6. I highly doubt we will hear that. But I want  you to know that when we take back the majority, these will be the  investigations that we take on.   Now, I want you to know some other things that really bother me. As  we have spoken about the failure and absolutely purposeful refusal to  protect this Capitol by Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, Chuck  Schumer, and Mayor Muriel Bowser, these are the failures. They did it  on purpose.   There are other things I don't think we will hear about tonight, and  I remind everyone.   Number one, we still do not know who the pipe bomber is. Who is the  person? There are videos everywhere. It is all over the FBI website but  we don't hear that coming out consistently from the January 6  Committee.   You know what else we don't hear enough about? We do not understand  what is happening to the over 800 people who have been arrested and  charged for the events on January 6. We don't know what is happening to  them, and there are dozens of them right here in this city wasting away  in the D.C. jail, being treated like political prisoners of war.   And you know what? This is before they have been convicted of  anything. They are there pretrial. And no one cares about them. No one  on this January 6 Committee dares to ask a question, what is happening  to these people and why their due process rights are being so  flagrantly and horrifically violated, pretrial. Pretrial, they are  sitting in that jail.   Do you know they have begged to go to Guantanamo Bay because they  think terrorists are treated better than they are treated here? But no  one cares about them.                                time  1345    These people have been arrested and charged, and they are wasting  away in jail.   Do you want to know something else that we are probably not going to  hear about? What about the fact that there is a man named Ray Epps? Do  you know who is not in the D.C. jail? Ray Epps. Ray Epps is not in the  D.C. jail, and I know because I went in the D.C. jail. I did not see  him there. He also is on video over and over again telling people to go  in the Capitol.    I don't think we are going to hear about Ray  Epps. I don't think so. I don't think he is on the witness list.   Do you know who else we probably won't hear about? The man on the  scaffolding, the so-called scaffolding commander that told the crowd,  told them, sent them, gave them orders to go in the Capitol. Storm the  Capitol.   I haven't heard about him being questioned, have you?    No. Do you want to know something else? Here  is a woman we don't hear anything about, a woman named Rosanne Boyland,  who was trampled in the tunnel, trampled to death. We never hear  anything about this woman. She died in the tunnel of this Capitol, and  I saw the video myself when I was in the D.C. jail, from one of the  people being held there pretrial, by the way, of her body being drug  across the floor, and then it was taken somewhere else.   Do you know what happened when they were dragging her body away? They  pulled her away from someone that was giving her CPR. She was pulled  away from lifesaving CPR. Why did that happen? Are we going to hear  about that from the committee tonight? I doubt it. They don't care  about Rosanne Boyland.   Here is my major issue. We are representatives of the people of the  United States of America, and all I hear from everyone in this body is  all they care about is themselves. The American people are suffering  from so many things happening from the decisions of this body, but the  people in this body and the people in that committee don't care about  Rosanne Boyland from Georgia, by the way. They don't care about her  family. They don't care about justice for them. They don't care about  anything else but, oh, what happened to us on January 6.   Well, what happened to the American cities in 2020 that were burned  and looted and destroyed because of BLM violence? Nothing. All that  money raised on ActBlue for BLM? It went in their pockets. No one paid  to rebuild those communities. Not at all.   You know who else we probably won't hear about is Michael Byrd, who  shot and killed Ashli Babbitt right out there. We don't hear about his  reckless record of guns, which is all we have talked about all week in  here. We aren't hearing about that. Why aren't we hearing about that  record? Why? Why isn't he standing trial? He is not. He just gets to  get away with it. It is on video; I bet you we won't see this video,  but I have seen it. It is out there.   Did you know Ashli Babbitt was trying to stop people from breaking  in? That is on video. I have watched it over and over. She was trying  to stop people from breaking in, and then she was shot and killed.   Yes, a lot happened on January 6. Do you know what else--and the  American taxpayers pay for this--there are surveillance cameras all  over this building. If we really want to know the truth about January  6, it is real easy. All we have to do is release the video footage, and  everyone can see for themselves what exactly happened. I think the  American people deserve that while they have to watch and go through  this big cinematic production tonight and carrying on for weeks and  weeks and weeks. And the American people pay for it, by the way. The  American people deserve to see all the video surveillance, not just the  little cut and pasted pieces that the January 6th Committee is going to  show tonight.   Most of all, I want to finish with this: There is something terrible  happening in this process, and it is called defamation of character.  The 45th President of the United States' character is being defamed and  all of his staff and his family and all Republicans. Everyone's  reputation is being defamed as lies are being told about all of us and  President Trump just for politics, and it makes me sick. It absolutely  disgusts me.   If we are supposed to represent the American people, and we are  supposed to do a good job and uphold this place  [[Page H5444]]  with honor and keep its reputation good for the people we serve, then  we should be truthful. But what is about to happen tonight is not going  to be truthful. It is going to be a political narrative, and it is all  for politics. It is sickening.
