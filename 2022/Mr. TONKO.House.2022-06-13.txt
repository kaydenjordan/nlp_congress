 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an inspiring  pioneer and brilliant mind, Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson, on the occasion of  her retirement.   Dr. Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, was the  first Black woman to receive a doctorate degree in physics from MIT,  and in 1999 became the first Black woman to lead a top-ranked research  university.   Ever the trailblazer, Dr. Jackson was the first Black person and the  first woman to chair the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   Dr. Jackson's historic achievements in public service and in her  field of theoretical physics, combined with her tireless advocacy for  increased Black representation in STEM fields, continue to provide  inspiration to so many in New York's capital region and, for that  matter, across our Nation.   It is no surprise that Time magazine has called her ``perhaps the  ultimate role model for women in science.''   It is indeed my honor to congratulate the unmatched Dr. Jackson as  she embarks on the next chapter of her life. I thank her for inserting  herself, her strength, and her vision into the fabric of RPI.   Dr. Jackson, thank you for your outstanding leadership.                            ____________________
