 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor five incredible members  of Minnesota's law enforcement, each of whom is deservedly receiving  the FBI Director's Award for Excellence: Stearns County Deputy/ Investigator Dennis Kern, former Captain Pam Jensen, retired Bureau of  Criminal Apprehension Agent Ken McDonald, and Federal Bureau of  Investigation Special Agents Shane Ball and Chris Boeckers.   Twenty-nine years ago, on October 22, 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling  disappeared. Minnesota was left in shock and horror. Our State hoped  and prayed for decades that Jacob would return home.   Though unable to change the tragic outcome of Jacob's life, Deputy  Kern, Captain Jensen, Agent McDonald, Agent Ball, and Agent Boeckers  were able to offer some peace and comfort by apprehending Jacob's  murderer.   Mr. Speaker, words can't adequately express the gratitude that the  Wetterling family and all Minnesotans have for the law enforcement who  never stopped searching for Jacob, who never gave up.   To Deputy Kern, Captain Jensen, Agent McDonald, Agent Ball, and Agent  Boeckers, on behalf of all Minnesotans, thank you and God bless you.                            ____________________
