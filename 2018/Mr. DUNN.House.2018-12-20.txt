 Mr. Speaker, just over 2 months ago, Hurricane Michael  ravaged the panhandle of Florida. It was a devastating Category 4.9  storm, which damaged more than 90 percent of Tyndall Air Force Base,  decimated our agriculture industry, and destroyed entire communities.   Mr. Speaker, the folks back home in my district, the Second District  of Florida, are hurting. This supplemental disaster relief funding is a  downpayment on getting the hardworking folks in my district back on  their feet. This funding, by no means, is even close to what we will  need to completely rebuild, but it is a start.   I commend President Trump for remaining steadfast in his commitment  to our Nation. After Hurricane Michael, President Trump and Vice  President Pence came down to the Second District and made it clear that  we have their support and we will rebuild.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue to fight for the disaster relief funding  in the coming months and years because the survivors of Hurricane  Michael across the South deserve nothing less.
