The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington is recognized  for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Washington?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, the House Rules Committee met yesterday  and reported a rule, House Resolution 478, providing for further  consideration of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act  of 2018. This legislation includes four individual appropriations  bills: Defense, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military  Construction-Veterans Affairs. The rule provides for further  consideration of H.R. 3219 under a structured rule.   Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of a critical  measure that will prioritize funding for important components of our  national security. This legislation directs funding for our troops and  their families, our Nation's veterans, the legislative branch and  United States Capitol Police, border and nuclear security, energy and  water infrastructure investments, and vital appropriations to ensure  our military has the equipment and readiness necessary to keep the  Nation safe.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is composed of the serious and  essential work conducted by the House Appropriations Committee over the  past many months. As an appropriator and a member of this committee, I  fully appreciate and understand the hard work my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle have put in to report these key measures we have  before us today.   The most important job we have as Members of Congress is ensuring the  safety of our Nation. By supporting this rule, we can move the national  security package forward.   H.R. 3219 includes a 2.4 percent pay increase for our troops. That is  the largest military pay increase in 8 years. It keeps our military on  the cutting edge of defense technology by investing in research and  development and in equipment and weapons procurement. Under the  legislation, we will restore readiness shortfalls and make much-needed  critical investments for our troops to address ongoing threats around  the globe.   We must provide support for our troops to combat terrorism and defeat  ISIS. With the legislation, we take a major step forward in restoring  the devastating cuts our Armed Forces faced under the Obama  administration. The bill also increases funding for construction of  critical military infrastructure to keep our troops safe and prepared.   The bill also provides for critical safety and enhanced security  functions for the United States Capitol. In light of the recent  horrific attack on our colleagues, on staff, and on the Capitol Police,  the legislation provides increased funding for the Capitol Police  toward increased training, equipment, and technology-related support.   The men and women who guard these hallowed Halls deserve to have  access to every resource needed to do their job as safely and as  effectively as possible. Under this bill, H.R. 3219, we can ensure that  the Capitol Police and House Sergeant at Arms are equipped with these  critical enhancements.   Regarding the important Energy and Water provisions included in the  bill, the underlying legislation will improve public safety, will  create jobs, and will grow our economy by funding the Army Corps of  Engineers, prioritizing navigation projects and studies.   H.R. 3219 reduces regulatory red tape, including authorizing the  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as well as the  Secretary of the Army to withdraw from the devastating waters of the  United States rule.   The bill also funds important Department of Energy programs,  including nuclear cleanup efforts, such as the Hanford Site, which is  located in my district in central Washington State, as well as nuclear  weapons programs to strengthen our national security.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation also provides the highest level of  funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs in our Nation's history,  ensuring that we keep the commitment to those who have defended our  Nation. It supports vital medical care for our veterans, including  mental healthcare services, suicide prevention activities, traumatic  brain treatment, opioid abuse prevention, and homeless veteran  services.   There are some issues here in Congress that are nonpartisan. Every  single one of our colleagues here in the U.S. House of Representatives  believes we must provide the best care possible for our Nation's  veterans. I am proud of the significant strides this legislation takes  to support veterans across the country.   The rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of a  bill that is critically important to keeping our Nation safe.                                time  1245    By passing this legislation, we will continue to rebuild our  military, ensure we maintain our military superiority, and boost  defense efforts in the face of rising global threats.   The bill will aid in supporting our troops and their families, and  improve access to care for our veterans. It will increase the safety of  the United  [[Page H6482]]  States Capitol complex for Members and staff who serve here; for  constituents, as well as the tourists from around the globe who visit  this campus; and for the valued Capitol Police, who protect us all.   It will also aid in important infrastructure and construction  investments to move the United States towards energy independence,  improve our economic competitiveness, and fund nonproliferation efforts  to prevent, counter, and respond to global nuclear threats.   Most importantly, this legislation will make major strides to  projects our men and women in uniform serving across the globe who are  protecting our freedoms.   I urge my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Carter), the chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee  of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, we do have a couple of speakers coming who  are not here yet.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time at this point but look  forward to having them participate as soon as they get here.    Mr. Speaker, the American people spoke loud and clear  last November. They voted to support a stronger military, an unyielding  national defense, and that includes the need for a much-improved border  security. As the gentleman from Texas said, we have threats of human  traffickers, drug smugglers, terrorists coming across our borders, and  this is something that the American people said that they wanted, and  we are responding to that with recommendations from the Customs and  Border Protection agency.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the debate on both sides on this  very important issue.   Let me just say that this has been a very open process. Not all may  want to acknowledge that, but let me just point out that this rule  makes 54 amendments in order: 21 of those amendments are from the  Democrats, 16 from Republicans, and fully, 17 are led by bipartisan  cosponsors. So that tells me that the openness of this process, the  ability for people to bring their perspectives, their opinions in this  important debate is real.   As far as the Rules Committee unilaterally striking language and  reinserting other language, that is true. We struck section 9021 of the  Defense Appropriations Act of 2018 and replaced it, though, with  language from an amendment offered by Mr. Cole to the NDAA, the  National Defense Authorization Act of 2018, which was adopted by the  full House on July 13 of this year. It was replaced with language that  was approved by this body. So again, Mr. Speaker, I think that points  to the openness of this process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do know that even though some people  would like to ignore the situation we have on our southern border, we  do need to respond to those border protection agents who are asking us  for help. We do need to respond to the crisis that we see along our  southern border to keep our country as safe as possible. And we do need  to confirm to people across the country that help is on the way.   Certainly, the border is one aspect of this important piece of  legislation, but there are many things in this bill that will help our  country and help our military forces keep our Nation safe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say to my good friend from  California, I agree that a new authorization on the use of military  force is something that is necessary, something that we owe our  military, and something that we should do.   The language with the Cole amendment, I think, starts us down that  path. In fact, the Foreign Affairs Committee, just this week, is  holding hearings on this very important topic.   I look forward to working with Ms. Lee on this, as well as all of us  here in this House, to get us to the end result that I think is  absolutely necessary, and I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs).                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, let me just say that one of the beauties  of Congress is being able to hear from people firsthand their  experiences, who speak not just in theoretical senses but because of  the life they live and their constituents, and so I appreciate very  much the gentleman from Arizona and his testimony.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Sanford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Poe), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the discussion we have had this past hour  from all Members that have participated. Although we may have our  differences, some difference of opinion, I believe that this rule and  the underlying bill are strong measures that are important to ensuring  the security and the prosperity of our country. The rule provides for  further consideration of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure  Appropriations Act of 2018.   Let me say again, while my friends on the other side may not want to  acknowledge it, this rule makes 54 amendments in order; 21 of those 54  are from my Democratic friends, 16 are Republican, and 17 are  bipartisan, led by bipartisan cosponsors. In fact, the majority of the  amendments that were made in order under yesterday's rule that provide  for the initial consideration of this bill were also led by Democrats,  so this reflects the balanced approach of the process under this rule.                                time  1345    Mr. Speaker, it is our job, it is Congress' job, to appropriate the  necessary funds to keep our Nation safe and our defense strong. This  rule allows us to complete our efforts to complete the appropriations  process for our top priorities, those of national security. I look  forward, though, to bringing the other eight appropriation bills to the  floor to fulfill the rest of our duty. Certainly, as an appropriator,  no one wants to see this effort completed more than our committee and  as I do.   I have appreciated the important advocacy my colleagues on both sides  have brought forward through this process, from within the  subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee, through the full  committee, through the Rules Committee, and now, here on the House  floor.   The measures included in this rule will provide vital resources for  our national defense and for our military infrastructure. As I said, it  will boost the pay of our troops, support our military families who  sacrifice so much for our country; it will strengthen the care we  provide for our veterans and enforce our border security to protect all  of the American people.   This rule will also allow for further security improvements for the  Capitol campus to protect all who visit here. It will also provide  robust funding to improve our Nation's waterways, our infrastructure,  our important nuclear clean-up, as well as nonproliferation efforts.   It also reinstates our top priority, providing funding for our  national defense. We must begin to rebuild our Nation's military, and I  am proud of this as a major step forward, restoring military readiness  in order to keep our country safe.   Mr. Speaker, the underlying appropriations within this rule are of  the utmost importance to the Nation, and we must move forward with this  rule in order to get our job done. The men and women in uniform serving  our Nation around the globe are depending on us.   I hope our colleagues, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, will  support this rule so that we can do that, get our job done.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 478 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, the amendment described in section 7 shall be in       order as though printed as the last amendment in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution if offered by Representative Lee of California or       her designee. Such amendment shall be debatable for 10       minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and       an opponent.        Sec. 7. The amendment referred to in section 6 is as       follows:        ``At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec__. (a) None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to implement, enforce, or administer the       Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40;       50 U.S.C. 1541 note).        (b) Subsection (a) shall apply beginning on the date that       is 240 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.''.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
