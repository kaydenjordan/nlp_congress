 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    First of all, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted  to speak for up to 7 minutes and Senator Barrasso be permitted to speak  for up to 10 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall votes.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I want to speak about a piece of  bipartisan legislation that Chairman Tester and I introduced with the  unanimous support of every member of the Senate Committee on Veterans  Affairs, both Republicans and Democrats.   Consensus is often hard to find, as we know, in this body, but caring  for our Nation's veterans--our heroes--has a way of bringing us  together. I tell Kansans back home that the Senate on veterans affairs  is one of the few places left on which Republicans and Democrats find  common ground. I hope that continues, and I hope that spreads.   Caring for our Nation's veterans is an honor that we all have, and  when you reach an agreement between some of the most liberal members of  our committee and the most conservative members of our committee, you  know that you have a really good deal.   I first learned about the issue of toxic exposure years ago, while  attending an event for Vietnam veterans at home in Kansas. After  hearing about their struggles with exposure to Agent Orange, I  introduced the Toxic Exposure Research Act, which was signed into law  in 2016 and mandates research on health conditions of children and  grandchildren of veterans who were exposed to toxins during their  military service.   Our military veterans and their families and their survivors know  exposure to toxic substances has become commonplace in modern warfare.  Regrettably, the negative long-term health effects are sometimes not  identified until long after the time of exposure, leaving veterans to  face serious medical issues years after their service.   Toxic exposure during military service has created significant  healthcare concerns for veterans, going back to mustard gas exposure in  World War I and, most notably, the Vietnam generation's exposure to  Agent Orange.   Despite these clear examples of lasting impact of military toxic  exposures, struggles with health conditions associated with burn pits  continue to plague the latest generation of veterans who served in the  Global War on Terror.   I have spoken with veterans across Kansas and held a townhall meeting  in my home State on the effects of toxic exposure on our veterans'  health. My office continues to receive casework  [[Page S445]]  from veterans regarding the burden of proof to gain access to  healthcare. This legislation--the one that our committee will consider  tomorrow--lessens that burden and creates a pathway for thousands of  Kansas veterans and many more thousands of American veterans to receive  healthcare for illnesses caused by toxic exposure.   For decades, toxic-exposed veterans have faced overwhelming barriers  to getting VA healthcare and the services that they deserve. Post-911  veterans are the newest generation of American heroes to suffer from  toxic exposures encountered in their military service.   These American heroes who put on the uniform and volunteered to go  into harm's way on our behalf deserve to have their level of commitment  matched by those of us who serve here in Congress. When our government  sends troops to war, we make a pledge to care for them when they come  home. Veterans who are made sick from service deserve medical care for  those conditions.   The Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act is an important first step  in making certain our veterans receive the care they need as a result  of their service.   I appreciate the entire Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for  working together to craft this consequential legislation to care for  our servicemembers who put their lives and health on the line for us. I  also appreciate every member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee--Senators Tillis, Hassan, Sullivan, Manchin, Boozman,  Sanders, Cassidy, Brown, Blackburn, Blumenthal, Tuberville, Hirono,  Cramer, Sinema, and Rounds--for working together to better the lives of  those who have served. Additionally, I am grateful for the support of  many VSOs--veterans service organizations--that represent millions of  veterans across the Nation.   This legislation is part of a comprehensive and phased approach. This  first phase provides the VA with the authority it needs to expand  healthcare for combat veterans. For many who are sick and suffering,  time is running out, and our first priority is to get these veterans  their healthcare now.   Our bill would also mandate training for the VA healthcare providers  and benefit specialists to ensure a level of competence across the  Department to make sure veterans receive exemplary treatment and  service.   Our legislation would direct the VA to incorporate a clinical  screening to inquire about a veteran's potential exposures and symptoms  commonly associated with toxic exposure.   I talked to a veteran today who said she has been to the VA twice for  care and treatment and has never been asked about whether she  encountered any substance that could have been damaging to her health  during her service. After speaking with these veterans, I have come to  understand that this basic and preventive act of screening is not part  of enrollment or basic care provided by the Department. That must  change.   Solutions to this complex problem cannot be generated by Congress  alone and require a coordinated and systematic approach that involves  partnering with the VA. My view is that we make a commitment to those  who serve that we will do our work. This is a significant step in  getting us to a point at which we are living up to that commitment and  doing it in a way that is not damaging to any other veteran.   I urge my colleagues to read our bill, to grow their understanding of  this complex challenge, and to join our committee, every single member  of the committee, in passing this bill to get one step closer to  providing care and relief on one of the most pressing challenges facing  veterans today.                                  ______                                         By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Paul, Mr. Lee, Ms. Sinema, Mr.          Braun, and Mr. Ossoff):   S. 3545. A bill to require the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to  be appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.   Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3545         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(2) With the exception of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation, the Bureau of Prisons had the largest       operating budget of any unit within the Department of Justice       for fiscal year 2018.        (3) As of 2019, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons       oversaw 122 facilities and was responsible for the welfare of       more than 176,000 Federal inmates.        (4) As of 2019, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons       supervised more than 36,000 employees, many of whom operate       in hazardous environments that involve regular interaction       with violent offenders.        (5) Within the Department of Justice, in addition to those       officials who oversee litigating components, the Director of       the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the       Director of the Community Relations Service, the Director of       the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Director of the       Office on Violence Against Women, the Administrator of the       Drug Enforcement Administration, the Deputy Administrator of       the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Director of the       United States Marshals Service, 94 United States Marshals,       the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, and the       Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment       Practices, are all appointed by the President by and with the       advice and consent of the Senate.        (6) Despite the significant budget of the Bureau of Prisons       and the vast number of people under the responsibility of the       Director of the Bureau of Prisons, the Director is not       appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
