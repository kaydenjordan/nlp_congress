 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. As a  veteran, and as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I have  had the privilege of seeing firsthand how intelligence supports U.S.  foreign policy abroad and just how important our allies are when  fighting our adversaries.   Intelligence sharing relationships act as a force multiplier,  ensuring the security of the United States and our allies. As we have  seen time and time again, restricting such critical information sharing  results in disastrous repercussions.   Even as we debate this amendment, our strategic partners, such as  Saudi Arabia, have civilian targets that are being attacked by Iran- backed Houthi rebels. These same Iran-supported rebels pose a threat to  U.S. military personnel in the region.   Yesterday, this body debated an amendment tasking the ODNI to provide  an annual report on civilian casualties.   You know what helps minimize civilian casualties? Intelligence.  Intelligence helps ensure that the correct targets are hit, while  minimizing collateral damage.   I am gravely concerned with the dangerous long-term implications of  this ill-advised amendment. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to  oppose the amendment.
