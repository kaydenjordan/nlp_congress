 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise President Biden and my  Democratic colleagues for our work to support the American people this  year.   We are building bridges and paving new roads across this country. We  broke ground on the new Hudson River tunnel to boost travel and the  economy.   We are lowering prices on insulin and other lifesaving medications.   We are improving education.   We are protecting voting rights.   We are fighting for reproductive rights for all women.   We are creating jobs and investing in new semiconductor chip  technology to protect American innovations.   The American people told us that this is what they want done. We are  doing them.   Republicans threw out the House Speaker for the first time in U.S.  history and worked for their reckless political agenda instead of the  American people.   Democrats work for America. Republicans work for themselves.                            ____________________
