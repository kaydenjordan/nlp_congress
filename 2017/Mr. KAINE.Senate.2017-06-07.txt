 Mr. President. Today I am introducing a bipartisan bill to  make the process of siting natural gas pipelines fairer and more  transparent.   For some time now, I have been listening to Virginians with  passionate views on the proposed Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley  Pipelines. For various reasons, many oppose one or both of these  projects, while others support these projects. The Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, FERC, is tasked with analyzing all the issues-- purpose and need for a project, impacts on 2 'people living on the  route, potential risks to the environment or property--and deciding  what course best serves the public interest.   From listening to all sides, I have concluded that while reasonable  people may reach different conclusions, FERC's public input process is  flawed and could be better. Accordingly, this legislation proposes  several steps to address several shortcomings, all of which were  originally brought to my attention by Virginia constituents. For  instance, this bill requires programmatic analysis of pipelines  proposed around the same time and in the same geographic vicinity so  that the full impacts of multiple projects can be analyzed. It requires  a greater number of public comment meetings so that citizens are not  required to commute long distances to meetings at which they must speed  through just a few minutes of remarks on these complex topics. And it  clarifies the circumstances under which eminent domain should and  should not be used.   I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator Mark Warner on this  bill, and our Virginia Republican colleague Representative Morgan  Griffith is preparing a similar bill in the House of Representatives.  While our views may differ on many aspects of energy policy, we can all  agree that the public deserves reasonable opportunity to weigh in on  energy infrastructure projects and that this process can be fairer and  more transparent without mandating a particular outcome.   I encourage the Senate to consider this legislation, not to pave the  way for pipelines nor to throw up insurmountable roadblocks to them-- but to give the public greater certainty that the federal government's  infrastructure decisions are fair and transparent.                            ____________________     Mr. President.
