 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4664, and that I may include  tabular material on the same.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to begin consideration of H.R. 4664, the  fiscal  [[Page H5551]]  year 2024 Financial Services and General Government appropriations  bill.   Before I get into details, I would like to recognize the hard work of  Chairwoman Granger on this bill, and the entire appropriations process.   We are one step closer to passing the last remaining few  appropriations bills. I also want to thank my good friend, Ranking  Member Steny Hoyer, for his input on this bill. We have had many  conversations. Steny is a dear friend of mine, somebody that I worked  very closely with, not only with this bill, but other matters of  importance to our country. I consider him a very, very dear friend, and  it is an honor to have him at my side as the ranking member.   Mr. Chairman, look at these people right here. This is my team. I  know I am a bit prejudiced. Steny would probably say the same thing  about his team. These are the best that we have. We have Lauren Flynn  and her team and my personal staff. The work they have put into this  process is truly remarkable.   I want the American people to know how dedicated these folks are in  trying to deal with the challenges that face our country on an everyday  basis, in this case, the funding of our government.                                time  0915    I could not do what I do, nor could any Member of this House of  Representatives, no Member can do what they do without the dedication  of these people. It is not lost on me, and I want to publicly recognize  them.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 4664 provides $25.279 billion in nondefense  discretionary spending across a number of critical agencies. The swath  that we cover is incredible.   It also includes $45 million in defense spending. It rejects over $6  billion in discretionary funding increases within the President's  budget request.   The bill represents an adequate level of funding, given our fiscal  constraints. It is 7 percent below the fiscal year `23 enacted level  and 2 percent below the fiscal year `22 enacted level.   The bill provides the resources necessary to combat threats and  protect the integrity of our financial and judicial system.   We claw back over $10 billion of unused and unobligated Inflation  Reduction Act IRS funding preventing the creation of a super army of  IRS agents poised to target individuals and small business owners. This  rescission does not touch taxpayer services or the modernization of  business systems which means taxpayers will still be able to get the  assistance they need to file their taxes, and the IRS can continue to  modernize their systems and better protect taxpayer data from  cyberattacks.   We also rescind IRA money from the General Services Administration  targeted to make Federal buildings greener. Instead of leading by  example in the construction of sustainable buildings, GSA should lead  by example by bringing their employees back to the office like the  private sector.   I am proud this bill requires Federal agencies to return to the  office at prepandemic telework levels. We must hold the Federal  workforce accountable for the quality of their work and the service  they provide to the American people. The administration has been  unwilling to make any real progress on this front, and we cannot afford  to have vacant Federal buildings in the District and across our  country.   The bill demands that agencies concentrate on their core mission. Mr.  Chair, let me say that again. It is important that our agencies that we  fund stick to their core mission. The pursuit of job-killing,  burdensome, and unnecessary regulations only serve to further bloat a  Federal bureaucracy that has become, in my strong opinion, too big, too  intrusive, and counterintuitive to limited government.   Specifically, we turn off rulemaking in the Securities and Exchange  Commission that lack proper cost-benefit analysis and aggregate income  analysis. Further, we prohibit agencies like the SEC and the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau from collecting and storing personal data  that is unconstitutional and serves no regulatory purpose.   To be clear, the agencies under our jurisdiction perform important  functions; however, many have strayed from their purpose, and the  results have been a true disservice to the American people. This bill  responsibly returns them to their core mission.   Mr. Chair, this bill is a strong bill with funding reductions and  policy wins, I urge its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Mr. Chairman, as I said earlier, Steny and I are really good friends,  and this goes all the way back to when I first got here. He had already  been here for a long time. I won't say how much time, but quite a  while, so I learn from people like that.   That being said, we have a different view in many cases, sometimes  about the role of the government or why we need to fund the government  at levels that they would prefer. I am going to pick one issue. There  are many we could talk about, but he mentioned fentanyl.   Nobody in this country would argue that we don't have a fentanyl  problem. Mr. Chairman, 100,000 people a year are dying as a result of  this synthetic, illegal substance that is making its way across our  borders.   Mr. Chairman, what this side of the aisle believes is that instead of  fighting the issue on the inside of the country--and let me remind you  that on the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program, we fund  HIDTA at a level higher than the President of the United States  requested. It is a little bit less than last year but higher than the  President's request.   I reject out of hand the notion that we are endangering the lives of  Americans because all of a sudden we don't think that fentanyl is a  problem. No, we believe fentanyl is a problem, but we believe the  problem should be addressed at the border of this country, at our  southern border, where a lot of this product is making its way across  without any real effort to stop it.   It is making its way into the households of America, from sea to  shining sea. Then all of a sudden we get accused of wanting to cut  budgets for agencies that target that illegal substance. For some  reason, we are the bad guys.   We think that if we had better border security, which is something  that both sides of the aisle have argued about for decades, maybe we  wouldn't need as much money to fight these problems interior to our  country.   I use that as an example, and there are others, but let's just agree  on this: With the better part of a $2 trillion deficit this year, we  have to address the root cause of what is causing such a difficult spot  for this Nation, and that is the fiscal health of the country.   Mr. Chairman, $2 trillion deficits, as far as the eye can see, are  not a sustainable outcome. We are over $33 trillion in debt right now,  and I guess the debt service of our country--I don't know what the  current numbers are, but it is approaching a trillion dollars a year.   We should think for just a moment what we could do if, instead of  paying our creditors, we are able to use that trillion dollars for  programs that benefit all Americans. That is a subject for a different  day.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.  Hinson), my dear friend who is a very valued member of this  subcommittee and a bright, shining star in the U.S. House of  Representatives.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Iowa.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) for the purpose of engaging in a  colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Mr. Barr for his kind remarks and for his hard work in  drafting the TABS Act. We are pleased to include it in this year's  Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill.   Let me add that I fully agree with your assessment of the importance  of making the CFPB part of the annual appropriations process.   As you noted, most agencies are funded by Congress, including all the  traditional consumer protection agencies, as you have articulated.   I also agree with you that the purpose of this legislation is to  uphold the Constitution. I mean, that is our oath. That is what we  swear to on January 3 every other year. This is a principled action. It  is not an effort to kill the CFPB. That is why this bill funds the CFPB  at the level it receives now.   We merely want to create an accountable funding structure for the  CFPB that is like all other consumer protection agencies. That is why I  will not support the amendment to eliminate the funding. That is why  this is about constitutional principles, not the CFPB's existence.   Finally, let me say the Appropriations Committee has a critical  constitutional responsibility to oversee how the Federal Government  spends taxpayer dollars.   The annual process is the mechanism whereby our democracy ensures  that the people's priorities are reflected in how taxpayer dollars are  allocated and spent. It is my hope the Supreme Court recognizes this  fact and strikes down the funding structure of the CFPB.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Chairman, we are prepared to close.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As I stated in my opening, I have great respect for my friend, the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), and his team over there. They do  their work in accordance with what they feel are the emerging issues  facing our country. We do the same on our side.   Suffice it to say, though, what we need right now is a bill on this  floor that we can use as a basis to go negotiate with our Senate  counterparts at the other end of this Capitol and, hopefully, come up  with a conference report that we can all live with.   We know that the clock is running. America knows that, on November  17, we are going to have a continuing resolution of some form to be  able to continue the work of this appropriations process. A lot of work  has gone into it. We can have our differences. Those are well stated,  as evidenced by the debate this morning, but we need to finish our  work.   We will have a big amendment process going on throughout the day  today, tonight, and into tomorrow, but we need right now to finish our  work on this bill, get it across the finish line, make it a basis for  negotiation in the Senate, get a conference report, and finish at least  this portion of the 12-bill appropriations work. That is what we are  responsible for doing here today.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 847, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bipartisan en  bloc amendment that has the endorsement of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle.   Breaking news: This en bloc has proven that Democrats and Republicans  can work together and find common solutions--on some things anyway.   The amendments set forth in this en bloc highlight the priorities in  the Financial Services and General Government bill that address  critical policies to strengthen our economy and bolster our workforce,  and I look forward to incorporating these amendments into my bill.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague and good friend Ranking Member Hoyer  for his consultation and all Members who have worked with me on this  bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the en bloc amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Molinaro).    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, Community Development Financial Institutions  stimulate economic growth and create and sustain employment  opportunities in rural and low-income areas, like a lot of America.   The CDFI fund ensures CDFIs are able to provide these underserved  communities access to capital by awarding certified CDFIs with tax  credits and monetary support.   I am proud that my own State greatly benefits from the CDFI fund and  have seen the far-reaching impact it has had on the community.  Defunding the program would only serve to harm the most vulnerable  communities in America.   So it is under that pretense, Mr. Chairman, that I oppose the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, for the reasons stated previously, I urge  rejection of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me correct the record on one thing my  friend said. He referred to the continuing resolution that expires not  February 17, but this month, November 17. I just didn't want him to  give the American people the appearance that we had a lot more time  because we don't.    Exactly.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's  amendment.   In full committee we had a robust discussion. I think the information  we are working on right now is back in 2018 from the GAO. It is time  for the IRS Commissioner to give us this information.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the gentlewoman for the Bedlam battle  victory that they had this past week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, as I mentioned before in the previous debate,  we had a robust debate in full committee and adopted an amendment which  capped IRS firearms and ammunition levels as of July 13, 2023. I think  that is reasonable.   This amendment would remove that cap. I understand that some of my  colleagues have concerns about Federal agencies holding vast amounts of  firepower. We need to be careful not to deprive our agencies of the  ability to purchase firearms to carry out their lawful duties.   Mr. Speaker, it is under that circumstance that I oppose the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland, the ranking  member of the subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I would say, notwithstanding the fact that  these Federal agencies engage in law enforcement activities, whether it  is IRS or FBI, it doesn't make any difference. They are engaged in some  very dangerous activities. Notwithstanding the fact that they are  engaged in activities, we should all remember that part of their  mission is also to train for these dangerous circumstances.   There are training events and weapons qualifications and all kinds of  thing that require the expense of ammunition, maybe not for a nefarious  target down range, but in order to be able to make them better at their  trade should that circumstance present itself.   Mr. Chairman, it is under those conditions that I reluctantly oppose  the gentlewoman's amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from Tennessee for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   To be clear, I have a record throughout this entire appropriations  process that will demonstrate that I am not a supporter writ large of  the Holman rule. I personally think it has been overused, and the  record can reflect that I don't think I am on the record voting for any  of the Holman rules to date. I wanted to make that disclosure up front,  but that is just a personal opinion. That is what I believe.   The Holman rule is a serious tool in Congress, and I think we have to  be careful when we are establishing precedents on the use of it, but I  do think there are times when the Holman rule is justified.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, the Securities and Exchange Commission  under Chairman Gary Gensler is an example of a time when I think the  Holman rule can be used as a messenger to the SEC Chairman.   The health and vibrancy of our markets and our economy at large can  be tested by an aggressive and overzealous rulemaking agenda. Over the  last 3 years, that has defined the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Let me be clear: This is not just about how the regulatory process is  conducted. The weight of the issues and topics under review by Chairman  Gensler must be considered thoughtfully and comprehensively.  Unfortunately, they have not been.   Reckless rulemaking requires climate disclosures from not only public  companies that the SEC claims but also the private suppliers far  downstream from these public companies.    Mr. Chair, in the interest of time, this list goes on and  on, to the tune of about 50 proposed and finalized rules by Chairman  Gensler, a breakneck speed of rulemaking given that he has been  Chairman for 3 years.   To me, it is unacceptable, and we have had that dialogue in hearings.  Speed and volume should not be defining characteristics of the  rulemaking process.   Mr. Chair, I stand with the gentleman from Tennessee and the  gentleman from South Carolina, the authors of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I support the Holman rule in this particular case.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my ranking member for yielding.  With all due respect to my colleague, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   This bill funded the Office of the Vice President at a 20 percent cut  from last year, so we have taken steps to send that message, that power  of the purse message to the Office of the Vice President. This  amendment would completely eliminate funding for the salary and  expenses of any employee in the office.   Now, I agree that the Biden administration is pursuing an agenda that  is in conflict with what I believe, there is no question about that.   However, I think it is wrong for us to take our grievances out by  just carte blanche eliminating funding for the Office of the Vice  President of the United States. Now, that is just a bridge too far, as  far as I am concerned.   We need to have these debates about whether or not border security is  correct or, you know, pick from the menu of all of the various things  that divide Republicans and Democrats. But to go this far, I would  strongly encourage the House of Representatives to take a very sober  view of an amendment like this and understand that these kinds of  things cut both ways.   I would caution us not to enter into the territory where because of  an issue that we might have some disagreement on that we find it within  our ability or the course of action to just eliminate the funding for  the Office of the Vice President. I strongly oppose this amendment.    Would the gentleman yield?    It may be duplicative, but it is twice as nice, so we  will proceed.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her amendment,  and I rise in support.   Plainly and simply, environmental policing is not within the SEC's  scope. It is just not. I know this process that we have undergone this  morning sounds a lot like we are ganging up on Gensler, and maybe we  are, and for good reason.   Scope 3 emissions are hard to quantify, requiring the shifting of  information needed from outside partnering companies like family  farmers. The information that would need to be reported to bigger  companies the farmers rely on for business is overly burdensome.   Farmers are American heroes. They don't need any more negative input  factors on how they feed, clothe, and fuel this Nation. They already  have enough to deal with--high inflation, markets, weather.   Somebody has to stand up for the family farmer, and that is why I am  proud to support my colleague from Minnesota's amendment here, and I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, the farmer needs an advocate, and that is what we are  doing.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment.   I agree that it is our job. The once measured, productive, and  independent FTC has, in recent years, certainly under this  administration and Chairwoman Khan, turned into an agency that has  disposed of tested and proven operations and rulemakings.   Gone are the days of competition based on prices, products, and  business innovation. Today, we have an FTC that is guided by political  whims and I guess the overall notion that big has to be bad.   As a result, numerous rulemakings have raised serious questions for  the American people and American businesses of all sizes, which is  especially true for rules developed under the FTC's unfair methods of  competition standard, which this amendment prohibits, including the  ill-advised noncompete rulemaking.   I stand here today in support of my friend from Wisconsin's amendment  in order to rein in the Biden administration's FTC by prohibiting  section 5 actions and the suspension of the early termination to  premerger notification filings.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for his thoughtful amendment, and I  encourage my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chair, my thanks to the minority side for giving me  an opportunity to speak. I rise in opposition to the gentleman from  Florida's amendment.   We are not always going to hate the FBI. I realize there are people  on my side of the aisle that don't like some of the activities of the  FBI. I am not going to pick an argument on that.   What I will argue is that it is bad policy for the Congress to be  taking steps to deny a Federal agency that is in serious need, in my  opinion, of an improvement to their headquarters.   Now, notice I said improvement. I didn't say some massive, big  expansion, necessarily. What I do know is that when I toured the FBI  headquarters, I saw it in a state of disrepair that is going to need  the attention of the owners of that property. That is us. To  [[Page H5618]]  deny the FBI the opportunity to be able to explore other alternatives,  I think, is a bit shortsighted.    The fact is the building is crumbling, and there is going  to be a need to do something. What that something is, I am not an  expert on. I think it would be wrong for us to be taking this action  today pursuant to this amendment without having at least a hearing and  an opportunity for the people responsible for the facilities--FBI, GSA,  any other stakeholder--to be able to help us understand what the  situation is today and what the needs are of tomorrow. That discussion  can take place, should take place, but I think it is a bit shortsighted  and premature for us to be taking the action that this amendment would  call for here today.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I rise to point out something that is pretty  obvious to everybody, and that is that this process that we are going  through right now can come across very complicated, but it is a broken  budget process system.   What I would like to see happen as we matriculate through the  remainder of the Financial Services-General Government bill and as we  move toward trying to get something done on Commerce-Justice-Science  and Labor-Health and Human Services is that maybe we would have this  moment of sobriety as a House and recognize that fixing this broken  budget process is going to be essential if this Congress is going to be  successful.   We are sitting here today with a clock ticking and the sand is in the  hourglass running right through to where on November 17 we could be  facing a government shutdown. There have been many opportunities for us  to complete our work on appropriations, move bills through the House,  get them conferenced with the Senate, and get them signed into law. Of  course, we are working against a deadline at the end of this year that  will require a 1 percent sequester if we don't get all 12 bills  through.   So it is my fervent belief that Congress can fix this issue if  Congress will recognize that it has an issue. I think the American  people recognize it. We are looking right down the barrel of a  government shutdown. If we can't find the resources to prevent a lapse  in government funding by next weekend and then even at the end of this  year, we are, as I said, facing that 1 percent sequester.   So we have a lot of work to do that is going to require the  cooperation of the left and the right to be able to come to terms, fix  our broken budget process system, and get this regular order system  back and working for the American people.   I was hoping for some buy-in from my friends on the left because  they, too, recognize this process, but I guess they look at us and say:  You are the governing majority, and it is up to you to make this thing  work.   Nevertheless, it has been broken with both sides being in control, so  it is essential, I think, that we do that.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                 Amendment No. 63 Offered by Mrs. Harshbarger     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment. Despite what my colleague on the other side says, when I  hear regulation, I don't necessarily hear protection. Sometimes I hear  just more red tape and more bars to success.   The private fund adviser rulemaking is a perfect example of the  aggressive regulatory posture Chairman Gensler has taken that has  threatened our markets and financial systems.   Bureaucratic overreach has been a hallmark of this administration's  SEC. It is past time, Mr. Chairman, that these rules be stopped.   The sweeping proposal for private fund advisers is a prime instance  of the agency's failure to conduct thorough economic analysis, missing  the serious potential impact of underserved business and emerging asset  managers.   This proposal could create additional hyper-regulatory hurdles for  those who have overcome obstacles of their own to break into the  market.   Therefore, I support the gentleman's amendment and yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from South Carolina for  yielding.   Look, I am just going to be really brief. What we don't need is a  disruption of innovation. That is what we don't need. What we do need  in the financial industry are clear rules of the road, not confusing  compliance standards within the analytics space.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to support the gentleman from South  Carolina's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Steube) having assumed the chair, Mr. Moylan, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4664)  making appropriations for financial services and general government for  the fiscal year ending  [[Page H5643]]  September 30, 2024, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution  thereon.                            ____________________
