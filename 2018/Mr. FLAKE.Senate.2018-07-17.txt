 Thank you. I will just be a moment.   Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my Democratic  colleagues and hope that more of my Republican colleagues will speak  about the spectacle yesterday in Helsinki.   I said yesterday that I never thought I would see the President of  the United States stand with the President of Russia and blame the  United States for Russian aggression. I said yesterday that that was  shameful. I feel the same today.   Today, the President said that the press conference had been  misinterpreted by the fake news media. I would say to the President  that we all watched the press conference, and it wasn't the fake news  media that sided with the Russian President over our own intelligence  agencies; it was you.   This body must stand and reaffirm that we stand with the men and  women in the Department of Justice who have brought these 12  indictments against individuals from the Russian Federation who  interfered with our elections. We must say that we stand with our NATO  allies and we stand with those in the EU; that they are not foes, they  are friends. We must stand up to the real adversaries we have. Right  now, Russia is an adversary. I hope the President will realize that. I  hope he will take the word of the men and women of the Department of  Justice and the entire intelligence agencies rather than the empty  words of a dictator.   With that, I yield the floor.
