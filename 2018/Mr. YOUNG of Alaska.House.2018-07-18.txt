 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 18, 2018, on page H6515, the following appeared: The Chair  recognizes the gentleman from Alaska. (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked  and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)      The online version has been corrected to read: The Chair  recognizes the gentleman from Alaska.  Mr.  Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. YOUNG of  Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    ========================= END NOTE =========================    [[Page H6516]]         Mr. Chairman, Alaska has a long history of  placer mining operations, beginning in the early 1800s and continuing  through today. In fact, Alaska is one of the few places left, including  California, that has placer mining operations.   Most placer mining operations are small, but it as a robust industry  in Alaska, providing hundreds of jobs and contributing to the growth of  rural Alaskan communities.   The Bureau of Land Management's Fortymile plan, finalized in the last  days of the previous administration, upended decades of successful  placer mining land management in the Fortymile Planning Area.   The Fortymile plan imposed an overly complex regulatory framework on  small-scale placer mining operations as part of an ongoing effort to  discourage mining activity in the area.   The Fortymile miners previously agreed to environmental remediation  standards, and under the new plan proposed by the BLM, they are  expected to reclaim land that they have not mined and mitigate in ways  they did not agree to in their approved operation plans.   They are expected to remediate land that was impacted by placer  mining over 100 years ago, which adds to their financial burden and  makes it economically impractical for miners to continue their  operations.   This language has been included in the appropriations report language  by unanimous consent for the last 2 years. This is a necessary piece of  legislation and amendment to this bill to make sure the BLM recognizes  that miners do have obligations, they have met their obligations, and  the agencies have gone against them.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the comments from the  chairman, and especially the comments from the gentlewoman who  understands and has opposition. I would like to remind everybody,  again, the reclamation was taking place, the mitigation was taking  place. They changed the rules after they agreed on it.   This is not a newly mined area. This has been mined before. In fact,  I just came from there on the Fourth of July. Chicken, Alaska. This is  where this mine is. Lots of mom-and-pop operations, retired people.  Chicken, Alaska. You know why they call it ``Chicken''? They couldn't  spell ``ptarmigan.'' That is why they call that small community that.   They are trying very hard, but very frankly, the BLM came in with  this plan. It is not working. In fact, they are spending very large  amounts of money trying to implement their reclamation concept when it  doesn't work. And I will challenge anybody to show that these miners  are not doing their best, but their proposal is trying to put them out  of business. I just think that is wrong.   If I thought they were doing some harm, I would definitely not be for  them. I have been there. I have seen it. I have watched what they are  trying to do. An agency, I think, has forgotten their role, and they  don't support mining. BLM is supposed to. And they have made it very  nearly impossible for, very frankly, a mom-and-pop operation to do so.   So I hope the gentlewoman can see her way to allowing this amendment  to this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment  No. 72 to provide additional funding for the Native American CDFI  Assistance Program.   This program supports critical economic development in Native  communities, which face significant barriers to accessing basic  financial services and capital. For example, almost all Alaska Native  villages in my State do not have banks and are not connected to the  road system.   The Native program provides financial assistance and technical  assistance awards on a competitive basis to Native CDFIs, allowing them  to effectively build wealth and further economic self-determines in  Native communities.   These mission-driven Native organizations are working to finance  businesses, create jobs, expand and improve affordable housing options,  and much more.   The Native program accounts for a small portion of the fund's overall  budget but has a significant positive impact, which includes empowering  Alaska Natives to improve their economic well-being in my home State.   Without my amendment, a cut to the Native program in FY 2019 would be  especially devastating to our Nation's impoverished and underserved  Native communities.   I urge my colleagues to support this noncontroversial bipartisan  amendment to restore funding for the Native program.   My amendment, when considered with Representative  Steven Palazzo's  CDFI amendment, would restore the program to the current enacted level  of $16 million so the Native organizations may continue growing small  businesses, create jobs, and promote vital economic development in  Native communities.   I would like to thank the Native CDFI Network and the amendment's  cosponsors, Representative Gwen Moore, Colleen Hanabusa, and Tulsi  Gabbard.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her  comments. This is a good amendment to this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
