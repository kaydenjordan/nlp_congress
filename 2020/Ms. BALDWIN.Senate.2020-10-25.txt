 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last Tuesday, in my home State of  Wisconsin, in-person early voting started. Over the past week, people  have showed up to vote in record numbers, as they have across our  entire country, because they want to make sure their voices are heard.  Why? Because they know how high the stakes are for them in this  election, an election that will determine our next President and  control of the U.S. Senate, an election that is just 1 week away.   My position on President Trump's Supreme Court nomination has been  very clear since the tragic passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  Voters across America should be allowed to cast their ballots first and  have their votes counted before this Senate votes on a lifetime  appointment to our Nation's highest Court. The people should be heard  first, but it is clear that the majority leader and a majority of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no interest in listening  to the people. That is why they are rushing and ramming President  Trump's Supreme Court nomination forward just days before the election.   This rigged and illegitimate process is wrong, and it follows a  pattern of the majority leader and Senate Republicans abusing their  power to break their own standards on Supreme Court nominations.   Back in 2016, 8 months before the election, President Obama nominated  Merrick Garland to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court after the passing  of Justice Antonin Scalia. Judge Garland is a highly experienced and  qualified judge, and I have no doubt that had he been given the  opportunity, he would have earned more than 60 votes in the U.S.  Senate. But he was never given that opportunity because the majority  leader decided to deny Judge Garland a hearing and a vote in the  Senate.   With the standards broken on the Garland nomination, the majority  leader established a new one: no Supreme Court nominations by the  Senate during an election year. Here we are in an election year.  However, Majority Leader McConnell has broken his own rule and created  yet another new one. Instead of applying the same standard that he  imposed on President Obama with the Garland nomination in March of  2016, 8 months before an election, he created a new standard now for  President Trump with his nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett made 39  days before an election. The majority leader is rushing President  Trump's nominee forward, with a Senate vote as people are voting, as we  stand 1 week--1 week--before election day.   What is the rush? My home State is a national red zone for COVID-19.  We are experiencing our worst outbreak of infections since the pandemic  began, breaking records for new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.  Right now, people want action, support, and relief from Washington.   The House passed the Heroes Act over 5 months ago. Was there a rush  for the Senate majority to take action to confront the public health  and economic crisis that has only gotten worse since then? No, this  legislation has been sitting on the majority leader's desk since May,  while businesses have closed, millions have lost their jobs, and  hundreds of thousands of Americans have died.   At the beginning of this month, the House, once again, passed an  updated version of the Heroes Act to provide local communities and  frontline healthcare workers with the support they need to stop the  spread of this  [[Page S6544]]  deadly virus. This legislation provides support to workers, families,  schools, local governments, and small businesses.   Was there a rush from the Senate majority to take action? No,  instead, the majority leader told the White House not to support this  legislation because it would divide the other side of the aisle and  they needed to focus on pushing this Supreme Court nomination forward  before the election.   What is the hurry? My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away people's  healthcare since I came to the Senate back in 2013. I remember that  vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act well. It was 2017, right here on  the Senate floor. As President Trump and Senate Republicans sought to  repeal the Affordable Care Act, Senator John McCain did something we  are not seeing from the majority now with this illegitimate Supreme  Court nomination process. Senator McCain stood by his principles and  gave a thumbs-down to repealing our Nation's healthcare law.   President Trump's response has been to try to do what the American  people will not let this Senate do. In 2015, President Trump made clear  his intentions with Supreme Court nominations when he said: ``If I win  the Presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing,  unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts, on ObamaCare.''   In May of this year he said: ``We want to terminate healthcare under  ObamaCare.''   The day after he announced his nomination of Judge Barrett, he  tweeted that the Supreme Court invalidating the Affordable Care Act  would be ``a big WIN for the USA!''   Just last week, he said he would like to ``terminate'' the Affordable  Care Act and ``we have a very good chance of doing it.''   He is right, but that is the problem. President Trump, with his  Department of Justice, has supported a Republican lawsuit to overturn  the Affordable Care Act completely. On November 10, 1 week after the  election, the Trump-backed lawsuit will come before the U.S. Supreme  Court. Judge Barrett has a record of criticizing and opposing the  previous Supreme Court decisions that have upheld the Affordable Care  Act. It is clear as day that the majority leader and Senate Republicans  are driving a vote on the President's Supreme Court nomination in order  to do what Trump wants--overturn the Affordable Care Act completely,  terminate people's healthcare, and take away protections for people  with preexisting health conditions.   Here is what is at stake if Judge Barrett does what Trump and Senate  Republicans have been trying to do for years. Over 186,000  Wisconsinites have been infected with COVID-19, which could now be  considered a preexisting health condition. These people need the  guaranteed protections that our Affordable Care Act provides, and they  cannot afford to have the Supreme Court terminate their healthcare. If  the Affordable Care Act is overturned, over 133 million Americans with  preexisting health conditions could stand to lose their guaranteed  protections or be charged more, including more than 2 million  Wisconsinites who have preexisting health conditions.    This issue is personal to me, as it is for so many others. When I was  9 years old, I got sick--really sick. I was in the hospital for 3  months. I eventually recovered. But when it came to health insurance,  it was like I had a scarlet letter. My grandparents, who had raised me,  couldn't find a policy that would cover me, not from any insurer and  not at any price, all because I was a child who had been labeled with  those terrifying words--``preexisting health condition.''   This is also personal for Chelsey from Seymour, WI, whose daughter  Zoe was born with a congenital heart defect. Right now, thanks to the  Affordable Care Act, Zoe is guaranteed access to coverage without being  denied or charged more. Chelsey wrote to me: ``I'm pleading with you as  a mother to fight for the kids in Wisconsin with pre-existing [health]  conditions that are counting on you to protect that right.''   Her fight is my fight today. No parent or grandparent should have to  lay awake at night wondering if the healthcare they have today for  themselves and their children and grandchildren will be there tomorrow.  The fact is, more children have become uninsured in every year of the  Trump administration, and striking down the Affordable Care Act would  be the final, devastating blow to children's healthcare.   If President Trump succeeds with his lawsuit and gets a ruling from  the person he is putting on the Supreme Court, Judge Barrett, an  estimated 800,000 children would lose healthcare insurance.   When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act over a decade ago, I led  the effort in the House to include a provision that now allows young  people to remain on their parents' health insurance until they turn 26.  In Wisconsin, that means over 40,000 young adults in their twenties who  have been infected with COVID-19. Many of these young people are likely  already on their parents' health insurance plan or are receiving  premium tax credits provided by the Affordable Care Act to lower costs  and make healthcare more affordable.   Recently, I heard the story of Amy from Neenah, WI. Her daughter is a  nursing student at Marquette University in Milwaukee. She is on her  mother's insurance plan, and they are worried that if the Senate shoves  this nomination forward and Judge Barrett does what President Trump  says she will do, this young nursing student and future frontline  healthcare worker will be kicked off her mother's insurance and lose  access to her healthcare.   Kirsten from Green Bay, WI, told me her story of being diagnosed with  a very serious heart defect when she was just 11 days old. By the time  she was 13 years old, she had undergone 17 angioplasties. Before the  Affordable Care Act was passed, she struggled to keep insurance  coverage, and she doesn't want to go back to the days when insurance  companies wrote their own rules and could choose to deny people  coverage, charge people more, or set annual or lifetime limits on  people's healthcare.   Kirsten, who is now 24 years old, said:         Amy Coney Barrett has made it clear that she opposes the       [Affordable Care Act]. With this nomination, the Republican       Party is actively saying that our lives do not matter. If a       decision is made on the Supreme Court nominee before the       election, the American people are taken out of the selection.    The message I have heard from Wisconsin has been clear. People want  to be able to vote before the Senate votes. People want their voices to  be heard. People want their healthcare protected, and they certainly  don't want it taken away by President Trump or his nominee to the  Supreme Court during a deadly pandemic that has taken over 1,700 lives  in my home State of Wisconsin and over 221,000 American lives.   I would remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that for the  women I have spoken about today, as well as all American women, if the  Affordable Care Act is terminated, insurance companies could once again  charge women more than men, and insurance companies could stop covering  basic services, like maternity care, cancer screenings, and  contraception. The threat this nominee poses to women's health cannot  be overstated.   The threat isn't limited to the Affordable Care Act; it extends  beyond that. President Trump took office with a promise to nominate  Justices and judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade. He has nominated  Judge Barrett, and her judicial record reveals a firm disagreement with  the Supreme Court's five decades of established constitutional  protections for women's reproductive rights.   Let's all be honest with the American people. Since day one of this  administration, a woman's constitutional right and freedom to make her  own healthcare choices, including access to birth control, has been  under assault. We know what Amy Coney Barrett's personal views are, and  I know that some of you support her for them. But let's be clear. I  don't oppose her because of her personal views. What I do oppose is the  phony game that is being played where the people pushing this  nomination forward pretend that this nominee is simply a blank slate  and will consider nothing more than words on a page in her Court  decisions concerning women's reproductive health.   Right now, in States across the country, Roe v. Wade is under attack,  and  [[Page S6545]]  millions of women are at risk of losing the freedom to make their own  healthcare decisions without interference from politicians playing  doctor. Dozens of abortion rights cases are headed toward the Supreme  Court as we speak. The stakes could not be higher for women's health  than they are right now with this nomination   We all know what Judge Barrett's judicial record is, and her public  advocacy is clear. This is a nominee who has been fundamentally hostile  towards reproductive health and rights. That is what is relevant here  because our Supreme Court plays an essential role in protecting and  upholding civil rights and civil liberties, including the  constitutional right for all women to make their own personal  healthcare decisions and to have access to safe and legal reproductive  care.   The least this nominee's Senate supporters could do is be honest with  the American people. We all know that, if given the opportunity, a  Justice Barrett would overturn Roe v. Wade. Don't pretend you don't  know how she will come down on this issue. You should at least have the  courage of your convictions and say to the people who are voting right  now in this election that you support Amy Coney Barrett's nomination  because you support overturning Roe v. Wade, too, and you know she will  help do it.   Just as I don't trust this nominee to protect people's healthcare or  women's reproductive rights, I have no faith in Judge Barrett to  respect the progress that the LGBTQ community has worked so hard to  achieve.   Unlike President Trump's nominee, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a  strong belief in equality for all, which was reflected in her life's  work and in her judicial record on LGBTQ rights issues. In June, we  again saw real progress in the Supreme Court with a landmark victory  for justice and equality when the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 that  workplace discrimination against LGBTQ people is wrong and our Nation's  civil rights laws forbid it.   But we have a lot more work to do. LGBTQ people in many States can  still be evicted from their homes or denied services simply because of  who they are or whom they love. The House passed the bipartisan  Equality Act to end this kind of discrimination well over a year ago,  but that, too, has been in the majority leader's legislative graveyard  and has not even received a vote in the Senate because he is afraid it  just might pass.   Here we are today moving forward on a Supreme Court nominee who I  believe is a real threat to LGBTQ rights--again, not because of her  personal preference to oppose marriage equality; rather, because she  has openly and publicly defended the dissenters in the Supreme Court's  landmark Obergefell case by questioning the Court's role in even  deciding that case.   Earlier this month, two of the dissenters in that case whom Judge  Barrett defended previously--Justices Thomas and Alito--came out and  attacked the Court's 2015 decision, which declared that same-sex  couples have a constitutional right to marry under the 14th Amendment  guarantee to equal protection under the law.   We just celebrated the 5-year anniversary of marriage equality  becoming the law of the land, and I have no faith in Judge Barrett to  protect this constitutional right.   President Trump wants to overturn the Affordable Care Act completely  and take away people's healthcare and protections for preexisting  health conditions in the middle of a deadly pandemic. This President  wants to overturn Roe v. Wade and have the government take away  reproductive freedoms for women. He has done nothing to move equality  and fairness forward for the LGBTQ community and has worked to turn  back the clock on hard-won progress. Judge Barrett has been nominated  and will likely be confirmed by this Senate to do what President Trump  wants. This nominee's complete and total unwillingness to show any  independence from the President makes that clear to me.   I believe it is wrong for Senate Republicans to rush this  confirmation vote before the American people have voted and our next  President and the next Senate have taken office. I oppose this  illegitimate process, and I oppose Judge Barrett's confirmation for a  lifetime appointment to our highest Court because I do not have faith  in her being a fair and independent Supreme Court Justice for the  American people.   With that, I yield the floor.
