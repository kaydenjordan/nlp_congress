 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res.  41, a resolution rejecting white nationalism and white supremacy.   As a lifelong resident of southwestern Pennsylvania, I was devastated  by the shooting that killed 11 Jewish worshippers and wounded six  others at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on  October 27, 2018. This despicable act of domestic terrorism reminded us  that evil is alive in this world and must be confronted in a spirit of  courage.   The day after this cowardly act of violence, I stood in solidarity  with Americans of all religions, all races, and all ethnicities at a  vigil honoring the victims of this heinous crime. There is no place for  this kind of thinking in our country.   When the rights of any community are under attack, all of our rights  are under attack. We must come together as a nation to stand up against  hatred, white nationalism, and bigotry in our country.   I commend the leadership of my party for their strong response to any  comments that divide our country, and I thank my colleague from South  Carolina for introducing this important resolution.
