 Mr. Speaker, like a character out of Looney Tunes,  the incorrigible little Kim of North Korea and his minions can't stop  rattling their sabers.   New satellite images show a prolonged and heightened level of  activity at North Korea's underground nuclear site. Since coming into  power, little Kim has continually defied U.N. sanctions and increased  testing of missiles and nuclear weapons.   Just this last weekend, North Korea illegally launched yet another  menacing ballistic missile. North Korea plans to develop submarines  from which to launch these missiles towards the United States.   Despite little Kim's Wile E. Coyote antics, the United States cannot  underestimate the war-prone lunacy of Kim Jong-un. Even our old Deputy  Secretary of State recently warned that little Kim's weapon  capabilities have shown improvement within the past year, resulting in  ``unprecedented level of activity.''   The last administration's appeasement policy of North Korea and its  strategic patience has failed. The  [[Page H4216]]  United States must cripple North Korea's regime with multiple  sanctions. We must convince China that it is in their interest to rein  in their puppet state of North Korea, and quickly deploy the new THAAD  missile systems throughout the region and in Asia.   And that is just the way it is, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
