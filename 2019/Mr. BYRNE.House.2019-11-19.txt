 Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I must rise again because,  like so many times before, the goalposts for impeaching President Trump  have moved. At this rate, Nancy Pelosi must be any field goal kicker's  worst nightmare.   Since literally day one, it has been abundantly clear that the far- left members of a so-called squad have been moving this Democratic  majority closer to impeaching the President. They don't care why or  how. They don't care what evidence, real or imagined, is used. They  care only about the end result: impeaching President Trump so that he  will not win reelection.   As this radical faction gains dominance in the Democratic Party,  Speaker Pelosi has tried every justification in the book to impeach  this President.   We were told for years that we would get to impeachment from the  Mueller report. They said just wait, wait till the report. It is going  to show Russian collusion.   Well, 2 years and millions of dollars down the drain, Mueller showed  no collusion.                                time  1015    The Democrat narrative quickly turned towards ``obstruction of  justice,'' but that, too, fell flat.   But then, Mr. Speaker, the majority got a new gift, the  whistleblower. Never mind he had no firsthand knowledge of what he blew  the whistle on; never mind he is a partisan Democrat; never mind he  worked with Adam Schiff on his new allegations against President Trump.   It was campaign finance violations. Well, that didn't work. So then  it was quid pro quo. For weeks, that is all the majority talked about.   Not anymore. Apparently, Mr. Speaker, some highly paid political  consultants warned Speaker Pelosi that quid pro quo did not resonate  with the American people. So now it seems they have moved on to another  version of impeachment that tested best in their focus groups, the  nefarious-sounding ``bribery.'' It is bribery. That is what we will  impeach President Trump on.   Well, Mr. Speaker, I think my friends on the other side need to dust  off their law books because, unfortunately for their latest impeachment  fantasy, bribery isn't just some word. It is a real crime with a real  definition, and it is one this majority cannot prove.   You see, bribery occurs when an individual ``corruptly'' links  receiving something of value in exchange for an official government  action.   I say to the majority, show me how asking Ukraine to look into the  2016 election and into the sketchy dealings of Hunter Biden is acting  corruptly. Because I will tell you what: I will show you evidence that  Ukrainian officials were working to boost Secretary Clinton, and I will  show you evidence that the Obama administration itself was concerned  about Hunter Biden's deals.   I think most Americans will say maybe the President of the United  States should be looking into these things. I think they will say we  want the President looking into possible corruption in our government  and interference in our elections.   More importantly, I say to the majority, show me how President Trump  linked aid to these investigations.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump's phone call with Ukraine's President  Zelensky--you know, the one that the whistleblower blew the whistle  on--it is on the internet. Everyone can read it, and I hope that they  will, because nowhere in that call did President Trump ever link any  aid to Ukraine in exchange for anything. The President did not one  time--not one time--even mention any kind of hold on the aid, not once.   This is not bribery. This is not impeachable conduct. Yet here we are  trying to remove the President of the United States, the leader of this  country, the man chosen by the voters, over these newest allegations.   Mr. Speaker, the American people see past this charade. They know  that this is a partisan political scheme. And at this point, I think  most people who are paying attention, those who haven't tuned out, know  this is just the latest effort by Democrats to throw something at the  wall and see it if sticks.   President Trump has committed no ``bribery, treason, or high crimes  and misdemeanors'' the only offenses that the Constitution says warrant  impeachment.   I ask the majority, when do we stop and get back to the business of  the American people?                            ____________________
