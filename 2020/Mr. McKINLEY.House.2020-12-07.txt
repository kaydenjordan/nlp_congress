 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bill Raney as he  retires from the West Virginia Coal Association.   Nearly 40 years ago, in the West Virginia Legislature, Bill and I  began working together, advocating on behalf of the coal industry and  the families who depend on it. Today, we continue to work together,  fighting for those same families, but now with a national perspective.   He has led West Virginia through the best and the worst of times for  coal. Bill is an icon in the industry, and his legacy is filled with  remarkable accomplishments. He is a colonel in the West Virginia  Reserves, has chaired many statewide organizations, and has been  nationally recognized for his advocacy of coal.   Bill Raney exemplifies the true Mountaineer spirit, serving others to  make West Virginia a better place.   It has been an honor to work with Bill, and I wish him and his wife,  Pam, a well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
