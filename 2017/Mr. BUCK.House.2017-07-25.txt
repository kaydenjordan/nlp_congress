 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 468 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 468         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 111) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule       submitted by Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection relating       to ``Arbitration Agreements''. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint       resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Financial Services; and       (2) one motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying resolution.   Congressional Review Act resolutions must follow a prescribed form  according to law. This rule provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 111  in keeping with that form.  [[Page H6226]]    Madam Speaker, we are here today to prevent Federal overreach by the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, also known as the CFPB. According  to the D.C. Circuit Court, this unaccountable government agency has  more unilateral authority than any single commissioner or board member  in any other independent agency in the United States Government.   On July 10, 2017, the CFPB exercised that vast authority by issuing a  776-page final rule that restricts the ability of consumers to enter  into arbitration agreements. The CFPB's misguided rule effectively  eliminates arbitration clauses, instead forcing consumers into  significantly more burdensome court proceedings. Eliminating this  overbearing rule is a big win for consumers.   Arbitration is an alternative to the judicial system, and it often  results in a better outcome for consumers. According to the CFPB's own  study, arbitration can be up to 12 times faster than litigation. This  study also found that a class action lawsuit's average payout was just  $32 per person, not even close to the $5,389 awarded on average from  arbitration.   Moreover, it costs less for consumers to file an arbitration  complaint than it does to file a new complaint in Federal court, making  the arbitration system more accessible to all Americans.   Arbitration allows parties to use an independent mediator, instead of  hiring expensive lawyers, to settle a dispute. While the rule  promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a bad deal  for consumers, it is a huge win for trial lawyers, who make an average  of $1 million per case.   The legislation being considered today would eliminate the CFPB's  prohibition on an individual's right to enter into contracts that  include arbitration agreements.   The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to eliminate a rule from  the executive branch, and prevents a substantially similar rule from  being proposed in its place.   Checks and balances between the three branches of government are the  cornerstone of our Constitution. The Congressional Review Act allows  Congress to exercise our Article I authority and stop executive  overreach that was never intended by the original legislation.   The Congressional Review Act is a powerful tool because it only  requires 51 votes to pass in the Senate. To date, Congress has passed  14 CRAs that have been signed by the President. One by one, we have  eliminated Obama administration rules that harm Americans and small  businesses across this country.   Despite the work we have ahead, these CRAs are important to bringing  regulatory relief to millions of Americans. President Trump campaigned  on a promise to end government overregulation that hurts Americans and  small businesses. He turned those words into action by signing an  executive order that requires two regulations be eliminated for every  new regulation that is proposed.   President Trump has exceeded those expectations in his first 6  months. For every new proposed rule, he has eliminated 16 regulations.   Unfortunately, he has limited tools to rein in the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, because it was designed to be unaccountable under  Dodd-Frank. This is an agency that continues to be run by an unchecked  Director. The structure of the bureau has even been ruled  unconstitutional by the judicial branch.   A few weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed legislation to  restructure the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, restoring  congressional oversight duties and moving the agency back under the  regular legislative appropriations process. I hope the Senate will  consider this bill and bring accountability to the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and the underlying  bill, and eliminate the bad antiarbitration rule issued by the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the author of this resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the Financial Institutions  and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been a continuous  example of Federal overreach. Once again, bureaucrats in Washington  have created a rule that will hurt consumers and make their lives more  difficult.   The last 8 years of overregulation have crippled our economy. Today,  we have a chance to end this antiarbitration rule and empower consumers  with an alternative to spending years in a courtroom.   We can't let concerns about the trial lawyer lobby impact the way we  treat consumers. Trial lawyers love this rule enacted by the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau because they will be the biggest  beneficiaries. They will walk home with the big winnings, while the  individuals who have been harmed walk away with little.    Arbitration allows harmed individuals to receive payouts on the  merits of their case without enriching the pockets of trial lawyers at  the same time. This legislation is for consumers. It is for the average  American who relies on our financial system every day.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Sessions and Chairman Hensarling for  bringing this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues now to vote  ``yes'' on the resolution, and then to vote ``yes'' on the underlying  bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 468 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2933) to promote effective registered apprenticeships, for       skills, credentials, and employment, and for other purposes.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and       the Workforce. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2933.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not  [[Page H6232]]       merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the       previous question is a vote against the Republican majority       agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer       an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should       be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
