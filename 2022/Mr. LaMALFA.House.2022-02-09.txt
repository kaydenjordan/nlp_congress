 Mr. Speaker, California's high-speed rail has issued a  new draft business plan for the year 2022 that was released yesterday.  It shows now a new price tag of $105 billion, which is an increase of  $5 billion over the last plan we just received not too long ago.   Now, the original price that voters agreed to back in 2008 when it  was placed on the ballot in front of them was a $33 billion, not $105  billion, plan.   Notably, it will now install a second rail between the towns of  Merced and Bakersfield. Two tracks; two tracks that won't actually  travel at high speeds because they can't get up to speed in that amount  of distance. Two tracks that will be calling, I guess, ghost passengers  for people that aren't going to be using this project anyway between  Bakersfield and Merced.   Every transit agency in the country ought to be looking at this plan  to see how it works. We need to be building water storage; we need to  be spending money on forestry, because our forests burn every year,  instead of this boondoggle, which continues to be a rat hole of good  money for a project that isn't helping anybody.                            ____________________
