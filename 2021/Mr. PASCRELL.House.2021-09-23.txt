 Mr. Speaker, I support Israel's right to defend  herself. I have always voted for defensive technology, which we should  invest in.   The Congress first supported Iron Dome funding a decade ago after a  request made by President Obama.   In 2014 I visited Israel. I saw with my own eyes how the Iron Dome  stopped rockets and saved lives.   This year we saw the horrific launching of rockets from Gaza toward  Israeli streets. It is never okay to target civilians.   While the deescalation prevailed, there was a tragic loss of life in  Israel and Gaza. Extremism and vicious rhetoric breed instability.   This year the U.S. rightly provided millions in humanitarian  assistance to the Palestinian people. Thanks to the bill before us,  Congress is reaffirming our commitment to Israel's right to defend  itself.   Iron Dome technology keeps people safe, and it saves lives.
