 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work  of Mrs. Sallie Baldwin Howard, a great North Carolinian, a nationally  recognized academic, and a dear family friend.   At 102 years old, Mrs. Howard transitioned to her heavenly home on  Tuesday, September 25, 2018. Our community in Wilson, North Carolina,  has lost a giant and a friend.   Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Sallie Baldwin Howard was born on March 23, 1916,  right in the midst of World War I, in Wilson, North Carolina, to  Narcissus and Marcellus Sims. Even though I did not know Mr. Sims, I  certainly knew Ms. Narcissus Sims Townsend, who lived directly across  the street from me as a child.   Though she was raised in the Jim Crow South as the daughter of  sharecroppers, Mrs. Howard graduated as valedictorian from Wilson  Colored High School, later renamed Charles H. Darden High School, in  1938, the same school that I graduated from in 1965.   She attended Kittrell Junior College in Kittrell, North Carolina,  before earning both a bachelor's and a master's degree in education  from Hunter College in New York City. She also did extensive study at  the New School of Social Research, as well as Columbia University.   Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Howard taught for nearly 30 years as a first-grade  teacher in New York City. While there, she worked in the New York City  American Negro Theater, which helped launch the careers of the likes of  Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, and Esther  Rolle.   There, she honed her acting and directing and writing talents,  finding her voice through her art. Mrs. Howard's off-Broadway play,  ``The Passing of a Dinosaur,'' is still performed today in local  schools.   Upon her retirement, Mrs. Howard returned to her beloved Wilson,  North Carolina, where she became an active member of St. John African  Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, which is a church that just celebrated  its 150th anniversary this past weekend, and I had an opportunity to  speak for that program. She led the Christian education department and  the church honor roll to encourage academic excellence among the youth  in her community.   Along with many other projects, Mrs. Howard founded the youth  enrichment program with my good friend, Dr. JoAnne Woodard, in 1989,  focusing the program on lasting scholarship, a commitment to the  cultural heritage of African Americans, and promoting the arts.   Mrs. Howard's tireless work to enrich her community inspired Dr.  JoAnne Woodard to create the Sallie B. Howard School for the Arts and  Education in Wilson, naming the school in Mrs. Howard's honor.   Established in 1997, the Sallie B. Howard School for the Arts and  Education is one of the first public charter schools in the State of  North Carolina, and the only charter school to open in Wilson County  after legislation passed in 1997 to approve charter schools in our  State. The school, along with the youth enrichment program, has been an  invaluable asset to our community.   Mr. Speaker, the school's mission is to provide every child,  privileged or underprivileged, the kind of education that nutures  students' gifts, talents, and potential to become more than they ever  thought they could be. At Sallie B. Howard School, they prepare  students for careers in the performing arts, science, and humanities.  They are a school to behold.   Established as an academic and as a writer, Mr. Speaker, and as a  playwright, avid traveler, and educator, Mrs. Howard used her vast  array of talents and expertise to leave a lasting impact on thousands  in our communities.   Two years ago, we had the awesome opportunity to celebrate Mrs.  Sallie B. Howard's 100th birthday, and this picture that I have with me  today depicts that moment as I escorted her into the auditorium of the  school. We will have very fond memories of that day when she reached  100 years old.  [[Page H9094]]    Finally, beyond her academic contributions, what is more illuminating  of Mrs. Howard's character was the way she connected with her students  and her friends. She took a personal interest in the scholarship and  mentorship of the youth that went far beyond success in the classroom.   This is, indeed, a solemn occasion, but it is also an occasion to  celebrate. At 102 years old, Mrs. Sallie B. Howard fought the good  fight, served her community, and was a friend and mentor to many.   I am thankful to God that she was able to touch so many lives. May  she rest in peace. She now belongs to the ages.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the  extraordinary life, work, and legacy of Sallie Baldwin Howard.                            ____________________
