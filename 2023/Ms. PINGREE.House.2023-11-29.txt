 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend, Mr. Grijalva, for yielding  me the time.   Mr. Chair, this bill does nothing to address the immigration crisis  facing our Nation. It does not help New York City, and it doesn't help  the asylum seekers.   I represent Portland, Maine, which, like New York, has welcomed an  influx of asylum seekers this year. Portland has also struggled to find  sufficient housing for our new neighbors.   If Republicans are serious about getting asylum seekers out of  shelters, then we should be debating my amendment to replace this  misguided bill with my plan to get asylum seekers to work faster.  Currently, asylum seekers must wait at least 6 months before they are  eligible to receive work authorization. The bipartisan Asylum Seeker  Work Authorization Act would cut this waiting time to 30 days, allowing  asylum seekers to get to work faster and no longer rely on social  safety net programs to survive.   I have spoken to countless asylum seekers who are anxious to get to  work and start supporting themselves and their families and contribute  to their communities. We just need to get out of their way.   I have also heard from employers from across the country who would  jump at the chance to hire asylum seekers. At present, there are 9.5  million job openings in the United States and only 6.5 million  unemployed workers. That leaves a gap of 3 million job openings that  businesses need asylum seekers to fill. That is why business groups  like the United States Chamber of Commerce have endorsed my bill.    My commonsense proposal would make no changes to the asylum process.  It would simply reduce the amount of time that asylum seekers are  barred from filling critical job openings.   As President Reagan once said, immigrants are one of the most  important sources of America's greatness.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to join me in  supporting this commonsense, bipartisan solution.
