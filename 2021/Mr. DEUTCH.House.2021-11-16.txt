 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary  trailblazer, philanthropist, and public servant in south Florida, Mrs.  Norma Fink, on her 100th birthday.   Born Norma Mager, in the Bronx, New York, on November 16, 1921, Norma  has spent a century giving back to those around her. In 1942, Norma  graduated from New York University with a bachelor's degree in  economics and a minor in geology, the only woman to graduate with that  honor at the time.   Shortly after, she put her degree to work by joining the Department  of War to assist with the military supply chain while her husband,  Robert Fink, served in our Nation's Armed Forces during World War II.   After the war, Norma worked in her father's bakery, Mager and Throne  Bread Bakery. During this time, she became enamored with jazz music and  made friends with many local musicians who were involved with the civil  rights movement. Inspired by their work, Norma began contributing the  money she made to support civil rights initiatives in the South. This  became an ongoing passion of hers.    After moving to Plantation, Florida, in 1972, Norma continued her  legacy of supporting the enrichment of the community by joining the  city's Parks and Recreation Department, where she still works at the  age of 100.   Additionally, she began spending her time and money supporting local  charities. Following the loss of her daughter, Marian, to breast cancer  in 2002, Norma dedicated herself to helping others suffering from  cancer.   Norma's spirit of persistence, generosity, and service to her  community is an inspiration to all of us in south Florida. It is an  inspiration to generations of Americans.   To honor her legacy, the city of Plantation, her home for nearly half  a century, has designated Norma Fink Day in honor of the oldest and  longest part-time employee in that city's history.   I join the entire south Florida community in wishing Norma Fink a  happy 100th birthday surrounded by her loved ones. I thank her for her  dedication to bettering the lives of everyone in south Florida.              Making History With Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the historic day  yesterday in this Nation's history.   The legislation that the President signed into law was overwhelmingly  bipartisan in the Senate, and it was overwhelmingly supported by the  American people. Why? Because it is the largest dedicated bridge  investment since the construction of the Interstate Highway System. It  is the largest investment in public transit and passenger rail since  the creation of Amtrak.   It expands broadband to every corner of our country so that every  American has access to reliable, high-speed internet.   It secures clean water, making the largest investment in clean  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in American history.   This is what we have been clamoring for, in a bipartisan way, as long  as I have been serving in this Congress. Yesterday, President Biden  delivered. He did it with the bipartisan support of the Senate and the  overwhelming support of the American people.   Unfortunately, in this Chamber, my colleagues on the other side view  any sort of bipartisan effort like that as too difficult to support,  too difficult to stand with the Republicans and Democrats in the  Senate, too difficult to stand with Democrats here, and too difficult,  apparently, to stand with the America people in moving forward with a  massive infrastructure plan that will help strengthen every community  across our country.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud that this House joined with the Senate in  sending this legislation to President Biden.  [[Page H6272]]  Yesterday, as I said, was a historic day as President Biden signed the  infrastructure bill into law and as we move forward to the Build Back  Better Act.   Again, I note for my colleagues here, this too is so popular  throughout America because everyone understands that if we invest in  the American people, if we take the kind of action that is necessary to  lower healthcare costs and childcare costs, provide universal pre-K,  and make investments to combat climate change that we will be making  America more competitive on the global stage, something that my  colleagues in this Chamber often talk about.   I hope that they will recognize the opportunity to do exactly that in  passing the Build Back Better Act when we vote on it this week.                            ____________________
