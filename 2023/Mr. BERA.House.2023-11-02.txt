 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor and remember Elwood  ``Bud'' John Lee. Bud was born November 6, 1946, in Caledonia,  Minnesota. A 10-pound baby, Bud was a gentle giant from the beginning.   He graduated from college in December 1965 and then enlisted and  served in Vietnam. After discharge, Bud settled in California where he  served my State in many ways, eventually as president of the California  Association of Catholic Hospitals. In retirement, he continued his  lifetime of service.   We lost Bud on September 4, 2023, but we will always have his  optimistic spirit.   Here is to Bud. In his words, today is a good day to have a good day.  Be well.                            ____________________
