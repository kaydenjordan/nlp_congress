 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that, and I appreciate the  gentleman from Georgia's hospitality in yielding the floor to me at  this time.   Mr. Speaker, indeed, I am privileged to represent the 19th  Congressional District of New York State. This encompasses a wide area  of the mid-Hudson Valley and the Catskill region. The district touches  Vermont in the northeast corner and Pennsylvania in the southeast  corner. We go out to Cooperstown, and we have great local locations  like Woodstock. Many people are familiar with Woodstock, where the  concert was supposed to be back in the late 1960s, but also where the  concert occurred in Bethel, New York, in Sullivan County. The district  encompasses all or part of 11 counties.   The gentleman from Georgia referenced the fact that I have resided  for the last 30, almost 34, years in Kinderhook, New York, the hometown  of Martin Van Buren, our eighth President. Our district also has within  it the town of Hyde Park in Dutchess County, which is the home of a  President who was extraordinarily well-known and recognized for his  great contributions to our country, Franklin D. Roosevelt. I encourage  people to come visit Hyde Park and the Roosevelt home and mansion, and  also Kinderhook.   I would be remiss if I did not also mention that the 19th District  has the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, where I know a  number of Members will be coming up later this year to play a game of  baseball in a charitable fundraising event.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Collins had made reference to the economic  condition. The economic condition in upstate New York is extremely  difficult. Of the 11 counties in my district, for instance, all 11 have  lost population in the last 5 years. What has happened is that people  are leaving because of high local taxes and burdensome rules. These  come not just from Albany, but also from Washington. This is one of the  things that I think the people sent me here to Congress to work on.   I ran on a platform of economic growth. We must get our economy  moving, and we must get it moving fast and growing at rates that are  not in the anemic 1.5 to 1.8 percent level, but up to 3, 3.5, and 4  percent if we are going to produce enough wealth and opportunity for  our children and grandchildren. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow  this generation to leave to the next generation a country that is  immeasurably poorer and less well off than the country that we were  given by our parents and grandparents.   I am privileged to serve on three committees here in Congress: the  Budget Committee; the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee,  where I am honored to serve as the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on  Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials; and also the Committee  on Agriculture. All three of these committees are going to be vitally  significant in terms of my tenure here in these 2 years of Congress,  but also for the people of our district.   Agriculture, we have a robust and growing agricultural economy. It is  dairy, where a lot of dairy farmers are struggling with the low price  of milk, but also fruits and vegetables. We have got a remarkable  number of new producers--yogurt producers, cheese producers, and beef  and pork producers--because we live only 125 to 150 miles away from the  city of New York and the tremendous metropolitan area and the  tremendous market that that entails.   On the Agriculture Committee, I will be fighting hard to protect the  interests of our dairy community and small farmers and to make sure  that we encourage our young people to go into agriculture. I am pleased  to soon support a measure which will encourage young people to go into  agriculture.   On the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I mentioned  the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee. Our  district is blessed to have the beautiful Hudson Valley. The Hudson  Valley--the Empire State corridor of Amtrak--is one of the busiest in  the Nation. It is also one of the profit centers for Amtrak. Many, many  people ride the train between Albany and New York City on a daily  basis, in fact. It is vitally important to our commerce and to our  business interests in our district.   We also have a number of freight rail facilities. I will be working  closely with folks out in Otsego County and Oneonta for the project  that they are looking at for their rail facility in that community.   Lastly, as I mentioned, I serve on the Budget Committee. Just today,  we heard a report from the Congressional Budget Office. The chief of  the CBO came before us. He indicated that today we have almost $20  trillion of national debt.                                time  1630    That is just the on-the-books government national debt. He also said  to us that within 10 years we are going to be facing another $10  trillion on top of  [[Page H920]]  that. And $30 trillion, my colleagues, is not sustainable. It is, in  essence, generational theft. It is saying we would spend today our  children's and grandchildren's inheritance and that we are forcing, by  borrowing way beyond our means, our children and grandchildren in the  future to pay for our spending today.   So this, indeed, is a crisis point. It is a crisis point for our  country. It is a crisis point for every man, woman, and child in our  Nation.   In fact, if you look at the data, right now our national debt is the  equivalent of about $60,000 for every man, woman, and child in America.  We have to get this under control. The way to get it under control is  we have to deal with growth. We have got to get economic growth. Smart  tax and regulatory changes can help us spur the private sector economy  to grow this economy, to create more opportunity, to create more wealth  and jobs for our families all across the Nation, but particularly, from  my vantage point, in upstate New York.   But we also need to take a hard look at reforming entitlement  programs. There is precedent for doing this. President Ronald Reagan,  Tip O'Neill, the great former Senator from New York State Daniel  Patrick Moynihan, and others came together in the early eighties and  fixed the Social Security financing problem for over 40 years. Well,  the timeline for fixing that problem is running out.   I encourage people at home and citizens all across this country, pull  out your Social Security earnings statement. Pull out that statement  that the Social Security Administration sends to you each year. If you  look at it closely, it will say that, in 2034, just a mere 17 or 18  years from now, Social Security can only pay approximately 75 or 76  percent of the promised benefits.   We have it in our capacity to fix this problem to assure that all the  seniors are taken care of and that those close and near retirement will  not be affected. But we also have to reform the system so that our  children and grandchildren have the prospect of something there for  them in the future. We cannot, again, be the generation to leave our  kids and our grandchildren holding the bag with a country less wealthy,  with less opportunity than the country that our parents and  grandparents gave to us.   So I am really pleased to have this opportunity to come before the  House today. I am very happy that Mr. Collins has, with his wisdom and  experience here in the House, afforded us this opportunity to come here  and describe what is going on in our district, why we came here, what  we want to do, and what we hope to accomplish over the next 2 years.    Well, I look forward to working with the gentleman from  Georgia, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to try to fix what is wrong with our country  today, to improve on what we already have, and to create a sustainable  future for all Americans. This is why I ran, and that is why I am here.   I thank the gentleman from Georgia for the opportunity to come before  the House to speak with him today.
