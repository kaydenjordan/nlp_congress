Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the continuing resolution,  H.R. 6363.   Before my discussion of the CR, I want to explain our process. At the  beginning of Congress, House Republicans said they would change how  Washington works. Today, we have sent seven appropriations bills  totaling 75 percent of government funding. The Senate passed just three  of its bills.   We still have a lot more work to do to get full-year bills enacted  into law. That is why I support the Speaker's reasonable plan to  continue government funding into early next year. It buys us time to  agree on a top-line funding level and negotiate final bills with the  Senate.   More importantly, this plan will allow us to avoid harmful government  shutdowns during the holidays, prevent a last-minute omnibus, and allow  us to discuss supplemental funding separately from full-year spending.   A continuing resolution is not ideal, but it is needed at this time.  I thank the Speaker for choosing this very practical plan while we work  out our political differences.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this CR, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert), who is the chairman of the Defense  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of Commerce, Justice, Science, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), the chairman of the Energy and Water  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Joyce), the chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Harris), the chairman of Agriculture Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
