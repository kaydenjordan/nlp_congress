 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 366, the DHS Stop Asset and Vehicle Excess  Act.   H.R. 366 seeks to improve the Department of Homeland Security's  management, acquisition, and oversight of its fleet of roughly 53,000  vehicles. H.R. 366 requires the Under Secretary for Management to  provide departmental components with a standardized vehicle allocation  methodology for components to utilize to develop fleet management  plans.   This legislation was informed by oversight that was conducted by the  Department's inspector general. The inspector general found that, in  2014 and 2015, the DHS did not adequately manage or have the  enforcement authority over components to ensure that the composition of  its motor vehicle fleet was right sized. This lack of effective  management led to the overuse of sports utility vehicles, unnecessary  discretionary equipment packages, and overpayments to the GSA.   Further, the Committee on Homeland Security received testimony from  the Director of the Federal Protective Service that roughly half of the  1,100 vehicles in FPS' fleet were underutilized or had fewer than  12,000 miles. H.R. 366 grants authority to the DHS headquarters over  components with respect to managing vehicle fleets.   Specifically, under H.R. 366, the DHS is directed to establish  requirements for components to more rigorously evaluate their fleets on  an ongoing basis. Additionally, this bill directs the DHS to identify  alternative methods for managing component fleets, such as a shared  motor pool. The DHS has the second largest civilian vehicle fleet in  the Federal Government at an operating cost of about $462 million.   There is a critical linkage between the Department's operational  effectiveness in national security missions and the effective  management of the resources and requirements by the DHS leadership. As  such, enhancing oversight and management should help the Department  more effectively spend limited taxpayer dollars on what the Department  actually needs to carry out its mission.   H.R. 366 seeks to improve the management of DHS' vehicle fleet by  strengthening the oversight and management of the Department's fleet by  the Under Secretary for Management. It is also worth noting that H.R.  366 includes language that I authored to ensure that the inspector  general's oversight of the DHS' management of its vehicle fleet  continues.   I commend the OIG for its robust and ongoing oversight of the  Department's vehicle fleet. I also commend my colleague on the Homeland  Security Committee, Mr. Perry, for introducing this legislation and  working in a bipartisan fashion to advance it.   I urge the passage of H.R. 366.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 347, the DHS Acquisition Documentation  Integrity Act of 2017.   I reintroduced H.R. 347, a measure that the House unanimously  approved on February 23, 2016, to ensure that the progress that the  Department of Homeland Security has made with respect to how it manages  acquisitions continues.   H.R. 347 requires complete, accurate, timely, and valid documentation  to be maintained for each of the Department's major acquisition  programs, which is defined as one with a life cycle cost estimate of  $300 million or more. The required documentation includes information  regarding operational requirements, a complete life cycle cost  estimate, a cost-benefit analysis, and a schedule.   Under this legislation, the DHS component heads would also be  required to submit certain documentation to the DHS Secretary for  inclusion in an annual status report on the Department's acquisitions.  While there have been improvements to acquisitions management under  former Secretary Jeh Johnson, the Department has struggled when it  comes to delivering a specific program on time and at an established  cost.   Most of the DHS' major acquisition programs continue to cost more  than expected, take longer to deploy than planned, or deliver less  capability than promised. For example, the DHS' efforts to deliver a  Department-wide human resources IT system--HR-IT--have spanned almost  14 years and have cost millions of dollars with little to show for it.  As can be seen with the case of HR-IT, anything less than up-to-date  acquisition documentation increases the odds of cost and schedule  overruns, risks delayed delivery of critical capabilities, and depletes  resources needed to address future requirements.   As such, H.R. 347 codifies ``best practices'' already embodied in the  DHS' acquisition policy and necessary for the success of the DHS'  mission. H.R. 347 requires the DHS Secretary, through the Under  Secretary for Management, to require components to maintain specific  types of acquisition documentation.   Representatives McCaul and Thompson, the chairman and ranking member  of our committee, and Representative Perry, the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, cosponsored this  legislation, which reflects a strong commitment to bolstering the  effectiveness of the DHS' acquisition programs in a bipartisan fashion.   I urge the passage of H.R. 347, a bill that will help ensure that the  DHS is a good steward of taxpayer dollars and can provide the DHS'  operators in the field with the tools they need to protect the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1545
