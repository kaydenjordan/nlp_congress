 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the small businesses and  nonprofits that are experiencing tremendous impacts from the  coronavirus right now.   I've talked to dozens of small business owners, some of whom have  taken out second mortgages to keep their businesses afloat and their  employees paid.   I've talked with many nonprofits in the Second District, all of whom  are feeling overextended but tirelessly showing up everyday to meet the  needs of their communities.   It's clear that small businesses are the economic engine in suburbs,  rural towns and cities and nonprofits keep our neighborhoods strong.  That's why I pushed for no interest, forgivable loans to get back to  our districts as fast as possible. I'm glad to see these loans included  in the CARES Act.   I believe supporting our local economic engines is something we can  all agree on. I look forward to seeing this swiftly become law and get  these resources to hard working Minnesotans.    Mr. Speaker, in Minnesota and across the country, schools  are closing and distance learning is being implemented. I led an effort  with my colleagues Rep. Pete Stauber from Northern Minnesota and Rep.  Jared Huffman from California to make sure our schools have the  additional IDEA funding to support all their students, including those  with special needs during this exceptionally difficult time.   I'm proud that the CARES Act includes $30 Billion to support our  students and educators--and that $13 Billion of this is available to  school districts and schools to make sure that students who have IEPs  get high quality education they would in school, in their homes.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting our teachers,  paraprofessionals, and school administrators who are working tirelessly  to continue to educate all students in our communities through equal  access to quality education.
