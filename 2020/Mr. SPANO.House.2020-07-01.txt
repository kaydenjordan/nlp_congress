 Mr. Speaker, the overwhelming majority of constituents in  my district are eager to get back to work, and I believe it is  Congress' duty, our duty, to ensure that our citizens have the  necessary resources to reopen in a safe and responsible way. That is  why I am proud to have introduced two bills that focus on this very  need.   The SAFE at Work Act would create a tax credit for businesses that  allow their employees to work from home. This not only protects  employees and employers against the spread of COVID-19 but also  encourages employers to create telework opportunities for those most  susceptible to the virus.   I also introduced the KEEP Act, which supports the President's push  for a 3-month payroll tax holiday. This initiative would allow millions  of Americans to keep more of the money that they already earn, thus  providing critical capital to weather this crisis without involving  Federal bureaucracy.   No government program, no matter how generous, can replace a  functioning economy. These measures would support hardworking  Americans' efforts to get our economy back on track, so I urge their  immediate adoption.                    Highlighting Border Wall Effectiveness     Mr. Speaker, I rise to lend my voice to the fight to  protect our Nation by securing its borders.   Since arriving in Congress, I have stood by the President and his  efforts to protect our children from traffickers, dealers, terrorists,  and other criminal elements by building a wall.   For decades, our porous borders have threatened our national  security, and it wasn't until President Trump took office that our  government took this threat seriously.   Just how effective has the wall been?   It is a fact that nearly 1 million people were stopped at the U.S.- Mexico border in 2019, but in the last 12 months, illegal immigration  has been down 84 percent and illegal crossings from Central America are  down 97 percent.   It is a fact that President Trump has deported over 6,000 MS-13 gang  members.   And it is a fact that this barrier between the countries is helping  stop the flow of illicit drugs. Nearly 450,000 pounds have been seized  this year alone.   For far too long, too many have ignored the facts, but I haven't, and  I will continue doing everything I can do to keep Florida 15 residents  and its businesses safe.                        Honoring Sergeant Andrew Bosko     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Andrew Bosko, a  Lakeland, Florida, World War II veteran who is 98 years young.   Andy was born in Ohio, raised in Pennsylvania, and one of 13 children  of immigrant parents from Austria and Czechoslovakia.   He entered the Army Air Corps in 1943, assigned to the VII Fighter  Command in Hawaii. In 1945, the command was reassigned to Iwo Jima,  which had been seized by Marine units, to provide emergency landing  fields supporting bombing operations against Japan.   Meanwhile, his wife and true love, Sophia, was supporting the war as  a Rosie the Riveter. Yet, they still found time to write to each other  each day.   Following the war, Andy worked as a machinist in New York and later  launched some of Lakeland's favorite restaurants.   Andy, you, together with your bride of 74 years, represent the  greatest of our Greatest Generation. You experienced economic and  social turmoil and a World War, and then you rebuilt our Nation into  the greatest on Earth.   It is our honor to serve you, as you, for so many years, have served  us.                 Saluting Ella Erickson, Veteran of the Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the inspiring story of  a World War II veteran from Lakeland, Florida.   At 100 years young, Ella Erickson is a unique personification of what  heroism is about.   Raised in Wisconsin, she joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1943.  Following basic training, she reported to Marine Corps Headquarters  here in Washington, and for the next 2 years, Staff Sergeant Erickson  maintained the records of Marine prisoners of war.   Discharged at the end of the war, Ella married and began her family  and career.   While holding demanding jobs at Wheaton College and as a nurse caring  for the ailing, she also found time to be a supportive wife to  international evangelist Victor Erickson and raise four children, two  of whom went on to serve in the U.S. Air Force.   She has been a hero to the sick and to our Nation and an even greater  one to her family. She epitomizes what heroism is all about,  sacrificial service.   Thank you, Ella. Thank you for serving us and showing us how to live  well.   On behalf of Florida 15, I salute you.                            ____________________
