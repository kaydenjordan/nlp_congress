 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from  Georgia and his remarks a minute ago. In fact, they sounded very  familiar. I think I heard them maybe 20 days ago, because this is  really nothing more than just theater today. If we are in a theater,  this is nothing more than a rerun.   We have been through this exercise. So, for those in the gallery and  watching, you have probably seen this before because it was on January  3 that we took up a bill much like this. We were told then, Mr.  Speaker, that: If you pass this, the government will reopen. This is  the answer.   But here we are again, 20 days later, and nothing has changed. In  fact, the arguments are the same. This is not a good-faith effort at  all. I think just less than an hour ago, we voted on an appropriations  measure by the new majority that said, if we pass this, the government  will reopen, and employees will be paid, and everything will be back to  normal, and harmony will be around all of us.   But that was less than an hour ago. Nothing has changed. In fact, we  are here right again.   So, going back to January 3, with a bill much like this, six  appropriations bills bundled together that had passed the Senate at  some point in the past were voted on by this House. They went to the  Senate. No action was taken.   The next day, January 4, we voted on a continuing resolution to fund  the remainder of the government, because that, again, was going to be  the solution. That was the silver bullet. It was going to open the  government, put everybody back to work, and have all the employees  paid. But, in fact, nothing happened, nothing changed.   We go into the next week. Because that didn't work, let's break them  all up and let's do them all separately. I am not sure why. Maybe we  will get a different outcome. But nothing changed.   In fact, they left the House. They go to the Senate. The government  is yet still closed.   Then, last week, let's do something very different. Let's don't take  up any of those again. Let's just pass a continuing resolution because,  surely, we missed the mark those other times. This will reopen the  government. This was the solution, we were told, last week.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, nothing has changed 33 three days in. Here we  are again.   But we have started over. We are going to do it again, but we are  going to change the terminology. These are the agreed-upon conference  reports from last year. I heard the majority say it was the Republicans  who had unified control of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency  that agreed to these things last year, so let's bring those up today.   But that is just a term. That is not truth. It is not fact.   For those watching and those in the gallery, they probably know and  remember the cartoon ``Schoolhouse Rock.'' I believe it was very clear  in a simple cartoon: You go from the House. You go to the Senate. There  is an amendment process. You have the opportunity to change, to amend,  to perfect.   Then, when each body has passed something, you go to a committee.  Those individuals from the House and the Senate, they get together.  They reach an agreement, and it is called a conference committee  report, which we are led to believe this might be. With that come  signatures on this report. Then it is presented to each body for final  passage and then to the administration for signature.   If this is, in fact, a conference committee report, how could it be?  How could it be, Mr. Speaker? Because it would have had to have passed  the House at some point this Congress, within the last 20 days, and  then have passed the Senate different, and then differences reconciled,  also with signatures.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask, is my signature on any of this? To answer  it for the Chair, it is no. I was chairman last year of the Financial  Services Committee. We did have good-faith negotiations. Mr. Quigley is  fantastic to work with. We were reaching consensus and had great  compromise.   So, today, to hear the other side say that this is what I agreed to  is truly inaccurate, because you will not find my signature. You will  not find any agreement from me on what is presented in the Financial  Services portion.  [[Page H1154]]    So this is not a good-faith effort. This is a repeat and a futile  exercise that we have seen over the last 20 days.   In fact, I doubt anybody is even watching, because you know where  their attention is today? I hope it is in the Senate, where they are  taking up the President's proposal--a true, good-faith effort to reopen  the government, to secure our country, to secure the border, and to  make sure that 800,000 Federal employees are being rightfully  compensated.   That is where the attention should be. I wish the House would take up  similar, but in the spirit of compromise. We don't see it here.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, I will draw your attention back about 11 months  ago. I believe it was the now-Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who  holds the record for the longest single speech standing on the floor of  the House, 8 hours and 7 minutes. It was over a very important issue.  It was over DACA.   The government went into a shutdown moment last year. There was this  big debate about it. It was then-Minority-Leader Nancy Pelosi who took  8 hours and 7 minutes to speak about this issue.   Yet when the President, this weekend, makes a proposal about it,  before he can even reach the lectern, Mr. Speaker, she is opposed to  it. She is opposed to it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Albert  Hodge, Jr., and as anyone who knows Al will attest, my remarks would  not be complete without a recognition of Al's talented wife, Cheryl.   Over the past 21 years, Al has served as president and CEO of the  Rome, Floyd County, Chamber of Commerce. Thanks to his hard work,  employers--including Suzuki, Pirelli, Neaton, and Lowe's--have brought  more than $1.2 billion of direct investment to our region and thousands  of jobs.   But Al's success would not be possible without Cheryl. Cheryl is not  just a supportive wife, mother, and grandmother. She is a Rome  institution in her own right. A talented artist active with the Rome  Area Council for the Arts, Cheryl is best known for her beautiful water  colors, one of which is hanging in my office right here in Washington,  D.C.   I pray for the best for Al and Cheryl, wherever life takes them. They  came to Rome over 20 years ago, and it is certainly a better place  today because of them.   Al and Cheryl, thank you and God bless.                            ____________________
