 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on  the Judiciary, I am responsible for legislation in the Senate relative  to law enforcement and criminal justice. It is an awesome  responsibility, and I think about it quite a bit because the first  thing all of us want is the safety of our families and our communities.  It is the first question asked: How safe is that area of Chicago? How  safe is that part of Springfield? It is a reality, and it is a natural  reaction.   I have had, during the course of my congressional career, the  opportunity to meet many of the men and women in law enforcement. Let  me tell you, there are some outstanding people who literally get up in  the morning and put on that badge and risk their lives. They go out for  just a routine traffic stop, and they could end up dead. That is the  reality of police work in a dangerous world, particularly in a world  awash with guns, as we are in the United States.   Having said that, acknowledging that reality, I also know that there  are cops who are doing terrible things. That was brought home to  America vividly over the last several days. You see, videotapes and DNA  evidence have changed our conversation about law enforcement and  justice. We now know just what happened--not an account of what  happened; we know what happened. We see it on videotapes over and over  and over again. And we know sometimes that people who have been found  guilty of crimes and are serving long sentences--it turns out the DNA  evidence proves it couldn't possibly have been them who were  responsible. It is a gross miscarriage of justice for the person who is  incarcerated--and even worse, the fact that the person who is culpable,  blamable, who should be prosecuted, may somewhere be on the loose.  Videotape and DNA have changed it.   Many Americans are struggling with feelings of grief and disbelief  after they watched the videotapes of Tyre Nichols being beaten to death  by a group of Memphis police officers.   Mr. Nichols, a 29-year-old father of a young son, worked the second  shift at a FedEx facility with his stepfather. He loved skateboarding  and photography. He loved his mother so much, he had her name tattooed  on his arm. He had no criminal record. One friend told a reporter Mr.  Nichols was even thinking about being a police officer to try to make  the system better from the inside.   The videotapes of the deadly assault on Mr. Nichols by Memphis police  officers on January 7 are horrific and sickening. They show at least  five officers attacking Mr. Nichols with their fists, boots, batons,  Tasers, and pepper spray, while yelling contradictory orders to him.  They continued pummeling Mr. Nichols even as he screamed in pain,  begged them to stop, and called out for his mother. One officer kicked  him in the head so hard that the officer was limping afterwards.   When the beating was over, another officer propped an apparently  unconscious Tyre Nichols up against the side of the squad car while the  others laughed, fist-bumped, and tried to justify their awful behavior.   It took 20 minutes for an ambulance to arrive, even longer for  medical aid to be rendered. Tyre Nichols died 3 days later in a Memphis  hospital. An independent autopsy revealed he had ``suffered extensive  bleeding caused by a severe beating.''   The killing of Tyre Nichols follows years of devastating tragedies  and needless loss. Who can ever forget George Floyd? When I saw the  videotape of what happened to him and saw that policeman with his knee  on his neck stare straight at the camera--I will never forget that. Or  Breonna Taylor, shot in her apartment.   In my own home State of Illinois, Laquan McDonald. A videotape that  was held back from the public for over a year finally was brought to  light, and people saw that he was shot in the back repeatedly, over and  over again. There are so many others. For George Floyd, he was murdered  as he lay on a curb in Minneapolis. Tyre Nichols was chased down and  beaten to death.   Black Americans in particular are forced to live through trauma with  every new incident of police violence.   I applaud the Shelby County district attorney for moving swiftly in  seeking the indictment of the five police officers. A sixth officer  connected to the incident was suspended today.   I agree with the attorney for Mr. Nichols' family, Ben Crump, that  the response by prosecutors could be a ``blueprint'' for how such cases  should be handled in the future if, inevitably, there are such cases.   We shouldn't wait for months to bring charges. There is no excuse for  delayed justice when the heinous acts occur and the facts are as clear  as the videotape.   I also want to extend my deepest condolences to Mr. Nichols' family,  especially his mom and his stepfather, who have responded with dignity  and grace to this unimaginable ordeal.   Before the videotapes were released, they called repeatedly for  protests to be peaceful. I would like to think that I would have the  strength to do that, having just lost my son in those circumstances,  but the Nichols family did, and throughout our Nation, almost without  exception, their wishes have been respected.   But prosecutions and peaceful protests cannot be the only response to  this tragedy. Americans--especially Black Americans--are exhausted by  the injustice of officers who abuse their authority. They are tired of  the systemic failures that can lead to a young man being beaten to  death after a questionable traffic stop.   As chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am committed to working  with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to finally confront these  problems with meaningful legislation.   We need to have an honest conversation with law enforcement officers  about screening, training, inherent bias, use of force, and  consequences for unjust actions.   We need to prohibit deadly and dishonorable police misconduct. We  must recruit and train the next generation of law enforcement to  protect and serve everyone in America: Black, White, Brown, and  everything in between.   We have made some very modest progress. Last December, Congress  enacted and the President signed a bill on  [[Page S140]]  law enforcement deescalation training. It provides for grants and  training for law enforcement deescalation tactics. It is not enough. We  must do more.   In the last Congress, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey led an effort  to build bipartisan support for policing reform legislation that  national police groups and civil rights advocates could endorse. He  worked with Tim Scott, a Republican Senator from South Carolina.   They invited me and Senator Lindsey Graham into their deliberations.  They were close to making some progress toward our goals, but even if  you look at their goals, which I believe were good, they are not  enough. Simply to say we are going to ban choke holds or we are going  to deal with warrantless searches in a different way doesn't get to the  heart of the issue. What is in the mind of these policemen when they  are executing their job, doing their duty? Is it the right way to  approach things?   These efforts must continue now anew. We owe it to all of the  families who have lost loved ones in these horrible acts of brutality  and to the families who fear that their loved ones could be next to  pass a law that will help ensure justice and accountability in our  policing system.   The vast majority of law enforcement officers are appalled and  angered by the deaths of Mr. Nichols and others. They deserve our  thanks, and I believe they will support bipartisan efforts to prevent  such abuses and punish those who commit them.   As I mentioned, Tyre Nichols loved photography. He loved  photographing the world as he saw it. One of his favorite images--which  appears again and again in his photos--was the image of a bridge. It is  time for Members of the Senate to bridge our differences and pass  policing reform so that Tyre Nichols' death will not have been in vain.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), the Senator from Massachusetts  (Mr. Markey), and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) are  necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 126         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
