 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I speak in opposition to H.R. 734, the politics over  participation act.   We can all agree on the need to address the challenges facing our  education system, issues like gun violence, academic achievement gaps,  and the lack of mental health support for our students. These are  serious challenges that demand serious action.   Unfortunately, my Republican colleagues have used their first 100  days in the majority to pursue a radical education agenda that  prioritizes political points over students' safety and success.   Today, we are considering another piece of this extreme agenda, one  that again targets transgender kids.   School sports activities offer fundamental life lessons--such as  leadership, self-confidence, and teamwork--that every child should be  able to enjoy. As Members of Congress, our responsibility is to ensure  that student athletics are, above all, fair and safe.   H.R. 734 does the exact opposite. It makes school sports less fair by  singling out and banning transgender women and girls as young as  kindergarten from participating on school sports teams with their  friends. We know transgender students already face widespread bullying  and discrimination. Adding to their pain by targeting their  participation in school sports is both wrong and dangerous.   Furthermore, contrary to my Republican colleagues' claims, H.R. 734  actually makes school sports less safe for women and girls. To enforce  its ban on transgender student athletes, the bill would require all  girls as young as their preteens to ``prove their gender.''   For example, under Utah's blanket ban on transgender student  participation in school sports, parents of the second- and third-place  finishers in a State-level girls' competition complained to the Utah  High School Activities Association that they suspected the winner of  the event was trans. Following the complaint, the school was forced to  investigate the student by combing through her records going back to  kindergarten. She was, in fact, not transgender.   The association has received other complaints about supposed trans  competitors, sometimes with the reasoning being simply that a girl  doesn't look feminine enough.   Simply put, H.R. 734 does not protect women and girls. It only makes  school sports less safe and less fair.   There are schools, States, and sports associations that have been  allowing transgender people to play equitably and consistent with their  gender identity with no issues for decades.   This bill doesn't address the most elite level of athletes. Yet, even  at the most elite level, organizations like the International Olympic  Committee have frameworks for transgender inclusion in sports. They  reject the type of categorical blanket ban Republicans are pushing for  kids as young as kindergartners in schools.   Congress has no business targeting transgender women and girls and  imposing a nationwide ban on their participation in school sports. We  need to refocus on our job in Congress to address the most pressing  issues facing students and parents and ensure that every child in  America can reach their full potential.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 734, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the following  letters from PFLAG, a consortium of women and girls' rights  organizations and 40 professional athletes all in opposition to H.R.  734.                                                          PFLAG,                                                     April 14, 2023.      Member of Congress,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: PFLAG is the nation's largest       organization dedicated to supporting, educating, and       advocating for LGBTQ+ people and those who love them. Since       our founding in 1973, we have been the connection for LGBTQ+       people with community, parents with resources, and allies       with tools, bolstering the LGBTQ+ movement with strength,       power, and love.        PFLAG families, members, and supporters in every District       across the country urge Congress and others to support       inclusion of transgender, nonbinary and intersex youth in       sports. We strongly oppose isolating, and excluding youth       from participation, and violating privacy and protection in       order to combat discrimination granted in Title IX, which by       law promises not to discriminate on the basis of sex.        In furtherance of the above,--and in pursuit of protecting       trans, nonbinary, and intersex youth athletes who participate       in sports with their cisgender peers--PFLAG National opposes       H.R. 734, the so-called Protection of Women and Girls in       Sports Act of 2023, and rejects its targeted attacks which       not only harms transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth and       their families but also harms girls' and women's sports as a       whole.        When more than 20 states have or seek laws to restrict       trans, nonbinary and intersex students from participating       with their peers in sports, families everywhere must be able       to rely on our federal government to seek fair inclusion and       equal access in all areas of public education, including       sports.        Our families across the nation are relying on you to do       what this bill states in name but defies in content: Protect       women and girls in sports by including--not excluding--trans,       nonbinary and intersex youth participation in sports.        If you or your staff have any questions or wish to speak to       your constituents who are part of PFLAG and can speak to the       negative impact and harm that passage of this bill would have       and inflict, please contact our Director of Policy Diego M.       Sanchez.        PFLAG's network of hundreds of chapters and hundreds of       thousands of members from coast to coast are working to       create an equitable, inclusive world where every LGBTQ+       person is safe, celebrated, empowered, and loved. We are all       counting on you to do the proper and honorable act of voting       ``No'' on H.R. 734 when it comes to the House Floor for a       vote.            Sincerely,                                                  Brian K. Bond,                                                 Executive Director,      PFLAG National.                                   ____                                                     April 14, 2023.        Dear Member of Congress: The National Women's Law Center       and Women's Sports Foundation, joined by the undersigned       women's and girls' rights organizations, write to voice our       vehement opposition to H.R. 734, ``The Protection of Women       and Girls in Sports Act of 2023,'' and any other similar       effort to ban transgender girls from participating in sports.       As organizations deeply committed to fulfilling the promise       of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 of equal       educational opportunity for all women and girls, including in       school sports, we have advocated for gender equity in schools       for decades. We support the inclusion of all students,       including transgender, intersex, and nonbinary students in       school sports as part of this mission. While this bill is       framed as ``protecting women's and girls' sports,'' we write       to call out this hateful measure for what it actually is: a       discriminatory attempt to target an already-marginalized       group, rather than to promote fairness and safety in school       sports for women and girls. We thus urge you to oppose H.R.       734 and join us in rallying behind all women and girls and       rejecting the efforts to enshrine sex discrimination against       an especially vulnerable group within Title IX.        H.R. 734 unmistakably constitutes discrimination on the       basis of sex. As recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court,       numerous Federal courts, and the U.S. Department of       Education, discrimination includes discrimination based on       gender identity and sex characteristics. Title IX's mandate       that all students must be able to access the benefits and       opportunities of an education free from sex discrimination       includes the right to play sports. It is well documented that       sports participation is linked to increased academic       achievement, and fosters in students increased emotional,       mental, and physical well-being and a sense of community.       Amending Title IX to exclude transgender, intersex, and       nonbinary students from these essential benefits of sports       participation betrays Title IX's broad purpose to defeat sex       discrimination in education in order to further harm these       students, who because of stigma and discrimination are       already especially vulnerable to isolation and decreased       academic performance.        The bill's title, ``Protecting Women and Girls in Sports       Act,'' is an intentionally deceptive misnomer, as H.R. 734       makes no effort to address the actual, pervasive       discriminatory barriers that women and girls continue to face       in school athletics. H.R. 734 does nothing to address the       fact that college women have almost 60,000 fewer athletic       opportunities to play than men, or that high school girls       have over 1 million fewer opportunities than boys do to play       sports. It fails to take any steps to open opportunities for       women and girls of color, who are disproportionately impacted       by these disparities in participation opportunities. H.R. 734       does not advance policies to address the second-class       treatment women's and girls' teams continue to receive from       their schools as compared to men's and boys' teams when it       comes to facilities, equipment, and travel. Nor does H.R. 734       seek to strengthen protections against the rampant sexual       abuse student-athletes of all ages and genders still  [[Page H1864]]       face. To put it plainly, one would be hard pressed to explain       how banning transgender women and girls from playing       alongside their peers does anything to address actual       problems of sex discrimination in sports.        Transgender women and girls have been playing school sports       for years, and claims that they have been unfairly       ``dominating'' competition or excluding their cisgender peers       from chances to play are utterly false. Indeed, recent data       from the CDC shows that state policies that prevent       transgender high school students from playing are correlated       with lower participation by all high school girls between       2011 and 2019; meanwhile, participation by all girls remained       unchanged in states with policies allowing transgender       students to play. H.R. 734's real purpose is not to expand       opportunities for women and girls, but to deny transgender,       intersex, and nonbinary students of their right under Title       IX to equal athletic opportunities. This bill coopts the       language of women's rights to undermine protections against       sex discrimination.        Not only does H.R. 734 fail to address the actual, ongoing       problems that limit women's and girls' opportunities in       school sports, but excluding women and girls who are       transgender from school sports invites gender policing that       threatens all women and girls. H.R. 734 is vague and       unworkable, and could only be implemented by a combination of       invasive and harmful practices. There is no principled way to       apply the bill's unclear language to the many girls and young       women born with intersex variations, which by definition, are       variations in ``reproductive biology and genetics at birth.       ``Similar bans have been widely used to push girls and women       born with these variations out of sports opportunities and       have chilled their participation in school sports.       Additionally, H.R. 734 would inevitably lead to some schools       adopting invasive and dangerous ``sex verification''       practices, which police women and girls' bodies by forcing       them to submit to a variety of humiliating and unscientific       practices for the purported purpose of determining whether       they are ``really'' girls or women. These procedures make all       women and girls vulnerable to sexual abuse, but are       especially likely to be used to target Black and brown women       and girls who do not conform to white ideals of femininity,       other women and girls who do not conform to sexist       stereotypes, and nonbinary and gender nonconforming students.       If H.R. 734 becomes law, it would permit school districts,       colleges and universities, and athletics associations to       become the arbiters of who is ``sufficiently'' feminine to       play, thereby perpetuating harmful racist and sexist       stereotypes that punish students for who they are or how they       look, and placing students at further risk for sexual abuse.        Transgender and intersex women and girls are women and       girls, and should have the right to participate in athletics       consistent with their gender identity. The blanket,       discriminatory exclusion that H.R. 734 would mandate for       every age, every sport, and every level of competition flies       in the face of Title IX's mandate of equal access to       educational opportunities. H.R. 734 promotes fear, dangerous       stereotypes, and sex discrimination based on misinformation,       and it should not become law.        As women's rights and gender justice organizations, we       vehemently reject the dangerous legislation and rhetoric       pushed by politicians seeking to marginalize transgender,       nonbinary, and intersex people. Supporting the civil rights       of women and girls cannot be separated from championing       policies that protect the rights of transgender, intersex,       and nonbinary individuals' rights to be free from sex       discrimination, including in school sports. This, at a       minimum, includes voicing strong opposition to H.R. 734.

We, the undersigned athletes, believe that every child       deserves to have their life changed for the better by being       able to participate in the sport that they love.        As professional, Olympic and Paralympic athletes, we have       dedicated our lives to sports. Sports have given us our       greatest friends, taught us incredible life lessons, and       given us the confidence and drive to succeed in the world.       Those of us who love sport know that its value goes far       beyond the playing field, to developing a sense of self and       identity, and reflecting what we value as a community. Sport       is a tremendous outlet for physical and mental health,       teaches valuable lessons on teamwork and discipline, and has       brought us lifelong community. Every single child should have       access to the lifesaving power of sports.        Right now, transgender and intersex human rights are under       attack, with politicians in Washington D.C. pushing forward       H.R. 734, the so-called ``Protection of Girls and Women in       Sports Act'', which would stipulate that Title IX compliance       requires banning transgender and intersex girls and women       from participating in sports. If this bill passes,       transgender and intersex girls and women throughout the       country will be forced to sit on the sidelines, away from       their peers and their communities. Furthermore, the policing       of who can and cannot play school sports will very likely       lead to the policing of the bodies of all girls, including       cisgender girls. This will deter girls from participating in       sports and create additional barriers. Denying children       access to a place where they can gain significant mental and       physical health benefits, and learn lifelong lessons that       come from being part of a team and working hard towards your       goals does not protect women in sports.        We believe that gender equity in sport is critical which is       why we urge policymakers to turn their attention and effort       to the causes women athletes have been fighting for decades,       including equal pay, an end to abuse and mistreatment, uneven       implementation of Title IX, and a lack of access and equity       for girls of color and girls with disabilities, to name only       a few        Our deepest hope is that transgender and intersex kids will       never have to feel the isolation, exclusion and othering that       H.R. 734 is seeking to enshrine into law.

To deny their existence is to also deny their  humanity, and this is a terrible thing.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Frost).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Stansbury).    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record an article from the  Advocate titled ``Judge Blocks Utah Trans Sports Ban, While Probe of  Athlete Emerges,'' from August 2022.                     [From the Advocate, Aug. 19, 2022]     Judge Blocks Utah Trans Sports Ban, While Probe of Athlete Emerges                              (By Trudy Ring)         A judge in Utah has blocked enforcement of the state's       transgender sports ban, days after news emerged that parents       of cisgender female athletes had filed a complaint about an       alleged trans competitor who turned out not to be.        Judge Keith A. Kelly in the Third District Court of Utah,       located in Salt Lake County, issued a preliminary injunction       Friday against the state's blanket ban on trans girls in       girls' school sports, meaning it can't be enforced while a       lawsuit against it proceeds. The ban is only one section of       the law passed as House Bill 11. He left the rest of the law       intact, including the requirement for trans girls to go       before a commission to determine their eligibility to compete       in girls' sports.        ``Thus, the effect of this preliminary injunction will not       mean that transgender girls will automatically be eligible to       compete on their school's girls' teams,'' Kelly wrote.       ``Rather, it will allow them to compete only upon the       commission's determination that their being able to compete       is fair under all of the circumstances.''        Utah lawmakers overrode Gov. Spencer Cox's veto to pass the       legislation in March.        The injunction comes shortly after another development       regarding the law. The parents of the second- and third-place       finishers in a state-level girls' sports event complained to       the Utah High School Activities Association that they       suspected the winner of the event was trans, David Spatafore,       legislative representative for the association, told the Utah       Legislature's Education Interim Committee Wednesday, the       Deseret News reports. The UHSAA had the student's school       investigate, looking over her records all the way back to       kindergarten, and it turned out that she was not trans. He       didn't identify the student, the school, or the sport, citing       privacy considerations.        He said the association has received other complaints about       supposed trans competitors, sometimes with people saying a       girl simply ``doesn't look feminine enough.''        Opponents of the law said this shows major problems with       it. ``We warned about this being a possibility, that everyone       would accuse everyone who is successful of being  [[Page H1866]]       transgender,'' Sue Robbins, a member of the Transgender       Advisory Council of Equality Utah, told The Salt Lake       Tribune. ``It becomes about judging women's bodies. And no       body is safe.''        At his monthly press conference Thursday, Gov. Cox called       this investigation a disturbing development. ``My goodness,       we're living in this world where we've become sore losers,       and we're looking for any reason why our kid lost,'' he said,       according to the Tribune. ``I have a real problem with that       story. . . . I just wish we could be a little more thoughtful       in life and a little less critical of other people.''        Meanwhile, the parents who filed suit against the law       welcomed Friday's injunction. ``My husband and I are very       relieved by this decision,'' Debbie Roe, a parent plaintiff       in the lawsuit, Roe v. UHSAA, said in a press release. ``We       are grateful the court understood how much harm this law has       caused, which has been a huge source of stress and trauma for       our child. Our daughter just wants the same chance as other       kids to make friends and play on the team she loves. Today's       ruling gives her the opportunity to do that.''        ``This is a win not only for my child but for all girls in       this state,'' added Jean Noe, another parent plaintiff.       ``This law is based on stereotypes and misconceptions that       are harmful to all girls. I am grateful the court has put       this dangerous law on pause and that, at least for the       moment, all Utah children can know that they are valued and       supported.''        ``We are very pleased by the court's decision,'' said       Justice Christine Durham, former chief justice of the Utah       Supreme Court and senior of counsel at Wilson Sonsini, one of       the lawyers representing the parents. ``Thus far, every court       to rule on a similar ban has barred it from taking effect,       due in part to the serious harms caused by excluding an       entire group of students from such an important school       activity. We read today's decision as recognizing that the       law is not only discriminatory but puts Utah children at       needless risk of lifelong harm. We look forward to moving       forward with the case and securing a permanent decision       blocking the law from taking effect.''        In addition to Wilson Sonsini, the parents are represented       by the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah and the       National Center for Lesbian Rights.     Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove)    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Landsman).    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record letters from the Human  Rights Campaign and the Athletes' Advisory Council.                                          Human Rights Campaign,                                                     April 14, 2023.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Human Rights       Campaign's more than three million members and supporters       nationwide, I write to express our strong opposition to H.R.       734--the misnamed Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act       of 2023 which seeks to implement a discriminatory ban on       transgender girls participating in girls' sports nationwide.       As the nation's largest civil rights organization working to       achieve lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer       equality, we are deeply concerned about the negative impact       this legislation would have on young people already facing       significant challenges due to stigma and discrimination.        Athletics are an experience everyone deserves equal access       to. School sports provide important development opportunities       that teach young people about teamwork, perseverance,       leadership, discipline, and exercise, and help them build       friendships and community. All kids--including transgender       girls and intersex children who would also be restricted from       participating in school sports by this bill--should have the       same opportunities to participate in activities that embody       our shared ideals as Americans.        We know that allowing transgender and intersex youth to       play sports in school does not disadvantage anyone else.       States, school districts, and athletic associations around       the country have allowed transgender and intersex young       people to participate in school sports consistent with their       gender identity for decades--all without issue. Indeed,       despite hundreds, if not thousands, of transgender women and       girls participating in sports over time, only a handful of       transgender athletes in high school or college have had any       notable success. This is because transgender and intersex       students do not seek to participate in sports consistent with       their gender identity to gain an unfair advantage--they do it       for the same reasons other young people play sports in       school: to challenge themselves, improve their fitness, be       part of a team, and have fun.        Banning transgender and intersex kids from playing sports       in school would do nothing to address ongoing, well-      documented threats to girls' and women's sports, including a       lack of equal resources, pay inequality, and sexual       harassment. Advocates for women and girls in sports like the       National Women's Law Center, the Women's Sports Foundation,       Women Leaders in College Sports, and American Association of       University Women all support policies allowing transgender       people to play sports consistent with their gender identity.        These groups oppose efforts to exclude transgender students       like this bill, which  [[Page H1867]]       would promote baseless fears and misinformation rather than       solve any real problems.        We urge you to vote no on H.R. 734, as well as vote against       any anti-LGBTQ+ amendments. We will consider these key votes.            Sincerely,                                                   Kelley Robinson,      President.                                   ____                                       Athletes' Advisory Council,                                                     April 14, 2023.      Re H.R. 734--OPPOSE.         Dear Members of Congress: The Team USA Athletes' Commission       (Team USA AC), formally known as the United States Olympic       and Paralympic Committee Athletes' Advisory Council (AAC),       serves as the representative group and voice of Team USA       athletes (approximately 5,000 athletes). We write to you       today to voice our opposition to H.R. 734, ``The Protection       of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023.''        H.R. 734 does not align with the Team USA AC position, as       detailed in our June 2022 Statement on Transgender and       Nonbinary Athlete Inclusion:        ``The AAC [now Team USA AC], which serves as the       representative group and voice of Team USA athletes, seeks to       promote a safe and welcoming environment for everyone       involved in sport, consistent with the AAC's core values of       championing diversity, equity and inclusion.        Everyone should have equal access to and opportunity in       sport. The AAC opposes any attempt to marginalize, limit or       deny human rights and is on the side of inclusion of all       participants in youth sports. Banning transgender and       nonbinary kids from sports ostracizes from a fundamental part       of growing up and all the benefits sports provide to youth.        The AAC also recognizes the difference between youth sports       (K-12 and recreational) and elite sports. Competitive sport       relies on a level playing field where no athlete has an       unfair and disproportionate advantage over another. Sport       must ensure everyone, irrespective of their gender identity       or sex characteristics, can compete in a safe environment       that respects and recognizes their needs and identities while       balancing the interests of ensuring fair competition. Like       the IOC, we echo that simply because an athlete is       transgender or has an intersex variation, does not mean they       automatically have a competitive advantage in sport.        Each sport's governing body should be given the latitude to       determine how an athlete may be at a disproportionate       advantage over another considering the nature of each sport.       Eligibility criteria play a paramount role in ensuring       fairness, particularly at the elite level. Such criteria       should be evidence-based, employ a stakeholder centered       approach and be grounded in inclusion, prevention of harm,       fairness and nondiscrimination. As the AAC, we remain       committed to ensuring all athletes have the right to       participate in sport in a way that respects their health,       safety and dignity.'        The blanket exclusion that H.R. 734 would mandate for every       age, every sport, and every level of competition is contrary       to Title IX's mandate of equal access to educational       opportunities.        We ask all members of Congress to oppose H.R. 734.            Sincerely,                                                       Mark Ladwig,                              Chair, Team USA Athletes' Commission.     Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Green).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire of the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record letters from the ACLU,  the Leadership Conference of Civil and Human Rights, and GLSEN, all in  opposition to H.R. 734.                                  American Civil Liberties Union,                                     Washington, DC, April 14, 2023.        Dear Representative: The American Civil Liberties Union       strongly urges you to oppose H.R. 734, the Protection of       Women and Girls in Sports Act. This discriminatory and       unconstitutional legislation would make it illegal for       schools receiving federal funding to allow transgender girls       and women to play on sports teams for girls and women, in       violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal       protection. In addition, under Title IX, all girls, including       those who are transgender, should be able to participate       fully and equally in athletics, in accordance with who they       are. This will be the first vote in congressional history to       specifically single out transgender people for       discrimination. Because of the importance of this vote, the       ACLU will be scoring it.        Across the country, state legislatures have advanced       legislation to ban transgender children from participating in       sports, particularly transgender girls. These legislators--      like the proponents of this legislation--have argued that       passing these bans is necessary to protect sports for girls       and women. There are a multitude of barriers facing female       student athletes--from continued funding inequities to pay       disparities among coaches and staff to harassment and abuse.       The participation of their transgender peers, who frequently       number in the single digits in states that have enacted bans       identical to this one, is simply not one of those barriers.        Legislators supporting these bans are cynically using       transgender people as political pawns under the guise of       ``protecting women's sports,'' yet leading advocates for       women's sports, including the Women's Sports Foundation,       Women Leaders in College Sports, the Tucker Center for       Research on Girls & Women in Sport, National Women's Law       Center, and hundreds of athletes in women's sports and other       women's rights groups have consistently voiced their strong       support for inclusion of transgender girls and women in       women's sports.        These organizations rightly recognize that transgender       girls and women participate in sports for the same reasons as       their peers who are not transgender: to be part of a team,       learn sportsmanship, and challenge themselves. The experience       of 12-year-old Becky PepperJackson from West Virginia is       reflective of so many other transgender youth across the       country. These are Becky's own words:        A long time before I or my parents understood what the word       ``transgender'' meant--as far back as I can remember--I knew       that I am a girl. I'm 12 years old and in the 7th grade now,       and I'm lucky that my friends at school all accept me for who       I am: a girl who loves math and science, anything pink, and       playing video games with my friends. And I'm a runner. Most       of my family runs. I run with my two big brothers and my mom,       and sometimes my aunt joins us too.        After I ran with my school's cross-country team in the       spring of 2022, my coach encouraged me to try out for some of       the field events. I made the team for shotput and discus, and       I love both. It was so much fun to cheer on my teammates at       the meets, and they would cheer me on when I competed in my       events. I kept up with cross-country too. The past two years       on my middle school's girls' cross-country and track-and-      field teams have been the best of my life. My teammates and I       have the best time during practices and at cross-country and       track-  [[Page H1868]]       and-field meets. They support me even when I am not the       fastest or best on the team. I don't want to stop doing the       thing that I love and that is part of who I am. Sports are       everything to me and my cross-country and track-and-field       teams have become my second family over the last two years. I       have many more years of cross-country and track-and-field       left, and I just want the opportunity to participate in       school sports like any other girl.        H.R. 734 does nothing to address the real barriers facing       female student athletes. Instead, it targets a small, already       vulnerable group of people for further discrimination. The       ACLU strongly urges all Members to vote NO on H.R. 734.            Sincerely,      Christopher Anders,        Federal Policy Director.      Ian S. Thompson,        Senior Legislative Advocate.                                   ____                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                     Washington, DC, March 27, 2023.                  Oppose H.R. 734 To Protect Civil Rights         Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of The Leadership       Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by       its diverse membership of more than 230 national       organizations to promote and protect the civil and human       rights of all persons in the United States, and the 187       undersigned organizations, we call for the full inclusion,       protection, and celebration of transgender, nonbinary, and       intersex youth, including access to extracurricular       activities such as athletics and to school facilities, safe       and inclusive school environments, and accurate and inclusive       curriculum. We reject H.R. 734, the so-called Protection of       Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023, because it would harm       women and girls and undermine civil rights for all students.        This discriminatory proposal seeks to exclude transgender,       nonbinary, and intersex people from athletics programs in       schools. Although the authors of the legislation represent       themselves as serving the interests of cisgender girls and       women, this legislation does not address the longstanding       barriers all girls and women have faced in their pursuit of       athletics. Instead of providing for equal facilities,       equipment, and travel, or any other strategy that women       athletes have been pushing for for decades, the bill       cynically veils an attack on transgender people as a question       of athletics policy.        Youth sports often play a significant role in children's       lives and development, helping them to develop critical life       skills like communication, teamwork, and leadership. Sports       spaces are imperative for all young people, no matter their       gender. Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth want to       participate in team sports for the same reasons as their       cisgender peers: to be part of a team, learn sportsmanship,       and challenge themselves. School athletics are very often the       centerpiece of communities across the country, and denying       transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth the chance to       participate only serves to deny them an opportunity to be       part of that community, further isolating and stigmatizing       these youth.        The civil and human rights community is no stranger to the       proffering of a bigoted agenda as if it were about equal       opportunity. We know about wolves in sheep's clothing. We       know that when affirmative action policies created to level       the playing field in higher education admissions are attacked       by opponents of voting rights, that their agenda is not about       the rights of people of color know that when companies profit       from poverty wages for disabled people, especially in       segregated work sites, that their agenda is not about       independence and self-determination for worker And we know       that when opponents of Title IX, those who have sought for       decades to weaken its protections and undermine its       enforcement, now present themselves as the law's champions,       that their agenda is not about the rights of women and girls.        Targeting and excluding transgender, nonbinary, and       intersex students from participation in school programming,       including athletics programs, alongside their cisgender peers       is harmful to all students and undermines the learning       environment for everyone. If schools mark some students       effectively as outcasts, they foster an environment where no       student is included and safe. H.R. 734's vague language and       intrusive focus on scrutiny of students' bodies will       effectively exclude girls and women with intersex variations       from participation, will invite scrutiny and harassment of       any other student perceived by anyone as not conforming to       sex stereotypes, and will likely be disproportionately used       to target girls and women of color. We support the full       inclusion and protection of transgender, nonbinary, and       intersex youth.        We are fortunate that transgender, nonbinary, and intersex       people are present in our community, and we fully embrace       them as members of our community. As organizations that care       deeply about ending sexbased discrimination and ensuring       equal educational opportunities, we support laws and policies       that protect transgender people from discrimination,       including full and equal participation in sports, access to       gender-affirming care, access to school facilities, and       access to inclusive curriculum. We firmly believe that an       attack on transgender youth is an attack on civil rights.        We ask all members of Congress to strongly oppose H.R. 734       and to reject attacks on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex       youth; to commit themselves to meaningfully advancing       policies that support equal opportunity; and to reassure all       students in the Nation's classrooms that they will have the       chance to learn, grow, and thrive.

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader Jeffries: Thank you for your ongoing leadership       in combating the rise of discrimination against LGBTQ+       Americans. We appreciate the opportunity to share our       thoughts on H.R. 734, the Protection of Women and Girls in       Sports Act.        GLSEN is the leading national organization on LGBTQ+ issues       in K-12 education, working at the local, state, and national       level to transform education systems to improve conditions       for LGBTQ+ students across the United States.        GLSEN believes that every student has the right to a safe,       supportive, and LGBTQ-inclusive K-12 education, and works to       ensure that LGBTQ+ students are able to learn and grow in a       school environment free from bullying and harassment.        H.R. 734, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act,       is designed specifically to attack students in the LGBTQ+       community, and opens the door for bullying and harassment.       This legislation prohibits transgender students from       participating in sports that align with their gender       identity, robbing them of their right to participate in       sports.        Participation in sports has positive effects on youth       development, such as improving physical health, social       skills, and psychological well-being. Additionally, research       has found that sports participation is related to greater       feelings of school belonging and pro-school behaviors. To       restrict which students can benefit from participation in       sports is to contribute to a hostile school environment that       further isolates and discriminates against transgender       students.        Policies that create social exclusion have been found to       have a negative impact on students' mental health. GLSEN's       2021 National School Climate Survey found that among those       who reported considering dropping out school, over half (51.5       percent) said it was due to hostile school climate created by       anti-LGBTQ+ policies, such as restrictions on their ability       to access sex-separated spaces. Further, students who       experienced anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination were nearly three       times as likely to have missed school in the past month as       those who had not (43.3 percent vs. 16.4 percent). These       students reported lower levels of self-esteem, higher levels       of depression, and were more than twice as likely to have       seriously considered suicide in the past year as compared to       students who did not experience these discriminatory       policies.        H.R. 734 targets the 41 percent of transgender youth who       have participated on at least one school sport team in the       past year. Removing students from their sports teams will       reinforce feelings of self-doubt, isolation, and a feeling       that they do not belong.        Rather than working to further entrench the mental health       problems faced by students, Congress should be acting to       support our children in schools. American families want to       enjoy time watching their children participate in their       favorite sports, not incite flames of hatred and exclusion.        GLSEN thanks you for your ongoing leadership and we are       happy to serve as a resource if you have any questions or       need additional information.            Sincerely,      Aaron Ridings,        Chief of Staff and Deputy Executive Director for Public       Policy and Research, GLSEN.     Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a statement by the  National Parents Union in opposition to H.R. 734.                                         National Parents Union.         H.R. 734 bullies kids instead of teaching them to read.       It's time to get focused on what matters to American       families.        The National Parents Union continues to be frustrated with       the lack of focus from House and Education Workforce       Committee Leadership on issues that matter to American       Families. Families across the country want Congress to focus       on ensuring that every child is prepared for their future--      not bullying kids who want to play sports among their peers.        32 percent of our country's 4th graders were proficient       readers according to the National Assessment of Educational       Progress. That means that 7 out of 10 of our current 5th       graders cannot fully engage in their learning because they       cannot read the content.        Our latest national parent poll clearly states parent       priorities and nowhere to be found is anything about members       of their kids sports teams.        90 percent Believe students should have access to high-      quality, well rounded education with resources to support       their individual needs.        90 percent Believe that students should be prepared for       college and/or careers when they graduate.        90 percent Believe students should be protected from any       form of discrimination at school.     Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the full Committee on  Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Vermont (Ms. Balint).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, fundamentally, the difference between the two sides is  that my friends on the other side of the aisle do not recognize trans  people as human beings. They do not even recognize the validity of  trans. That is a terrible error, and it is wrong, and it does not grant  trans people humanity.   A subsequent corollary to this stance is that they don't believe that  trans people are who they are, that somehow it is a choice. I am going  to tell you: This debate itself has been traumatizing.   I can remember when I was a teenager when debate in California was  occurring over the Briggs Initiative, which would have banned LGBT  teachers from teaching. One Republican Governor, Ronald Reagan, at the  last minute opposed the initiative, and to me that meant a lot. It  means a lot to me that Spencer Cox of Utah recognizes that trans kids  exist and that we  [[Page H1871]]  should protect them. This bill is horrible. All should stand opposed to  it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a Statement of  Administration Policy from the administration.                     Statement of Administration Policy     h.r. 734--protection of women and girls in sports act of 2023--rep.                      steube, R-fl, and 93 cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R.       734.        For students nationwide, participating in sports and being       part of a team is an important part of growing up, staying       engaged in school, and learning leadership and life skills.       H.R. 734 would deny access to sports for many families by       establishing an absolute ban on transgender students--even       those as young as elementary schoolers--playing on a team       consistent with their gender identity. Schools, coaches, and       athletic associations around the country are already working       with families to develop participation rules that are fair       and that take into account particular sports, grade levels,       and levels of competition. As a national ban that does not       account for competitiveness or grade level, H.R. 734 targets       people for who they are and therefore is discriminatory.       Politicians should not dictate a one-size-fits-all       requirement that forces coaches to remove kids from their       teams. At a time when transgender youth already face a       nationwide mental health crisis, with half of transgender       youth in a recent survey saying they have seriously       considered suicide, a national law that further stigmatizes       these children is completely unnecessary, hurts families and       students, and would only put students at greater risk.       Discrimination has no place in our nation's schools or on our       playing fields.        Instead of addressing the pressing issues that families and       students face today--such as raising teacher pay, keeping       guns out of schools, addressing the mental health crisis our       youth face, and helping students learn and recover       academically from unprecedented disruptions--Congressional       Republicans have instead chosen to prioritize policies that       discriminate against children.        If the President were presented with H.R. 734, he would       veto it.
