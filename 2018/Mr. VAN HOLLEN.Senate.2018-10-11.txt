 Madam President, Mr. Clark's nomination is yet  another example of the Trump administration nominating individuals to  lead government offices whose missions they have opposed.   The Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Department of  Justice is uniquely charged with the ``stewardship of the nation's  natural resources and public lands.'' Yet, in the face of the  overwhelming evidence of climate change, Mr. Clark says the science is  debatable. It isn't, and this is not the time to have someone in this  position who refuses to acknowledge facts and confront the costs and  risks of inaction.   In addition, like many Trump nominees, Mr. Clark is skeptical of the  longstanding Chevron doctrine which states that courts must give  deference to agency regulations because agencies are staffed with  subject matter experts and that judges, who are only supposed to  interpret the law, are not qualified to substitute their opinions.  Large corporate polluters frequently challenge EPA regulations designed  to safeguard our waters, endangered species, and natural resources, and  we need a person in this position who will side with the scientists and  public health experts, not big polluters.   Americans deserve an associate attorney who is committed to  protecting their interests and not big-monied special interests. I do  not believe that Mr. Clark is that person, and I will be voting against  his nomination.    Mr. President, I rise to oppose the nomination of  Eric Dreiband to serve as Assistant Attorney General of the Civil  Rights Division. His nomination is an affront to the mission of the  Civil Rights Division, the career attorneys, and to everyone in our  country dedicated to advancing civil rights.   Created in 1957, the mission of the Civil Rights Division is to  ``enforce[e] federal statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis  of race, color, sex, disability, religion, familial status and national  origin.'' The Civil Rights Division has been indispensable in helping  our country combat housing discrimination, voting rights abuses, and  hate crimes. It has also intervened in cases of police misconduct in  certain situations.   Mr. Dreiband is the wrong person to lead the Civil Rights Division.  He has spent his entire career advocating for weaker antidiscrimination  laws. He has testified in Congress against the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay  Act, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, and ban- the-box regulations.   Looking at this record, Mr. Dreiband will do more to undermine than  to protect efforts to prevent discrimination. How can someone devoted  to fighting against antidiscriminatory laws now be charged with leading  an agency that enforces antidiscrimination laws? It is almost as if the  Trump administration is ``trolling'' the agency itself with Mr.  Dreiband's nomination.   Unfortunately, under Attorney General Sessions, the Department of  Justice has already rolled back Obama-era guidance that terminated the  Federal Government's use of private prisons, helped protect vulnerable  transgender students, and the Cole memo which allowed prosecutorial  discretion in sentencing for drug cases. Mr. Dreiband's record suggests  he will continue these attacks on civil rights.   The Assistant Attorney General of Civil Rights Division should be  someone that will vigorously protect minority rights and aggressively  expand civil rights for all Americans. Mr. Dreiband has shown that he  is not that person.   THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time  has expired.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination  of Eric S. Dreiband, of Maryland, to be an Assistant Attorney General?    Mr. President, this week the Senate completed work on  America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, a new water resources  development bill that authorizes U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil  works activities and drinking water and wastewater infrastructure  improvements.   The legislation will invest in numerous infrastructure projects in  Maryland and across the country and includes funding to repair aging  drinking water, wastewater, and irrigation systems, protect Americans  from dangerous floodwaters, and increase public participation and State  funding flexibility in local infrastructure projects.   This bill rejects the Trump administration's proposed  reclassification of the Poplar Island restoration project, which could  imperil the progress of this national model for restoration success  located in Talbot County and extends the original 7-year authorization  of the Mid-Bay Islands Ecosystem Restoration Project, focused on James  and Barren Islands in Dorchester County, by an additional 3 years, to  total 10 years.   To allow for greater involvement of local governments in project  selection, the bill requires the Army Corps of Engineers to increase  public participation by, at a minimum, holding annual public meetings  at the district level, providing information about the administration's  budget requests, and allowing non-Federal interests the opportunity to  collaborate and share in concept development and decision making to  solve problems.   The bill also authorizes $8 million in new EPA grants through a  Drinking Water System Infrastructure Resilience and Sustainability  Program for water systems that will assist in planning, design,  construction, implementation, operation, or maintenance to improve  resilience to natural hazards.   I am pleased to support this bill, and I look forward to working with  the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure more transparency in the process.                            ____________________
