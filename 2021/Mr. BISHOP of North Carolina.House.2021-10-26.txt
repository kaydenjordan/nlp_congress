 Madam Speaker, Hoke County Sheriff Dr.  Hubert Peterkin died unexpectedly last Friday during surgery and from a  previous unannounced affliction of cancer. For the people of Hoke  County, whom Sheriff Peterkin served in that capacity for 19 years, it  has been a devastating shock and loss. I consider it to have been my  honor and privilege to have gotten to know him briefly.   Sheriff Peterkin wore the badge over three decades. His fellow  sheriffs elected him vice president and then president of the North  Carolina Sheriffs' Association. But, of course, as sheriff, he  maintained not only law and order but community cohesion in that  special way that rural communities throughout my State do so well.  Peterkin's terrific presence earned him many awards and recognitions,  including the Order of the Long Leaf Pine and the key to the city of  Raeford.   Sheriff Peterkin leaves behind his wife and two children to cherish  his memory as well as many colleagues and friends. The people of Hoke  County will miss his leadership, and I join them in lifting up the  Peterkin family in prayer.                            ____________________
