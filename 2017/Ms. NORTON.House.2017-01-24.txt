 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.   I stand here in a unique position; first, to oppose this sweeping  attack on women's reproductive health in its entirety, but I also am  compelled to discuss the unique provision that singles out the District  of Columbia, permanently barring the District of Columbia from spending  its own local funds--not a cent of it raised in this Congress--on  abortion services for low-income women, thus uniquely denying the  District of Columbia government the right that local and State  governments exercise throughout the United States using their own local  funds.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 7 goes further. It insults the District of  Columbia.   Just to make sure everybody understands that the bill means to  include the District of Columbia, it tortuously defines or redefines  the term ``Federal Government'' to include a local jurisdiction, the  ``District of Columbia government.''   The District of Columbia government is thrown in with the Federal  Government. We are talking about U.S. citizens, the people I represent,  who are number one per capita in taxes raised to support the government  of the United States of America.    This bill, of course, is annual, and it is less inclined  to become law than to be part of the annual upcoming march.   We do not intend, Madam Speaker, to let our colleagues get away with  not supporting democracy, including the right of local governments to  spend their own local funds on choice. Everywhere on Earth you can  support such a right, except for the 700,000 people who live in your  own Nation's Capital.                                time  1330
