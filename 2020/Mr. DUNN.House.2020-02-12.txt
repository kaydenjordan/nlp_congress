 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding member of  my staff who has been selected by the Trump administration to be the  oversight counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, Dr. Courtney  Veatch.   Courtney graduated from the University of North Florida and the  Florida State University College of Law in 2015. She has been with my  office for 3 years as a legislative assistant and as general counsel.  She has been an expert on veterans affairs, healthcare, and tax policy,  and she has always served with both grit and grace.   Because of her love for the law and for policy, she also served on  the campaigns of Senator Marco Rubio and Governor Ron DeSantis.   In 2018, I had the honor of swearing her in to the District of  Columbia Bar in this very building.   We are so very proud of all Courtney has accomplished serving the  people of the Second Congressional District of Florida.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Dr. Courtney Veatch and  wishing her luck in all of her future endeavors.                            ____________________
