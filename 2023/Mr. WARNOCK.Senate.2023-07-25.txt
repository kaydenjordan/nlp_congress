 Madam President, today I pay tribute to the  Center for Transportation and the Environment in Atlanta, GA, on their  30th anniversary.   Since 1993, the Center for Transportation and the Environment has  supported the commercialization of clean and zero-emissions  transportation technologies that have driven the development of green  energy economies in Georgia and across the United States. Using its  engineering and planning expertise, the center has helped connect  innovative thinkers, create jobs in emerging sectors, and foster energy  independence over its long and storied history.   Though the Center for Transportation and the Environment calls  Atlanta home, it has an extensive national network and imprint. The  center currently manages 115 zero-emission development and deployment  projects across 35 States. Over the past 30 years, the center has  helped more than 300 U.S. companies move their technologies into the  global energy and transportation mainstream and has supported countless  cities, transit agencies, airports, municipal entities, and vehicle  manufacturers as they adopt these technologies and advance our clean  energy future.   Recently, the Center for Transportation and the Environment offered  its unbiased expertise and insight in support of the development of the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Public Law 117-58, and  resulting Low- and No-Emissions Program at the U.S. Department of  Transportation. Thanks in part to their recommendations, Congress  delivered the largest infrastructure investment in our Nation's history  and advanced bipartisan and transformative low-emissions transportation  policies that will help keep our planet healthy for generations to  come.   On their 30th anniversary, I would like to thank the Center for  Transportation and Environment for their monumental efforts to reduce  emissions in our Nation's transportation sector and their commitment to  being a good steward for our planet. I look forward to working with the  center for another 30 years as we continue to develop green energy  economies in Georgia and across the country.                            ____________________
