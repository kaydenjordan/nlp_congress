 Mr. President, I call up my amendment, No. 483, and I  ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment which  would prevent taxpayer dollars from going toward economic impact  payments for prisoners.   You may not realize it, but the first $1,200 checks we sent went to  every inmate in the United States. And I am thinking: That can't be  right. And I am told it was a drafting error.   Well, then we sent out the last checks, and I said: We have got to  stop this. And I was told that there were those who wished that those  checks go to inmates.   When my constituents hear about that, they think it is a total  example about how Congress is incontinent in spending money.   Now, prisoners do not contribute to the tax base. Taxpayers are  already paying the entirety of their care, and they cannot reasonably  stimulate the economy, and still they are eligible for stimulus checks.   I argue that all spending on COVID relief must be targeted toward  real needs. This is a perfect example of untargeted, inappropriate  spending. I ask that my colleagues support this commonsense amendment.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of Senate  amendment No. 483.   I ask for the yeas and nays.
