 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 246) opposing efforts to delegitimize the State of  Israel and the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement  targeting Israel, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 246         Whereas the democratic, Jewish State of Israel is a key       ally and strategic partner of the United States;        Whereas since Israel's founding in 1948, Congress has       repeatedly expressed our Nation's unwavering commitment to       the security of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state;        Whereas it is a hallmark of American democracy for citizens       to petition the United States Government in favor of or       against United States foreign policy;        Whereas the United States Constitution protects the rights       of United States citizens to articulate political views,       including with respect to the policies of the United States       or foreign governments;        Whereas American policy has long sought to bring peace to       the Middle East and recognized that both the Israeli and       Palestinian people should be able to live in safe and       sovereign states, free from fear and violence, with mutual       recognition;        Whereas support for peace between the Israelis and       Palestinians has long-standing bipartisan support in       Congress;        Whereas it is the long-standing policy of the United States       that a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian       conflict should come through direct negotiations between the       Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with the       support of countries in the region and around the world;        Whereas cooperation between Israel and the United States is       of great importance, especially in the context of rising       anti-Semitism, authoritarianism and security problems in       Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa;        Whereas the Global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions       Movement (BDS Movement) targeting Israel is a campaign that       does not favor a two-state solution and that seeks to  [[Page H7182]]       exclude the State of Israel and the Israeli people from the       economic, cultural, and academic life of the rest of the       world;        Whereas the Global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions       Movement is one of several recent political movements that       undermines the possibility for a negotiated solution to the       Israeli-Palestinian conflict by demanding concessions of one       party alone and encouraging the Palestinians to reject       negotiations in favor of international pressure;        Whereas the founder of the Global BDS Movement, Omar       Barghouti, has denied the right of the Jewish people in their       homeland, saying, ``We oppose a Jewish state in any part of       Palestine. No Palestinian, rational Palestinian, not a sell-      out Palestinian, will ever accept a Jewish state in       Palestine.'';        Whereas the Global BDS Movement targets not only the       Israeli government but also Israeli academic, cultural, and       civil society institutions, as well as individual Israeli       citizens of all political persuasions, religions, and       ethnicities, and in some cases even Jews of other       nationalities who support Israel;        Whereas the Global BDS Movement does not recognize, and       many of its supporters explicitly deny, the right of the       Jewish people to national self-determination;        Whereas university-based Global BDS efforts violate the       core goals of the university and global cultural development,       which thrive on free and open exchange and debate, and in       some cases, leads to the intimidation and harassment of       Jewish students and others who support Israel;        Whereas the Global BDS Movement promotes principles of       collective guilt, mass punishment, and group isolation, which       are destructive of prospects for progress towards peace and a       two-state solution;        Whereas boycotts and similar tools aimed at promoting       racial justice and social change have been used effectively       in the United States, South Africa, and other parts of the       world; and        Whereas in contrast to protest movements that have sought       racial justice and social change, the Global Boycott,       Divestment and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel is not       about promoting coexistence, civil rights, and political       reconciliation but about questioning and undermining the very       legitimacy of the country and its people: Now, therefore, be       it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) opposes the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions       Movement (BDS Movement) targeting Israel, including efforts       to target United States companies that are engaged in       commercial activities that are legal under United States law,       and all efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel;        (2) urges Israelis and Palestinians to return to direct       negotiations as the only way to achieve an end to the       Israeli-Palestinian conflict;        (3) affirms the Constitutional right of United States       citizens to free speech, including the right to protest or       criticize the policies of the United States or foreign       governments;        (4) supports the full implementation of the United States-      Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-296;       128 Stat. 4075) and new efforts to enhance government-wide,       coordinated United States-Israel scientific and technological       cooperation in civilian areas, such as with respect to       energy, water, agriculture, alternative fuel technology,       civilian space technology, and security, in order to counter       the effects of actions to boycott, divest from, or sanction       Israel; and        (5) reaffirms its strong support for a negotiated solution       to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting in two states--      a democratic Jewish State of Israel, and a viable, democratic       Palestinian state--living side-by-side in peace, security,       and mutual recognition.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 246.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking the authors of this resolution,  Mr. Schneider, Mr. Nadler, Mr. Zeldin, and Mrs. Wagner. I am grateful  for their bipartisan leadership.   Mr. Speaker, there are 339 cosponsors of this resolution. Let me say  that again: There are 339 cosponsors for this measure opposing the  global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement that undermines the  legitimacy of the State of Israel.   Support for Israel in Congress is an issue that has been like catnip  for our friends in the press that cover our work. Frankly, this issue  has been politicized in a way that I find ugly and is ultimately  harmful to the U.S.-Israel relationship. It is time that leaders stop  playing politics with our relations with the Jewish state.   When the fog clears, and the bullies on their pulpits end their  tirades, what you see with this measure is a real bipartisan reflection  on how this body regards our country's relationship with and support  for Israel and our opposition to BDS. Almost 80 percent of House  Members are cosponsors, and we are here debating it under suspension of  the rules.   What this resolution says is simple. It says that support for BDS and  support for a two-state solution just aren't compatible. Let me explain  why, and I hope this explanation will also help to address some of the  concerns about this measure.   Opposing BDS isn't about opposing any individual's right to protest  or boycott. The right of any person to express views like that is  enshrined in our Constitution. That sort of free expression is a pillar  of American democracy, and this resolution says so. Let me read from  it:   ``Whereas it is a hallmark of American democracy for citizens to  petition the United States Government in favor of or against United  States foreign policy;   ``Whereas the United States Constitution protects the rights of  United States citizens to articulate political views, including with  respect to the policies of the United States or foreign governments.''   That is in this resolution. It couldn't be any clearer, Mr. Speaker.   Throughout history, protests, boycotts, and movements like that have  played key roles in driving important change. The resolution says that,  too:   ``Whereas boycotts and similar tools aimed at promoting racial  justice and social change have been used effectively in the United  States, South Africa, and other parts of the world.''   But here is the thing about the global BDS movement: I don't believe  it promotes racial justice or social change at all. It promotes a one- sided view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that seeks to  marginalize Israel and that would deny the Jewish people the right of  national self-determination, a right proclaimed by none other than the  United Nations.   Many of us have been fighting for years to advance a future for the  Israelis and Palestinians of two states for two peoples living side by  side in peace and security. Building that future will require hard work  and concessions.   BDS says that the onus is entirely on Israel. All concessions have to  come from Israel, and the Palestinians should reject negotiations and  just allow international pressure to build on Israel.   That is not how negotiations work, and it is no way to promote peace.  That is why this movement is so counterproductive, in my view.   Do you want to criticize a government? That is your right. Do you  want to stop buying products from a certain country? That is also your  right.   But participating in an international commercial effort that  undermines Israel's legitimacy and scuttles the chances of a two-state  solution isn't the same as an individual exercising First Amendment  rights.   I continue to believe that a two-state solution that guarantees self- determination for both Jews and Palestinians--not one or the other--is  the best way to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I believe that  the overwhelming majority of our colleagues in this body agree with me,  and Congress has said so before in bipartisan resolutions.   Today, we have the opportunity to reiterate that point and to warn  against something that would derail that solution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

[[Page H7183]]         I acknowledge that provisions of the resolution fall within       jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space and       Technology under House Rule X, and that your Committee will       forgo action on H.Res. 246 to expedite floor consideration. I       further acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with       respect to the resolution does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in the       measure that fall within your jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       resolution.

The Science Committee will forgo action on H.Res. 246 in       order to expedite floor consideration. This is, however, not       a waiver of future jurisdictional claims by the Science       Committee over this subject matter. Additionally, thank you       for agreeing to include our exchange of letters in the       Congressional Record.

Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.Res. 246, Opposing efforts to       delegitimize the State of Israel and the Global Boycott,       Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel, that       fall within our Rule X jurisdiction.

The Judiciary       Committee has no objection to your including them in the       resolution for consideration on the House floor, and to       expedite that consideration is willing to forgo action on       H.Res. 246, with the understanding that we do not thereby       waive any future jurisdictional claim over those provisions       or their subject matters.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.

Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.Res. 246,       Opposing efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel and the       Global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions targeting Israel.        Because you have been working with the Committee on       Financial Services concerning provisions in H.Res. 246 that       fall within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to forgo formal       consideration of H.Res. 246 so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor. The Committee on Financial       Services takes this action to forego formal consideration of       H.Res. 246 with our mutual understanding that, by foregoing       formal consideration of H.Res. 246 at this time, we do not       waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       this or similar legislation.        Finally, I would request that a copy of our exchange of       letters on this matter be included in the Congressional       Record during floor consideration of H.Res. 246.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                        Chairwoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), who is the author of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), chairman of the Subcommittee on the Middle East,  North Africa, and International Terrorism, and a valued member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Suozzi), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time for the  purpose of closing.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am  really heartened by the outpouring of support we have heard from both  sides of the aisle involving the U.S.-Israel relationship and involving  the unfair BDS movement against Israel.   I thank all the people who have spoken in favor of this resolution-- the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin) and others who have spoken-- because it shows that, when it comes to support for the U.S.-Israel  relationship, there really is no difference between Democrats and  Republicans.   Israel should not be a political football. We support the U.S.-Israel  relationship, and we know that BDS is very destructive, very unfair,  very anti-Jewish, anti-Semitic, and should have no place in the public  spectrum.   I think that this Chamber is getting together. If we look at the  numbers we bring to the floor today, they really speak for themselves.  Almost 80 percent of the House of Representatives has cosponsored this  resolution.   There are Members not just from different sides of the aisle but from  across the entire political spectrum, from one end to the other,  supporting this resolution, saying the BDS movement is unfair, that the  BDS movement singles out Israel, that the BDS movement is really  supported by people who want to see the destruction of the world's only  Jewish state, and that is not something that we can stand idly by and  watch happen.   I have never been prouder of this body--and I have been here for a  while now--than I am tonight. I am proud of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle.   Again, I think the reason why we have that kind of support is clear.  Congress supports the U.S.-Israel relationship. We support a two-state  solution. We support the rights enshrined in the First Amendment.   We know that the global BDS movement threatens the possibility of  future peace between Israelis and Palestinians. It is that simple.   We know that the global BDS movement threatens what is fair. We know  that the global BDS movement is really a fraud. It is a fraud. It is  Israel-hating. It is Jew-hating.   We have had enough of that in the world. Frankly, they should be  ashamed of themselves.   I would like to note that today's resolution is a very powerful  rebuke of the global BDS movement, more powerful than any particular  legislative proposal. What we are saying today, to those who want to  see a peaceful end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, is that the  global BDS movement has no place here.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to support this measure. I urge all Members to  do likewise. Again, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I  have never seen Congress as united as it is on this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1837) to make improvements to certain defense and security  assistance provisions and to authorize assistance for Israel, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1837         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

TITLE II--SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR ISRAEL       SEC. 201. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) On September 14, 2016, the United States and Israel       signed a 10-year Memorandum of Understanding reaffirming the       importance of continuing annual United States military       assistance to Israel and cooperative missile defense programs       in a way that enhances Israel's security and strengthens the       bilateral relationship between the two countries.        (2) The 2016 Memorandum of Understanding reflected United       States support of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grant       assistance to Israel over the 10-year period beginning in       fiscal year 2019 and ending in fiscal year 2028. Such FMF       grant assistance would equal $3.3 billion annually, totaling       $33 billion.        (3) The 2016 Memorandum of Understanding also reflected       United States support for funding for cooperative programs to       develop, produce, and procure missile, rocket and projectile       defense capabilities over a 10-year period beginning in       fiscal year 2019 and ending in fiscal year 2028 at a level of       $500 million annually, totaling $5 billion.       SEC. 202. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to provide assistance       to the Government of Israel in order to help enable Israel to       defend itself by itself and develop long-term capacity,       primarily through the acquisition of advanced capabilities       that are available from the United States.

TITLE IV--BUDGETARY EFFECTS       SEC. 401. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1837.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the United States-Israel  Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security Act.   I want to start by thanking Mr. Deutch and Mr. Wilson for their  extraordinary leadership in crafting this measure. This is another  piece of bipartisan legislation that underscores the vitality and  bipartisanship of the U.S.-Israel relationship.   The centerpiece of this bill is a provision that writes into law the  10-year memorandum of understanding President Obama signed with Israel  before he left office. The legislation also enhances U.S.-Israel  cooperation on a wide range of issues, from helping veterans confront  issues with PTSD, to advancing space cooperation, to developing new  ways to get clean water.   In addition, the bill advances other critical priorities. It helps  ensure that the families of American victims of terrorism will get  their day in court, so they can finally see some justice after their  loved ones were so cruelly taken from them. And it includes a legal fix  that will restore U.S. assistance to Palestinians that has been cut off  in recent months.   When I traveled to the West Bank in May, I saw the impacts of this  funding cut firsthand. I visited a water treatment system in Jericho  that is ready to go into place, already paid for by the United States  but, because of legislation Congress passed last year, they can't take  the tiny extra step needed to get it up and running.   We also met with people seeking to enhance tolerance and  understanding between Palestinians and Israelis, exactly the sort of  peace-building efforts we should be supporting, unlike the BDS  movement. These have all had to stop work due to the assistance cut.   In addition, I met with American military officials who are deeply  concerned about the suspension of security assistance to the  Palestinians and the implications of that for Israel's security. So I  am pleased that the legislation before us today provides a fix for this  unsustainable situation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two pieces that argue that we  must restore this assistance now.                       [From The Hill, Jan. 28, 2019]   Congress Must Move Quickly To Fix the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act                             (By Debra Shushan)         In a perversely ironic turn, a law intended to aid American       victims of international terrorist attacks will strike a       serious blow to counterterrorism cooperation that keeps       Israelis (and Americans visiting Israel) safe.        The Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act (ATCA) will take       effect on February 1. Unless it is adequately amended or       repealed before then, the law will damage Israeli national       security and U.S. foreign policy toward the Israeli-      Palestinian conflict. Time is short, and Congress must take       action.        ATCA was passed with little fanfare, by unanimous consent       in the House and Senate, and apparently absent an       understanding of its foreign policy implications. The law's       aim is to assist American victims of international terrorism       in securing, through U.S. courts, monetary damages from       entities alleged to have aided and abetted terrorist attacks.        It was the outcome of lawsuits against the Palestinian       Authority and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), like       Waldman v. PLO, that drove the most consequential provision       in ATCA. In Waldman, a district court awarded the plaintiff       $655.5 million (triple the damages suffered), only to have a       circuit court rule on appeal that the court lacked personal       jurisdiction over the PLO. To address this perceived flaw,       Section 4 of ATCA stipulates that a defendant consents to       personal jurisdiction if it accepts the types of aid the U.S.       government has given the PA: most importantly, economic       support funds (ESF) and international narcotics control and       law enforcement (INCLE) aid.        Recognizing that future acceptance of U.S. assistance could       bankrupt the Palestinian Authority through litigation,       Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah informed Secretary       of State Mike Pompeo that the Palestinian Authority will       decline U.S. aid when ATCA takes effect. Comparing the $665       million judgement in Waldman (equivalent to 13 percent of the       Palestinian Authority's 2018 budget) to $60 million in       security funding it receives from the U.S., its decision was       obviously inevitable.        So, ATCA will not achieve its purpose of enabling terror       victims to collect money from the Palestinian Authority or       PLO through litigation. Since the Palestinian Authority has       foresworn U.S. aid, courts still won't have personal       jurisdiction over it.        Meanwhile, ATCA will harm Israeli security, given an end to       INCLE funding for the Palestinian Authority and the       termination of the U.S. Security Coordinator. Under U.S.       supervision since 2005, the Palestinian Authority Security       Forces (PASF) have transformed into a professional and       effective entity that works closely with Israel to maintain       law and order in Palestinian cities and foil terrorism.       Israeli security chiefs are unequivocal about the importance       of this security coordination. In remarks, to the Israeli       cabinet earlier this month, outgoing Israeli army chief of       staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot urged the government to       strengthen the PASF. Belatedly, the Israeli government has       weighed in with the Trump administration, asking for an ATCA       fix to preserve security coordination, ``a top priority       Israeli national security interest.''        ATCA will also undermine U.S. foreign policy vis-a-vis the       Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Neither President Trump nor       subsequent presidents will be able to use aid as a tool to       facilitate future Palestinian-Israeli peace. Meanwhile, as       the U.S. Agency for International Development prepares to lay       off local staff and abandon nearly completed infrastructure       projects in the West Bank, the Palestinian people will       suffer. American interests are harmed, too, when worsening       Palestinian quality of life fosters extremism and a hardening       of attitudes toward the U.S. and Israel.        Compounding its deleterious impact, ATCA may apply to       foreign states, impacting allies in the Middle East (think of       Egypt and Jordan) and beyond. It could also apply to       humanitarian NGOs.        Members of Congress are working with the Trump       administration on a fix. A number of options are available.       The best choice is revocation of Section 4, which triggered       this crisis while failing to help terrorist attack victims. A       national security waiver for the President is another       possibility. It is suboptimal since President Trump slashed       ESF funding to Palestinians before ATCA and appears unlikely       to reinstate it, though a future president could. Exempting       only INCLE funding is better than nothing, but would transmit       the message to Palestinians that the U.S. cares only about       Israeli security and not their welfare. (They are       complementary; we must care about both.)        If Congress cannot engineer a fix by January 31--a real       danger, even likelihood--Congress must at minimum delay       ATCA's implementation. This time bomb is ticking, and if  [[Page H7194]]       Congress can't defuse ATCA in time, it must at least reset       the clock.                                   ____                          [From NPR, Jan. 31, 2019]       Opinion: Here's Why U.S. Aid to Palestinians Needs To Continue                    (By Dana Stroul, Daniel B. Shapiro)         Is U.S. assistance to the Palestinians an indulgence we can       do without? Will its elimination leave Israelis, Palestinians       and U.S. interests better off? Unless Congress and the Trump       administration act quickly, we are about to find out.        Since 1993, the United States has provided more than $5       billion in assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This       generous program continued across Republican and Democratic       administrations, with bipartisan Congressional support,       despite ups and downs in the peace process, spikes and drops       in violence and frustrations in Washington and Jerusalem with       Palestinian leaders.        But the whole enterprise is now in jeopardy.        First, the Trump Administration cut the entire fiscal year       2017 economic aid program for the West Bank and Gaza and       looks likely to do the same for fiscal 2018. Now the U.S.       Agency for International Development (USAID) mission, with no       money to spend, is on the verge of closing down, leaving       ongoing projects uncompleted.        Next, the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act, which exposes       the Palestinian Authority to legal action in U.S. courts if       it accepts any U.S. assistance funds, comes into force on       Feb. 1.        The ATCA's passage last year prompted Palestinian Authority       Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah (who resigned Tuesday) to       inform Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a late-December       letter that the Palestinian Authority will no longer accept       any U.S. assistance. If carried out, that will end U.S.       assistance for the Palestinian Authority Security Forces, the       deliberately under-the-radar and largely successful U.S.       effort to develop these forces and facilitate effective       security coordination with Israel in the West Bank.        It will also eliminate the role of the U.S. security       coordinator, a three-star general who oversees the training       of the security forces and serves as a liaison between       Israeli and Palestinian security officials.        Thus far, there has been minimal debate in Washington over       the implications of these developments on stability in the       West Bank and Gaza and the inextricable link to Israel's       security. Nor has there been a sober reckoning of the very       real implications for U.S. influence.        It's easy to be cavalier about these programs, considering       the moribund peace process, Palestinian leaders who lack       legitimacy with much of the U.S. public, and bouts of       violence. But members of Congress, including many of Israel's       strongest supporters on both sides of the aisle, have long       understood their value.        While oversight has been rigorous, funding for Palestinian       assistance programs has always flowed with bipartisan support       because it was determined to reinforce Israel's security and       provide a measure of U.S. leverage and influence.        This logic was ratified by the support of the Israeli       government for these programs. Israeli authorities understood       that a breakdown in security, an economic collapse or a       humanitarian crisis in the West Bank would place an enormous       burden on Israel. A crisis in the West Bank could require the       Israel Defense Forces to redeploy personnel from other high-      risk areas like the Lebanon border or the Golan Heights.        Moreover, U.S. assistance has sustained lines of contact       with Palestinian officials. During flare-ups and crises, this       connective tissue has placed the U.S. in a position to defuse       situations when direct Israeli-Palestinian engagement was too       difficult. U.S. Security Coordinator Lt. Gen. Eric Wendt and       his predecessors have at times been the only American       officials able to bridge both sides in moments of high       tension.        The current funding crisis runs contrary to clearly       expressed Congressional intent. Last year, large bipartisan       majorities passed the Taylor Force Act, which, by withholding       some U.S. aid, aimed to compel the Palestinian Authority to       end, among other things, its practice of providing payments       to families of convicted Palestinian terrorists. But Congress       also voted resoundingly to maintain key elements of       assistance, including humanitarian aid, people-to-people       programs, medical services and other programming with no       direct connection to the Palestinian Authority.        The Israeli government, for its part, was clear in its       support for the Taylor Force Act's intent of ending U.S.       assistance that could even indirectly subsidize the       Palestinian Authority's payments to terrorists' families. But       there was never Israeli support for curtailing the accounts       Congress protected programs acknowledged to maintain a       modicum of stability in the West Bank and prevent a full-      scale humanitarian crisis in either the West Bank or Gaza.        In other words, the Taylor Force Act's passage underscored       bipartisan Congressional support for continuing U.S.       assistance to the Palestinians. Trump officials, who took an       axe to the entire program, citing the Taylor Force Act, have       misinterpreted the meaning of the law.        The Israeli national security establishment remains       painfully aware that it will face the burden--financial,       security, and otherwise--of addressing a full-scale collapse       in the West Bank or Gaza if the U.S. steps away or loses all       influence and credibility with the Palestinians. And if they       lose cooperation with the Palestinian security forces,       Israeli security forces will find themselves in the far worse       position of needing to directly intervene to confront       security threats in Palestinian-populated areas, rather than       working through the U.S.-funded multilateral construct.        If all parties remain stuck on the current course, the       biggest losers will be innocent Palestinian civilians and       Israel. The winners are those benefiting from instability and       the opportunity to point to the U.S. as unreliable and in       retreat from the Middle East: Hamas, other assorted       terrorists and Iran.        To reverse the current course, here are some steps that the       administration and Congress should urgently undertake:                   Fix the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act         A straightforward legislative fix is low-hanging fruit.       Congressional and administration staff recognize that ending       U.S. security assistance to the Palestinian security forces       only helps adversaries and empowers enemies. In recent days,       Israel belatedly added its voice, making clear it wants U.S.       aid to the PASF to continue. In fact, Congress and the       administration should go further and seize the opportunity in       this crisis to permanently protect U.S. security assistance       to the Palestinian security forces.                               Mitigate damage         Walking away from ongoing USAID projects in the West Bank       and Gaza--unfinished roads, incomplete water projects, and       piecemeal humanitarian and education programs--is a total       waste of U.S. taxpayer dollars. Such visible reminders of       U.S. abandonment will also inflame local sentiment against       the United States. Congress should authorize and explicitly       appropriate funds to complete these projects, following a       thorough review of the status of U.S. programs in the West       Bank and Gaza.                    Pass positive legislative alternatives         Even if traditional assistance programs remain blocked,       there are creative legislative proposals that preserve space       for U.S. influence and enjoy bipartisan support. The       Palestinian Partnership Fund Act, introduced in the last       Congress, promotes economic development by connecting       Palestinian entrepreneurs and companies with counterparts in       the U.S., Israel, and the Middle East. An International Fund       for Israeli-Palestinian Peace, long advocated by the       nonpartisan Alliance for Middle East Peace, has enjoyed       bipartisan support in past Congresses and would promote       people-to-people peace-building activities by pooling funding       from government and private sources. Now is the time for       Congress to approve funding for it.                Urge Israeli clarification on U.S. assistance         Members of Congress naturally seek Israel's views on the       security and economic consequences of completely shutting       down U.S. assistance programs to the Palestinians. But during       the Trump administration, the answers have been murky. After       Israel's election in April, Congress should urgently seek a       clear picture of the new government's views, as members       continue to vote on this much-debated set of issues.    Mr. Speaker, this is a strong bipartisan bill that  advances the U.S.-Israel relationship. I, again, want to thank  Representatives Deutch and Wilson for their leadership, as well as all  the other Members who contributed to this fine piece of legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.

There are certain provisions in this legislation that       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1837, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to       forgo action on the bill. However, this is conditional on our       mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill       would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I also request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this Committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the committee       report on H.R. 1837, and into the Congressional Record during       consideration of the measure on the House floor.

Dear Chairman Engel: Thank you for the opportunity to       review the relevant provisions of H.R. 1837, the United       States-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security       Act. While the bill was primarily referred to the Committee       on Foreign Affairs, the Agriculture Committee received an       additional referral.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House in an expeditious manner, and       accordingly, I agree to discharge H.R.1837 from further       consideration by the Committee on Agriculture. I do so with       the understanding that by discharging the bill, the Committee       on Agriculture does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       on this or similar matters. Further, the Committee on       Agriculture reserves the right to seek the appointment of       conferees, if it should be necessary.        I ask that you inset a copy of our exchange of letters into       both the Congressional Record and the Committee Report during       consideration of this measure on the House floor.

Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1837, the United States-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and       Regional Security Act, as amended, which was additionally       referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce.        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 1837, the Committee on Energy and Commerce agrees to       waive formal consideration of the bill as to provisions that       fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce. The Committee takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and that the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. I also request that you support my       request to name members of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce to any conference committee to consider such       provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter in       the report on the bill and into the Congressional Record       during floor consideration of H.R. 1837.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.

Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1837, the United States-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and       Regional Security Act. I appreciate your willingness to work       cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R.       1837 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge       that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill.

Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 1837, the ``United States-      Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security Act,''       that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your       consulting with us on those provisions. The Judiciary       Committee has no objection to your including them in the bill       for consideration on the House floor, and to expedite that       consideration is willing to forgo action on H.R. 1837, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.

Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Engel: I am writing to you concerning H.R. 1837,       the United States-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional       Security Act. As a result of your having consulted with us on       provisions within H.R. 1837 that fall within the jurisdiction       of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I forego further       consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Committee on Veterans' Affairs takes this action with       our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of       H.R. 1837 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and       that our committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so       that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction.       Further, I request your support for the appointment of       conferees from the Committee on Veterans' Affairs during any       House-Senate conference convened on this or related       legislation.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       1837 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor to memorialize our       understanding.

Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1837, the United States-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and       Regional Security Act.

Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: I write to you regarding H.R. 1837,       the ``United States-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and       Regional Security Act.''        H.R. 1837 contains provisions that fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security. I       recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House in an expeditious manner and,       accordingly, I will not seek a sequential referral of the       bill. However, agreeing to waive consideration of this bill       should not be construed as the Committee on Homeland Security       waiving, altering, or otherwise affecting its jurisdiction       over subject matters contained in the bill which fall within       its Rule X jurisdiction.        Further, I request your support for the appointment of       Homeland Security conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this or similar legislation. I also       ask that a copy of this letter and your response be included       in the legislative report on H.R. 1837 and in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.        I look forward to working with you as we prepare to pass       this important legislation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), a valuable member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, author of this important bill, and chairman of the Middle  East, North Africa, and International Terrorism Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   The United States-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional  Security Act is an excellent bipartisan bill designed to further  strengthen the relationship between Israel and the United States, give  American victims their day in court, and restore assistance to the  Palestinians.   I strongly support this bill. I urge all Members to join me in doing  so. Again, this is a bipartisan bill showing, again, the strong support  that the United States and Israel have for each other.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1850) to impose sanctions with respect to foreign support for  Palestinian terrorism, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1850         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 9. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record extraneous material on H.R. 1850.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Mr. Mast of Florida and Mr.  Gottheimer of New Jersey for their hard work on this legislation.   The United States designated both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad  as foreign terrorist organizations more than 20 years ago. It is easy  to see why: Hamas is responsible for the deaths of more than 400  Israelis and at least 25 American citizens. As recently as May of this  year, the group fired hundreds of rockets from Gaza into southern  Israel, including at Israeli civilian areas in Tel Aviv. And  Palestinian Islamic Jihad is taking credit for a number of terrorist  attacks in Israel, including an attack that killed a New Jersey  American student in 1995.   Yet both groups, and particularly Hamas, still get cash from abroad.  These funds are used to build tunnels into Israel and launch rockets at  civilian populations. It is simply disgusting.   No one benefits from terrorism, Mr. Speaker: not Israelis, who just  want to live in peace and security; not Palestinians, who want a state  of their own but are exploited by these terrorists. A Palestinian state  will never be built on the backs of terrorism.   Israel has the right to defend itself. The United States will  continue to support that. In the meantime, we must do everything we can  to prevent the loss of civilian life. That starts with cutting off the  money to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.   This bill would help do just that. It would impose new sanctions on  those who support Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the deep pockets  that are enabling these groups to wage their campaigns of violence.   Of course, we don't want to punish innocent civilians, so this  measure includes an important exception for humanitarian and medical  assistance. This bill is designed to ensure that people in Gaza get  what they need and that Hamas does not.   It is a good, straightforward piece of legislation. I am glad the  House is considering it today, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                      Washington, DC, July 22, 2019.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 1850, the       ``Palestinian International Terrorism Support Prevention Act       of 2019.'' In order to permit the H.R. 1850 to proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor, I agree to forgo formal       consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 1850 with our mutual       understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration of H.R.       1850 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as this or similar legislation moves forward. Our       Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and request       your support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 1850.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, July 22, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1850, Palestinian International Terrorism Support Prevention       Act of 2019. I appreciate your willingness to work       cooperatively on this bill.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on       H.R. 1850 to expedite floor consideration. I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the measure that fall within       your jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on Financial Services conferees during any House-      Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the resolution. I appreciate your       cooperation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  purposes of closing.   Mr. Speaker, let me again thank our ranking member, Mr. McCaul of  Texas, and our colleagues who worked so hard on this good, bipartisan  measure. I want to thank Mr. Mast, for whom I have enormous respect,  and I thank Mr. Smith, who is always there fighting the good fight and  always consistent in saying what he believes.   Let me just say, the actions of Hamas, of the Palestinian Islamic  Jihad, are a constant danger to innocent Israelis and innocent  Palestinians. They are also a terrible roadblock that stand in the way  of Israelis and Palestinians ever finding peace.   These terrorist groups don't want peace. They know that their violent  tactics will never contribute to a peaceful resolution. They want to  see Israel wiped off the map, plain and simple.   We need to crack down on them and we need to crack down on those who  stand behind them in the shadows quietly fueling their violence that  they carry out.   This bill would give us more tools to cut off the flow of resources,  and that is why it is so important.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to support this bill and I urge all Members  to do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 358) calling on the Government of Cameroon and  armed groups to respect the human rights of all Cameroonian citizens,  to end all violence, and to pursue a broad-based dialogue without  preconditions to resolve the conflict in the Northwest and Southwest  regions.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 358         Whereas many Anglophone Cameroonians have long felt       marginalized by official actions and policies of the       Government of Cameroon, including the abolishment of a       federal form of government, which was the constitutional       basis under which English-speaking Southern Cameroons entered       into the union, and replacing it with a unitary state       dominated by the Francophone majority;        Whereas, beginning in late 2016, protests organized by       lawyers, teachers, and students were violently repressed by       the Government of Cameroon, leading to numerous deaths and       imprisonments, including of journalists, teachers, lawyers,       and an Anglophone judge on the country's Supreme Court;        Whereas the conflict escalated in late September and early       October 2017, when Cameroonian security forces brutally       cracked down on peaceful Anglophone civilian demonstrators,       resulting in dozens of deaths and leaving over 100 injured;        Whereas, in 2017, separatists launched a campaign to       pressure school officials in the Northwest and Southwest       Anglophone regions to go on strike as part of a boycott       against the Government of Cameroon, and reportedly began       burning school buildings, threatening education officials       with violence if they did not comply with a boycott, and       kidnapping for ransom children and teachers who defied the       boycott;        Whereas numerous human rights monitors have documented       armed separatists killing traditional leaders and targeting       civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, who       are perceived to be supporting or working with the Government       of Cameroon, and reports indicate that armed separatists have       killed scores of security force personnel;        Whereas the security forces of the Government of Cameroon       have attacked medical facilities and health workers in the       Northwest and Southwest regions;        Whereas numerous credible reports from human rights       monitors, including the United Nations High Commissioner for       Human Rights, have documented the excessive use of force by       government security forces against Cameroonian civilians       living in the Anglophone regions, including the burning of       villages, the use of live ammunition against protestors,       arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, sexual abuse, and       killing of civilians, including women, children, and the       elderly;        Whereas the Department of State has expressed serious       concern over the manner in which the government has used       force to unlawfully restrict the rights to free expression       and peaceful protest that are protected under the Cameroonian       Constitution and international law;        Whereas the government has charged journalists, social       activists, and members of political opposition parties with       terrorism-related crimes and prosecuted them in military       tribunals;        Whereas the Government of Cameroon arrested opposition       leader Maurice Kamto and roughly 150 members of the Cameroon       Renaissance Movement party following peaceful protests on       January 26, 2019, charging them with crimes that could result       in the death penalty and handling their cases at the Military       Tribunal even though they are civilians;        Whereas the Government of Cameroon continued to place bans       on Cameroon Renaissance Movement's attempts to hold peaceful       protests, and civil society reported that security forces       interfered with MRC registration processes in Yaounde,       Douala, and Bafoussam in February 2019;        Whereas the Government of Cameroon has repeatedly       restricted freedoms of expression by shutting down the       internet, harassing and detaining journalists, refusing       licenses to independent media, and intensifying political       attacks against the independent press;        Whereas the United Nations Office for the Coordination of       Humanitarian Affairs stated in April 2019 that more than       530,000 people were internally displaced in areas affected by       the Anglophone conflict;        Whereas the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner       for Refugees reports that more than 32,000 Cameroonian       refugees have registered in Nigeria;        Whereas the Department of State has expressly called on the       Government of Cameroon to respect the rights, including the       right to due process, of 47 Cameroonians forcibly returned in       January 2018 from Nigerian custody to Cameroonian       authorities, many of whom had reportedly submitted asylum       claims in Nigeria; and        Whereas ten of the 47 Cameroonians forcibly returned from       Nigeria now face charges before a military court punishable       by the death penalty, while the other thirty-seven reportedly       remain in detention without charge: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) strongly condemns the abuses committed in Cameroon's       Anglophone regions by the Government of Cameroon security       forces and armed groups, including extrajudicial killings and       detentions, the use of force against nonviolent civilians and       protestors, and violations of the freedoms of press,       expression, and assembly;        (2) affirms that the United States continues to hold the       Government of Cameroon responsible for upholding the rights       of all citizens, regardless of political views or beliefs or       the regions in which they reside, in accordance with       Cameroon's international obligations and Cameroon's own       Constitution;        (3) urges all parties, including political opposition       groups, to exercise restraint and to ensure that protests       remain peaceful;        (4) urges the Government of Cameroon to--        (A) initiate broad-based dialogue without preconditions and       make a credible, full faith effort to work with religious and       community leaders in the Anglophone region to address       grievances and seek nonviolent solutions to resolve conflict       and constitutional reforms that would protect minority       concerns, such as reconstituting a Federal system;        (B) follow through on the initiatives developed to address       grievances, including the Commission of Bilingualism and       Multiculturalism, the Ministry of Decentralization, and the       National Commission for Disarmament, Demobilization,       Reintegration, that currently offer no visible evidence of       having played a constructive role in resolving the crisis;        (C) respect the fundamental rights of all Cameroonian       citizens, including political activists and journalists;        (D) ensure that any security operations are conducted in       accordance with international human rights standards,       including efforts to ensure security forces only use force       under appropriate circumstances;        (E) transparently investigate all allegations of human       rights violations committed in the Anglophone regions and       take the necessary measures to prevent arbitrary detention,       torture, enforced disappearances, deaths in custody, and       inhumane prison conditions;        (F) promptly charge or release all those detained in the       context of the Anglophone crisis, including the Cameroonians       forcibly returned from Nigeria, and ensure that any future       detainees are treated with due process, in line with       Cameroon's penal code;        (G) allow unfettered access to humanitarian and health care       workers in accordance with humanitarian principles of       humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence;        (H) release the leaders and members of the Cameroon       Renaissance Movement party who were arrested following their       peaceful protests, and ensure that this party, like others,       can participate unfettered in upcoming municipal,       parliamentary, and regional elections;        (I) release human rights defenders, civil society       activists, political prisoners, journalists, trade unionists,       teachers, and any other citizens who have been arbitrarily       arrested and detained without trial or charge;        (J) ensure that detainees are treated fairly and humanely,       with proper judicial proceedings, including a registry of       those detained by the Cameroonian security forces, and with       full access to legal resources; and        (K) ensure that Cameroon's antiterrorism legislation is       used only to prosecute offenses that would be considered acts       of terrorism under international legal standards, and cease       to use this legislation to sanction activities that are       protected by national and international guarantees of freedom       of expression, peaceful assembly, and association with       others; and        (5) urges the separatist groups to--        (A) engage with Cameroonian government officials, as well       as civil society and religious leaders, in a broad-based       dialogue without preconditions to peacefully express       grievances and credibly engage in nonviolent efforts to       resolve the conflict;        (B) immediately stop committing human rights abuses,       including killings of civilians, use of child soldiers,       torture, kidnapping, and extortion;        (C) end the school boycott immediately and cease attacks on       schools, teachers, and education officials, and allow for the       safe return of all students to class;        (D) end incitement to violence and hate speech on the part       of the diaspora; and        (E) immediately release all civilians illegally detained or       kidnapped in the Anglophone Northwest and Southwest regions.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 358.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   I want to start by thanking Ms. Bass and Mr. Smith for bringing  forward this resolution, which calls on the Government of Cameroon and  armed groups to respect the human rights of all Cameroonian citizens,  to end all violence, and to pursue a broad-based dialogue without  preconditions to resolve the conflict in the anglophone regions of  Cameroon.   Since October 2017, the region has been mired in conflict, with both  the Government of Cameroon and armed separatists fighting one another  and perpetrating human rights abuses.   While armed actors refuse to pursue a negotiated settlement to the  conflict, innocent civilians continue to suffer. According to UNICEF,  more than 80 percent of the schools in the anglophone regions of  Cameroon remain closed, putting at risk the future prospects of  children who are being denied access to education. In addition, 1.3  million people, including approximately 650,000 children, are in need  of humanitarian assistance.   This resolution urges the Government of Cameroon to respect the  fundamental rights of all Cameroonian citizens and follow through on  initiatives developed to address grievances in the anglophone region.  It also urges separatist groups to engage with Cameroonian government  officials, civil society, and religious leaders to express grievances  and engage in efforts to resolve the conflict and to stop committing  human rights abuses and inciting violence.   For several months, the Swiss Government has been attempting to  mediate a peaceful resolution to this crisis, and I am pleased this  resolution demonstrates Congress' strong support for a negotiated  settlement.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to support this resolution, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Ms. Bass and Mr. Smith for their  hard work. Again, as I mentioned before, Mr. Smith is always working  very, very hard to be on the side of justice.   For too long, the people in Cameroon's anglophone region have been  marginalized by the Cameroonian Government, and since 2017, conflict  between the government and separatists have brought chaos and fear to  those living in the region.   This resolution supports a negotiated settlement to the conflict that  respects the basic human rights of its citizens, so Cameroon can become  a country that is more peaceful and stable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this  bipartisan piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
