 Madam Speaker, I rise today to declare my community's  unshakable support for the State of Israel.   Israel has been under constant fire for over a week by Hamas, which  is a terrorist organization supported by Iran. Over 3,100 rockets have  been fired, 10 Israelis have been killed, and millions more would be at  risk if not for the Iron Dome missile defense system protecting its  citizens.   Make no mistake, Hamas is not interested in peace. Their goal is to  destroy the Jewish State of Israel.   Hamas uses children as human shields and pays the terrorists'  families for life.   Hamas launches the attacks but tries to paint Israel as the  aggressor. At the same time, cynics or opportunists are taking  advantage of this violent wave of terrorism to peddle anti-Semitic  hate.   I am proud to stand for Israel, the only democratic country in the  Middle East and its right to defend itself.                            ____________________
