 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   I think it is important to point out that when you talk about  civilian control, General Mattis is, in fact, a civilian. He is not in  command of any Marine divisions right now. I don't think prior military  service should be held against him when he has the ability to offer  additional service to the country.   I hear this argument that: Well, he is a retired general, he is  subject to the UCMJ. That is not an argument that has much merit. If  that were the case, you couldn't have retired military officers serve  in the Congress. If they were still considered military officers, it  would violate the incompatibility clause of the Constitution.   Now, this 7-year statutory restriction, I think it is understandable,  but I don't think it is in any way sacrosanct. If you go back to the  founding of our country, a 7-year restriction would have prevented  George Washington from being the first civilian commander in chief  because he had resigned his commission in 1784, he took  [[Page H528]]  the oath of office as our first President in 1789. Nobody was under any  illusions that he was a civilian, and he was somebody who was revered.   Now, it is true the Founders feared the civil being subordinate to  the military, but that is because they thought Republican government  could be overrun by a military junta. We don't have that danger here.  We have a civilian President of the United States, a civilian Congress  that is charged under the Constitution with providing and maintaining  our Navy, with raising and supporting our armies, and prescribing rules  for the regulation of the Armed Forces, and we will have Jim Mattis,  who is a civilian, as a Secretary of Defense.   This man, Jim Mattis, has been a faithful servant to our country. He  is also a strategic thinker, who I think can do a great job in  rebuilding our military and getting our national security policy on a  firmer, stronger foundation.
