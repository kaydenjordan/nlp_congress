 Madam Speaker, I rise today to draw  attention to an ongoing epidemic that is plaguing most communities  across the Nation. I am talking about the opioid crisis.   Far too many people have fallen victim to opioid abuse, and the  statistics in Pennsylvania are frightening. In the most recent data  from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is reported  that 5,388 people died from drug overdose in 2017, many of them from  opioid abuse.   Addiction does not discriminate. It does not see race, gender, or  socioeconomic status. There is not a community in our Nation that  hasn't been impacted by opioid addiction in some way.   Before my time in Congress, I spent 28 years as a therapist and  rehabilitation services manager. I have seen firsthand how addiction  impacts families and our communities.   September is Recovery Month, and it is an opportunity to increase  awareness and understanding of substance abuse disorders.   To celebrate those who are helping combat the opioid crisis and those  who are on the road to recovery, Clarion County recently celebrated  Recovery Month by honoring first responders who have made an impact on  the community.   Together, John Greenway, Farrah Murray, and Bridget Murray have saved  38 lives by delivering naloxone, the medication that counters the  effects of opioid overdose.   At the award ceremony, Clarion resident Dustin Parsons told his story  about his struggle with addiction, noting the help he received from the  AICDAC, the Armstrong Indiana Clarion Drug and Alcohol Commission.   Dustin said: ``During the last few years of my addiction, I was in a  position where I could meet the AICDAC. They helped me get a lot of  resources. I want to give back to the community. I try to convince  other people that there is a way out of this.''   The AICDAC works to prevent addiction and treat those who have fallen  victim to opioid abuse, and they are the recent recipient of a $1  million grant from the Department of Health and Human Services.  [[Page H7994]]    These funds will ensure the region will have substance abuse  prevention, intervention, and treatment services, especially when it  comes to combating the opioid crisis affecting our communities.    The grant is being used to expand the commission's Addiction Recovery  Mobile Outreach Team that services the three area hospitals to provide  treatment and recovery 24/7.   Kami Anderson, Executive Director of AICDAC, said: ``The commission  will continue its work with county overdose task forces which are  committed to reducing and eliminating the number of fatal opioid  overdoses in the three-county area.''   Recovery is incredibly important. The care the therapists, first  responders, doctors, and addiction specialists provide can, in many  cases, be the difference between life and death, but we must not  overlook the critical importance of prevention efforts.   Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced $1.8 billion  to help States combat the opioid crisis. It is my hope that this will  be a step in the right direction in healing and to rid this Nation of  this health crisis.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  September as National Literacy Month.   Reading is a fundamental part of learning and expanding our knowledge  of the world around us. It is especially important to form strong  reading habits in childhood that we can carry with us throughout our  adult lives.   Parents, educators, and the local community can all play a role in  encouraging young people to pick up a book and to exercise their  imaginations.   A great resource that schools, museums, and public libraries can take  advantage of is the Library of Congress' Surplus Book Program. This  initiative offers surplus books of all kinds and for all ages to  organizations and institutions nationwide to help build their book  collections, and I encourage those interested to visit the library's  website for more information.   Mr. Speaker, reading at a young age is important, but a passion for  books can form at any stage of life.   During National Literacy Month, let's all pick up a new book and  share the reading experience with the children in our lives.                            ____________________
