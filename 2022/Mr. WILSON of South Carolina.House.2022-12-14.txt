 Mr. Speaker, congratulations to  congressional foreign policy adviser Stephanie Pendarvis and her  husband, Julian Hunter Pendarvis, on the birth of their first child, a  boy.   Julian Biddle Pendarvis was born at 2:03 a.m. on Wednesday, December  7, 2022, at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He weighed 5  pounds, 10.5 ounces, and measured 18.75 inches long.   Stephanie has long been a valued member of the congressional team and  has not only been instrumental in getting important policy legislation  through the House but a positive influence on the staff and those  around her. I know she and her husband will pass those fine qualities  to baby Julian.   Additionally, I offer congratulations to the extended Biddle and  Pendarvis families on the newest addition to their team.   In conclusion, God bless Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  Putin's Iranian drones attacked yesterday the key district I visited  Saturday on a codel. Fortunately, the people of Ukraine have destroyed  in the last week 85 percent of Putin's missiles and drones.                            ____________________
