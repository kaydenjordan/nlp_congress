 Madam President, I rise in strong support of the  nomination of Julie Su to be Deputy Secretary of the Department of  Labor.   The U.S. Department of Labor is an important Federal Agency, but  amidst a global pandemic that has left millions of Americans out of  work, the Department's mission takes on outsized importance. The  Department needs leadership with deep experience, knowledge, and a  demonstrated ability to successfully lead an organization.   Just as importantly, the Department needs leadership with an  understanding of the unique challenges of this moment. As we are seeing  with President Biden, leadership does make a difference. At this  critical time in our Nation's economic recovery, we must ensure the  President has the team he needs to move our country forward. Julie Su  is a key member of that team. She is a highly qualified and proven  leader.   As California's secretary of labor and workforce development,  Secretary Su oversees and protects the workforce for the State of  California, the fifth largest economy in the world. When you add her  work as an attorney and a nonprofit executive, she brings a wide mix of  experience to the table. Coupled with a collaborative work style that  gives everyone a seat at the table, Secretary Su has not only delivered  on her agency's mission but has also improved and transformed her  agency.   Her success and effectiveness is best summed up in the words of her  own staff at the agency she has led for more than 7 years:         During Ms. Su's seven years as California Labor       Commissioner, she remade the agency in ways that many would       have thought impossible.        She increased efficiency throughout the division and broke       down departmental silos that had stifled effective       collaboration and caused redundancy.        Moreover, under her leadership, the Labor Commissioner's       office reworked its investigative bureau into a cutting edge       labor enforcement team that dug deep into complex cases that       the Labor Commissioner's office had been previously       unequipped to handle.        Complex, high quality investigations that had previously       been rare--if not unthinkable--became standard operating       procedure.    Secretary Su is an excellent manager. Not only does she deliver  results, she invests in her own staff by providing them with the  resources and environment they need to get the job done. She builds  diverse teams and then empowers them to do their best work--all while  knowing who they are. I mean this literally.   Again, in the words of her staff:         She was legendary for having learned the names of every one       of the more than 600 staff within the Labor Commissioner's       office, from secretarial support staff to investigators,       deputies, and legal staff.    Julie Su will also bring diverse life experiences to the Department.  She is the daughter of Chinese immigrants. Her immigrant background  shaped Secretary Su personally and professionally. Her own lived  experience offered her insight into how segments of our economy leave  people behind or even exclude them from experiencing the benefits of  economic growth and opportunities.   Her professional career reflects this life lesson as she has  established a long and distinguished record of fighting for  [[Page S4843]]  worker rights and civil rights. From defending the rights of Thai  garment workers to protecting low-wage workers against abuses,  Secretary Su has worked tirelessly to help people and communities that  might not otherwise have access to justice. This sense of fairness and  the desire to fight injustice will be critical for the Department of  Labor, particularly as the Department works to address the pandemic's  disproportionate impact on women and minorities.   Given her proven track record and commitment to worker and fair labor  rights, I have every confidence that Secretary Su will protect all  sectors of our workforce and will work to lift everyone from this  pandemic. Moreover, her experience in managing labor policy at the  executive level for the State of California over the last decade will  enable Secretary Su to hit the ground running immediately after she is  confirmed.   In particular, through the COVID-19 pandemic, Secretary Su has dealt  with the overwhelming demand for assistance from workers who are  suffering or who are unemployed. She has helped her State combat the  organized crime attacks and employment fraud that have affected all 50  States, including, of course, California, with its large economy. She  has worked to address systemic shortcomings that bad actors have  exploited during this pandemic. Secretary Su led an effort to stop  fraudulent actors from taking advantage of the unemployment system,  dating back to the beginning of the pandemic, and the State of  California has already begun prosecuting these offenders. The U.S.  Department of Labor ultimately advised all States to take the same  steps Secretary Su took in order to cut down on fraudulent claims.   Despite the many challenges brought on by the pandemic, Secretary Su  has never lost sight of her ultimate goal: to provide millions of  workers access to unemployment benefits and other assistance. In these  economic times, Secretary Su's leadership skills and proven track  record of experience and effectiveness are just what we need.   Her nomination also proves something I believe deeply: When you look  for the most qualified person, you get diversity, and when you  prioritize diversity, you get the most qualified people--people who  reflect all of America and who are able to serve all of America.   Secretary Su's nomination is supported by many who see their stories  reflected in hers, including labor leaders from the AFL-CIO and SEIU,  business leaders from the Small Business Majority, and civil rights  leaders from the National Women's Law Center and the National  Employment Law Project.   Secretary Su will be an outstanding Deputy Secretary of Labor. I am  proud to support her nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   I yield the floor
