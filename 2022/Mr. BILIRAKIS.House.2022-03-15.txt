 Madam Speaker, inflation hit 7.9 percent in February.  Inflation hurts all Americans, especially seniors and those living on a  fixed income.   During each of my recent townhall meetings and surveys, Madam  Speaker, my constituents have consistently pleaded for the pain to  stop. Unfortunately, inflation has gone up every month of Joe Biden's  Presidency.   Americans are smart. They know this is not a fluke or the result of  the tragedy that is occurring in Ukraine. It is a direct consequence of  liberal policies and fueled by reckless government spending. My  constituents have said they simply can't afford to keep paying more for  everything, which is one of the main reasons I was compelled to vote  ``no'' on last week's $1.5 trillion spending package. While there were  individual provisions I supported, I am worried that more massive  government spending will only worsen their plight. I can't, in good  conscience, contribute to their pain.                          Celebrating Dennis Kappas     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Dionysios,  otherwise known as Dennis, Kappas, an outstanding member of the Tarpon  Springs community.   Dennis was born in Zakynthos, Greece, a beautiful island, but  migrated to the United States after a devastating earthquake destroyed  his island.   Dennis and his family landed in Detroit, where he was a hardworking  new immigrant. He worked diligently at restaurants by day and learned  English by night.   Through years of blood, sweat, and tears, as is common with the  immigrant story, Dennis and his brother saved enough money to buy their  own restaurant, living the American Dream.   In 1990, Dennis moved to Tarpon Springs, Florida, where he settled  with his family and owned and operated Plaka restaurant, the best gyros  and souvlaki on the Sponge Docks.   In addition to running Plaka and many other business ventures, Dennis  has been a generous philanthropist and has made significant  contributions to the centerpiece of Tarpon Springs, St. Nicholas Greek  Orthodox Cathedral. He is donating the contents of his home chapel,  including beautiful and one-of-a-kind icons, to the new church annex,  which contains the newly opened and appropriately named St. Dionysios  Chapel.   I am proud to call him a friend and thank him for all his meaningful  contributions to our wonderful community.   Axios. He is worthy, Madam Speaker.                            ____________________
