 Mr. Speaker, I am in support of this bill, and I think  everybody should be in support of it.   It simply says that each State will recognize the other States'  marriages and not deny a person the right to marry based on race,  gender, or sexual orientation. It urges the Federal Government to do  the same thing.   As far as what the Supreme Court said, that we should listen to this  and listen to that, the Senate listened to Gorsuch and Kavanaugh when  they said that Roe v. Wade is precedent. Do you want to listen to them?   Alito, when he was confirmed, said that Roe v. Wade is important  precedent. Do you want to listen to him?   Listen to Thomas, who told you that we need to look at these cases,  and we need to reconsider them. That is gay marriage. He didn't mention  interracial, but it is on the same theory. Of course, he is involved in  an interracial marriage. He wouldn't be married to justice Ginni but  for the Loving decision. He mentioned the other case of Lawrence.   We need to be concerned. This bill is an American bill. Everybody  should be for it. The only reason to be against it is because you  really don't want to go on record of being in favor of those rights  that have been extended to Americans and that are potentially in  jeopardy.
