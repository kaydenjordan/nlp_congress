 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Walker), my friend, for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership on  this very important piece of legislation. And I also thank the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), my colleague, for her  leadership on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the FUTURE Act. This  bipartisan bill would extend mandatory funding under title 3 of the  Higher Education Act to HBCUs around the country.   HBCUs play a vital role in expanding opportunity to students in North  Carolina, especially in my district, where I am fortunate to represent  three of them: Bennett College, North Carolina A&T, and Livingstone  College.   Now, a recent report I came across found that HBCUs generate $1.7  billion in Federal economic impact in North Carolina. This figure  includes direct spending on faculty, academic programs, and by the  students directly attending these institutions.  [[Page H7737]]    HBCUs are an engine of economic growth in our communities because  they expand the economic playing field to students from every  background. Our economy works best when everyone has a shot at success.   As current funding to HBCUs is set to expire on September 30, it is  critical that this legislation makes it across the finish line and onto  the President's desk.                                time  1730    The FUTURE Act would provide funding to more than 100 HBCUs across 19  different States. It will allow universities and their students to  continue down the pathway to success. In my view, having healthy HBCUs  is critical for our State's economic future.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends again for their leadership on this  bill.
