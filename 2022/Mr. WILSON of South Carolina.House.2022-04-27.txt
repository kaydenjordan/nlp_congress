 Madam Speaker, we appreciate your  million-dollar smile.   Living legend Sean Hannity of FOX News is now officially the longest  running prime-time cable news host in television history, passing the  former record of Larry King.   I especially appreciate his professionalism, having myself minored in  journalism and being editor of my high school, college, and law school  newspapers, and also being an intern reporter for The Post and Courier,  the daily paper of Charleston, South Carolina.   He is a champion for freedom, and he cites each day that has passed  in honor of the 13 dead Americans in Kabul. He also points out, sadly,  the Americans left behind in Afghanistan.   He stands with the heroes of Ukraine fighting war criminal Putin as  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy inspires: Live free or die.   As aptly written in an April 21 FOX News story by Brian Flood:  ``Hannity, who has been with the network since it was launched in 1996,  has hosted a prime-time program on FOX News for 25 consecutive years, 6  months, and 15 days.    `` `Sean's authenticity and insightful commentary have created one of  the most enduring connections with our audience, and it has been an  honor to watch him over the years. A FOX News original, he has helped  innovate the industry, and we are incredibly proud of his extraordinary  success,' FOX News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said in a statement.   ``Hannity's eponymous program has been one of the most-watched cable  news programs on a regular basis. `Hannity' has finished number one in  its time slot for 13 consecutive years among both total viewers and the  advertiser-coveted demographic of adults age 25 to 54 since launching  as a solo hour in January 2009, according to Nielsen Media Research.   `` `I am extremely grateful to FOX News Media and to our loyal,  dedicated viewers, whom I am proud to serve every night,' Hannity said.   ``Before landing a solo program, Hannity was one half of the popular  `Hannity & Colmes' with the late Alan Colmes.   ``Last year, Hannity joined `FOX & Friends' to discuss the network's  25th  [[Page H4518]]  anniversary. `It was a bold innovation. Everybody laughed. Nobody  thought it would be successful. Not only did we quickly become number  one, but we have been able to maintain that number one position for a  very long period of time,' Sean Hannity said.   ``FOX News finished the first quarter of 2022 as basic cable's most- watched network, crushing CNN and MSNBC for the 81st straight quarter  during a busy news cycle that included Russia's'' hideous ``invasion of  Ukraine,'' sadly, ``the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and round-the- clock political news.''   ``Over the last 25 years, Hannity has interviewed newsmakers,  including former President Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence,  former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . . . and most recently,  award-winning actor and director Sean Penn. Hannity is also the author  of four New York Times bestselling books.''   Congratulations, Sean. Thank you for providing America with news we  can trust by telling the truth.   I have another personal interest. Our family really appreciates  newscasters. My oldest son, Alan, the attorney general of South  Carolina, married the leading newscaster of South Carolina, Jennifer  Miskewicz, of WIS-TV. Because he married over his head, he was elected  the youngest attorney general of the United States.   As I conclude, as the co-chair of the French Caucus, I congratulate  President Emmanuel Macron on his reelection. America appreciates our  first ally with extraordinary representation by Ambassador Philippe  Etienne.   We stand together for the people of Ukraine and with President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Ukraine President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy has shown the world he is a leader to be respected  and admired. He has earned being a hero to the people of Ukraine, to  win for freedom.   Prior to his election in 2019, Mr. Zelenskyy was a former actor and  comedian. Some questioned these credentials, but President Zelenskyy is  the right leader at the right time for the world.   The cowardly Putin invasion has left untold thousands of Ukrainian  civilians murdered. Yet, instead of retreating, Zelenskyy has stood up  to Putin as a compassionate man of the people.   Just yesterday, he went to another Kyiv hospital visiting with a pair  of orphaned children who lost their parents to Putin bombs.   ``In the first days of the war, everybody was in shock, and everybody  was thinking what to do. . . .'' ``The President's decision was that no  one goes anywhere. We stay in Kyiv, and we fight. That cemented it,''  explained an adviser.   Terrorists, sadly, are emboldened worldwide with three rocket attacks  in the last week from Gaza into Israel, as America stands with  Ambassador Michael Herzog.   God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. God bless Volodymyr Zelenskyy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to be here with Congressman Dean Phillips  as we work together, unintentionally united by war criminal Putin, as  Democrats and Republicans are united for freedom.   Mr. Speaker, on December 28, 2018, U.S. citizen Paul Whelan was  arrested in Moscow. On June 15, 2020, he was sentenced to 16 years in a  Putin labor camp. He remains behind bars to this day for a crime he did  not commit. No real evidence of Paul's guilt was ever provided, defense  witnesses were excluded, and he was denied a fair trial.   U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan described Paul's wrongful conviction  exactly right--a mockery of justice. Paul is an American and a U.S.  Marine Corps veteran. The U.S. Congress cannot remain silent as Paul  remains unjustly held by the thug in the Kremlin.   The resolution we are considering today shows we have not forgotten-- and will never forget--Paul or any other American wrongfully detained  in Russia.   I was thrilled and relieved today to learn that Trevor Reed has been  released from his unjust detention in Russia. Trevor, another former  U.S. Marine, had spent years behind bars on completely fabricated  charges.   However, we cannot rest until Paul and every single wrongfully  detained American is home safely with their families as well.   As it launched its full-scale murderous invasion of Ukraine, the  Putin regime has stepped up its reprehensible practice of targeting  Americans for unfounded detentions. In February, Brittney Griner, a  WNBA--that is the Women's National Basketball Association--player was  arrested for allegedly bringing drugs into Russia. She faces up to 10  years in prison, if convicted. I fear she too will be held hostage by  the Russian dictator. I appreciate her Member of Congress, Sheila  Jackson Lee of Houston, for being such an outspoken proponent for her  release.   I would be remiss not to mention Vladimir Kara-Murza too. He is one  of the fiercest advocates of a democratic Russia, who has been poisoned  twice by the Putin regime, and who faces up to 15 years in prison for  speaking the truth about Putin's unprovoked war of aggression and  murder in Ukraine. He is a brave freedom fighter who does not deserve  to be locked up for shining a light on Putin's brutality and  corruption.   Putin must stop using innocent Americans as diplomatic pawns and  release them immediately.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution so Paul  and his family know that the U.S. Congress stands with them, Democrats  and Republicans, and will do everything in our power to make sure Paul  can join Trevor in coming back home.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Representative Haley Stevens for her  work on this resolution. You can tell it is from the heart, and we are  working together, again, Republicans and Democrats.   How fortunate we are, with the leadership of Congressman Tim Walberg,  to have spent the Orthodox Christian Easter weekend in Ukraine to visit  with Lviv, to be in Kiev, to be in the Bucha region where the  atrocities were so horrific, and to be on a delegation with  Congresswoman Victoria Spartz, who was actually born in Soviet Ukraine,  and now she has seen it become a free Ukraine. Our country is so  blessed by the number of Ukrainians who have come to live in our  country and then support their maintenance, victory, and winning for  freedom in Ukraine.   As the world watches in horror at the war crimes and atrocities that  the war criminal Putin is committing in Ukraine, we must also condemn  the Russian dictator's practice of exploiting innocent Americans as  political pawns.   I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this resolution. This will  send a strong message to Paul and the other wrongfully detained  Americans in Russia that Congress will not rest until they are returned  home to their families.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the AXIS Act, A-X-I-S, a bill that  is to require the Department of State to report on China's support of  Putin's unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Communist Party is complicit in Russia's  crimes against the people of Ukraine.   Xi and Putin established a no-limits partnership with their joint  statement that foolishly cast NATO as an aggressor. They coordinated  the timing of the invasion to avoid disturbing the CCP's genocide  Olympics. The Chinese state media has regurgitated Russian propaganda,  and instead of joining the world in sanctioning Putin, the CCP is  working with Putin to avoid sanctions.                                time  1300    We are already seeing the results of this unholy alliance between the  two dictators, and it is essential that CCP support of the Russian  invasion of Ukraine become a matter of public record.   I thank our colleague from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) for introducing the  AXIS Act. This bill requires an unclassified report on the full scope  of CCP support of the Putin invasion, from sanctions violations, to  disinformation, to the sale of controlled technology.   If the United States is going to counter the national security threat  of this new axis of autocrats working together, we must understand how  they are working together in the conflict between autocrats, which are  ruled by gun, against democracy, which is ruled by law.   Mr. Barr's bill fills this need. I thank the gentleman for  introducing the AXIS Act, and I urge our colleagues to support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I especially appreciate the people of China. My father  served in 1944 as a member of the Flying Tigers, the 14th Air Force of  the Army Air Corps of the United States, to defend the people of China  in World War II. He served in Kunming, Chengdu, and Xi'an, and he had a  deep affection for the people of China. We want the best for the people  of China.    Sadly, at every step of Russia's unprovoked, full-scale invasion of  Ukraine, the CCP has chosen to reject the free world and embrace  Putin's mass murder. Just last week, one of the CCP's top Foreign  Ministry officials promised to increase strategic coordination with  Russia, regardless of Russia's war crimes. But we know that Ukraine  will win with the leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.   They need to be held accountable at the CCP, and Congressman   Andy  Barr's legislation does just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Protecting Semiconductor  Supply Chain Materials from Authoritarians Act.   H.R. 7372 would set up a high-level interagency task force to make  sure that we have a whole-of-government effort to anticipate and  respond to the impacts on the supply chain for semiconductors.   The semiconductor supply chain has long been under strain, which has  only been exacerbated by the COVID pandemic. On top of that, the war  criminal Putin's invasion of Ukraine has only added to the problem. It  has interrupted critical inputs into the semiconductor supply chain,  such as palladium, neon gas, and helium.   While it certainly is important to know the impacts on this critical  supply chain caused by Russia's invasion, the United States must take a  holistic approach and work with our allies and partners to strengthen  the entire semiconductor supply chain and protect it from being  dominated by the Chinese Communist Party.   I am pleased that this bill also requires forward-looking assessments  to understand the impact to the supply chain by a possible invasion of  Taiwan, a courageous beacon of democracy in the East that manufactures  90 percent of advanced logic semiconductors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume to close.   Mr. Speaker, the U.S. share of global semiconductor production has  dropped from 37 percent in 1990 to 12 percent today, and it is  projected to decline even further without a comprehensive U.S. strategy  to support the industry.   This bill is a small step in the right direction, but we must do more  to ensure these vital supply chains for semiconductors. If we fail, the  impacts to our economy and national security will be monumental.   We are in a conflict of democracy with rule by law opposed by  authoritarians of rule by gun.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill that I am grateful to  have introduced with the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver), my  longtime friend and codel colleague, the Ukraine Religious Freedom  Support Act.   It is important that we first acknowledge the heinous escalation by  the war criminal Putin, as he continues to wage a one-sided, full-scale  war in sovereign, democratic Ukraine. Putin's war in Ukraine and  illegal occupation of Crimea have dragged on for 8 years. The human  toll is staggering.   Prior to the full-scale invasion, fighting in the Russian-occupied  regions had already claimed over 13,000 Ukrainian lives, including  thousands of innocent civilians. That is even before the current  invasion.   Another casualty of Russian aggression in Ukraine has been the attack  on religious freedom. Russian occupation authorities in Crimea continue  to persecute and intimidate the minority Christian, Muslim, and other  religious groups, like the Jehovah's Witnesses.   Putin's puppets in Crimea during the duration of their occupation  subjected them to kidnappings, torture, forced psychiatric  examinations, and imprisonment. Muslim Crimean Tatars have been  sentenced to serve lengthy terms in Russian prisons on the entirely  baseless charge of terrorism.   Minority religious groups in the area of eastern Ukraine controlled  by pro-Putin proxies have also been forced to flee in order to escape  the oppressive conditions. The religious persecution in Ukraine being  committed at the hands of the Putin authorities is self-destructive and  must be stopped.   Throughout American history, the United States has worked tirelessly  to advance religious freedom and protect religious minorities around  the globe. The bill follows that strong tradition by accomplishing the  following:   One, making clear that it is the policy of the United States to never  recognize the illegal attempted annexation of Crimea by Russia or the  separation through the use of military force or recognition of  independence of any portion of Ukrainian territory;   Second, it helps ensure that war criminal Putin and his cronies are  held accountable by considering any official involved in carrying out  severe violations of human rights in sovereign Ukrainian territory by  applying the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act.   Three, additionally, this legislation requires a determination of  whether to designate Russia as a country of concern for religious  freedom.   We cannot allow these grave violations to continue. It is vital that  the United States continues to be a leader in advancing international  religious freedom around the world.   This bill not only brings international attention to the religious  persecution being committed in the territory of Ukraine that Putin  illegally occupies or controls through illegal armed groups it  commands, but also ensures that war criminal Putin and his thugs are  held accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is vital that the United States continue its  tradition of advancing religious freedom and human rights around the  world.   This bill brings accountability to the Putin regime for its crimes of  oppressing religious minorities as it illegally occupies sovereign  Ukrainian territory.   Additionally, it is so critical that the United States continue to  send a clear message that it will never recognize Putin's illegal  occupation of sovereign Ukrainian territory.   Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of the Helsinki Commission, I  especially recognize our dear friend, the late Chairman Alcee Hastings  for championing this issue and the Helsinki Commission for prioritizing  human rights and holding war criminal Putin accountable for his  continued violations of human rights and religious liberty in Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Sadly, on February 24, war criminal Putin launched an unprovoked,  unjustified murderous war of aggression against the people of Ukraine.   The humanitarian toll has been devastating. More than 5 million  refugees have fled Ukraine. More than 7 million are believed to be  internally displaced, and we have seen on our screens the heart- wrenching images of Putin's horrific war crimes in Bucha, Mariupol, and  elsewhere.   The economic toll for Ukraine is no less devastating. The World Bank  has forecasted that Ukraine's economy could contract by 45 percent this  year with a worst-case scenario seeing its GDP shrink by 75 percent.   The Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said last week during a  visit to Washington, that Ukraine would need around $5 billion a month  in budgetary support as long as the war continued and then roughly $600  billion for a broader rebuilding effort.   To rebuild this country, the Ukrainian Prime Minister requested not  only additional financial support from the United States and its allies  and partners, but also the transfer of Russian assets that have been  frozen by the global sanctions regime to Ukraine.   The U.S. must answer this call.   The resolution we are considering urges the President to establish an  interagency working group to determine the constitutional mechanisms  through which the United States could not only freeze but seize the  assets of Russian oligarchs within the United States if this property  was derived through corruption linked to the Putin regime.   The liquidated funds are to be repurposed for the benefit of the  people of Ukraine, including post-conflict reconstruction when the  Ukrainians win, humanitarian assistance, and assistance for the  security forces of the Government of Ukraine.  [[Page H4532]]    I was grateful to colead this legislation with our colleague,   Tom  Malinowski of New Jersey. Thanks to an amendment from our colleague,  Peter Meijer, the bill also urges the administration to expand  sanctions on members of the Russian Parliament, the duma, who voted in  support of recognizing the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republic, which  are illegal fabrications. This vote served as part of Putin's pretext  to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against the  people of Ukraine. Anyone who supported that vote must fall under U.S.  sanctions--full stop. The administration needs to seriously consider  how we can use the frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine fight and  continue winning, then rebuild its country. Therefore, I urge all  colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, rather than financing war crimes in Ukraine and  multimillion-dollar yachts and real estate for Putin's cronies, this  money could be much better spent on urgently needed humanitarian aid  and weapons for Ukraine.   This makes sense for the people of Ukraine as well as for the  American taxpayer. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
