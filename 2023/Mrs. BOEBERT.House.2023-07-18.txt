 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill receiving  consideration on the House floor that would terminate the national  emergency related to the Congo.   National emergencies are supposed to be temporary by definition and  limited to 6 months by law unless there is a justifiable reason for an  extension. They aren't supposed to linger on for decades with no  oversight from Congress or the executive branch.   Clearly, this process is broken for national emergency declarations,  and it needs reform. Having been in Washington, D.C., for over 2 years  now, I clearly realize nothing gets accomplished here without force.   Today, we are raising the issue of this broken system, and that  should be something that Members on both sides of the aisle can all  agree with. Congress needs to do its job.   By law, Congress shall meet to consider a vote on a joint resolution  to determine whether a national emergency shall be terminated after 6  months. Do you hear that? Congress shall do its  [[Page H3661]]  job. Then, they should meet again for that same consideration of each  extension of any national emergency every 6 months.   Congress has been required by law to consider a joint resolution for  the Congo since April 27, 2007, 16 years ago, and 31 more times since.   Shockingly, Congress has never once reviewed the national emergency  related to the Congo over that 16-year timeframe, despite the clear  language in section 202 of the NEA requiring review every 6 months.   Administration after administration just keeps on unilaterally  rubberstamping these extensions without even providing a report or  update to Congress on how much taxpayer money is actually being spent.  What are they spending it on? What is the need to extend this temporary  national emergency authority?   These national emergency declarations have become the deep state's  favorite foreign affairs slush fund. There is literally no spending  transparency whatsoever out there on the 41 national emergencies  currently in place. Congress is allowing the swamp to continue to shift  and funnel an unknown amount of taxpayer dollars to an overseas dark  hole.   I know that some of my colleagues will argue that some of the  national emergencies we are terminating today won't save that much  money. If that is the case and we are only sending a couple hundred  thousand dollars in aid and munitions to a particular country, then  that country no longer meets the definition of a national emergency. If  it is tens of millions of dollars or even hundreds of millions of  dollars that we are sending to certain countries as a result of these  41 national emergency authorizations, then taxpayers have the right to  know these costs, and Congress has a responsibility to provide  oversight on these dollars.   The current sanctions in the Congo have also not addressed the real  issue that is there, which is the Congo mineral conflict. Nearly 40,000  children are estimated to be mining cobalt with their bare hands in the  Democratic Republic of the Congo right now. They are working in unsafe  conditions.   This is the real humanitarian crisis taking place in the Congo. If we  want to talk about sanctioning anyone for what is going on in the  Congo, it should be China, which is exploiting these children and  sucking up the Congo cobalt.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard scare tactics that voting for this bill to  end Congo's national emergency would unfreeze the assets of Viktor  Bout, an arms dealer who was accused of supplying arms to al-Qaida. I  encourage everyone on both sides of the aisle to not be tricked into  voting against my bill based on this false assertion.   Viktor Bout was never a citizen of the Congo or of the United States,  and the current sanctions only apply to United States assets. Viktor  Bout is currently living and running for political office in Russia.   If the U.S. wants to impose further sanctions against him--and I  think we probably should--it can do so under the same mechanisms it has  imposed more than 2,200 sanctions against Russia in the last year and a  half. This is not the only way to sanction a terrorist. We have many  other avenues that we can go down, as is seen in these 2,200 sanctions  from just the past year and a half.   Mr. Speaker, I agree that Viktor Bout is a threat, so much so that I  condemn the President's action and this administration for having  traded him for a professional women's basketball player that was locked  up for bringing marijuana into Russia.   Mr. Speaker, I have not yet heard a compelling argument to vote  against my bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my bill. I urge Congress to actually  roll up their sleeves and do the hard work of authorizing stuff like  this or putting an end to it, exposing to the American taxpayer exactly  where their tax dollars are going and what it is being spent on so we  know if we are sending our tax dollars overseas to terrorists with no  oversight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar), my colleague.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about the forced termination of  these emergencies as being reckless and dangerous because it would  remove sanction designations from hostile foreign actors.   I agree that the people who are on this list should be sanctioned,  but also I see what is reckless and dangerous is continuing to funnel  hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign countries, many with bad  actors, over a 20-year period with no congressional oversight of how  much taxpayer money the deep state is sending out the door.   It is also irresponsible that Congress is ignoring the law and not  reviewing these 41 national emergency declarations every 6 months as  required by law.   It is also reckless and dangerous that Congress is allowing Joe Biden  to have unilateral authority from these national emergency declarations  to draft Americans without consent into Active Duty, authorize chemical  and biological weapons testing on humans--including Americans--and  seize private property of the United States citizens.   Joe Biden decided to release and trade Viktor Bout when he still had  nearly 15 years on his sentence. We can find another way to sanction  him rather than just giving him a free pass, like the other terrorists  who are on this list, without going outside of the bounds of Congress'  official duties.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
