 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the farm broadcaster,  Gary Truitt.   Gary was inducted into the National Association of Farm Broadcasting  Hall of Fame for his outstanding work and commitment to delivering  informative and insightful news to our Nation's farmers.   I offer my congratulations to Gary for this remarkable achievement  and to celebrate his dedicated career. Gary began his farm broadcasting  career in 1981, bringing a fresh perspective to the industry. And in  only a few years, he began his own news broadcast, which soon dominated  Indiana radio.   In 2006, he did it all over again after a corporate sale of his first  network, and created Hoosier Ag Today. For more than 33 years, Hoosier  farmers have relied on Hoosier Ag Today for the latest news about the  condition of the agricultural industry and markets.   Mr. Speaker, it is hard to find someone who puts his whole heart into  everything that they do. Gary is one of them. I wish Gary many more  years of success.                            ____________________
