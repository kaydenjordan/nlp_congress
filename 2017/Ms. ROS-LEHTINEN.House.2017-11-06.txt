 Mr. Speaker, the lives of over 300,000 legal  immigrants are at stake. Central Americans and Haitians, many of whom  are my constituents, could be facing deportation if their temporary  protected status, known as TPS, were to end. This vital program, signed  into law by President George Herbert Walker Bush, has allowed  individuals fleeing instability and chaos in their home countries to  legally live and work here in the United States.   Reports indicate that the administration is considering eliminating  TPS for these populations, a decision that will have negative  humanitarian, economic, and national security concerns, and that could  undermine U.S. investment in the region.   Mr. Speaker, as a longtime supporter of TPS, I urge the  administration to continue to extend this program and provide a safe  haven for Central Americans and Haitians unable to securely return to  their home countries. My heart aches at the thought of massive  deportations of good, hardworking people from my hometown.   Mr. Speaker, TPS beneficiaries are important and integral members of  our community, and it would be a mistake to turn our backs on them.                            ____________________
