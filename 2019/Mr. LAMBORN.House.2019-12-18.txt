 Madam Speaker, anyone watching this impeachment sound  and fury, signifying nothing, should look out for three  misrepresentations the Democrats are making:   One, Trump endangered national security.   No. The 55-day delay did not stop Ukrainians from defending  themselves. Trump actually gave them lethal aid, which Obama never did.  During Obama's negligence, Democrats said nothing.   Two, Trump is not above the law. No one is.   But why don't the Democrats tell us what law he broke? They can't,  because he didn't break any. So Democrats have resorted to two vague  and subjective articles: abuse of power and obstruction of justice.   And, three, the evidence is not in dispute.   No, the evidence is very much in dispute. In fact, for every  statement Democrats cherry-pick to indict Trump, more statements back  up the President.   In reality, this is nothing but a partisan ploy by Democrats to  overturn an election. But this charade will fail, and the Senate will  exonerate Trump, and everyone knows it.
