 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for an extension  of the critical child tax credit.   Here is the truth: Before expiring at the end of 2021, the expanded  child tax credit was working. Payments lowered hunger. They kept nearly  4 million children out of poverty. And they helped countless people  make ends meet.   The child tax credit was a critical lifeline for more than 35 million  American families. This includes more than 70,000 in my district, which  has some of the highest poverty in America.   Shaneice, a mother of three from Cleveland, used the payments to pay  rent and afford basic necessities. But now, 2 months after the payments  stopped, Shaneice says she is just getting by, and she is looking for  side jobs to support her family.   It is time to extend the child tax credit. We cannot--we must not-- let families down.                            ____________________
