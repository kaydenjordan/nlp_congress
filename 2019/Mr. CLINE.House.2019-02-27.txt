 Mr. Chair, I want to thank the previous speaker, the  Speaker of the House, reminding us all that it is California where  Michael Bloomberg and the gun control advocates have established their  utopia of a land without guns. And what has it led us to? With some of  the strictest gun control laws in the land, we have some of the worst  incidents of gun violence in the country.   Gun control measures do not address the problems of gun violence, and  this bill will not address gun violence.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 8. The legislation is  an attempt to take away our Second Amendment rights, hidden under the  guise that we will see a reduction in violent crime.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim the bill would  save lives, but nothing in this bill would have stopped any of the  recent mass casualty shootings that have occurred in our country. The  only thing this bill does is limit the Second Amendment rights of law- abiding citizens.   They will tell you this bill closes loopholes; however, the loophole  that they believe exists is private gun ownership, and what they really  want is to regulate the private transfer of firearms. If my neighbor is  in trouble and needs to borrow a firearm to protect his family, I  should be allowed to loan that firearm to my neighbor so that he can  protect himself and his family.   This is not something we should need to go to the Federal Government  to get permission to do. The Second Amendment does not say that, after  you get permission from the government, your right to keep and bear  arms shall not be infringed.   Our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution to protect us from the  government and gave individuals the Second Amendment to protect  themselves.   I carry this Constitution every day on the campaign trail asphalt. I  carry it with me every day now to remind myself of those protections  that were given to us--not by government, but by God.   This bill is nothing more than an attempt to advance the agenda of  radical gun-grabbers and lay the foundation for a national gun  registration scheme. Mr. Chair, I urge the House to reject this  misguided legislation so we can begin having real discussions about  ways to reduce crime across this great Nation.    Madam Speaker, I was disappointed in the passage of H.R. 8  just a few moments ago, which will do nothing to address the rash of  mass shootings that have occurred across this country in recent years  but will place impediments in the way of law-abiding citizens acquiring  firearms and in defense of their Second Amendment rights. But I was  pleased that the motion to recommit was adopted.   That motion was based on an amendment I offered in committee to  require the national instant background system to report to ICE when an  illegal immigrant tries to obtain a firearm in violation of current  law. I was pleased that it received 220 votes.   I have drafted it as a standalone bill. I will offer it for  cosponsorship. I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring the  bill and ensuring those not here legally who try to purchase a gun are  reported to ICE and deported before they commit additional crimes.                            ____________________
