 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the retirement of a  pillar of my community, an exemplary businessman, dedicated public  servant, dear friend, and an all-around great American, Dick Trammel of  Rogers, Arkansas.   Most know him as Mr. Northwest Arkansas. No one I know of has loved,  served, and promoted northwest Arkansas more than Dick Trammel.   A native of Pocahontas, Arkansas, Dick was recruited to the northwest  part of our State by Walmart founder, Sam Walton. Since moving to the  area in 1975, he has been the area's most avid cheerleader.  Cheerleading came natural for Dick, who was a University of Arkansas  cheerleader back in the 1950s.   Nothing of importance in our area has happened in the last 40-plus  years that doesn't have Dick Trammel's fingerprints on it. He was the  only man to lead the Arkansas State Highway Commission for 4 years. He  has been a mainstay in Rotary International, higher education, programs  serving our youth, Mercy Hospital Northwest Arkansas, and dozens of  other charitable causes.   Dickey Ray, congratulations on a terrific career and a life of  serving your fellow man.                            ____________________
