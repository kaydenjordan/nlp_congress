 Madam President, today I rise to introduce the  Extreme Risk Protection Order Expansion Act.   The premise of this bill is simple: Individuals who pose a serious  threat to themselves or others should not have guns.   Too often we see the deadly consequences when those at risk of  committing violence are given easy access to guns. Nearly 40,000 people  die each year from gun violence. Last year, 3,597 children died by  gunfire--making guns the No. 1 cause of death for children in the  United States.   Before many incidents of gun violence, shooters display warning signs  of impending violence. However, family and friends--those in the best  position to recognize troubling signs--are too often powerless to stop  the violence.   That is why Congress must pass the Extreme Risk Protection Order  Expansion Act.   Extreme risk protection orders, which are often referred to as red  flag laws, allow law enforcement and family members to petition courts  to temporarily remove guns from individuals who are determined to be  dangerous. These laws help save lives.   Nineteen States, including California, already have these laws on the  books. Red flag laws work, but they need more funding.   The Extreme Risk Protection Order Expansion Act, which I am  reintroducing today, would allow States to use Federal funds to develop  red flag laws.   Passing the Extreme Risk Protection Order Expansion Act would help  States respond to situations where a dangerous person should not have  access to a gun. It will also help us better understand the causes of  gun violence and how to better protect our communities.   When Congress passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act last year,  it expanded the Justice Department's existing Byrne-JAG Program to  allow States to apply for Federal grant assistance if they want to  create these laws.   While this was an important first step, I believe we must pass the  Extreme Risk Protection Order Expansion Act to build on the important  work done last Congress and make sure that specific dedicated funding  exists for the development and implementation of red-flag laws.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mrs. Blackburn, Mr. Tillis, and Mrs.          Feinstein):   S. 253. A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, to provide fair  treatment of radio stations and artists for the use of sound  recordings, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
