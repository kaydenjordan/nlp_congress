DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1456, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Peace Corps  Reauthorization Act, and I thank Mr. Garamendi for authoring this  important bill.   This week marks 61 years in which President Kennedy signed the bill  creating the Peace Corps into law, with the mission of promoting world  peace and friendship. The Peace Corps has fulfilled this vision and has  evolved into a vital diplomatic tool for U.S. foreign policy.   Since 1961, more than 240,000 Americans have served as Peace Corps  volunteers in 143 countries, conducting people-to-people diplomacy and  development in partnership with communities in some of the poorest  countries of the world.   Volunteers work in sectors that include education, agriculture,  environment, health, youth, and community economic development. From  incorporating agroforestry technologies in Zambia's farming system, to  promoting volunteerism in Georgia, there is no doubt about the profound  impact that the Peace Corps has had on the world's developing nations.   In addition to changing lives of people all over the world, the Peace  Corps has also shaped the next generation of American and foreign  leaders and changemakers, by fostering cross-cultural immersion and  collaboration.   After 61 years of success, we think it is time to further strengthen  the Peace Corps' global mission by providing additional resources to  better the agency and to support its volunteers. Congress last  authorized the Peace Corps in 1999. For this reason, the bill is  timely, provides a much-needed update to benefits for volunteers that  include readjustment allowance, re-enrollment priority, transition  assistance, health insurance, noncompetitive eligibility for Federal  employment, and updated workers' compensation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member McCaul for  moving this legislation forward in a bipartisan way. The bill will  enhance the ability of the Peace Corps to make strong and strategic  investments to meet the challenges of today and continue to be a  transformative force for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all Members to vote in support of this  critical legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1456, the Peace Corps Reauthorization Act, as  amended, would significantly upgrade the Peace Corps and better support  Americans who are ready to serve their Nation and make the world a  better place.   I thank Mr. Garamendi for his service to the Peace Corps in Ethiopia  and for this bill. It is clear from Mr. Garamendi and from many other  Americans--we all know how their Peace Corps service has transformed  their lives and the lives of those with whom they volunteered.   All of this has contributed to a stronger American image abroad,  reaffirming our conviction in the enduring value of the Peace Corps.  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me and support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the      The online version has been corrected to read:  Mr. Speaker, I  move to suspend the rules and pass the    ========================= END NOTE =========================                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8453) to provide for the imposition of sanctions with  respect to foreign persons undermining the Dayton Peace Agreement or  threatening the security of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and for other  purposes, as amended.

SEC. 7. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 8453, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8453, the Upholding the  Dayton Peace Agreement Through Sanctions Act. I thank Representatives  Wild and Wagner for their dedicated efforts to introduce and move this  important bill.   Memories and horrific consequences of the Balkan wars of the 1990s  are with us all, those of us who experienced that war in the region and  those of us who worked on the ending of that war. I was one of those  people.   I was at the Dayton peace conference in 1995 as a young State  Department staffer and remember how close we came to failure and the  extraordinarily positive consequences of success: ending a war that  claimed 200,000 lives, reaffirming the centrality and importance of  American leadership in Europe and the importance of the NATO alliance,  and keeping the peace in the transatlantic community.   The fragile peace that we ushered in with the Dayton Accords was  meant to leave the threats of ethnic nationalism and demagoguery in the  past and to create a framework, as imperfect as it was, for cooperation  and, ultimately, the integration of those countries into European  institutions.   Well, some of those young countries have done as we hoped. They  successfully moved toward and integrated into the European Union and  NATO. Some have struggled on that path but are still striving for a  democratic and prosperous future.   Some of the problems that they still experience are internal of their  own making, but others are coming from outside actors, particularly  Russia and China, who see an interest and an opportunity to keep these  countries in chaos and limbo.  [[Page H7895]]    In 2 weeks, the people of Bosnia will head to the polls in decisive  elections that will determine their country's fate. However, in the  lead-up to and following the elections, there will be temptations to  break away from the Dayton Accords and the spirit of peace and  partnership that they represent. The citizens of Bosnia deserve better  from their leadership.   This legislation, which the House Committee on Foreign Affairs marked  up in July, is designed to hold the bad actors holding Bosnia back  accountable and to prevent others from hurting that country's chances  to enjoy a free and democratic future.   As we are learning from Putin's cruel and unjustified war on the  people and the very idea of Ukraine, peace and democracy are not  guaranteed but must be fostered and protected always.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8453, Upholding the Dayton Peace Agreement Through  Sanctions Act, will help prevent malevolent actors from undermining  peace and stability in Bosnia, to protect that country's free and  democratic future from efforts to unravel the Dayton Accords.   The progress made since the devastating Balkan wars of the 1990s must  be preserved. Efforts to provoke tensions must not and will not be  tolerated by the United States. Russia's war of choice in Ukraine has  showed us the consequences of a land war in Europe in the 21st century.  We cannot allow anything remotely similar to happen in the Balkans, and  I am confident that Congress and the administration will work together  to prevent that.   I once again thank my colleagues, Representatives Wild and Wagner,  for introducing H.R. 8453, and I hope my colleagues will join us in  supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6846) to require a review of sanctions with respect to  Russian kleptocrats and human rights abusers, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6846         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Financial Services of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6846, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6846, the Corruption,  Overthrowing Rule of Law, and Ruining Ukraine: Putin's Trifecta Act, or  better known as the CORRUPT Act. You can imagine we worked hard on that  acronym.   I first thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the  bipartisan effort. Representatives Curtis, Kinzinger, Salazar,  Fitzpatrick, and Joe Wilson, on the Republican side, led this bill with  me when Putin's invasion kicked off.   And despite what the news often says, behind the curtains I have seen  tremendous bipartisan unity over the last 6 months to ensure that  Ukraine's brave people have all of the military hardware and economic  support that they need.   I will start by reminding us why we are advancing the CORRUPT Act  today. We are passing this bill today because of the death and  destruction in Ukraine.   Right here, you see a picture from the village of Bucha. When Bucha  was liberated, Ukrainians found mass graves with hundreds, including  many civilians with hands tied behind their  [[Page H7897]]  backs. The Associated Press says more than 1,300 bodies have been found  in just this one location. And sadly, as the Ukrainian military  advances and retakes more of its sovereign territory from the Russian  invaders, more such evidence of massacres is coming to light.   We are here because this is a moral outrage, because this is evil. We  are also here because we understand that the people of Ukraine are not  just fighting for their country; they are fighting for ours. They are  not just fighting for their freedom and security; they are fighting for  ours.   They are fighting for the idea that in the 21st century, no country  can change borders with tanks. No leader can seek power through murder.  These are principles that protect everybody in the world, including the  people of the United States.   And with this bill, we are sending another clear bipartisan signal  that Congress supports President Biden's unprecedented sanctions  against Putin's regime; and that we will continue to push for targeted  sanctions against key enablers of Putin's repression until Ukraine is  free.   Now, we have before us a list of nearly 200 key cronies of Putin.  Identified by brave Russian democracy activists, these are the people  who keep Putin in power and continue to fuel the war in Ukraine. They  must not continue to profit from investments, accounts, condos,  properties, planes, yachts held in the West.   But I also want to use this opportunity to make an important point;  that Putin's senseless invasion started with his cruel repression  inside Russia. The first victims of Putin were in Russia, brave  Russians who stood up for democracy and freedom in their country.   Right here, you see a picture of a dear friend of mine, Vladimir  Kara-Murza, a brave Russian hero. Putin tried to poison him twice, and  he survived, miraculously. Putin now holds him in Russia's new gulags.  Why? Because he openly calls for democracy and freedom in Russia.   So you don't get to the war crimes in Bucha without this. So this is  why the U.S. Congress is going to continue pushing for targeted  sanctions against those corrupt cronies of Putin propping up his  repression and fueling the horrific war in Ukraine; because it is the  same people responsible for both of these crimes; because we believe it  is what is best for the Ukrainian people and the Russian people and for  the United States.   I would like to use Vladimir Kara-Murza's own words to make that  point. He said that the Magnitsky Act, the bill that we passed years  ago to facilitate the sanctions against corrupt and repressive cronies  of the Putin regime:         The Magnitsky Act is the most pro-Russian law ever to have       been passed by a foreign parliament. Nothing can send a chill       down the backs of Putin's autocratic enablers like the       realization that not even the Kremlin, with all of its       patronage, all of its oil money, will be able to guarantee       their ill-gotten gains.    Finally, as we continue to freeze the assets of corrupt Russian  officials and leaders, we must also face the fact that many of their  condominiums, and villas, and investment accounts, and trusts remain  hidden right here in the United States because of loopholes in our own  laws.    So I am going to continue to push with the same congressional leaders  who have supported the CORRUPT Act, the bill we are passing today,  Representatives Maria Salazar,   Joe Wilson,   Steve Cohen, Abigail  Spanberger, Richard Hudson, to include the House-passed ENABLERS Act in  this year's NDAA, the national defense bill.   It will make sure that Putin's cronies, the ones who we are  sanctioning today in the CORRUPT Act, as well as Venezuelan  kleptocrats, and Chinese Communist Party officials repressing their  people, that these dictators and their enablers can no longer hide  their money and earn interest here in New Jersey, in Florida, and  across America.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6846, with this bill, the CORRUPT Act, we stand in  bipartisan solidarity with the Ukrainian people and with the many  people in Russia who oppose this war, who believe that Putin's regime  is as destructive to their country as it is to the rest of the world.   We are saying, with passing this bill, that the United States is  absolutely committed to tracking down the dirty money that props up  Putin's repression, his brutal criminal war in Ukraine. Hopefully, as  we scour the world to seize the yachts and the property and the bank  accounts of these people, we will be able to put the proceeds of that  wealth to good use to help rebuild the country that Putin is  destroying.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3895) to extend and authorize annual appropriations for the  United States Commission on International Religious Freedom through  fiscal year 2024.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3895         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``United States Commission on       International Religious Freedom Reauthorization Act of       2022''.       SEC. 2. UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS                     FREEDOM.         (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 207(a) of the       International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C.       6435(a)) is amended by striking ``2019 through 2022'' and       inserting ``2023 and 2024''.        (b) Extension of Authorization.--Section 209 of the       International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6436)       is amended by striking ``September 30, 2022'' and inserting       ``September 30, 2024''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 3895.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the United States  Commission on International Religious Freedom Reauthorization Act of  2022. I thank our Senate colleagues and Mr. Smith and Ms. Eshoo for  their leadership in advancing this important measure--in Mr. Smith's  case, his leadership over many, many years in advancing the cause of  religious freedom across the world.   Since 1998, USCIRF has served as a leading advisory panel to the  United States Government on matters related to religious freedom  globally. It is responsible for monitoring the freedom of religion or  belief abroad and for making policy recommendations to the President,  Secretary of State, and to Congress.   The past several USCIRF reauthorizations have been bipartisan and  faithful to the original mandate as established by Congress.   Mr. Speaker, the right to practice a religion, or to practice no  religion, is a fundamental human right. The principle of religious  liberty should extend to all people, not only ones who come from a  specific set of religious beliefs. As respect for democracy and human  rights continue to be under stress in many parts of the world, the work  of USCIRF and other human rights groups to shine a light on religious  freedom is even more important.   I thank Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member McCaul for moving this  legislation forward in a bipartisan way. The bill will enhance the  Commission's ability to continue its important work promoting religious  freedom and to highlight those countries around the world that have to  do better.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all Members to vote in support of the  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3895, the USCIRF Reauthorization Act, is critically  needed to ensure that our country maintains the tools we need to stand  up for human rights and, in particular, religious freedom around the  world.   I thank my friend from New Jersey, once again, for encouraging us to  move on this and really for being the conscience of the House on these  issues for so many, many years.   I remember many times testifying before you back in the day, and I am  glad that you are still reminding us that this is some of the most  important work that we can do.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me and support the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7240) to reauthorize the READ Act, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7240         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``READ Act Reauthorization Act       of 2022''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.         Section 4(a) of the Reinforcing Education Accountability in       Development Act (division A of Public Law 115-56; 22 U.S.C.       2151c note) is amended by striking ``during the following       five fiscal years'' and inserting ``during the following ten       fiscal years''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7240, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7240, the  reauthorization of the Reinforcing Education Accountability in  Development, or the READ Act. I would first like to thank my  colleagues, Representative Bass and Representative Smith, for their  leadership in this legislation. I also want to acknowledge former  Appropriations Chairwoman Lowey for championing basic education  programs for so many years in the House. The READ Act is just one piece  of her great legacy.   The bill we are considering today reauthorizes the READ Act for  another 5 years, continuing our country's leadership in expanding  access to basic education for kids around the world. As Chairwoman  Lowey would say, education is one of the greatest force multipliers in  foreign aid. Every dollar we spend on a child's education is an  investment in their future and in a more peaceful and prosperous world.                                time  1500    Since the READ Act was signed into law in 2017, we have made  significant progress in responding to the needs of our partner  countries to improve literacy, strengthen education systems, expand  access to safe learning, and promote education as a foundation for  sustained economic growth.   Despite this progress, the READ Act and our basic education programs  remain critical in the face of profound learning loss everywhere due to  the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning poverty has increased by a third in  low- and middle-income countries, with an estimated 70 percent of 10- year-olds unable to understand a simple written text, up from 57  percent before the pandemic.   According to the World Bank, this generation of students now risks  losing $21 trillion in potential lifetime earnings, or the equivalent  of 17 percent of the world's GDP. Millions of kids around the world  remain out of school.   Children need a quality education, whether in Bethesda, Nairobi, or  Kabul. But investing U.S. taxpayer dollars in this cause is not just  charity; it is in our collective interest. Reauthorizing the READ Act  is thus a step toward maintaining U.S. leadership in achieving this  goal, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage through the  House.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7240, the reauthorization of the Reinforcing  Education Accountability in Development Act, or the READ Act, comes at  a critical time.   Despite the progress we have made toward expanding access to  education around the world, COVID-19 has set us back, particularly in  low- and middle-income countries. The bill demonstrates our continuing  commitment to ensuring every child has access to safe, equitable, and  quality education, and our confidence that every dollar invested in  this cause returns dividends by way of global economic growth and  stability.   Once again, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass) for  introducing this bill, along with the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Smith) for their leadership in advancing this critical reauthorization.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8503) to require the development of a strategy to promote  the use of secure telecommunications infrastructure worldwide, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8503         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Global       Telecommunications Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress as follows:        (1) The United States Government should promote and take       steps to ensure American leadership in strategic technology       industries, including telecommunications infrastructure and       other information and communications technologies.        (2) The expansive presence of companies linked to the       Chinese Communist Party, such as Huawei, in global mobile       networks and the national security implications thereof, such       as the ability of the People's Republic of China to       exfiltrate the information flowing through those networks and       shut off countries' internet access, demonstrates the       importance of the United States remaining at the       technological frontier and the dire consequences of falling       behind.        (3) The significant cost of countering Huawei's market       leadership in telecommunications infrastructure around the       world underscores the urgency of supporting the       competitiveness of United States companies in next-generation       information and communication technology.  [[Page H7901]]         (4) To remain a leader at the International       Telecommunication Union (ITU) and preserve the ITU's       technical integrity, the United States must work with       emerging economies and developing nations to bolster global       telecommunications security and protect American national       security interests.        (5) Multilateral cooperation with like-minded partners and       allies is critical to carry out the significant effort of       financing and promoting secure networks around the world and       to achieve market leadership of trusted vendors in this       sector.       SEC. 3. STRATEGY FOR SECURING GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS                     INFRASTRUCTURE.         (a) Strategy Required.--Not later than 90 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State       shall develop and submit to the Committees on Foreign Affairs       of the House of Representatives and Energy and Commerce and       the Committees on Foreign Relations and Commerce, Science,       and Transportation and of the Senate a strategy, to be known       as the ``Strategy to Secure Global Telecommunications       Infrastructure'' (referred to in this Act as the       ``Strategy''), to promote the use of secure telecommunication       infrastructure in countries other than the United States.        (b) Consultation Required.--The Secretary of State shall       consult with the President of the Export-Import Bank of the       United States, the Chief Executive Officer of the Development       Finance Corporation, the Administrator of the United States       Agency for International Development, the Director of the       Trade and Development Agency, the Chair of the Federal       Communications Commission, and the Assistant Secretary of       Commerce for Communications and Information, in developing       the Strategy, which shall consist of an approach led by the       Department of State using the policy tools, and informed by       the technical expertise, of the other Federal entities so       consulted to achieve the goal described in subsection (a).        (c) Elements.--The Strategy shall also include sections on       each of the following:        (1) Mobile networks, including a description of efforts by       countries other than the United States to--        (A) promote trusted Open RAN technologies while protecting       against any security risks posed by untrusted vendors in Open       RAN networks;        (B) use financing mechanisms to assist ``rip-and-replace''       projects and to incentivize countries to choose trusted       equipment vendors;        (C) bolster multilateral cooperation, especially with       developing countries and emerging economies, to promote the       deployment of trusted wireless networks worldwide; and        (D) collaborate with trusted private sector companies to       counter Chinese market leadership in the telecom equipment       industry.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 8503.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8503, the Securing  Global Telecommunications Act, introduced by the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Manning) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim).   A week from today, the International Telecommunication Union, the  U.N. organization that oversees global telecom and tech issues, will  have a plenipotentiary for the first time in 4 years. Crucially, among  the elections to be held during this time, there will be an election to  decide who will lead the agency as its secretary general.   The current secretary general is a Chinese national who has used his  position to bolster the PRC's interests. The upcoming race to decide  who will next lead the organization is between an American, Doreen  Bogdan-Martin, and a Russian national, Rashid Ismailov. The Russians  and Chinese have consistently staked out positions on internet  governance that would make the communications sector more friendly for  authoritarian governments such as they, governments that want to crack  down on human rights, on freedom of speech and expression.   This bill is an answer that stakes out a better telecommunications  future. It calls on the administration to submit a strategy on how to  promote American economic and security interests in critical  technologies like 5G, Open RAN, and low-Earth orbit satellite internet.   The bill positions the United States to lead on global  telecommunications issues and requires the administration to increase  reporting and transparency on Russian and PRC activities in the  telecommunications sector. This information will help us better  coordinate with like-minded democracies on digital and internet freedom  and security issues.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting the bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8503, the Securing Global  Telecommunications Act, is important legislation that will position our  country to be a leader in the world's telecommunications future. It  will ensure that the U.S. Government is taking steps to shore up and  protect our digital infrastructure at home and help us better  coordinate with like-minded democracies as we work to thwart Russia and  the PRC's malign efforts to crack down on dissent and freedom of  expression.   I again thank my colleagues, Representatives Manning and Kim for  introducing this legislation. I hope my colleagues will join me in  supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8520) to establish certain reporting and other requirements  relating to telecommunications equipment and services produced or  provided by certain entities, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8520         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Countering Untrusted       Telecommunications Abroad Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the national security of the United States is affected       by the telecommunications security of United States allies,       partners, and other countries around the globe;        (2) the importance of mobile and internet services makes       such services tempting and effective tools for malign       influence and economic coercion;        (3) Huawei Technologies Company and ZTE Corporation (and       any subsidiary or affiliate of either such entity) should not       serve as a vendor of telecommunications equipment or services       given the close ties to, and control over, such entities by       the People's Republic of China; and        (4) it is in the economic and national security interests       of the United States to ensure that countries around the       globe use trusted telecommunications equipment or services.       SEC. 3. REPORT ON UNTRUSTED TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT OR                     SERVICES IN COUNTRIES WITH COLLECTIVE DEFENSE                     AGREEMENT WITH UNITED STATES.         (a) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for two years,       the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Assistant       Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information,       shall submit to the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Energy       and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the       Committees on Foreign  [[Page H7903]]       Relations and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the       Senate a report on the prevalence of untrusted       telecommunications equipment or services in the networks of       United States allies and partners.

(2) If any untrusted telecommunications equipment or       service is present in such a network--        (A) an enumeration of any mobile carriers that are using       the untrusted telecommunications equipment or service       present, and any mobile carriers that are not;        (B) a determination of whether the untrusted       telecommunications equipment or service present is in the       core or periphery of the network; and        (C) any plans by the United States ally or partner, or the       individual mobile carrier, to rip and replace the untrusted       telecommunications equipment or service present with a       trusted telecommunications equipment or service.        (3) A description of any plans by network operators to use       untrusted communications equipment or services in the       deployment of Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN)       technology, or any successor to such technology, or in future       6G networks.

(a) In General.--Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act       of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m) is amended by adding at the end the       following new subsection:        ``(s) Disclosure of Certain Activities Related to Untrusted       Telecommunications Equipment.--        ``(1) In general.--Each issuer required to file an annual       or quarterly report under subsection (a) shall disclose in       that report the information required in paragraph (2) if,       during the period covered by the report, the issuer or any       affiliate of the issuer used or contracted to use covered       telecommunications equipment or services.        ``(2) Information required.--If an issuer or affiliate of       the issuer has engaged in an activity described in paragraph       (1), the issuer shall disclose such activity, including a       detailed description of--        ``(A) whether the covered telecommunications equipment or       services are being used in a mobile network run by the       issuer, and whether those equipment or services were used in       the core or periphery of the network;        ``(B) whether the covered telecommunications equipment or       services were used for cloud computing or data storage;        ``(C) whether any covered telecommunications equipment or       services were replaced with other vendors; and        ``(D) whether the issuer is currently engaging in       negotiations or planning to contract to use additional       covered telecommunications equipment or services.        ``(3) Notice of disclosures.--If an issuer reports under       paragraph (1) that the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer       has knowingly engaged in any activity described in that       paragraph, the issuer shall separately file with the       Commission, concurrently with the annual or quarterly report       under subsection (a), a notice that the disclosure of that       activity has been included in that annual or quarterly report       that identifies the issuer and contains the information       required by paragraph (2).        ``(4) Public disclosure of information.--Upon receiving a       notice under paragraph (3) that an annual or quarterly report       includes a disclosure of an activity described in paragraph       (1), the Commission shall promptly--        ``(A) transmit the report to--        ``(i) the President;        ``(ii) the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Energy and       Commerce, and Financial Services of the House of       Representatives; and        ``(iii) the Committees on Foreign Relations, Commerce,       Science, and Transportation, and Banking, Housing, and Urban       Affairs of the Senate; and        ``(B) make the information provided in the disclosure and       the notice available to the public by posting the information       on the Internet website of the Commission.        ``(5) Covered telecommunications equipment or service       defined.--In this subsection, the term `covered       telecommunications equipment or service' has the meaning       given to the term `covered communications equipment or       service' in section 9 of the Secure and Trusted       Communications Network Act of 2019 (47 U.S.C. 1608).''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect with respect to reports required to be       filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the       date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of this       Act.       SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Covered telecommunications equipment or service;       untrusted telecommunications equipment or service.--The terms       ``covered telecommunications equipment or service'' and       ``untrusted telecommunications equipment or service'' have       the meaning given to the term ``covered communications       equipment or service'' in section 9 of the Secure and Trusted       Communications Network Act of 2019 (47 U.S.C. 1608).        (2) Trusted telecommunications equipment or service.--The       term ``trusted telecommunications equipment or service''       means any telecommunications equipment or service that is not       a covered telecommunications equipment or service.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 8520.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8520, the Countering  Untrusted Telecommunications Act.   Imagine the following: A senior official for a NATO ally of the  United States transmits a vital national security matter to his  country's embassy here in Washington, but before the call even reaches  the embassy, it is intercepted by Chinese spyware, which transmits the  call to Beijing. Before our officials even hear the top-secret message,  CCP officials have captured and recorded the information.   Threats like this are very real and on the rise. Even here in the  United States, intelligence and defense officials are concerned that  telecommunications equipment made by the company Huawei could capture  communications about our nuclear arsenal.   Around the world, the problem is worse. Many of our partners and  allies have all of their major cell phone networks backed by unsafe  equipment giving the PRC and its friends backdoor access to our private  communications. Many countries, replete with this unsafe equipment,  have mutual defense treaties with the United States.   The Countering Untrusted Telecommunications Act would be a crucial  tool to address these security issues.   First, it would require the State Department to ensure that the  Department itself is not relying on unsafe equipment at our embassies  around the world.   Second, it would require a comprehensive report on the  telecommunications security of all countries with which the United  States has a mutual defense treaty.   Third, it authorizes our State Department to provide diplomatic  support for telecommunications projects and pushes our United States  Trade and Development Agency to finance important projects in this  area.   Finally, it requires mobile network operators listed on American  stock exchanges to disclose whether they have Huawei, ZTE, or other  unsafe equipment in their networks. Currently, many network operators  fail to disclose this information despite existing sanctions against  Huawei. This provision would be beneficial for our national security  but also crucial for investors and shareholders in these companies.   I thank Representatives Wild and Wagner for their important work on  this bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8520, the Countering Untrusted Telecommunications  Act is an important initiative in finding and addressing American  vulnerabilities to cyber spying and espionage, particularly in our  communications with partners and allies whose unsecure networks may  provide backdoor access to these increasing threats.    I, once again, thank Representatives Wild and Wagner for their  tremendous work in advancing this bill and their commitment to  protecting our national security from cyber and security threats. I  hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7338) to require congressional notification prior to  payments of Department of State rewards using cryptocurrencies,  authorize the appointment of a Director of Digital Currency Security in  the Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation of the  Department of State, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7338         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Russia Cryptocurrency       Transparency Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On February 24, 2022, the Government of the Russian       Federation, led by Vladimir Putin, launched an unprovoked,       full-scale invasion of Ukraine.        (2) This unprovoked act of aggression violates Ukraine's       right to independence, sovereignty, and territorial       integrity, and constitutes an emergency in international       relations.        (3) The invasion by the Government of the Russian       Federation of Ukraine caused significant displacement in       Ukraine and triggered a broader humanitarian crisis in       Europe.        (4) On March 23, 2022, the Department of State released a       statement assessing that the Russian Armed Forces committed       war crimes by launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians       and non-military infrastructure, including apartment       buildings, schools, and hospitals, leaving thousands of       innocent civilians killed or wounded.        (5) The United Nations Office for Coordination of       Humanitarian Affairs has projected that, over the next three       months, 12,000,000 people living in Ukraine will need       humanitarian assistance, 6,700,000 people will be internally       displaced, and 4,000,000 people will flee Ukraine.        (6) Rapid humanitarian assistance is necessary 6 across       sectors to address the needs of refugees and internally       displaced persons from Ukraine.        (7) Cryptocurrency has been used as an effective cross-      border payment tool to send millions to the Ukrainian       Government, Ukrainian army, and Ukrainian refugees with       limited access to financial services.        (8) In response to the war of aggression by the Government       of the Russian Federation, the United States has imposed an       array of sanctions, cutting off major Russian financial       institutions from Western markets and freezing the assets of       numerous Russian oligarchs.        (9) Given that regimes sanctioned by the United States have       used cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions, there are       increasing concerns that these digital assets may be used to       circumvent the sanctions now imposed on Russia and Belarus by       the United States and other foreign countries.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATIONS FOR STATE DEPARTMENT                     CRYPTOCURRENCY REWARDS.         (a) Congressional Notification.--Subsection (e) of section       36 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22       U.S.C. 2708) is amended by adding at the end the following       new paragraph:  [[Page H7905]]         ``(7) The Secretary of State shall notify the appropriate       congressional committees not later than 15 days before paying       out a reward in cryptocurrency.''.        (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to       the appropriate congressional committees a report on the use       of cryptocurrency as a part of the Department of State       Rewards program that--        (1) explains why the Department of State made the       determination to pay out rewards in cryptocurrency;        (2) lists each cryptocurrency payment already provided by       the State Department;        (3) provides evidence as to why cryptocurrency payments       would be more likely to induce whistleblowers to come forward       with information than rewards paid out in United States       dollars or other prizes;        (4) analyzes how the State Department's use of       cryptocurrency could undermine the dollar's status as the       global reserve currency; and        (5) examines if the State Department's use of       cryptocurrency could provide bad actors with additional hard-      to-trace funds that could be used for criminal or illicit       purposes.        (c) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives;        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.       SEC. 4. REPORT ON BLOCKCHAIN USAGE FOR UKRANIAN HUMANITARIAN                     NEEDS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in       coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and the       Administrator of the United States Agency for International       Development, shall submit to the appropriate congressional       committees a report on the most effective avenues to promote       economic development and provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine,       including possible uses of cryptocurrencies or other       technologies incorporating blockchains. Such report shall--        (1) review and analyze the advantages offered by cross-      border transactions involving digital assets relative to       other traditional avenues for cross-border humanitarian       relief payments and the reasons for those advantages,       including structural barriers which may impact the cost,       efficiency, and reliability of traditional payment channels;       and        (2) also review and analyze ways in which technologies       incorporating blockchains can--        (A) assist in the care, support, or resettlement of       refugees and internally displaced persons from Ukraine;        (B) address humanitarian access challenges and ensure the       effective delivery of such assistance to persons from       Ukraine;        (C) increase efficiency, accountability, and transparency       in the administration of humanitarian aid provided by the       United States to persons from Ukraine;        (D) prevent corruption through the use of ``web3''       technologies;        (E) improve access to capital; and        (F) bolster the efficiency and reliability of cross-border       remittances.        (b) Form.--The report required under subsection (a) shall       be submitted in unclassified form and may include a       classified annex.        (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Financial Services of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.       SEC. 5. EFFECTIVENESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF SANCTIONS.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) on March 9, 2022, President Biden issued an Executive       Order outlining a national policy to mitigate the risks, and       harness the potential benefits of, digital assets and       distributed ledger technology;        (2) the growing development and adoption of digital assets       have created an urgent need for the United States to play a       leading role in the global financial system and facilitate       technological innovation;        (3) these developments have had significant implications       that pose risks to the financial stability and national       security interest of the United States, including issues       relating to privacy and surveillance;        (1) the United States Government must--        (A) ensure the efficacy and enforcement of the United       States' sanctions regime by preventing the misuse of digital       assets, which can facilitate transactions by Russian persons       subject to sanctions;        (B) mitigate national security liabilities and systemic       financial risks posed by the misuse of digital assets by       developing policy recommendations and addressing existing       regulatory gaps; and        (C) maintain technological leadership to promote United       States global competitiveness and play a leading role in the       global governance of digital assets.        (b) Report.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in       consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit a       report to the appropriate congressional committees that       provides an assessment on how digital currencies affect the       effectiveness and enforcement of United States sanctions       against the Russian Federation and actors subject to       sanctions related to the Russian Federation's invasion of       Ukraine.        (2) Matters to be included.--The report under paragraph (1)       shall--        (A) describe any efforts by the Russian Federation or       persons subject to sanctions related to the Russian       Federation's invasion of Ukraine to utilize digital assets to       evade the sanctions regimes of the United States and its       international allies and partners;        (B) describe any efforts by persons subject to sanctions       related to the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine to       use decentralized finance technology or other similar       technology to effect transactions, including digital wallets,       digital asset trading platforms, and digital asset exchanges;        (C) assess how the use or adoption of digital currencies       could undermine the national security interests of the United       States and impact the efficacy and enforcement of sanctions,       , and the enforcement of anti-money laundering provisions;        (D) detail actions taken by the United States government to       work with private sector actors to combat the evasion of       sanctions imposed by the United States; and        (E) include recommendations for new legislative and       regulatory measures needed to strengthen the United States       Government's ability to prevent any states, state-sponsored       actors, and non-state-sponsored actors from using digital       currencies to evade sanctions imposed by the United States       Government.        (c) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives;        (2) the Committee on Financial Services of the House of       Representatives;        (3) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate; and        (4) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of       the Senate.        (d) Report Form.--The report required under subsection (b)       shall be submitted in unclassified form with a classified       annex, if necessary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7338, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7338, the Russia  Cryptocurrency Transparency Act introduced by the chairman and ranking  member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representatives Meeks  and McCaul. I also acknowledge Chairwoman Waters of the Financial  Services Committee, who has been deeply engaged on cryptocurrency  issues for years and has shown such tremendous leadership on the topic.   Russia's illegal, immoral, and indefensible invasion of Ukraine has  placed renewed focus on how the Putin regime evades sanctions and  continues to fund itself.   One answer is cryptocurrency. Virtually unregulated globally,  cryptocurrency technology has increasingly become a tool for people  seeking to avoid financial sanctions. While there are legitimate and  responsible companies that police their platforms and products, there  are also products like cryptocurrency tumblers that have little or no  value to society other than helping people evade sanctions and launder  money.   At the same time, the people of Ukraine have demonstrated the  potential value of cryptocurrency. Some refugees, for example, have  found that it is a particularly useful way to conduct cross-border  transactions, and the sale of nonfungible tokens has been used to  support Ukraine and its people.   Balancing these tradeoffs is not easy, but Chairman Meeks' bill, I  believe, strikes the right balance. It will provide necessary  transparency and information about these practices to ensure that our  foreign policy is up to the challenge of adapting to this new  technology.   I strongly support the measure, and I urge all of my colleagues to do  the same.  [[Page H7906]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    In closing, Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank, again,  my colleagues, Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member McCaul, for  introducing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6265) to require a strategy by the United States Government  to disrupt and dismantle the Captagon trade and narcotics networks of  Bashar al-Assad in Syria.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6265         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Countering Assad's       Proliferation Trafficking And Garnering Of Narcotics Act'' or       the ``CAPTAGON Act''.       SEC. 2. INTERAGENCY STRATEGY TO DISRUPT AND DISMANTLE                     NARCOTICS PRODUCTION AND TRAFFICKING AND                     AFFILIATED NETWORKS LINKED TO THE REGIME OF                     BASHAR AL-ASSAD IN SYRIA.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Captagon trade linked to the regime of Bashar al-      Assad in Syria is a transnational security threat; and        (2) the United States should develop and implement an       interagency strategy to deny, degrade, and dismantle Assad-      linked narcotics production and trafficking networks.        (b) Report and Strategy Required.--Not later than 180 days       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Defense, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the       Treasury, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement       Administration, the Director of National Intelligence, and       the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies shall provide       to the appropriate congressional committees a written       strategy to disrupt and dismantle narcotics production and       trafficking and affiliated networks linked to the regime of       Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Such strategy shall include each of       the following:        (1) A strategy to target, disrupt, and degrade networks       that directly or indirectly support the narcotics       infrastructure of the Assad regime, particularly through       diplomatic and intelligence support to law enforcement       investigations and to build counter-narcotics capacity to       partner countries through assistance and training to law       enforcement services in countries, other than Syria, that are       receiving or transiting large quantities of Captagon.        (2) Information relating to the use of statutory       authorities, including the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection       Act of 2019 (22 U.S.C. 8791 note), the Foreign Narcotics       Kingpin Designation Act (popularly referred to as the       ``Kingpin Act''), section 489 of the Foreign Assistance Act       (relating to the international narcotics control strategy       report), and associated actions to target individuals and       entities directly or indirectly associated with the narcotics       infrastructure of the Assad regime.        (3) Information relating to the use of global diplomatic       engagements associated with the economic pressure campaign       against the Assad regime to target its narcotics       infrastructure.        (4) A strategy for leveraging multilateral institutions and       cooperation with international partners to disrupt the       narcotics infrastructure of the Assad regime.        (5) A strategy for mobilizing a public communications       campaign to increase awareness of the extent of the       connection of the Assad regime to illicit narcotics trade.        (6) A description of the countries receiving or transiting       large shipments of Captagon, and an assessment of the       counter-narcotics capacity of such countries to interdict or       disrupt the smuggling of Captagon, including an assessment of       current United States assistance and training programs to       build such capacity in such countries.        (c) Form of Report.--The report required under subsection       (b) shall be submitted in an unclassified form, but may       contain a classified annex.        (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--In this section,       the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (1) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on the       Judiciary, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on       Financial Services, the Committee on Appropriations, and the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of       Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on the       Judiciary, the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee       on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on       Appropriations, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of       the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6265.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6265, the CAPTAGON Act.   I would like to first thank Representatives French Hill and Brendan  Boyle, as well as Members from both sides of the aisle for  reintroducing this bipartisan legislation and addressing an important  issue which continues to fuel the Assad regime's coffers and campaign  of brutality.   Despite condemnation from the United States and the international  community, Bashar al-Assad's military has continued its relentless  assault on the Syrian people committing reprehensible crimes against  humanity upon them.   Even as American and European sanctions restrict this regime's  ability to transact and deal internationally, its campaign of brutality  continues to seek sources of revenue around the world.  [[Page H7907]]    One of these illicit sources of revenue is the smuggling of the  narcotic stimulant drug, Captagon, which is trafficked to, in, and  around Syria, and has become a cash source for the Assad regime to  enrich itself and prolong its atrocities against Syrians.   Though initial steps have been taken by the State Department, our  intelligence community, and the Drug Enforcement Agency to work with  allies and partners to counter this traffic, more can and must be done.   So the CAPTAGON Act would require the Federal Government to develop  an interagency strategy to disrupt and dismantle narcotics trafficking  and networks linked to the Assad regime in Syria. It also requires  reporting on such efforts and on coordination with our partners.   This is an important step in ensuring we can use every tool we have  to stop the spread of Captagon in the region and to choke off illicit  revenue for this brutal regime.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the bipartisan group of Members, including you,  Mr. Speaker, for presenting this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support it, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, September 19, 2022.      Hon. Gregory Meeks,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Meeks: This letter is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 6265, the ``Countering Assad's       Proliferation Trafficking And Garnering Of Narcotics Act'' or       the ``CAPTAGON Act,'' that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to forgo       action on H.R. 6265, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 19, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       6265, the ``Countering Assad's Proliferation Trafficking And       Garnering Of Narcotics Act'' or the ``CAPTAGON Act. I       appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R.       6265 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge       that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction.        I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward and will support the appointment of       Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, once again, my colleagues, Representatives  French Hill and Brendan Boyle, for introducing this critical  legislation. I hope all of our colleagues will join us in supporting  it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 558) urging the European Union to designate  Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organization, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 558         Whereas, in April 1983, a Hizballah terror attack against       the United States Embassy in Beirut killed 63 people;        Whereas, in October 1983, a Hizballah terror attack against       the United States Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killed       241 American and 58 French servicemembers supporting the       Multinational Force peacekeeping mission;        Whereas, in July 2012, a Hizballah terror attack, carried       out by an operative with dual Lebanese-French citizenship, in       Burgas, Bulgaria, killed 5 Israeli tourists and 1 Bulgarian;        Whereas, in March 2013, a Swedish-Lebanese Hizballah       operative in Cyprus was convicted of planning terror attacks       against Israeli tourists;        Whereas, in June 2015, a Hizballah operative was sentenced       to 6 years in prison after he stockpiled more than 8 tons of       ammonium nitrate in Cyprus;        Whereas the Hizballah International Financing Prevention       Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-102) and the Hizballah       International Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2018       (Public Law 115-272) broadened financial sector sanctions       against Hizballah to compel foreign financial institutions to       refrain from supporting the terrorist group;        Whereas, in May 2018, the Department of the Treasury       imposed sanctions on Abdullah Safi-Al-Din, Hizballah's       representative to Iran, Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi, a Hizballah       financier, and blacklisted 5 of Bazzi's companies, including       Belgian energy services conglomerate Global Trading Group NV;        Whereas, in October 2018, French police raided the Islamic       Zahra Centre on suspicion of supporting Hizballah, freezing       the organization's funds, and seizing illegal weapons;        Whereas, in September 2020, 4 former leaders of the Zahra       Centre France were arrested on suspicion of continuing to run       the association;        Whereas, in July 2019, the Department of the Treasury       designated 2 Hizballah-backed members of Lebanese Parliament,       Amin Sherri and Muhammad Hasan Ra'd, and Hizballah security       official Wafiq Safa, stating that Hizballah uses its       operatives in parliament to advance its violent activities;        Whereas, as of April 2020, Germany believed there to be       1,050 people with suspected links to Hizballah in the       country;        Whereas Europol's June 2020 European Union Terrorism       Situation and Trend Report outlined that Hizballah is       ``suspected of trafficking diamonds and drugs and of money       laundering via the trade in second-hand cars'', and the       report also stated that ``investigations face the difficulty       of demonstrating that the funds collected are channeled to       the military wing of the organization'';        Whereas United States-led Project Cassandra and Operation       Cedar exposed the criminal-business wing of Hizballah, the       Business Affairs Component (BAC) of Hezbollah's External       Security Organization;        Whereas, during Project Cassandra, Hizballah elements       involved in drug trafficking were arrested in the United       States, South America, and several European countries,       including France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy;        Whereas Hizballah's criminal activity in Europe is run by       the BAC, which reports to the External Security Organisation,       also known as Unit 910, or the Islamic Jihad Organization,       and Abdallah Safieddine, Hizballah's representative in Iran,       is also involved in this activity;        Whereas, in August 2020, United Nations Secretary General       Guterres called on Lebanon to disarm Hizballah, citing the       terror group's persistent violation of Resolution 1701       (2006);        Whereas Iran is the prime sponsor of Hizballah, harboring,       financing, training, and arming the group;        Whereas the Department of the Treasury and Department of       State estimate that Iran provides as much as $700,000,000 per       year to Hizballah in the form of financial and logistical       support, weapons, and training;        Whereas Hizballah now has an arsenal of approximately       150,000 missiles and rockets, many of which can reach deep       into Israel;        Whereas Hizballah fighters have been supporting the Assad       regime in Syria, often leading operations in the conflict       which has left more than 500,000 dead;        Whereas Hizballah's destabilizing actions in Syria have       contributed to a migrant crisis that has brought over 700,000       refugees to Europe;        Whereas Hizballah trains and provides weapons for militias       in Iraq and Yemen, further destabilizing the region and       perpetuating violence in those countries;        Whereas Hizballah activities continue to plague Lebanon       with profound economic and political instability and       violence;        Whereas, in August 2020, at least 220 people died and       thousands more were injured when a massive stockpile of       ammonium nitrate exploded in Beirut's port;        Whereas Hizballah's cross border illicit arms and drugs       trafficking undermines the Lebanese Armed Forces, the       legitimate security establishment of the country as outlined       in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006);        Whereas, in October 2012, Hizballah Deputy Secretary       General Naim Qassem stated that ``[Hizballah does not] have a       military wing  [[Page H7909]]       and a political one . . . Every element of Hizballah, from       commanders to members as well as our various capabilities,       are in the service of the resistance'';        Whereas the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, the       Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Serbia,       and Kosovo, among others, have designated Hizballah in its       entirety as a terror organization;        Whereas, in March 2016, the Gulf Cooperation Council       formally branded Hizballah, in its entirety, a terrorist       organization, and the League of Arab States shortly       thereafter adopted the same designation;        Whereas the Department of the Treasury has diligently added       persons and entities to the list of Specially Designated       Global Terrorists who have provided material support to the       Hizballah terrorist organization, thereby hampering its       financing and logistical capabilities;        Whereas the European Union, in July 2013, designated       Hizballah's so-called ``military wing'', but not the       organization as a whole, as a terrorist organization;        Whereas, despite restrictions put on Hizballah since the       designation of its military wing, the group continues to       conduct illicit narcotrafficking, money laundering, and       weapons trafficking throughout Europe and the world; and        Whereas the House of Representatives has previously called       on the European Union to fully designate Hizballah as a       terrorist organization, passing House Resolution 359 in       October 2017: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) applauds and expresses support for the continued,       increased cooperation between the United States and the       European Union (EU) in thwarting Hizballah's criminal and       terrorist activities;        (2) supports transcontinental efforts within Europe to       share intelligence information among police and security       services to facilitate greater cooperation in tracking,       apprehending, and prosecuting terrorists, foreign fighters,       and potential offenders;        (3) encourages the European Union to implement sanctions       against Hizballah-affiliated terrorists in tandem with the       United States;        (4) recommends greater civil society engagement in both the       United States and Europe to underscore Hizballah's malign       regional influence; and        (5) urges the European Union to designate Hizballah in its       entirety as a terrorist organization and increase pressure on       the group, including through--        (A) facilitating better cross-border cooperation between       European Union members in combating Hizballah;        (B) issuing arrest warrants against members and active       supporters of Hizballah;        (C) freezing Hizballah's assets in Europe, including those       masquerading as charities; and        (D) prohibiting fundraising activities in support of       Hizballah.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 558, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 558, urging the  European Union to designate Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist  organization.   I thank first my dear friend, Ted Deutch, the chairman of our  Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and Global  Counterterrorism for reintroducing this important legislation which  previously did pass the House in the 115th Congress. When Ted departs  our Foreign Affairs Committee in October, we are all going to miss his  voice, particularly on issues regarding the Middle East, and his  tireless advocacy in defense of American interests and those of our  allies around the world.   Now, despite all we know about Hizballah, a murderous, terrorist  organization that also serves as an Iranian proxy in the region, our  friends and partners in the European Union only include Hizballah's  military branch, not its political branch, on its list of sanctioned  terrorist organizations.   The Government of the United States, in contrast, makes no  distinction between its two branches and includes Hizballah in its  entirety on the U.S. foreign terrorist organization list because we  know they are one and the same. The European Union is long overdue in  coming to the same realization.   Congress is pleased that many individual European countries have  acted despite the position of the E.U. as a whole. The Arab League and  the Gulf Cooperation Council have also designated Hizballah in its  entirety. So it remains troubling that the E.U., an organization that  shares so many of our values, interests, and policy goals, continues to  allow Hizballah's political wing to operate freely, advancing  Hizballah's violent agenda around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute and 30  seconds to the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly agree with Representative Deutch. I have  always believed the first principle of foreign policy is to call things  by their proper name. Sometimes we have to be pragmatic in our dealings  around the world, but always start by being honest. Hizballah is a  terrorist organization.  [[Page H7911]]  Say it. The European Union should do so, as well.   Today, we are being heard again on a bipartisan basis--loud and  clear--and I hope the European Union hears our message. I hope my  colleagues will join us in supporting this resolution, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
