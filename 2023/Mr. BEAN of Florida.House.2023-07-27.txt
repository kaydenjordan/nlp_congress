 Mr. Speaker, the new rankings are out, and  Florida is number one. It is not football, although I would understand  one making that assumption. Florida is number one for small business.   According to a recent Venture Smarter's study that considered  numerous factors like business climate, tax structure, and burdensome  business regulations, Florida has just been ranked the number one State  in America.   Today, I rise to congratulate my home State, the free State of  Florida, on this outstanding accomplishment.   In the Sunshine State, we support small businesses to do what they do  best: invest, hire, and grow. When we shop small, we all win big.  Spending your money at that local small business can make a big  difference.   Today, 2.8 million businessowners and entrepreneurs call Florida  home, but, Mr. Speaker, there is room for one more.   Mr. Speaker, if you are considering coming to Florida to open a  business, then I urge you to make a plan. Frankly, you should have a  plan of what to do with all that extra money you will have in your  pocket because Florida has no income tax.   As a member of the House Small Business Committee, I am working to  ensure every small business has the opportunity to thrive and fuel our  economy in communities all across America.                             Honoring Nathalie Wu     Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Small Business  Committee, I rise today to honor Florida's Main Street Award for  Business Owner of the Year, Nathalie Wu.   Ms. Wu is a resident of Nassau County, and I am proud to represent  her in Florida's Fourth Congressional District.   Nathalie opened the wonderful Wicked Bao Restaurant 5 years ago. For  the first time, amazing Asian street food was available to patrons of  downtown Fernandina Beach's historic district.   Delectable and scrumptious are words we use to describe our food, but  what about innovative?   Who knew that tater tots made with rice instead of potatoes--rice  tots--could be so delicious?   That would be Ms. Wu. With her establishment, she has inspired what  was once an overlooked area off the beaten path into a popular  destination.   In addition to serving up delicious treats, Ms. Wu is a steadfast  advocate for local small businesses. She is a Fernandina Beach Main  Street No Cost Ways to Promote Your Business panelist and a prominent  supporter of the Fernandina Beach window painting event, inspiring  local high school artists to showcase their work. She is also an  awesome mother to her two sons, Phillip and Martin Toxldorf.   Ms. Wu's dedication to her business and our community will have a  lasting impact on Fernandina Beach. My colleagues and I on the Small  Business Committee are inspired by her story.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of my colleagues in Congress join me in  honoring Florida Secretary of State's Florida Main Street Award for  Business Owner of the Year, Ms. Nathalie Wu.                            ____________________
