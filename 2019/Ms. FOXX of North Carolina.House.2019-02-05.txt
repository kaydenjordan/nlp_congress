 Mr. Speaker, abortion and infanticide are  not examples of women's healthcare.   Abortion advocates used to say they wanted abortion to be safe,  legal, and rare. Today, they want abortion to be free, casual, and for  newborns.   It is distressing to see the new levels of disregard they hold for  new human lives and how their language has fostered such numbness to  the moral evil of abortion that there is now space in society to openly  promote infanticide.   The Reproductive Healthcare Act, RHA, law being celebrated by pro- abortion activists in New York and Virginia's Repeal Act bill, which is  supported by pro-abortion activists, legislators, and Governor Northam,  are horrifying indicators of that attitude and the spreading culture of  death.   This time, pro-abortionists have gone farther than ever before, by  their own admission. Their actions fly in the face of the limits of  abortion that most Americans support and lay bare the extreme agenda of  the pro-abortion movement. Not only are they bent on the systematic  removal of any protections for the unborn that exist in law, now they  admit that they support infanticide.   The sponsor of Virginia's bill said that a baby could be ``aborted,''  i.e., murdered, as he or she is being born. This should be a moment for  reflection on the reality of the atrocities being committed in the name  of so-called women's healthcare.   These extreme and disgusting advances by abortion advocates expose  the reality of our culture's view of human dignity writ large. Society  can't allow these actions to go unchallenged and still believe that the  culture supports human dignity.   With their language, abortion advocates have been successful at  dehumanizing the unborn and devaluing human life itself. The Repeal Act  would further ensure that the life of a child remains unseen by  repealing ultrasound requirements and the State's 24-hour waiting  period before an abortion. It is as though society's ``ignorance is  bliss'' mentality is a requisite for abortion advocates' agenda to  strip unborn life of protection.   Thanks to the tragic decision of Roe v. Wade, abortion can be  performed in the U.S. in all 9 months of pregnancy for any reason  related to a mother's health. The RHA preserves and expands Roe v.  Wade's guarantees of access to abortion.   In New York, an abortionist no longer need be a licensed physician,  and if an abortion is not successful and the child is born alive, the  law has an absolutely barbaric provision that ensures the child still  dies.   The RHA repeals section 4164 of New York's public health law. That  section required abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy be performed in  a hospital and that abortions performed after 20 weeks have a separate  physician ready to provide medical care for any infant born alive  during the procedure.   This repealed section also protected children born after a botched  abortion and required records to be kept of the infant's medical  treatment. Without section 4164, infants who survive in an attempt to  kill them in the womb have no legal right to life and could be denied  the care they need to live.   It is clear that the value of life has eroded in our culture. Without  a society that questions ``what are the rights of the unborn?'' New  York and Virginia legislators can use their power to eliminate the  right to life and promote the idea that life is dispensable, even in  the case where a child is viable and the mother's life is not in  danger.   Nothing warrants the evil of infanticide, yet calling abortion  healthcare has become a widespread and acceptable justification for a  woman to choose abortion over life. Meanwhile, supporting unborn life  has come to mean being against women's choices.   As a woman and proud pro-lifer, I reject this deceptive language and  the false narrative it perpetuates. I also encourage proponents of the  New York and Virginia legislation to ask whether these policies reflect  a society where women are truly valued or where unwanted babies are  indefensible.  [[Page H1354]]    Finally, in a culture where aborted babies are collateral damage in  so-called women's healthcare, we should all fear that, following unborn  children and newborns, there will soon be new targets for disposal.                            ____________________
