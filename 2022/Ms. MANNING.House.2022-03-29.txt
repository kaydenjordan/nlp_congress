 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for yielding me  this time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Securing a Strong  Retirement Act.   Today, too many workers face difficulty saving for retirement. Even  for those who have access to retirement plans, it can be difficult to  grow and protect hard-earned savings.   There are roughly 55 million Americans who lack access to a  retirement savings plan at work, with many lacking any retirement  savings at all. This is particularly true for women. Approximately 50  percent of women ages 55 to 66 have no personal retirement savings,  compared to 47 percent of men, and only 22 percent of women have  $100,000 or more in savings, compared to 30 percent of men.  [[Page H3947]]    Women are also more likely than men to work in part-time jobs that  don't qualify for a retirement plan and are more likely than men to  quit work, transfer jobs, or interrupt their careers to care for family  members, resulting in lower retirement savings.   This is why I am proud to have my bill, the Improving Part-Time  Workers Access to Retirement Act, included in this important  legislation. This provision will make it easier for long-term part-time  workers to access retirement by shortening the amount of time they are  required to work for their employer in order to participate in their  401(k) plan. This will have an important impact on the ability of women  and low-wage workers to be able to save for retirement.   As a member of the House Education and Labor Committee and a strong  supporter of college affordability, I am also pleased that this  legislation will allow borrowers the option to pay down their student  loans while still receiving an employer match in their retirement plan.  This commonsense approach to retirement savings will help the nearly 46  million Americans facing student loan debt become more financially  stable while overcoming the barriers too many in our country face upon  graduating, like advancing in their career, buying a home, or starting  a family.    SECURE 2.0 will help workers save more longer, improve flexibility  and protections for Americans' retirement accounts, and eliminate some  of the barriers small businesses face in providing comprehensive  retirement options to their employees.   These are bipartisan, commonsense provisions that will better serve  workers and employers across our country. I strongly urge my colleagues  to vote in favor of this critical legislation.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Fletcher for  holding this very important session.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the healthcare providers who  have dedicated their lives working to ensure equitable access to  reproductive healthcare.   Today I am honored to highlight the work and courage of Susan Hill of  North Carolina, the former president of the National Women's Health  Organization in North Carolina, and a fierce advocate for abortion  access and reproductive rights.   Susan opened clinics across the country to ensure that women could  access the healthcare they need, including abortion care, with dignity  and safety. She focused her work on providing reproductive health  services in the Southeast, despite onerous restrictions, so that  pregnant women could make the best healthcare decisions for themselves  and their families no matter where they lived.   In fact, Susan Hill founded Jackson Women's Health Organization,  which is now the last remaining health center providing abortions in  Mississippi. This very clinic is at the center of the case directly  challenging Roe v. Wade that is currently before the Supreme Court.   If the Court decides to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and gut  Roe, it will be overturning nearly 50 years of judicial precedent and  undermining women's fundamental right to make their own personal  decisions about their bodies, their families, their futures.                                time  2000    Susan Hill never wavered in her commitment to protecting patients'  autonomy and safety, even as anti-abortion protestors used arson, fire  bombing, and countless acts of vandalism to intimidate her into closing  down her clinics.   Today, the stakes for reproductive freedom are more dire than ever  before. Extreme abortion bans and medically unnecessary restrictions  are sweeping our country and posing an enormous threat to women's  health and constitutional rights. Decimating abortion access diminishes  our equality under the law.   The consequences of these egregious attacks most acutely impact  communities of color and underserved communities which already face  barriers to healthcare.   Healthcare cannot just be for the few, as the legacy of Susan Hill  reminds us. All people deserve access to the reproductive care they  need, free from political interference, discrimination, and harassment.   Years ago, I spoke on a panel about abortion rights with a physician  who had done his residency in Philadelphia before the passage of Roe v.  Wade. He told us about his experience working in the emergency room,  trying to save desperate women who were near death from botched back- alley abortions, women who suffered irreparable damage, women who  didn't make it.   And he told us that history has shown there will always be abortions.  The only question is whether abortions will be safe and whether they  will be available to those who are faced with terribly difficult  choices.   We must ensure that all people have the right to control their own  reproductive decisions, and have the right to the reproductive  healthcare they need.   I am proud to recognize a fellow North Carolinian, Susan Hill, and to  share her commitment to ensuring that abortion rights are protected,  and comprehensive reproductive healthcare is accessible to all who need  it.
