 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first, this  resolution--and I am just going to make a few key points here--is on  the trade agreement with the UK, and it is a question of international  trade, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.   The committee has not been consulted on the resolution so Senators  have not had adequate time to consider it. Needless to say, the  prospect of reshaping the American economy with sweeping trade deals is  not something that should just rocket past the committee of  jurisdiction.   Second, I have serious concerns about blessing a potential trade  agreement with the United Kingdom when the contents of such an  agreement are still unknown. I stated a number of times that there are  serious issues that need consideration with respect to our economic  relationship with the United Kingdom. That cannot happen if the debates  play out in a slapdash process on the floor of the Senate.   For example, the United Kingdom has not only proposed but implemented  a discriminatory digital service tax since entering negotiations with  the United States. What they are doing is opportunistically looting  American technology companies before these measures are shut down by an  FTA or another agreement. The UK is also considering other  discriminatory policies.   The UK must commit to abandoning these unfair policies, which are  serious barriers to trade, a detriment to the special relationship,  harmful to American workers, as a precondition of honest and worthwhile  negotiations.   Otherwise, if Senators are going to rush to hand out big promises on  trade talks, they risk surrendering America's negotiating position on  these key issues without getting anything in return.   So I don't see the wisdom in undermining good-paying American jobs  and American businesses with a trading partner that has thus far seen  no reason to back away from discriminatory measures. For those reasons,  I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Wednesday, June 16; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that upon the conclusion  of morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Fox nomination; further, that the cloture vote on  the Griggsby nomination occur immediately following the cloture vote on  the Fox nomination, and that if cloture is invoked on either  nomination, the confirmation votes occur at 3:15 p.m. in the order that  cloture was invoked; finally, that if any of the nominations are  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:43 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, June 16, 2021, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
