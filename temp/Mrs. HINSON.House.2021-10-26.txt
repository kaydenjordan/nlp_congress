 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and the  passing of a hero with deep roots in the tight-knit community of  Waukon, Iowa, Iowa State Patrol Trooper Ted Benda.   On October 14, Trooper Benda was on duty, answering the calls of  citizens in northeast Iowa, when he experienced a tragic accident. He  later passed from his injuries on October 20.   This is the devastating loss of a father, a husband, a son, a friend,  a mentor, a dedicated public servant who made it his life's mission to  keep his community safe in Iowa.   This tragedy is a reminder that brave law enforcement officers often  sacrifice for a purpose greater than themselves. So I join all Iowans  in mourning the loss of Trooper Benda, and my heart is with his family,  his friends, and fellow troopers during this very difficult time.                            ____________________
