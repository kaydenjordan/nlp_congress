 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1594, the First  Responder Access to Innovative Technologies Act.   With threats to our communities constantly evolving, it is reassuring  to see the emergence of new technologies ready to meet the new  challenges. However, emerging technology is frequently developed faster  than voluntary consensus standards can be implemented.   Recipients of grants under FEMA's State Homeland Security Grant  Program and Urban Area Security Initiative must procure equipment that  meets these standards. This can be problematic when first responders  seek to use grant funds to acquire new and innovative technology that  does not meet or exceed any applicable national voluntary consensus  standard.   Unfortunately, if a grant recipient would like to use grant funds to  purchase such equipment, FEMA does not maintain a uniform process for  reviewing these applications. H.R. 1594 requires FEMA to develop such a  process for reviewing these requests.   This legislation also directs FEMA to implement a uniform process for  reviewing applications to purchase equipment not included on the  authorized equipment list maintained by FEMA.   It is imperative that we listen to those in the emergency services  sector and help enable them to acquire the tools that they need to save  American lives and keep us safe. We must empower them to acquire the  equipment they need for their jobs and provide them with a uniform  process to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and I support our first responders.  These brave men and women run into danger as everyone else runs away  from it. We owe it to them to create processes that make their jobs and  their lives easier. They have our backs on our worst days. We should  have their backs on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1313, the Transit  Security Grant Program Flexibility Act.   The Transit Security Grant Program directly supports transportation  infrastructure security activities by providing funds to owners and  operators of transit systems. Whether they be bus systems, ferries, or  passenger rail, this grant program aims to protect and increase the  resilience of critical surface transportation infrastructure and the  traveling public from acts of terrorism.   H.R. 1313 codifies the performance period for use of grant funds and  allows additional time for large-scale capital security projects. This  bill also allows grant recipients to use their awards to pay for the  cost of backfilling personnel attending necessary security training.   This important legislation, introduced by my colleague on the  Homeland Security Committee, Congressman Pete King, will further assist  in keeping our communities safe against the threat of terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  join me in doing so.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H3758]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1437, the Securing DHS  Firearms Act of 2019. This bill makes some much-needed improvements to  address the security of firearms at the Department of Homeland  Security.   A DHS Office of Inspector General report from October of 2017 found  that the DHS and component personnel misplaced over 2,100 highly  sensitive assets, including 228 firearms, and 1,889 badges between the  fiscal years of 2014 and 2016.   The statistics from the OIG report and the lack of accountability for  DHS personnel that fail to safeguard sensitive assets is startling. DHS  performs a critical national security mission. It is unacceptable that  DHS has deficiencies in the training personnel receive on how to  properly safeguard and track sensitive assets like firearms.   H.R. 1437 follows the recommendations made by the OIG in its report  and requires the under secretary of management at DHS to issue a  directive to ensure the Department and its components adequately  safeguard sensitive assets.   H.R. 1437 also mandates DHS to revise its Personal Property Asset  Management Program Manual to require recurrent training and appropriate  procedures to secure assets in accordance with the DHS directive.   The Securing DHS Firearms Act of 2019 puts into place important steps  to ensure that DHS is appropriately safeguarding sensitive assets while  conducting its critical mission. This much-needed bill is identical to  legislation passed in the 115th Congress by a voice vote.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Correa for introducing this  legislation, and I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1912, the DHS  Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act of 2019. This legislation  requires the Department of Homeland Security to better document its  major acquisition programs that are essential to keeping America safe.   While every Member of Congress will agree that protecting our Nation  and its citizens is vitally important, we must also agree that  protecting taxpayer dollars and ensuring accountability for the  government agencies is also essential.   The Government Accountability Office assists Congress in its efforts  to ensure accountability by producing a report every 2 years that  identifies areas in the Federal Government that are at high risk of  waste, fraud, and abuse. Major acquisitions by DHS have consistently  been identified by the GAO as high risk.   This legislation requires DHS to improve management of its major  purchases of systems to secure the border, provide screening for  travelers, and protect our shores, and for our other vital missions.   Too often, DHS has failed to document what these programs will cost,  when they will be completed, and what they will deliver. It is  unacceptable to spend billions of taxpayer dollars and not document  this important information.   To address these issues, DHS has updated its acquisition policy to  follow corporate best practices. However, it must take additional steps  to ensure its components adhere to these policies.   H.R. 1912 provides important tools to ensure that these policies are  being followed. It will improve visibility into DHS major acquisition  programs and promote better management of DHS acquisitions of items  that are expected to cost more than $300 million.   Under the bill, the Undersecretary for Management must require the  relevant component or office to maintain documentation that provides  validated operational requirements, a complete lifecycle cost estimate,  an independent verification of that cost estimate, a cost-benefit  analysis of the program, and a complete schedule for the acquisition  program.   With this documentation, Congress and other government watchdogs will  be able to conduct necessary oversight to ensure that taxpayer dollars  are being spent efficiently and effectively.   This bill passed the House of Representatives by voice vote in both  the 114th and 115th Congresses.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Torres Small for reintroducing  this language, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1892, the Quadrennial  Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019.                                time  1645    In the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of  2007, Congress required the Department of Homeland Security to conduct  a security review every 4 years. As the threats to the United States  change and evolve, it is more important than ever for DHS to produce a  robust strategy to protect the American public.   The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, or QHSR, is intended to  outline DHS' strategic outlook in its plan to successfully carry out  its mission to protect our homeland. Thus far, DHS has produced two  QHSRs since the requirement was established: one in 2010 and its most  recent one in 2014. We are currently awaiting the release of the 2018  QHSR, which is quite a bit behind schedule.   The Government Accountability Office has reviewed both reports and  made recommendations on how DHS could improve its efforts for future  quadrennial reviews. In its 2016 review of the most recent QHSR, the  GAO  [[Page H3762]]  made several recommendations to strengthen the QHSR process, which are  the basis of this legislation.   H.R. 1892 requires DHS to perform a risk assessment to shape the  direction and the focus of QHSR. Second, the Department would be  required to collect and maintain communications related to the QHSR to  allow for better congressional oversight. Finally, DHS would be  required to enhance its stakeholder engagement throughout the  development of QHSR.   The result of these changes would be a more robust strategy that  provides a roadmap for DHS to address future threats as they emerge and  allows Congress to better execute its oversight responsibilities.   This language passed the House with wide support last Congress but,  unfortunately, was not taken up by the Senate.   I continue to believe that this is an important piece of legislation,  and I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) for  reintroducing it.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this commonsense bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2066, the DHS Intelligence  Rotational Assignment Program Act of 2019.   I want to commend the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher) for  introducing this legislation.   The goal of H.R. 2066 is to establish a robust rotation program for  intelligence analysts across the Department of Homeland Security. As a  former intelligence officer, Representative Gallagher certainly  understands the value of robust, interagency intelligence cooperation.   This legislation addresses specific shortfalls within the Department  of Homeland Security where the different component intelligence offices  do not reliably coordinate and analysts from one agency are rarely  detailed to another.   This bill was originally introduced last Congress and received  overwhelming bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to support the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, establishing a rotation program for intelligence  analysts from individual DHS component intelligence offices is  essential for building a robust DHS intelligence enterprise.   I applaud Congressman Gallagher for his work on this issue, and I  want to thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member   Mike Rogers for  bringing this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
