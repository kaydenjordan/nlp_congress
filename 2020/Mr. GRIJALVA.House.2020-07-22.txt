Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 1957.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In February of 2019, I flew to Arizona from Washington to speak about  my bill to permanently protect the Grand Canyon from uranium mining. We  wanted to publicly release the legislation on the rim of the canyon to  show firsthand the lands that we were attempting to protect.   Unfortunately, the weather had other ideas. That night, before the  event, it snowed more than it had in decades. But by some small  miracle, the roads were clear, and we found an easy pathway into the  park. We made it in time and even found some rangers to help us set up  in the snow.   Tribal leaders representing people who have called that land their  home for a millennia joined us at the event. Standing there with them  on the edge of the amazing canyon millions of years in the making and  glistening in the snow, it was hard not to be moved.   Looking out over the Grand Canyon, you are reminded why we as a  Nation have dedicated ourselves to protecting the unique and enduring  landscapes around us. Nowhere else on Earth is there a sight quite like  the Grand Canyon, or, for that matter, like Yosemite Valley or  Yellowstone National Park. These places are gems of our National Park  system, and they show who we are as a people.   We are judged on what we choose to pass on, and today we have an  opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to preserving these lands for  the future and for future generations.   In a few short minutes we will vote on the Great American Outdoors  Act, a bill to significantly increase conservation spending in the  United States. For too long we have allowed our National Parks to fall  into disrepair. We have underfunded maintenance while park visitation  has skyrocketed. At the same time, we have failed to meet the full  promise of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We have been diverting  half of this conservation funding stream to other uses for which this  money was never intended.   Today, we take the opportunity to remedy both those failures. The  Great American Outdoors Act provides $1.9 billion per year to maintain  our National Parks and public lands, ensuring that special places like  the Grand Canyon are accessible to all Americans as they were to me on  that February morning.   The law will also make an enduring commitment to protecting green and  flourishing open spaces by providing $900 million annually to the Land  and Water Conservation Fund.   This funding will mean more parks for inner city families. It will  allow us to protect forests, wetlands, and marshes from the destruction  of climate change. It will help protect lands around the National Parks  from inappropriate development and will expand recreational access and  opportunity for all Americans. Combined, these two major programs  amount to one of the biggest wins for conservation in decades.   We all know that not everyone here agrees about the value of these  programs. In fact, we disagree almost daily on how best to protect the  landscapes of our Nation.   But I hope today we can move past those political differences and to  honestly consider the value of conservation and the importance of  stable, predictable funding.   We have a generational opportunity to ensure America's crown jewels  are protected. We have a unique chance to ensure that every tool is  available to help us respond to the climate crisis, so that we can  protect those landscapes that best protect clean water, clean air, and  healthy green spaces.   This bill is a major win for the American people, decades in the  making, I might add. I have pursued it for years. Some of my colleagues  have pursued it for years. This didn't happen overnight.   Now, during a time of national disillusionment, it is perhaps more  necessary than ever to demonstrate that we can still bridge the divide.   When it comes to passing along this Nation to our children and to  theirs, we can still work together to find common ground.   This bill goes beyond politics. It is about ensuring that we pass  along a legacy of public lands stewardship and conservation to future  generations, so they, too, can marvel at the Grand Canyon covered in  snow.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham), a sponsor of the legislation,  companion legislation to the Senate bill.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cox), a member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa), the senior member of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Haaland), who is vice chair of the full Committee of  Natural Resources and chair of the Subcommittee on National Parks,  Forests, and Public Lands.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Neguse), a member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin), a valued member of the Natural Resources  Committee    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), an effective member and a leader on the  Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the next speaker, let me  echo the words of Mrs. Dingell. John Dingell was indeed a warrior on  behalf of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Today is a culmination  of those efforts in which he played such a huge role, and I would be  remiss in not thanking him and Debbie Dingell.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson), who is a leader in conservation and access to our public  lands.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Mucarsel-Powell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Richmond).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), our distinguished Speaker, whom I thank for  helping guide this important piece of legislation to the floor and to a  vote today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan) and thank her for her work on environmental  justice legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. McAdams).                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close when the gentleman  from Utah is done with his speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the process of this legislation reaching this point on  the floor to be voted upon has, to those of us involved, been  difficult. It has been frustrating. Yet, the possibility of it being  done was always there, and that was the goal. I think the overwhelming  support in the Senate for a clean bill to come to the House was  bipartisan.   I think today would have been--I didn't feel it was necessary to  engage in the same arguments that we have been engaging about with the  Land and Water Conservation Fund in particular and the backlog. This  legislation is not about robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is not about  taking money from the East to give to the West. It is not about denying  coastal States their share.   If we do transition, as we transition, which we need to urgently, to  clean energy in the future, future Congresses, I think, will have the  foresight to look at this legislation and deal with how we move forward  with it and continue to fund it.   When I went to visit Land and Water Conservation Fund sites, I went  to a park in south Phoenix, the only green space and recreation area  for close to 8,000 families who live in that general area, Land and  Water Conservation Fund; and when I went to other locations in urban  areas across this country, Land and Water Conservation Fund.   That continues to be a priority for reasons of public health, equity,  and access.   Mr. Speaker, in a strange procedural trick of the House, we have  spent this afternoon debating the Great American Outdoors Act, but the  bill we refer to as H.R. 1957 began as something else.   H.R. 1957 was originally a bill to protect taxpayers by ensuring fair  treatment under the law. It was introduced back in March 2019 by our  late friend and colleague, Representative John Lewis.   Now, I can't personally speak to Representative Lewis' thoughts on  conservation spending. But I do believe our late friend would be happy  with the work that we have done here today and the vote that we are  about to take.   Representative Lewis truly believed in a government by and for the  people, all the people. He challenged us to leave petty partisanship at  the door and to consider the essential pursuit of justice and equity  that we have long sought and failed to meet in this country.   I am proud to have called Representative Lewis my friend. I am proud  that we can honor his legacy with the passage of this bill.   There is much work left to be done to ensure real equity and justice  in the United States, and I look forward to working with all my  colleagues across the aisle in continuing that work in the future.   But when we come together as we have today, as the people's  representatives working toward the common goal of protecting future  generations, then perhaps there is hope we might see Representative  Lewis' vision realized.   I thank all of my colleagues who spoke on behalf of this legislation.  I thank leadership for bringing it to the floor and all the members of  the committee and Members not on the committee who worked very hard to  bring this legislation forward. It is historic. It is important. It is  necessary. And it is an essential step. I urge us to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 1957.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
