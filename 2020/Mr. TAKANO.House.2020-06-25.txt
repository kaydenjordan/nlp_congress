 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act. This is necessary and bold legislation that  includes critical provisions to hold police accountable and to save  lives. It includes a ban on no-knock warrants that would have saved  Breonna Taylor's life, a ban on chokeholds that would have saved George  Floyd's life, and the prohibition on racial profiling that would have  saved Rayshard Brooks' life.   Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, and so many other  innocent Black lives were ended by law enforcement officers, who often  faced little to no consequences for their actions.   This bill also reforms qualified immunity for law enforcement, which  is a barrier to achieving justice for victims of police brutality. The  Senate majority's idea of compromise is to strip this section out of  the bill. I say no.   A police officer has held his knee to George Floyd's neck for 8  minutes and 46 seconds, leading to his death. This atrocious act has  finally forced us to confront the racism deeply rooted in our  institutions.  [[Page H2470]]    Congress must act. Vote ``yes'' on the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act.
