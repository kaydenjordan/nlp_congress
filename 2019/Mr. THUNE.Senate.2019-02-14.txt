 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later today, we hope we will have an  opportunity to vote on legislation that will fund the government and  provide much needed support for border security. While no agreement is  perfect and not everybody gets everything one wants, this makes a  significant downpayment on a border wall as well as on other border  security measures. At the same time, it funds all of the appropriations  bills for this fiscal year.   I hope, as our Members review the text, they will have an opportunity  to conclude that we will be able to get the votes that will be  necessary to move the legislation through the Senate and, hopefully,  ultimately, through the House and to the President and that the  President will be able to sign it into law. So stay tuned on that.  Hopefully, that will all transpire later today.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Burr).
