 Madam Speaker, I am delighted to welcome to this  Chamber Father John P. Fitzgibbons, who delivered today's opening  prayer.   A native of Omaha, Nebraska, he entered the Wisconsin Province of the  Society of Jesus in 1973, and he was ordained as a priest in 1985.   Like all good Jesuits, Father Fitzgibbons has dedicated his life to  God and to education. He currently holds bachelor's degrees in  philosophy and English, two master's degrees in theology, a master's in  English, as well as a Ph.D. in English.   He had stints teaching at Creighton and Marquette Universities, and  he served as the dean of the College of Professional Studies at the  University of San Francisco. He would later return to Marquette  University to serve as the associate provost for faculty development.  In 2012, he was appointed the 24th president of my alma mater, Regis  University.   Madam Speaker, I thank Father Fitzgibbons for his 26 years in  education, his 34 years as a priest, and his 46 years of dedication to  God. It has been a tremendous pleasure having him here today.                            ____________________
