 Madam Speaker, I speak in opposition to the unprecedented  and unauthorized impeachment of the President of the United States.   Since the day after the 2016 election, many of my colleagues have  vowed to impeach President Trump and have since spent more than two  years searching for a reason to do it.   Today, they have brought forward two articles of impeachment based on  unfounded accusations of abuse of power and obstruction.   Despite a lack of evidence, an unfair process and no bipartisan  support, my colleagues across the aisle have barreled toward  impeachment, ignoring or delaying key priorities like the US-Canada- Mexico Agreement along the way.   This is a sad day and the fact remains that this effort seeks to  overturn the 2016 election not based on evidence, but on a disdain for  President Trump.   I will vote against the articles of impeachment before us because I  think the American people deserve better from the House of  Representatives.   So on behalf of hardworking Kansans in the Fourth District and  Americans across our country, I call on my colleagues to vote against  articles of impeachment and focus on priorities that matter like  growing our economy, supporting our veterans and military, lowering  prescription drug costs, and helping Americans prepare for jobs and  retirement.   That's what the American people sent us here to do and it's time we  got back to work and beyond this shameful impeachment.
