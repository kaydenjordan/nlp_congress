 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about some friends of  mine.   Roxie Raines Kornegay Allison. Roxie Raines Kornegay Allison, my  across-the-street neighbor for nearly 30 years, died of COVID last  Thursday night at 6 o'clock. Roxie has been kind of the matriarch and  the pillar of our little four-block-long neighborhood.   We have the annual party in the median in October, and Roxie kind of  presides. She has been sort of the caretaker, always taking care of a  family member or a friend.   One of the first persons who reached out to me when Roxie passed was  a city councilman in Pasadena, CA, who had heard instantaneously. He  used to be the deputy police chief in Richmond. He said: When I moved  to Richmond, I didn't know anybody. Roxie was the one who kind of  adopted me and showed me the ropes in Richmond.   Roxie was a pioneer in Virginia government, making opportunities for  African Americans to get hired in key positions--a civil rights leader  in the State.   My wife and I and our whole neighborhood are just absolutely  devastated by the loss. My wife and I were talking about: How old do  you think Roxie is?   We always viewed her as sort of our age because she is so vigorous  and fun and lively. She is 20 years older than my wife and me.   Three days before Roxie Raines Kornegay Allison died, another  neighbor of mine, Sheila Mandt, who was 55 years old, died of COVID.  Sheila was a dynamic activist in the Richmond community, with a real  heart for nonprofit organizations that focused on the needs of  survivors of domestic violence. She had done pioneering work in that  area and worked with other organizations too, like the Salvation Army  and others.   She was married for a long time to another friend, Chris Hilbert, who  had been a member of the Richmond City Council.   Three days before Sheila Mandt died of COVID, Patsy Arsenault died of  COVID in Richmond. Patsy is the mother of my parish priest, Father Jim  Arsenault. It is a tiny little parish in Richmond, and Patsy has been  very much a part of our parish community.   So in 8 days, three people that I know died of COVID. And this  morning, I heard early in the morning that another dear friend--and I  am not going to mention his name, but another dear friend of mine--is  in the hospital with COVID and on a ventilator. He is somebody I know  very, very well. I officiated at his wedding about 15 years ago, when I  was Governor.   I am a healthy and wealthy and privileged person, so if this is  happening to me in my network of friends and family, I know it is  happening to others. I think this now makes nine people I know who have  died of COVID.   I was on the phone yesterday with Taiwan's representative to the  United States--representative is essentially their equivalent of the  Ambassador. She told me that Taiwan has had nine COVID deaths--dozens  of miles from China. They have had nine COVID deaths. I haven't gone  back to check that, but my wife and I have nine friends and family,  including the mother-in-law of my brother, who have died of COVID.   We had 3,406 deaths yesterday in the United States to COVID.  Basically, beginning on about December 20, the daily death toll in the  United States to COVID has virtually every day eclipsed the number of  Americans who were killed on 9/11. We have now eclipsed 447,000 deaths  to COVID.   So my own feelings of sadness about my friends are just shared in  common with everybody. Everybody has been touched by this--knowing  somebody who is ill, knowing somebody who has died, maybe having COVID  themselves,  [[Page S284]]  maybe having lost a job, maybe having lost a business, maybe having not  been able to go see a parent or grandparent in a nursing home or not  been able to travel to see a brandnew grandchild. This touches  everyone. It doesn't touch everyone equally. Those getting COVID and  those dying of COVID are predominantly minorities. Those losing jobs to  COVID are predominantly minorities, young people working at the lowest  end of the salary scale.   So why do I take the floor to talk about Roxie and Sheila and Patsy  and my other friend who I just learned this morning is on a ventilator  in the hospital? I take the floor because this, to me, is just evidence  underlined with an exclamation point that we have to act promptly to  provide a suffering nation more COVID relief, and we shouldn't be  stingy about it. We have to be bold about it because the amount of  suffering people in this country are undergoing is still so staggering,  nearly unprecedented.   The scale of the problem is so big, the health scale of the problem-- that many deaths and millions having had COVID; the economic scale of  the problem--we are still down 10 million jobs from where we were 1  year ago, and that is with some significant recovery occasioned by the  investments that Congress has been willing to make in the first five  bills that we passed. Even with those having had significant effect on  our States and communities, we are still down 10 million jobs. And then  we are also down in the intangibles. It is not just the number of  cases, the number of deaths, the number of hospitalizations, the number  of businesses that are closed, and the number of people who have lost  jobs; it is the scale of sadness and unhappiness and the consequences  that will go on for some significant period of time that we are still  living under.   Here are two examples, and I could give 50, just as any Senator who  stood on the floor could give 50 examples because we are all hearing  this. The mental health needs of frontline healthcare workers--I had a  Zoom session with doctors and nurses around the State not long ago, and  the stories just break your heart.   One nurse said: You know, I am used to death. I mean, this is what I  do. I have been a nurse for 20 years in this hospital, and I am sort of  used to maybe one death per week on the shifts that I work. I am not  used to three deaths on a shift day after day after day.   Another nurse jumped in from a different part of the State and said:  That is right. Let me tell you what the hardest thing is for me.   The nurse said this: Maybe the most important thing I do as a  healthcare provider is, when somebody is dying in the hospital, I  escort their family into their room so that they can have some last  moments together as a family sitting around the bedside and holding  their hand or exchanging memories with their parent or their spouse or  a child or a sibling. You can't do that now. People dying from COVID-- because of exposure risk, I can't make this place sort of a sacred  place for family to say a last goodbye, so it is up to me to do it. I  have to go in there, and I am wearing a mask; I can't even smile at the  person. I am probably not even supposed to hold their hand, but I do  anyway. And then what I do is I bring in my iPad, and I hold it a few  inches from the dying person's face so that they can have an end-of- life discussion with family members who can't be there at their bedside  and be there with them.   The nurses who told me this said this is really tough. It is tough to  do it day after day after day and be the last person on Earth who so  many people are seeing and trying to manage that really intimate and  important sacred moment between a dying person and their family when  they are gasping their last breath.   A third nurse then cut in and said: All those things are true. Let me  tell you, for me, what is the hardest for my mental well-being in terms  of doing this every day. I do what the other two have just described,  and then I get done with the shift, and I am just beat, and I don't  want to take that home to my family.   I don't want to take that frustration and depression home to my  family, so I drive around for a while until I can kind of clear my  head. Invariably, when I am driving around, I will go by someplace like  a restaurant or a bar, and I will see a whole lot of people there with  each other without masks on, people who think the mask thing is fake or  it is a political thing, and they are making a statement by not wearing  a mask and not following basic health guidelines.   After the day that I have gone through and the challenge to my own  mental health in seeing this, I see that happening, and I am like: You  are going to be in the hospital next week. Do you know what you are  doing to yourself? Do you know what you are doing to your family? Do  you know what you are doing to me? I am going to be having to hol that  iPad in front of your face or maybe somebody else you are with as they  talk to family.    The healthcare needs of our frontline healthcare workers who have  been besieged by this pandemic--they are not going to go away the day  we say we are past COVID. The challenges people have endured to be the  heroes we claim them to be are not just going to immediately go away.  Part of this COVID relief bill needs to be about keeping our own  healers healthy.   A second example I will give quickly is housing. Thank goodness, in  the COVID bills thus far, we have been able to find some bipartisan  agreement to extend evictions--put a moratorium on evictions, put a  moratorium on foreclosures for properties that have some Federal  connection, financed through, you know, Fannie or Freddie, or FHA. If  they have a Federal nexus, we provide an eviction moratorium.   OK, that is really important, but what about when we get to the end  of the moratorium? Families have big obligations that are backed up.  Maybe they lost jobs or lost income. Can they come current then on  their obligations when we are done with the moratorium, or will they  then face eviction? After they have gone through the unimaginable of  COVID and now we are past it, will they then face eviction because  their resources will not be sufficient to catch them up with their  back-due obligations?   It is not just the residents. What about the landlords? So many  landlords of rental properties are small business owners, and they  provide housing to families, and they have to pay off mortgages too. We  also want them to keep the properties up, to keep them safe, to keep  them habitable, to keep them as dignified places where people can live,  but if rent isn't coming in to them, how can they pay off their own  obligations? How can they keep up the quality of housing where people  live?   I could have talked about the needs of the unemployed or the needs of  people who use childcare. At one point in the summer, 40 percent of  childcare institutions in this country were closed down. That makes it  so hard to open our businesses. I could have talked about the  tremendous needs of small businesses. Thank goodness it has been a  bipartisan priority in all the bills we did in 2019 to prioritize small  business assistance. These needs are intense.   There are some positive signs. Hospitalizations and cases are  starting to go down even though the death toll remains high, but this  challenge--we are not done with it. We are not near done with it, and  that is why we have to go big, in my view, and that is why we have to  do it with a sense of urgency.   I want to conclude and just say that the budget reconciliation tool  that was part of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is about doing  big things with a sense of urgency. I am getting asked sometimes by  press, as I wander around: Should you use reconciliation, or should you  try to be bipartisan?   I said: Hold on a second. Reconciliation isn't partisan.  Reconciliation was a part of the Budget Control Act put in place 35  years ago, and budget reconciliation has been used for some of the most  bipartisan, positive achievements of Congressmen in recent decades.  CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, was done with  reconciliation. The earned income tax credit was done with  reconciliation.   Reconciliation is a tool. You can use it in a bipartisan way or in a  partisan way. It has also been used in a partisan way. The effort to  undo the Affordable Care Act was done by reconciliation with no support  on the Democratic side of the aisle. The tax cut bill in 2017 was done  via reconciliation with no support  [[Page S285]]  on the Democratic side of the aisle. But choosing the path of  reconciliation is not the opposite of bipartisanship.   I so applaud President Biden and Vice President Harris for their  earnest dialogue with our Republican colleagues, and I applaud my  Republican colleagues for going to the White House and talking about  what should be in this bill because as they share their priorities,  they are going to shape this bill.   Without having seen the bill--I know no one has--I can make a  guarantee about this bill, and I am 100 percent sure I am right about  this. When this bill hits the table and the negotiation is done and  before we have a final passage vote on it and we analyze what is in the  bill, we are going to see so many priorities in this bill that are not  just Democratic priorities but that are Republican priorities, too,  things that were drawn from bills that Republicans introduced or that  Republicans cosponsored with Democrats, things that were raised by  Republican Senators in their dialogue with President Biden and with us.  We are going to see a bill that meets the need of Americans who are  suffering to do something big and to do something urgent and includes  priorities that were Republican Senators' priorities, that are good for  Republican voters, and that are good for all Americans.   So this is the second time I have done a floor speech where I have  gone over the names of people whom I know who died of COVID. I don't  want to do a third speech. I don't want to do a third speech. I think  it is important to say people's names so we remember them and we honor  them. But the best way we can honor them is not through a floor speech;  the best way we can honor them is acting in a compassionate and prompt  and significant way to ease the suffering of Americans during this most  unprecedented time.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
