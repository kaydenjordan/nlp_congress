 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    After the announcement that was made this morning--it was  a great announcement, long awaited--I think it is appropriate that we  talk a little bit about it. When Trump withdrew from the Paris  Agreement and pulled back from the Clean Power Plan, we heard from the  environmental extremists and the liberals declaring that the  administration's actions will ``endanger public health, our environment  and our economic prosperity.'' That was Governors Brown and Cuomo. They  further declared that ``if we don't decarbonize our future, people are  going to die.'' People are always going to die. That is what the  extremists always say. I guess there must be a population out there  that actually believes that.   However, the opposite is happening even without a one-sided  international agreement or the punishing Clean Power Plan. In effect,  in 2017, the United States led the world in CO2 reductions,  while China and India led the world in increasing CO2  emissions. How many people know that? All you ever hear about is that  we are the guilty one in terms of our emissions. That is not true at  all. Just think, both China and India led the world in increasing  CO2 emissions. These are the guys our previous President,  Barack Obama, would have us believe were actually making great  sacrifices, and here they are leading in increasing CO2  emissions.   When we passed tax reform, the Democrats claimed we would experience  ``Armageddon''--Nancy Pelosi said that--and taxes on middle-class  families would increase. As we have seen, tax reform has been a  resounding success, with 4 percent unemployment and nearly 4.1 percent  GDP growth in the last quarter.   Right after Congresswoman Pelosi made the statement that taxes would  increase on all middle-class families, the Washington Post fact-checked  the Democratic claims, giving them four Pinocchios, as 80 percent of  middle-class families are paying less in taxes. In other words, 80  percent of middle-class families are paying less in taxes now than they  were. Yet she was saying that taxes on all middle-class families were  going to have to increase.   You hear these things--they can't look at success and see what is  happening and really appreciate it without rousing everyone on the  other side with extreme accusations. With every Executive order and  Congressional Review Act resolution that rolled back regulation after  burdensome regulation, we heard that the end of days was coming.   Let's pause here for a minute and see how you get rid of some of  these regulations. There are two ways of getting rid of regulations.  One is you do it with an Executive order. Sometimes that doesn't work.  You can't use an Executive order in certain types of regulation, so you  have to go with the Congressional Review Act.   It is kind of interesting because we started the Congressional Review  Act over 20 years ago. Prior to this administration, it had been used  successfully only once in 20 years; now it happens almost every day.   With every Executive order and Congressional Review Act resolution  rolling back the regulations, we heard that the end of the world was  coming. You would not know it if you looked at the economy and saw what  is happening in this country today with the increases in energy  production, manufacturing, consumer confidence, GDP, and job  opportunities.   Meanwhile, jobless claims have dropped to a 45-year low--a 45-year  low of jobless claims this year--and the Social Security disability  claims last year were the lowest we have seen since 2002.   I think it is kind of interesting to go back and look at the fact  that we have 4 percent unemployment. For as long as I can remember, I  have always considered 4 percent unemployment full employment. There  are always going to be some unemployables, but 4 percent is considered  to be full employment, and that is what we have.   It is kind of interesting. I was in Texas last week, talking to one  of my liberal friends down there. I said: What can you say now? Look at  the economy. The economy has never been better.   He said: No, the economy is bad. It is hard to find anyone to work in  restaurants anymore.   In other words, we have full employment, but that is supposed to be  bad. That is the position we are in right now.   In the last quarter, we had 4.1 percent growth in the economy. Let's  stop and think about that. This is something that no one disagrees  with. For every 1 percent growth in economic activity, that translates  into $2.9 trillion of new income coming into the Federal Government  every 10 years.   Let's stop and think about it. We have a President who is trying to  undo the damage from the last administration when the military was cut  down to the bone and we didn't do anything in the way of  infrastructure. This President is committed to that.   People are saying: All right, where is the money going to come from?  [[Page S5750]]    There is where it is going to come from. My gosh, if we can average  just 3 percent growth--and we have been doing that; we are far  exceeding that--that is going to be close to $6 trillion of new funding  that will be there for the next administration.   With each action the President takes, we hear that the consequences  are going to be dire and that people will die. It is always that people  will die. Yet those predictions have never materialized. We have seen  the opposite happen.   When it comes to President Trump's pick to replace Justice Kennedy on  the Supreme Court, the predictions are just as hysterical. If there is  not any logical reason to be against something, they just start name- calling. That is what has been happening.   In a recent speech, Hillary Clinton worried that with the nomination  of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Republicans ``want to turn the clock back . .  . to the 1850s.'' That came from Hillary Clinton. Her meaning was very  clear. She wants people to believe that Judge Kavanaugh and the  Republicans are taking the country back to the days of slavery, despite  no evidence to back up this reckless claim. In fact, Republicans want  more freedom, not less.   Others are equally as bold in their predictions in saying that his  confirmation will be the death--listen to this--the death of millions,  that his confirmation will be the destruction of the Constitution, and  that his confirmation will usher in the end of civil rights in America  and make us complicit in evil. In other words, it will be the death of  millions of Americans. Who, logically, can even look at that without  smiling and saying that they have to be totally desperate in the  accusations they are making against this guy? All of these baseless and  extreme attacks on his nomination mean just one thing--that Judge  Kavanaugh is an excellent pick for the Supreme Court.   After meeting with him last week, looking into his record, and  reading about his character--some of the stories that I have heard from  other people--it is clear that he is a solid choice to become our  newest Supreme Court Justice. With 12 years on the DC Court of Appeals,  Judge Kavanaugh has amassed a record of over 300 opinions, and the  worst opposition research we have seen against him so far is that he  charged baseball tickets to his credit card and then paid for them.   By all accounts, from those who know him, Judge Kavanaugh is a  respected member of his community and of his profession.  Professionally, he is known as a serious jurist who studies the law and  is evenhanded in applying the law.   In his op-ed for the New York Times, entitled ``A Liberal's Case for  Brett Kavanaugh,'' Yale Law professor Akhil Reed Amar made this  statement: ``Good appellate judges faithfully follow the Supreme Court;  great ones influence and help steer it.'' He was referring to Judge  Kavanaugh. By this measure, Judge Kavanaugh has been a great appellate  judge.   He ranks second among the current judges who have law clerks who have  gone on to clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court. More impressively, the  Supreme Court has agreed with the positions that Judge Kavanaugh took  in the last 13 of his opinions, adopting his logic in the prevailing  opinion before the Court. In other words, they came down on his side in  the cases that he had decided in the last 13 of his opinions. Nine of  those times, the Supreme Court adopted his dissenting opinion as their  majority opinion. In fact, he has been reversed by the Supreme Court  only once and only in part.   Of those dissenting opinions by Judge Kavanaugh that the Supreme  Court adopted as their own, one of them includes his dissent in  Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA, in which he concluded that  the EPA defined ``air pollution'' too broadly in its regulations on  greenhouse gas emissions. He viewed the Obama EPA's burdensome  greenhouse gas regulations for powerplants as exceeding its authority  and argued that the courts should ``not lightly conclude that Congress  intended'' to ``impose the enormous costs on tens of thousands of  American businesses, with corresponding effects on American jobs and  workers.'' Again, the Supreme Court agreed with him. They were on his  side.   This opinion is also instructive to see his thinking on the proper  role of the courts in our system of government. In his opinion, he  wrote: ``As a court, it is not our job to make the policy choices and  set the statutory boundaries, but it is emphatically our job to  carefully but firmly enforce the statutory boundaries.'' This is a  consistent part of his jurisprudence.   Because of his position on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge  Kavanaugh has had many opportunities to check the Federal Government's  overreach. I served as chairman of the Environment and Public Works  Committee for quite a number of years, and one of the big problems we  had at that time was that the bureaucrats were actually making the  determinations. This is where he has actually overruled the bureaucracy  many times. In fact, he has overruled Federal agency actions 75 times  in his 12 years on the bench. That is really saying something.   When the EPA wanted to impose massive emissions regulations but did  not want to consider the costs, Judge Kavanaugh rejected that effort in  White Stallion Energy Center v. EPA. The Supreme Court agreed.   In the case of EME Homer City Generation v. EPA, Judge Kavanaugh held  that the Obama EPA's cross-state air pollution rule was awful and  imposed excessive regulatory burdens on the States.   He also rejected the Department of the Interior's position to  designate 143 acres of plaintiff's property as critical habitat for a  shrimp based ``on a single 2001 sighting of four ant-sized San Diego  fairy shrimp'' on the property. They would shut that down. He reversed  it.   These are just a few examples of Judge Kavanaugh's efforts to ensure  that our agencies are acting and regulating within their authorizing  statutes and the U.S. Constitution.   This is the real reason we are seeing such vitriol from the left.  They have long used our courts and our agencies to impose their  unpopular agenda, mostly because they couldn't get it through Congress,  as the majority of Americans recognized how stifling and burdensome  their agenda is.   Having another judge on the Supreme Court who recognizes the proper  role of the courts and the agencies when it comes to setting policy  that affects all Americans threatens their ability to force costly,  ineffective, unpopular burdens on our economy, our job producers, and  our landowners. With Judge Kavanaugh on the court, we will preserve the  U.S. Constitution and our system of representative government for  decades to come.   As I told Brett in our meeting--he has been good enough to go around  and have meetings with all of the Members of the Senate. As a matter of  fact, I told him that, from his reputation, he didn't need to waste his  time with me because I knew all about him, and I was going to support  him. As I told him during that meeting, though, his nomination and the  work President Trump and the Senate have done to process judicial  nominations are to save our country, not for me but for my 20 kids and  grandkids.   So I look forward to the confirmation. We are going to hear more of  the accusations, more of the extreme left making comments about this  great judicial success. I look forward to having him there for many  years to come. I am convinced that it is going to happen.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute today to two  exceptional Oklahomans and patriots, retired Army Chief Warrant Officer  Michael ``Tony'' Dunne of Webber Falls, OK, and retired Army Chief  Warrant Officer Brandon ``Ray'' Seabolt of Skiatook, OK. On August 14,  2018, both were awarded the Office of the Secretary of Defense Medal  for Valor, the highest civilian award presented by the Department of  Defense.   On August 7, 2015, Tony was working at Camp Integrity, just north of  Kabul, Afghanistan, executing duties as contractors for the Department  of Defense when a potent vehicle-borne improvised explosive device  impaled the main gate and knocked down a guard tower. Without  hesitation, Tony rushed to the fight and evacuated a wounded  servicemember from the scene, undoubtedly saving their life. From his  actions that day and others, Tony has been honored for exceptional  gallantry in repeatedly putting himself in harm's way to assist in  countering multiple insurgent threats, helping to save lives at the  risk of his own.   On December 17, 2015, Ray was serving as a counter-IED expert in  congruence with U.S. Special Forces and Afghan partners when they were  ambushed by enemy fire. Without regard for his own life, Ray jumped to  action and single-handedly fended off the insurgent onslaught, allowing  the recovery force to approach the scene with little resistance. Ray  has deservedly been recognized for his bravery and confidence in  supporting multiple engagements with the enemy with devastating effects  and for providing tactical advice and assistance in the successful  recovery of servicemembers.   Oklahoma is truly honored and proud to claim Tony and Ray, two  patriots that exemplify the ultimate in bravery and courage in support  of our country's most critical national security missions both at home  and overseas.   Created in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the Medal for  Valor recognizes government employees and private citizens who perform  an act of heroism or sacrifice, with voluntary risk to their personal  safety in the face of danger. Tony and Ray's well-deserved medals,  along with one other awarded on August 14, bring the total number of  Medals for Valor to 17 awarded since September 11, 2001. This  exemplifies the recognition of immense sacrifice that this small group  has made for our Nation. Now, Tony and Ray's names will permanently  reside in the Pentagon's Hall of Heroes, distinguished among our  Nation's best.                            ____________________
