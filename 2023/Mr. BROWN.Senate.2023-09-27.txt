 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, sometimes we come to the floor in maybe a  less serious vein. We are all incredulous that while we do our work  here and keep the government open, the people down the hall there are  playing political games and threatening a shutdown. And when 55,000  people in my State and probably 10,000 people in the Presiding  Officer's State will lose their jobs temporarily, will be furloughed,  will be laid off, all because they are trying to play political games,  we talk about that a lot. We need to fix that.   But, today, I want to rise for a moment on something more  lighthearted than that, and that is to honor the retiring manager of  the Cleveland Guardians, Terry Francona, called in Cleveland--referred  to as ``Tito'' Francona.  [[Page S4711]]    Cleveland will play their last home game with Tito as their manager  starting in maybe 20 minutes from now, something like that. Tito has  been a part of the team since 2013.   I call him by his first name. I don't know the Cleveland manager. I  have never met the Cleveland manager. But I have watched him. I watch a  lot of games on television. But we all refer to him by his first name,  ``Tito.''   I was at a game earlier this summer, and we were pulling out in a  traffic jam, and Tito does what I have read in the Plain Dealer that he  does. All of a sudden, he passed us. The game was about an hour over,  and he rode by on his little scooter to his little Cleveland  condominium downtown, just the manager by himself.   (Mr. OSSOFF assumed the Chair.)   He didn't have airs about him. He is a normal guy, and we will  really, really miss him.   In his baseball career, he left Cleveland. He was the manager in the  2016 World Series, where my daughters and my wife and I--they broke our  hearts in game 7 to a team like the Chicago Cubs. And it was really  amazing that there was a rain delay in the ninth inning, and then they  came back and Cleveland lost in extra innings.   A week later, Donald Trump was elected. So I don't think it was a  good week for the country. But that is just my biased opinion, perhaps.   But in Ohio, in Cleveland, if you are a Cleveland Guardians fan, you  know about perseverance. His baseball career extends back to when he  joined Major League Baseball as a player. Spending 9 years in the  field, he played a year for Cleveland, but he is a baseball lifer. But  his life is very inextricably linked to Cleveland, as a baseball player  and manager.   I am not sure he was born in Cleveland. He lived in Cleveland when  his dad played for the Cleveland Indians in the old Municipal Stadium.  Notably, his dad twice was traded for Larry Doby, the first African- American player in the American League and one of the Hall of Fame  members because of his baseball play, his courage, his guts, and his  note of being so important to history and breaking the color line.   I grew up watching his father play. I saw his father, once in a  double-header, get seven hits. And the eighth time he came to the  plate, Brooks Robinson--the third base player from the Orioles who just  passed away--Brooks Robinson threw him out. He would have been 8 for 8  in a double-header.   As I said, his dad was traded twice for Larry Doby. His dad, one  year, should have led the league at hitting, at .363 but was  disqualified because he had one too few plate appearances. He batted  399 times instead of 400, even though he walked a number of times--too  much inside baseball, maybe, for the Senate floor and for my colleagues  to care about.   But his dad played for years and was an All-Star in 1961. He hit .363  in 1959 and was a fan favorite.   So the Francona family was formed in Cleveland and grew up in  Cleveland in that sense. It reminds me of how baseball is a game that  spans generations and brings people together.   I grew up 2 hours south of Cleveland. My dad used to take us to Major  League Baseball games, to five or six games a year--five or six times a  year, often double-headers. And my dad hated the New York Yankees so  much that he would never take us to a Yankees game because he didn't  want Mickey Mantle, the star of the Yankees, to get 10 cents of his  ticket. So I never saw the Yankees play until I could drive myself to  New York.   When Tito Francona joined the Montreal Expos in 1981, he succeeded  his father as a baseball player. He played in Cleveland for a year. In  1990, he retired from the game and not a particularly stellar baseball  career, not as good as his father's.   But then he became a manager. He managed the Phillies. He managed the  Red Sox in two world championships. He then came home to us in  Cleveland in 2013. In 2016, Cleveland won the American League  Championship with the Indians--now, of course, the Guardians. He led  the team to the World Series.   As I said, game 7 was quite an experience that I could take my  daughters to, then in their thirties. And we had gone to baseball  games. And my dad took me for years, and we got to see this team we  loved and this team we followed so closely go to the World Series--a  team that wasn't considered at the beginning of the season World Series  caliber. And it was quite a season.   And the next year, Cleveland came back. They, at one point, won 22  games in a row. Only once in Major League Baseball did a team win more  than that, when the Giants, in 1926, won 26 in a row. So it was an  incredible streak.   But more important, his players reached a level of excellence that  was beyond what most people think was their skill level. Cleveland, to  owners that have never spent the money--owners in the Presiding  Officer's home State, in Atlanta, they try to buy pennants like the  Yankees do and the Mets do and the Dodgers do and the Red Sox do. They  spend so much money to try to buy the best players. Cleveland has never  had owners that were either that rich or that generous. So Tito had to  figure out how to win without that kind of money.   But what he has done, which I so much like, is he gets out of his  players a skill and a drive that most managers are not able to achieve.  You can tell he loves America's game. I mean, he shared that with all  of us.   He loves the city where his team plays and where he manages. He has  been there for 10 years, in Cleveland. I guess 11 years.   His players could have gone somewhere else and made more money. The  star player for Cleveland, a young man named Jose Ramirez, signed a  long-term contract, made a whole lot of money, but everybody said he  could have made so much more money if he had gone to New York or  Atlanta or L.A. or Boston and signed huge contracts with really rich,  generous owners. I think his players want to play for him, and he  helped put our team on the map again.   I just wanted to say to Tito Francona, thank you for everything you  have done for Cleveland. Thank you for the memories and the joy you  have brought so many of us as fans.   We celebrate his contributions to baseball, his commitment to  Cleveland, and his extraordinary career.                            Remembering Tom Conway    Mr. President, on a much more serious note, I want to honor a friend  of mine who passed away this week, a national leader of stature who  made such a difference in working people's lives.   I come to this floor to talk about the dignity of work, to talk about  people who put their lives on the line and put their careers front and  center about workers. Tom Conway did that.   Tom Conway passed away in the last few days, the president of the  United Steelworkers. He joined the labor movement in 1978. He worked as  a millwright. ``Millwright'' means those workers who essentially fix  and make equipment work inside plants. He worked at the Burns Harbor  Works of Bethlehem Steel in northwest Indiana.   Forty years ago, 45 years ago, he joined Local 6787. He dedicated his  life to expanding opportunity and economic security for workers.  Whether on a picket line or sitting across from the steel executives,  his values were on his sleeve. His commitment to workers never wavered.   On trade issues and worker safety, always one of the first calls I  made was to talk to Tom Conway, to get wisdom from Tom Conway, to get  perspective from Tom Conway, because I knew always he was looking out  for the workers whom he represented.   Steelworkers in Ohio knew what those bad trade deals--from NAFTA to  PNTR with China, to TPP, to CAFTA--all the issues that, frankly, are a  big part of the reasons my State has struggled with so many lost jobs.   Given this devastation, Tom saw across the industry. You might  understand if he became a pessimist, threw up his hands, and gave up.  He was never that--far from that. He drew his energy from the  resilience of American steelworkers and steel communities across the  Midwest.   He knew what we know in Ohio, that American workers can compete with  anyone. They just need a level playing field. He never stopped fighting  for that level playing field, for fair trade, for real investment in  American industry, for strong enforcement of our trade laws.   Because of his advocacy and the advocacy of so many Ohio  steelworkers, we made real progress. We passed the  [[Page S4712]]  original Level the Playing Field Act, the landmark overall of our trade  remedy laws, to allow steelworkers to fight back against cheating by  China, against dumping steel from China, against other unfair foreign  competition. We passed the strongest ever ``Buy America'' rules to  ensure that American tax dollars support American workers.   He never gave up on American steel. He never gave up on American  workers. He saw the potential in this union to grow. He knew that, if  more people carried a union card, their lives would be better. It would  mean higher wages and better benefits. It would mean a more secure  retirement. It would mean a safer workplace. It would mean more control  over your schedule. That is what carrying a union card means.   My wife will say that her dad's union card saved her life. She grew  up and at 16 had an asthma attack. She lived almost 2 hours from  Cleveland Clinic. She got an ambulance to take her to the clinic. She  was there for a week. It saved her life. Her dad could afford that  care, that ambulance, that time in Cleveland Clinic because he carried  a union card, and they negotiated for healthcare benefits. That is what  Tom Conway did his whole life.   I wear on my lapel a pin depicting a canary in a birdcage. The  mineworkers used to take the canary down in the mines a hundred years  ago. If the canary died, the mineworker was on his own. He knew that he  didn't have a union strong enough or a government that cared enough to  protect him. That is why he carried the canary down into the mines.   This was given to me by a steelworker some 20 years ago in Lorain,  OH. I have worn it on my lapel ever since. And that is what Tom Conway  is about.   John Shinn, the secretary-treasurer of USW said: Solidarity wasn't  just a word to Tom. It was a way of life. He understood that, by  working together, we balance the scales against greedy corporations.   We see it now. Chrysler, now called Stellantis, has made $12 billion  just in calendar year 2023. Stellantis' CEO makes 800 times what the  entry-level worker at Stellantis makes.   Tom Conway understood that we fight against that kind of worker  greed, and we help lift up workers so they can share in the wealth  created by their work. Balancing those scales is what unions are all  about. It is why autoworkers are in that picket line. That is what they  are doing. It is what Tom Conway led the steelworkers to do.   We honor his memory, his legacy best by carrying on his life's work.  His successor at USW is Dave McCall, fellow Ohioan. Dave McCall worked  with and has known Tom Conway for over 40 years. He will serve out the  remainder of his term. I can't think of anyone better to carry on Tom's  legacy than Dave McCall.   Dave and I have been in the trenches together for the better part of  our entire careers, walking picket lines, talking to Ohio workers at  union halls and fighting against bad trade policy that this body far  too often falls for because corporate lobbyists swarm this place and  push these bad trade agreements, always, always, always at the expense  of workers.   Dave McCall understands the dignity of work, as Tom did. He spent his  whole life fighting for it. He would have made Tom Conway proud.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Tom Conway today. Our  thoughts are with his family, his longtime partner Carol, his three  sons and six grandchildren, and with steelworker sisters and brothers  in Ohio and around the country.   I yield the floor.
