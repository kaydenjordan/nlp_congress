 Mr. Speaker, 50 years have passed since the historic  Stonewall riots in New York City which brought us one step closer to  full equality for all Americans. But as we wrap up Pride Month and  celebrate all we have accomplished over the last five decades, I want  to take this time to raise the issue of hunger in the LGBTQ community.   A study by the Williams Institute at UCLA found that more than one in  four LGBTQ adults did not have enough money to buy food for themselves  or their families in the past year. That is an alarming number. It is  more than double the national food insecurity rate.   The average SNAP benefit only provides about $1.40 per person per  meal. That only covers a fraction of an individual's meals. While many  households go to food pantries to fill the SNAP gap, some of these food  banks and pantries are affiliated with groups that may not accept  people for who they are. That is because discrimination due to sexual  orientation and gender identity is everywhere. In more than half of  the country, there are no explicit Statewide laws that protect people  from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in  employment, housing, and public accommodations.    This type of discrimination has real consequences. LGBTQ Americans  are much more likely to end up homeless, particularly as kids and  teens, and are more likely to live in a food desert where they have  trouble purchasing nutritious food nearby.   As if this weren't bad enough, these numbers are even more  devastating across racial demographics. For example, in the LGBTQ  community, a staggering 42 percent of African Americans, 33 percent of  Hispanics, and 32 percent of Native Americans reported being food  insecure. That is unconscionable, and it is unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, this is not some abstract problem. These are our  friends, these are our family members, our neighbors, our classmates,  and our coworkers. We should be uplifting and supporting them, but the  numbers don't lie. Our country is facing a full-blown hunger crisis and  the LGBTQ community--and, in particular, communities of color within of  it--are bearing the brunt of that crisis. We cannot allow their stories  to be erased or muted.   We must work together to address interconnected issues like housing  and hunger by gathering more data on how to specifically respond to  these problems. We must increase outreach to these communities so that  everyone who qualifies for hunger assistance programs can access  benefits.   Sadly, instead of working to solve this problem, this President and  his administration have tried to roll back the clock on equality.  Whether it is blocking questions related to sexual orientation or  pushing half-baked rule changes to enact a definition of gender, which  would essentially erase people from our official population counts,  they are working overtime to threaten the rights of Americans.   But we are working overtime to stop them. Last month the House passed  the Equality Act which aims to extend civil rights protections to all  Americans, regardless of gender identity and sexual orientation.  Passing this bill into law would play a key role in addressing hunger  in the LGBTQ community. I am proud that the House has taken action, and  I urge the Senate to do the same.   This is Pride Month. As we celebrate the progress that our country  has made, let us also remember all of the work we have to do to end  hunger now.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 460 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H.

The first reading of the bill       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations.

The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions.    Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to my good friend, the gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Monday night, the Rules Committee met  and reported a rule, House Resolution 460. It provides for  consideration of H.R. 3351 under a structured rule that makes 46  amendments in order, with 1 hour of general debate controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.   It also provides for consideration of H.R. 2722 under a closed rule  with 1 hour of general debate provided, controlled by the chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee on House Administration. It  also provides same-day authority through the legislative day of  Thursday, June 27, 2019, relating to appropriations measures.   Madam Speaker, this underlying package of bills is proof that this  Democratic majority is committed to getting its work done both for  routine matters like appropriations and emergency priorities facing our  Nation.   Take the first measure, H.R. 3351, the Financial Services and General  Government Appropriations Act. This builds on our efforts to fund the  government for fiscal year 2020 in a timely way. Instead of hollowing  out important investments like past Republican majorities have done,  this Democratic majority is investing in our future.   This legislation not only ensures both the executive and judicial  branches can continue to operate for the American people, there is also  language here to protect consumers from dangerous products and help  small businesses thrive, especially in distressed communities.   Most notably, Madam Speaker, this bill provides hundreds of millions  in grants to strengthen the integrity of our election system. This is  especially important since, if left to his own devices, I don't think  our President would even acknowledge that there is a crisis of  confidence in our elections following Russia's meddling in 2016, let  alone act so it never happens again. He seems content to welcome future  interference rather than prevent it, so it is especially important that  this Congress takes the lead to protect our democracy.  [[Page H5092]]    That is why we are also moving here to consider H.R. 2722, the  Securing America's Federal Elections Act. The Mueller report made clear  that Russia waged an all-out attack on our elections. Putin put his  thumb on the scale for President Trump, and intelligence officials have  made clear that he and others are trying to attack us again in the next  election.   I want to repeat that, Madam Speaker, in case the President happens  to be watching. Our very democracy is under attack. No troops have been  sent into combat. No guns have been fired, but a foreign adversary is  turning the internet and the ballot box into battlefields with the  integrity of the vote at stake.   It is beyond me why this President has not acted as if this is a  national emergency. Instead, he said the other day that he thinks he  would take campaign dirt about an opponent from a foreign government.  You can't make this stuff up, Madam Speaker. That is like leaving the  front door wide open when you know there is a burglar in town. He is  not preventing future acts, he is encouraging them.   Before my friends on the other side chalk this up to a slip of the  tongue, let me remind them that his own former communications director,  Hope Hicks, testified recently that she believes he is serious about  accepting information from a foreign source.   This President may not be stepping up to secure our elections, but  this Democratic majority is. This bill would enact things like verified  paper ballots, cybersecurity upgrades, and State grants to secure  voting systems.   This majority passed H.R. 1 in the opening months of this Congress.  That package includes reforms to fix our democracy. But under Leader  McConnell, the Senate did with it what it seems to do best: nothing.   He refused to even bring H.R. 1 up for a vote. Now, I don't know why  Leader McConnell is ignoring the warnings from our intelligence  officials or why he seems content with weaknesses in our election  systems. Maybe he is unwilling to ever break from Donald Trump on  anything, even something this important, which really is quite sad. But  I hope this time he will try something radical for the Senate: have a  vote. Bring this bill up so the American people can see whose side you  are on.    Lastly, Madam Speaker, this bill also gives us flexibility to deal  with an emergency of a different kind--the one this President is  creating on our southern border. President Trump's policies have led to  children sleeping on concrete floors, dirty and hungry with no access  to soap or even a toothbrush, sometimes left to be cared for by  children just a few years older than they are. It is hard to believe  that this is happening in the United States of America today.   This House will act, and I hope the Senate does the same thing. I  encourage all my colleagues to vote for this rule and the underlying  legislation, so we can do our jobs and act on these important issues.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I would like to say for  the record that when it comes to this piece of legislation, the  Financial Services appropriations bill, Democrats actually did much  better than the Republicans did when they were in charge.   In fact, we made more amendments in order. We made more minority  amendments in order than the Republicans did when they were in charge.  In fact, there is a 57 percent increase, in terms of minority  amendments being made in order compared to what they did.   Let me also point out for the record that my Republican friends, I  think, tend to be a little redundant in the amendments that they offer.   For example, I think they submitted three amendments on the wall. We  make one amendment. Do we have to debate the wall three different  times?   On spending reductions, four amendments were submitted. We make two  in order, which is probably two too many. We should have made one in  order.   The bottom line is, there is a habit of just offering the same old,  same old, again and again and again. Quite frankly, the minority will  get its opportunity to debate these issues but not over and over and  over again.   Let's also get to the substance here. The gentleman said these are  two unrelated bills. Well, I disagree. The Financial Services  appropriations bill actually funds the Election Assistance Commission,  and the other bill we are considering, the SAFE Act, authorizes the  Election Assistance Commission at the same amount that is in the  appropriations bill. They are very much intertwined.   Let me also say, I expect that, before the day is out, we will do a  supplemental emergency bill to deal with the crisis that this President  has created at the border.   Let me also be clear that what we want to make sure is that, when we  provide the funding, this cruel treatment of children at the border  comes to an end.   This administration's deliberate policy of separating children from  their parents, of allowing children, almost infants, to sleep on cold  floors, to be denied basic necessities like soap and toothpaste and  toothbrushes, I mean, it is child abuse. It is unconscionable, so we  want to demand that this administration stop it.   This is the United States of America. I think the American people are  horrified at the inhumanity that they are reading about that is  occurring to these little children at our border.   It is unbelievable. I never thought that we would ever be on the  House floor talking about how children who have fled some of the worst  conditions imaginable are being so mistreated at the border.   So, yes, we will have a supplemental appropriations bill to deal with  it, but we are going to demand that the cruel policies of this  administration stop and stop now.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.  Welch).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Vermont.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I always enjoy listening to my Republican colleagues debate on the  floor. And I always love listening to the gentleman from Illinois when  he is on the House floor.   But I can't help but think of the fact that the Russians attacked our  elections in 2016. The 2 years after that, the House was controlled by  Republicans. The Senate was controlled by Republicans. Donald Trump, a  Republican, was in the White House. They had a unified government; the  House, the Senate, and the Presidency.   And all of our intelligence agencies said that Russia interfered in  our elections; they attacked our democracy; not only the Obama  administration's intelligence officials, but the Trump administration's  intelligence officials.   And what did my Republican friends do in the aftermath of this attack  on our democracy by a foreign adversary? Nothing. Nothing.   We hear all these great ideas, but while they had a unified  government, while they were in control of everything, they did nothing.  In fact, I recall sitting here on the House floor and listening to  Republican after Republican after Republican basically say that this  was much ado about nothing; in fact, trying to deny that Russia  attacked our elections.   Now the evidence is so overwhelming you can't deny it anymore. But  yet, they had this opportunity. And now they say we all want to protect  our elections.   Well, 2 years prior to this, I don't know where you were, but you  weren't working trying to protect our elections. People were working,  instead, to try to cover up for what a foreign adversary did to our  elections.   So here we are, coming forward with a bill that we believe will  provide security for our elections so that people believe that the  elections have integrity, they believe the results. And we are told  well, we disagree with you, and we have better ideas; on and on and on.   Bottom line is we are acting. My friends had 2 years to act. They did  nothing.   Our Democratic majority went through regular order on this. The  Committee on House Administration held three hearings on election  security. In case anyone forgot, they were on February 14, May 8, and  May 21.   In addition to those hearings, the Subcommittee on Elections  conducted field hearings in six States, while the Committees on  Oversight, Homeland Security, and the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence held hearings on the subject.   So experts testified. People offered their viewpoints. And after all  of that, the House Administration Committee marked up this bill last  Friday, on June 21, and here we are on the House floor.   So, I mean, give me a break. I get it. Some of my Republicans friends  may be ``Johnny-come-latelies'' when it comes to the issue of election  security. We welcome you on board, because our elections are important,  and we need to protect them from interference from foreign adversaries  like Russia.    But you had 2 years of unified government in which my friends did  nothing, nothing.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the gentleman was talking about appropriations that  were approved in the last Congress.   A lot of the ideas that we are talking about here today, including  some of the ideas that Mr. Davis raised, are authorizations, and so  they can't be taken care of in an appropriations bill, and that is why  we are doing a separate bill in addition to the appropriations bill.   The gentleman talks about the $300 million that were approved under  the previous leadership. Well, we are asking for $600 million. We are  doubling that because we know how serious it is.   And just forgive us if we are a little bit concerned, because we have  a President who continues not to acknowledge that the Russians  interfered in our election. He continues to refer it to as a Russian  hoax. He took Vladimir Putin's word for it rather than the word of our  intelligence agencies.   So when we express concern about our election process and about the  lack of attention given to this, we are responding to what the  President of the United States, Donald Trump, says on a weekly, if not  daily basis.   The fact of the matter is Russia interfered in our election.  Everybody knows that. The only person who is in denial is at 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue. So we need to respond, and we need to respond  appropriately.   Madam Speaker, I say this to my friend again, that we expect,  hopefully today, to bring up a supplemental appropriations bill to be  able to deal with what I would call the Donald Trump-created crisis on  the border.   And, by the way, as we provide funding, which I believe we will do to  deal with some of the issues on the border, let us be clear: there is  absolutely no excuse at all for how this administration has allowed  children to be treated in such an inhumane fashion under our custody,  children being denied soap, children being denied toothpaste or  toothbrushes, children so young and separated from any adult who are  being cared for by children only a couple of years older.   I mean, everybody should be horrified by that. There is no excuse,  none at all, for that to be happening.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman trying to articulate the  best he can all that the Republicans did on this issue when they were  in the majority, but I will be very honest with him: I am unimpressed,  and so are the American people.   The bottom line is my friends had unified government, Republican  control of the House, Senate, and the White House for 2 years, and  basically they did nothing.   The President, the leader of their party, routinely and continues to  do so today, refers to Russian interference in our election as a  Russian hoax. The leader of our country says that it is a hoax.   So I understand why there was inaction for the previous 2 years, but  that ends because Democrats, Republicans, Independents, people of all  political persuasions deserve to have an election system that has some  integrity.   I look forward to passing this bill, and I am urging the Senate to do  the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I urge, obviously, support for this rule and the  underlying bills that will be debated.   As we are sitting here debating, we just got some news that Acting  Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Agency John Sanders has  submitted his resignation. I guess the public pressure is so great that  it is untenable for him to continue in that position, and I am sure the  President will replace him with somebody else.   The problem is the President keeps on replacing individuals with  people who continue to enforce policies that are cruel, policies that  separate children from their parents at the border, and policies that  treat children worse than animals in our custody, but I thought it  would be interesting for my colleagues to note this breaking news.   Madam Speaker, it is true that we have an ambitious agenda before us  this week, and we believe in doing our job and holding the  administration accountable. We aren't going to leave the threat of  another shutdown for another day. Maybe that is what my Republican  friends did when they were in charge, but that is how we ended up in  one shutdown after another.   And, yes, we wish we had an agreement on the caps, but it is not for  lack of trying. We have been trying to negotiate with the Senate since  we took control of the House of Representatives. We have been trying to  negotiate with the President since we took control of the House of  Representatives. But every time we sit down with the President, he has  a temper tantrum or he behaves in an erratic way and leaves the room.  We can't wait, so we are going to lead, and hopefully they will follow.   And we are not going to ignore the threats posed by Russia and others  to our elections. The President wants to cozy up to Putin instead of  defending this Nation, but this majority doesn't believe in  prioritizing the egos of dictators. We believe in accountability and  restoring the integrity of the vote.   My friend says, well, this isn't going anywhere. Well, look, we are  happy to negotiate with Republicans in the Senate, but where is their  bill? Basically, the Republicans in the Senate are following the lead  of the Republicans in the House and the previous Congress in doing  nothing.   We don't believe in doing nothing. We think our elections are  important, that they are worth defending, so we are acting. These are  serious matters, Madam Speaker, and this is why we  [[Page H5099]]  were sent here, and this is what we intend to tackle.   I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous question. I  urge them to vote ``yes'' on the rule and the underlying legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.    When the Committee of the Whole rose on Monday, June  24, 2019, amendment No. 244 printed in House Report 116-119 offered by  the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman) had been disposed of.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 462 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 462         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3401) making       emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted.       The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during       consideration of the bill. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations; and (2) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 462, providing for consideration of  H.R. 3401 under a closed rule. One hour of general debate has been  provided, controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Appropriations.   Mr. Speaker, I have fought for human rights my entire career. As co- chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, I have seen troubling  conditions abroad, but never in my wildest imagination did I ever think  I would see such inhumane conditions here at home, all because of the  President's cruel and failed immigration policies.   We have children today at border facilities forced to sleep on  concrete floors, with the lights kept on 24 hours a day. They are not  being given soap, diapers, or even a toothbrush. Lice combs are being  shared. Bottles aren't able to be washed. In some cases, children are  being supervised by other kids not much older than themselves.   This is happening in America today because of the choices made by  President Trump. It is horrific. This is child abuse, plain and simple.   In a document obtained by ABC News, one physician who visited  recently described the conditions there by saying: ``The conditions  within which they are held could be compared to torture facilities.''   Torture facilities, Mr. Speaker, at the behest of this  administration. This should sicken every single American.   This administration seems to relish this and use the lives of these  children as political theater. The President even had the audacity to  claim, ``We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.''   Are you kidding me? Lives are being torn apart. There were some  children who we know will never be reunited with their families, who  are being locked in cages and forced to endure inhumane and unspeakable  conditions.   There is a special place in hell for those who are ripping children  from the arms of their mothers, putting them in cages without even a  blanket, arguing that they shouldn't even get basic necessities like a  toothbrush.   If your heart doesn't break, if you don't want to do everything you  can to end this, then you should really take a hard look in the mirror.  This majority doesn't agree with the President's policies. We will not  turn a blind eye to this humanitarian catastrophe.   This bill delivers billions to provide necessities like food, water,  and blankets, and it will also fund things like legal assistance and  support services for unaccompanied children and refugees.   There are also strict limits here on influx shelters. It protects  sponsors from DHS immigration enforcement based on information  collected by HHS during the vetting process. It creates strong  oversight by Congress, including to protect unaccompanied children.   This legislation also reverses the administration's senseless  decision to block the humanitarian funding that Congress has already  appropriated for the Northern Triangle countries.   At the same time, we do not provide a single penny for the  President's failed mass-detention policy. There are humane alternatives  here instead because we are not going to help this President continue  this cruelty.   Mr. Speaker, this is not a perfect measure, but this isn't a big  immigration bill. This is an appropriations bill. I want to recognize  the extraordinary leadership of Chairwoman Lowey, Chairwoman DeLauro,  and Chairwoman Roybal-Allard. They have been dedicated to getting this  done.   The updated language submitted today will enhance protections for the  rights and for the dignity of migrants even further.   It wasn't too long ago that President Reagan said America was best  represented as ``the shining city upon a hill.'' It should sicken all  of us that this administration apparently believes this country is,  instead, best represented by separated children living in filth in a  cage down by the border.   I urge all my colleagues to vote for this bill and the underlying  legislation so we can honor our values and show the real humanity of  the American people.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, at this moment, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me provide a little bit of a news  flash for my Republican friends. The Senate bill has a hold on it by a  Republican from the home State of the Senate Majority Leader, and I saw  a news report today that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee  in the Senate, Mr. Shelby, was asked by a reporter: Do you have  assurance that the President would sign the bill that the Senate  produced?   Mr. Shelby replied that he did not.   So this is moving, and I would urge my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the gentleman from Texas, he went  through a series of quotes, and I think what Democrats were responding  to was the crisis that the President was talking about.   The President, as you know, Mr. Speaker, for years has been railing  against immigrants. He talked about an infestation of immigrants. He  has characterized immigrants in the most derogatory and the most  hateful terms possible, that we were being invaded. That is not the  crisis that we are talking about here today.   The crisis we are talking about here today is the one the President  created, the mistreatment of children in U.S. custody. There is no  denying it.   Read the press accounts. Read The New Yorker; read The New York  Times; and read The Washington Times. They talk about how little  children have been mistreated at the border under U.S. custody, and  that should offend every single person in this Chamber; and that this  administration created and manufactured this crisis in order to make  political points, I think, is unconscionable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just say, I am so sorry the gentlewoman was inconvenienced,  but I think she misspoke when she said that Republicans--or she--just  received the bill at 5:00.   The bill has been available since last week. The only thing that was  different was there was an amendment, a manager's amendment. It was  seven pages long, double spaced, on single sides. It didn't take that  long to read.   So, I am sorry whether or not she couldn't get through it all, but it  is not a new bill. This bill has been around.   Let me also say, again, for the record: We don't agree. We don't  agree with the crisis that the President has been talking about for  years and years and years and years, the derogatory fashion and way in  which he refers to immigrants. We don't agree.   He talked about there being an infestation of immigrants, that we are  being invaded. No, that is not the crisis.   The crisis that he created, that this administration created, which  should, quite frankly, cause more outrage on the other side of the  aisle, was separating children from their parents. And, as we gather  here today, there are countless children who may never be reunited with  their parents.   The crisis that he created was denying these children in our custody  basic things--basic necessities like soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes-- and where little kids were being taken care of by other little kids.   This is an outrage, and it is a crisis that he manufactured, that he  created. And we need to fix it.   So, that is what this bill is trying to do. If my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle don't want to support it, fine. But we are  going to do what is right. That is why we ran for office. That is why  we won the last election, because people were horrified by what was  happening at the border, the way we were treating other human beings.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from the  gentleman from Arizona. He talks about ICE. He wants more funding for  ICE. The previous speaker talked about more money for the Department of  Defense.   We are talking about children here. That is what this bill addresses:  money for State-licensed shelters, legal services, child advocates,  post-release services, Federal field specialists, case management  services, and money for the Office of the Inspector General.   The humanitarian crisis is that children are being mistreated at our  border and we need to address it, and that is what we are trying to do  with this bill.   So, I appreciate all the other things that my Republican friends want  to fund, but the crisis that we need to address right now is the  mistreatment of children at our border.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman did offer an amendment in the Rules Committee. He is a  member of the Rules Committee. He knew there was a budget point of  order against it, so it was not compliant with the rules of the House,  so it wasn't made in order.   I am not sure what the gentleman was talking about, about these young  children--2, 3, 4 years old--what? To request that they be sent back to  their homes, that they could somehow just walk out of where they are  being held right now? I am not quite sure what he is talking about.   The bottom line is, there is also money in here for U.S. Customs and  Border Protection. My friends know that, if they have read the bill.   So I just have to say, I think where the outrage is here is that this  administration has overseen an immigration policy which does not  reflect the values of this country, where children have been separated  from their parents, and now we see children being held in the worst  conditions possible.   It does not reflect the values of the American people, and we need to  pass this bill to try to remedy that.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, have great respect for the gentleman from  Oklahoma. We don't always agree on everything, but there are some  things we do agree on.   I want to say this with great respect for him and for the gentlewoman  from Arizona, and I am sorry if I offended her in the way I responded  to her comments. But my friends had the bill for quite some time. What  is new today is the amendment, the 7-page amendment.   It is not correct to say that the bill was just given to the minority  at 4:30 or 5 today or whenever, right before we met. The bottom line is  that Members have had it for a while. The amendment, which is 7 pages,  is something new.   The amendment has been characterized as us moving to the left. Let me  remind people what is in this amendment. There are stronger  requirements for care of unaccompanied minor children, tightened  restrictions on influx shelters, accountability for contractors  violating standards at influx shelters, funding for the Immigration  Court Help Desk program, ensuring access to translation services.   That is not left or right or middle of the road. To me, it just  sounds like common sense. To characterize this as a move to the left, I  just don't get it.   Mr. Speaker, this administration's actions at the border should not  be ignored. What these children are going through should not be  minimized. But that hasn't stopped some on the other side of the aisle  from trying, as they continue to defend any move that this  administration makes.   I mean, we didn't hear a lot of talk about the children in the debate  on the other side. Some did raise the issue, but most of the talk was  on other things.   Last night, I heard one of my friends on the other side of the aisle  defend the conditions at these border facilities in an interview, and  he came to the floor again today. He said that there was ``no lock on  the door,'' and, ``Any child is free to leave at any time. But they  don't, and you know why? Because they're well taken care of.''   Mr. Speaker, is he really suggesting that a 3- or 4-year-old  unaccompanied child should just get up and walk out of one of these  facilities? Come on, what are we talking about here?   I don't know how anybody could say being denied soap or being denied  toothbrushes and medical care is being well taken care of, because  these are inhumane conditions, and I think it is child abuse.   America is better than this, and we must demand better for these  kids.   Let's vote on this rule and on the underlying bill so that we can get  this aid where it is needed as quickly as possible and hold this  administration accountable.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 462         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House       on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3056) to provide supplemental appropriations relating to       border security, and for other purposes. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. Points of order against provisions in the       bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI are       waived. Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during       consideration of the bill. When the committee rises and       reports the bill back to the House with a recommendation that       the bill do pass, the previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3056.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
