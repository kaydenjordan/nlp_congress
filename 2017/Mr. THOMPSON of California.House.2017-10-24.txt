 Mr. Speaker, the worst fire in the  history of California has devastated nearly 300,000 acres, destroyed  some 7,000 homes, caused billions of dollars in damage, burned to the  ground many businesses, and, most sadly, taken the lives of 42 people;  and that number may, in fact, rise.   This fire was like no other, propelled by winds that reached speeds  of over 70 miles an hour. It moved so fast, burning at times 200 feet  per second--that is three football fields every 30 seconds--that people  had little time to escape their burning homes.   People fled with only their night clothes--no time to grab even their  medication, important papers, or personal belongings. Thousands of  families were displaced and will have to find housing, rebuild their  homes and businesses, and rebuild their lives.   Over 100,000 people were evacuated during the late hours of the first  night of this monster firestorm. Many of you saw the news coverage play  out on your television. The most covered area in the news is an area in  Santa Rosa called Coffey Park. This is it. There alone, some 1,300  homes were burned to the ground. This area is on the far western side  of the fire-devastated area, a county away from where it started.   The winds were so high that they pushed the blaze across eight lanes  of freeway and over two frontage roads to destroy the homes and the  lives of these 1,300 families. The winds were so high that cars were  not only burned beyond recognition, but they were flipped over. There  is a metal garage door that remains stuck about 35 feet off the ground  in the remains of a burned-out pine tree.   Leader McCarthy was with me in Coffey Park and saw firsthand the  devastation. I want to thank the leader for his commitment to work with  us to help our communities and the many people so devastated by this  unprecedented disaster. I thank also the 11,000 firefighters, the many  law enforcement, and National Guard that put their life on the line to  stop the raging inferno and protect the lives of the people of my  district and the other fire-threatened areas of California. Some of  those first responders lost their own homes, but worked 24/7 to help  others.   The response was awesome and truly appreciated. Mutual aid came from  every county in California, States across our great country, Federal  agencies, and from other countries. The actions of civilian heroes and  heroines saved an untold number of lives and continue to make life  tolerable to those affected by this fire disaster.   The fallout from the disaster will be felt for years, if not decades.  You just can't rebuild 7,000 homes and neighborhoods overnight.   The heartbeat of our community--doctors, nurses, workers, teachers,  CEOs, and small business owners--were burned out and must start over.  My colleagues and I appreciate all of their words of comfort and offers  to help. The people hurt by this monster fire will need all of our  help. As we move forward, we have to work together to address this  devastation that has befallen the people of my district and other parts  of northern California.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).    Mr. Speaker, the worst fires in the  history of California have devastated nearly 300,000 acres, destroyed  some 8,000 homes, caused billions of dollars in damage, burned to the  ground many businesses, and, most sadly, taken the lives of 42 people-- and that number may very well rise.   These fires were like no other, propelled by winds that reached  speeds of over 70 miles per hour. The worst of the fires were in my  district. They moved so fast, burning at times 200 feet per second.  That is three football fields every 30 seconds.   People had little time to escape their burning homes. They fled with  only the clothes on their back and, in some cases, with their homes  already in flames.   The most covered area on the news is a neighborhood in my district in  Santa Rosa called Coffey Park. There, alone, the entire neighborhood,  some 1,300 homes, were burned to the ground. The winds were so high  that they pushed the blaze across eight lanes of freeway and over two  frontage roads to destroy the homes and lives of those 1,300 families.   Eleven thousand firefighters, thousands of law enforcement and  National Guard soldiers put their lives on the line to stop the raging  inferno and protect Californians in the line of the fire. Some of those  first responders lost their own homes, but they worked 24/7 to help  others. The actions of civilian heroes and heroines saved an untold  number of lives.   The fallout from this disaster will be felt for years, if not  decades. You can't just rebuild 8,000 homes and entire neighborhoods  overnight.   My colleagues and I from California appreciate all of your words of  comfort and offers to help, and the people hurt by this monster fire  will need all of our help.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House now observe a moment of silence for  those who lost their lives in this terrifying fire and to show our  commitment to help rebuild the lives of the many thousands of people  who have lost everything.                            ____________________
