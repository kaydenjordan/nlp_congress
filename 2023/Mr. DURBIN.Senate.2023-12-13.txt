 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor again to discuss two  U.S. attorney nominations that have been on the calendar for weeks:  Rebecca Lutzko, nominated to be U.S. attorney for the Northern District  of Ohio, and April Perry, nominated to serve as U.S. attorney for the  Northern District of Illinois.   On several previous occasions, I have had to come to the floor to  request unanimous consent for the Senate to take up these  noncontroversial, bipartisan nominations and confirm these law  enforcement nominees. Each time I have come to the floor, asking for  this, the junior Senator from Ohio has objected. He says that he ran  for office to ``[f]ight the criminals--not the cops.'' It turns out to  be a hollow promise when he is holding up criminal prosecutors, at a  professional level, in two major parts of the United States--one of  them in his own State.    Our communities desperately need top Federal prosecutors in place.  Interested in stopping fentanyl? I am. Thousands of people are dying.  Well, who is going to prosecute those cases? The U.S. attorneys will-- 93 of them across the United States--but you can't prosecute the case  if you don't have the U.S. attorney there to lead the effort and to  coordinate the effort with other branches of government. You can have  an interim in there, and I am sure that person will do as good a job as  he can, but it isn't like having the permanent person that you need as  a U.S. attorney. Here we have two who have been chosen by the junior  Senator from Ohio to stop--one from his own State.   U.S. attorneys lead the Nation's efforts to prosecute violent  criminals and protect our communities from violence, terrorism, and  more. The U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio is no  exception. While the entire Nation has been impacted by the opioid  epidemic, Ohio has been hit harder than almost any other State. Over  the course of 1 year--from April 2022 to April 2023--more than 5,000  Ohioans lost their lives to drug overdoses. That number is shocking-- 5,000 in 1 year. On average, every day, 14 Ohio families lose a loved  one to drugs.   The U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio could, as we  speak, be tackling this drug crisis with community stakeholders, like  the Toledo Metro Drug Task Force. Instead, her nomination has been  languishing on the calendar here in the Senate for months because one  Senator, the junior Senator from Ohio, has promised, I guess, former  President Donald Trump that he would do his best to get even with the  Department of Justice for even considering holding Donald Trump  responsible for his conduct. It would be laughable if it weren't so  damned dangerous.   Because Senator Vance is not just harming my State and is not just  harming his own State, the precedent he is setting will undermine  public safety across the entire Nation for years to come.   As I have stated before, the Senate has a long history of confirming  U.S. attorneys by unanimous consent. We don't even have rollcall votes.  When it came time for the Trump U.S. attorneys, no votes were required.  Democrats--in control for most of that period of time--said to the  President and his administration: You pick the U.S. attorneys. That is  your right as President. The junior Senator from Ohio does not agree  with that.   Before President Biden took office, the last time the Senate required  a rollcall vote on a U.S. attorney was in 1975. At the beginning of a  new Presidential administration, it is customary for all the U.S.  attorneys to resign en masse and for the new President to select their  replacements. That is the ordinary course of business. As we have  learned in the Senate, you can change that if you want to and run the  risk of not bringing someone new to the position if it is that  important. That is why, during the Trump administration, 85 of  President Trump's U.S. attorney nominees moved through the Judiciary  Committee.   Senate Democrats--Democrats--allowed Trump's nominees--every single  one of them--to be confirmed by unanimous consent, many of whom we  would not have chosen personally, but that was the tradition that we  held to. It would not have been realistic to force a floor time debate  on every single one of those nominees and still expect 85 U.S.  attorneys to be confirmed and be on the job in a timely manner.   That tradition and the logic behind it obviously escapes the junior  Senator from Ohio. So we respected our colleagues, and we respected the  need for Senate-confirmed leadership in U.S. Attorney's Offices. The  Democrats put public safety and the needs of law enforcement ahead of  the obvious politics of the day. But now the Senator from Ohio is  setting an unfortunate standard as he is putting us on a path of  requiring cloture and confirmation votes for every U.S. attorney  nominee--something everyone here knows is not feasible.   Does this sound reminiscent of another Republican strategy from  another Republican Senator in the State of Alabama? He held up, I  believe, 400 military promotions for months at a time. He was angry  about a new policy in the Department of Defense after the Dobbs  decision. To protest that, he literally put a brick on 400 nominees for  promotion in the U.S. military. Finally--finally--2 weeks ago, he  relented. We still have 11 to take care of.   To think of the hardship caused to those individuals and the fact  that we didn't have leadership when we should have had for our national  security is an indication to me of how this strategy of ``just stop the  train; I want the world to get off'' is not a sensible one.   So what will happen in the future when, inevitably, dozens of U.S.  attorneys are left to function without Senate-confirmed leadership?  Public safety will suffer, and we are setting a terrible precedent. To  get angry with the administration and to try to require a rollcall  vote--at least one, maybe two--on each nominee is just unnecessary; it  is not logical, and it doesn't follow the precedent of the Senate--all  because one Senator has decided that, because Donald Trump is facing  indictments and prosecution in various parts of the United States, he  wants to protest by hurting the selection of U.S. attorneys in his own  home State of Ohio and the State of Illinois.   We have before us two highly qualified nominees to lead their  respective U.S. Attorney's Offices. Until we confirm them, law  enforcement agencies in both Illinois and Ohio will be held back from  doing their best to fight crime and to end our drug crisis in this  country.   When the Senator from Ohio was asked why he was doing this and what  his goal was, he was very explicit:   [[Page S5949]]              I will hold all DOJ nominations. . . . We will grind [the       Justice Department] to a halt.    June 13, this year.   I can tell you, we just had a hearing--as you know, as a member of  the committee--with the Director of the FBI. He talked to us about the  battles he is fighting, the terrorism threats across America since the  October 7 attack in Israel. He sees blinking lights, he says, in every  direction of danger to the United States.   Are we going to have the Department of Justice on the job, with  professionals doing the best they can, or are we going to let it grind  to a halt? ``Grind to a halt''--those were his words. I hope we have  some common sense in this situation, and I hope we do it right now.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be  determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Republican  leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the  following nominations: Calendar Nos. 314 and 315; that there be 2  minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form on each  nomination; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate  proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations  in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no  further motions be in order; and that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative  session.    Madam President, I keep hearing this argument over and  over again--weaponizing the Department of Justice. His complaint is  that the Department of Justice has decided that Donald Trump, an  American citizen, should be held responsible for his own conduct. Why  would you argue that any citizen in this country is above the law?   I didn't choose to make that strategy or even support it publicly,  but I can't argue with the decision by the attorney general, nor the  State of New York, nor the State of Atlanta, who believe that Donald  Trump did things that he should be held accountable for. He will have  his day in court, like every American citizen. He should not be put in  some saintly status that he can't be touched.   To think that in order to show my protest to any policy, I want to  see the Department of Justice of the United States grind to a halt-- does the Senator have any idea what he just said? To think that we  would stop the court proceedings, we would stop the prosecutions, we  would stop the war against drugs, we would stop the war against  terrorism, have them grind to a halt because I am mad that the former  President is being, in my mind, harassed by this administration--this  is irresponsible conduct, it is dangerous conduct, and it is a terrible  precedent to set in the Senate that we would say to any individual: You  have the power to stop a nominee who has been found to be acceptable on  a bipartisan basis through the Senate Judiciary Committee.   You know as well as I do that these nominees come before the  committee, and both staffs, Democrat and Republican, tear through them  to look for any flaws or any reason to stop the nominations.   These two nominees in Ohio--his home State--and in Illinois both  passed the test, the bipartisan test, and they were on their way to do  a job for America and make it a safer place to live, and he stops them  because he doesn't like the way Donald Trump is being treated. Is that  a fact? He admits it on the floor of the Senate.   It is hard to explain to the Senator--he is new to the Senate,  relatively new to the Senate--that some of the traditions in the Senate  are worth keeping.   The fact that we gave 85 U.S. attorney nominees to Donald Trump as  Democrats and did it without a single record vote is an indication we  were trying to help his administration do their job. Why won't the  Senator from Ohio let the Biden administration do their job and keep  his own State safe?   I yield the floor.
