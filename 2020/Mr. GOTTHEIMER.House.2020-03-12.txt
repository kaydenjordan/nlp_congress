 Madam Speaker, this week, coronavirus impacted my  north Jersey community in a heartbreaking way.   Our thoughts are with the loved ones of Bergen County resident John  Brennan, New Jersey's first life lost from coronavirus. Mr. Brennan was  a lifetime horse trainer, a fixture at Yonkers Raceway, and a  remarkable individual.   As of this morning, New Jersey now has 22 other presumed positive  cases, several in my district alone.   North Jersey's hospitals and frontline medical professionals are  working to contain the outbreak and keep our residents safe. I commend  our counties and hospitals in New Jersey's Fifth District--New Bridge,  Valley, Atlantic, Hackensack Meridian, and Holy Name--for working so  hard and working together and for holding daily calls to coordinate  efforts to help combat the spread of the virus.   This week, I led members of our congressional delegation to ask the  CDC when New Jersey should expect to receive confirmation of our  pending presumed positive cases. We still have not received CDC  confirmation of the tests that have been sent to the agency.   I know the CDC is working diligently to fight this crisis, but gaps  in testing confirmation hinder our ability to mitigate the spread.   Now is the time for our country to come together--our great  hospitals, the CDC, all levels of government--to ensure all Americans  are safe.   There is nothing partisan about this moment. We must, as a country  and as government, come together to fight the coronavirus and keep our  families safe.                            ____________________
