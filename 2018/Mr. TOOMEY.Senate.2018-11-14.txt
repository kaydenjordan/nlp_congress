 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, winter has arrived in Pittsburgh. Today,  11 3-foot-tall wooden Stars of David make up a sidewalk memorial in the  city's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, and they will be brought inside the  Tree of Life Synagogue to protect this display of the city's grief from  the snowstorm.   Pittsburgh, the Jewish community and our entire country were shaken  by a horrific anti-Semitic attack that occurred on October 27, during  Shabbat morning services. Members of three Jewish congregations were  present: the Tree of Life, Dor Hadash, and New Light congregations.  Eleven innocent people were senselessly slaughtered in the attack, and  six others were wounded, including four police officers who responded  to the attack.   Even within this act of evil, there were displays of amazing courage  and humanity: the first responders, who rushed into danger to apprehend  the shooter and protect others; the Jewish doctors and nurses who cared  for not just the victims but the shooter as well. Like Dr. Jeffrey  Cohen, president of Allegheny County Hospital--who is actually a member  of the Tree of Life Synagogue--displayed an amazing, remarkable courage  and humanity in visiting the shooter to ask him about his care and to  try to make some sense of the attack.   After such an inexplicable event, all of us looked for the motivation  of the perpetrator and asked why.   Well, let's be clear about what this shooting was about. It was a  cowardly act of brutal violence, fueled by anti-Semitism, a corrupt and  repulsive ideology that really betrays our most fundamental values and  distorts history.   John Adams had an interesting quote. John Adams said:         If I was an atheist and believed in blind eternal fate, I       should still believe that fate had ordained the Jews to be       the most essential instrument for civilizing the nations.       They are the most glorious nation that ever inhabited this       Earth. The Romans and their Empire were but a Bauble in       comparison to the Jews. They have given religion to three       quarters of the Globe and have influenced the affairs of       Mankind more, and more happily, than any other Nation ancient       or modern.    Despite Judaism's incredible contributions to mankind and to our own  country and our country's founding, anti-Semitism is still far too  prevalent. We can't ignore it. We must condemn it. We must challenge  it.   I think there is a lesson here from Dr. Cohen, whom I mentioned  earlier. When asked how he could visit a patient with so much hatred,  Dr. Cohen replied:         I thought it was important to at least talk to him and meet       him. You can't on one hand say we should talk to each other,       and then I don't talk to him.    I think Dr. Cohen's wisdom and insights in humanity could be useful  for this body as well. I have spent a lot of time working with  colleagues and others to try to find some commonsense solutions to  address some element of the gun violence that plagues this country. Too  often, it seems to me, we talk past each other rather than speaking  with each other.   I know there are strongly held views on the Second Amendment, and I  am one of the Senators who has strongly held views on the Second  Amendment. I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, but I am  also convinced  [[Page S6944]]  there is common ground among people who have different views on the  Second Amendment.   In this session of Congress that we are wrapping, we overwhelmingly  enacted legislation to improve NICS, the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System, which is used to prevent the sale of firearms  to people who should not have firearms. Now think about that. We all  agree firearms should not be sold to criminals and the dangerously  mentally ill. I have never heard any colleague in this body suggest  that firearms should be sold to violent criminals or dangerously  mentally ill people. No. We all agree, as does our entire society, that  these are people who shouldn't have firearms. So we have a NICS system  that is designed, when it works well, to identify people who should not  be able to have firearms because they are convicted criminals or  dangerously mentally ill, or both, and we in this body recently passed  legislation to improve the effectiveness of that NICS system.   Since we all accept the premise of the NICS system, and we have in  fact enacted legislation to improve the effectiveness of the NICS  system, shouldn't we also agree to close the remaining loopholes in the  background check in this NICS system?   One measure that I think ought to be a consensus measure, and I know  has bipartisan support, is that using the NICS system, we should cover  all commercial sales of firearms with a background check. This is just  a commonsense measure that is entirely consistent and compatible with  the Second Amendment.   The Constitution guarantees the rights of law-abiding people to own  firearms, but there is no such right for violent criminals and those  who are dangerously mentally ill. I am not the only one who believes  that. None other than the very pro-Second Amendment Justice Antonin  Scalia wrote that it is completely compatible with the Second Amendment  to have regulations like a background check.   Senator Joe Manchin and I have introduced bipartisan legislation that  would address this loophole, that would expand background checks. It is  pretty simple. It simply says that all commercial sales of firearms,  including those sales at gun shows and over the internet, need to be  subject to criminal and mental background checks. If you pass the  background check, you get to buy your gun, but if you fail the  background check, then you are exactly the kind of person we have all  agreed shouldn't be able to get a gun. This is just common sense. By  the way, he and I built into this legislation a number of provisions to  allow law-abiding gun owners to more fully exercise their Second  Amendment rights.   So I hope my colleagues will join me in working to advance this  commonsense, bipartisan measure to keep our communities a little bit  safer. I have never suggested that this would end mass shootings in  America--that would be absurd--but it might make it a little more  difficult for someone who doesn't belong owning a firearm to obtain  one.   I know in our country many people feel a deep sense of division. We  saw it after the shooting at the Tree of Life. We see it sometimes in  the debates here, including over gun safety, but this isn't the first  time or even the worst time we have been divided.   Interestingly, Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue was founded in  1864 during the Civil War. When I was in Pittsburgh following the  tragedy, the day after the attack, I attended a beautiful memorial  service just a few miles from the Tree of Life Synagogue. The service  was at the Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall. At that ceremony,  Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Jews, people from every walk of life  were represented. People from the Greater Pittsburgh area united to  support their Jewish neighbors.   It was fitting to gather at the Soldiers & Sailors Memorial. This  memorial was founded by veterans of the Civil War in Allegheny County  to honor the sacrifice and valor of those who were willing to die to  save our country during that war. The very first soldier from Allegheny  County to die in the Civil War was a married salesman in his early  thirties from Pittsburgh. He died at the Battle of Williamsburg on May  5, 1862. His name was Jacob Brunn. He was Jewish. That didn't matter to  Pittsburgh. The entire city turned out for his funeral, the entire  city. As one historian put it, ``the city put religious and political  differences aside to honor the man who was first to fall.''   I hope the Senate can also put aside some of our political  differences and do something sensible. It is our duty, and it would be  a fitting act of remembrance for victims of mass shootings--at the Tree  of Life, Thousand Oaks, Sandy Hook, and all the others whose deaths  from gun violence have scarred our country.   I yield the floor.
