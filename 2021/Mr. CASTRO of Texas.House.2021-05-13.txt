 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with grave concern  about the ongoing violence in Israel and Palestine. The events of the  last week and the deaths of so many Israeli and Palestinian civilians,  including many children, are heartbreaking. My condolences to their  families and my thoughts are with those in Israel and Gaza who continue  to live in fear.   Rocket attacks by Hamas and other militant groups that intentionally  target civilians are, of course, reprehensible, and I condemn them  unequivocally. The escalation of violence is not in the interest of  Israelis or Palestinians, but only extremists who thrive on conflict.  The Biden administration needs to call on the Israeli Government to  agree to a cease-fire and put pressure on Hamas to do the same.    I have consistently supported security assistance to Israel and voted  to fund the Iron Dome, which is saving  [[Page H2309]]  lives as we speak. Yet Israel's disproportionate response to Hamas'  attacks, destroying entire buildings and public spaces, is exacerbating  this horrible cycle of violence. These air strikes, which have already  resulted in the deaths of civilians and at least 38 women and children,  must stop. We need a cease-fire now, and the United States must help  bring one about.   Beyond stopping the immediate violence, the United States must also  urge Israel to support the creation of a Palestinian state--the only  way to end this cycle of violence for good. The status quo of  occupation and creeping de facto annexation is unjust and not  sustainable. The forced evictions of Palestinian families in east  Jerusalem are wrong, and it is not the first time that events like we  saw last week in Sheikh Jarrah have happened.   I will wrap up by saying that I hope and pray for peace. I want to  thank my colleague, Rashida Tlaib. I think part of what has been  missing in Congress is hearing Palestinian voices.
