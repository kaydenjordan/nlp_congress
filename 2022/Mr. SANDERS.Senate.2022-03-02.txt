 Mr. President, S. Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022  congressional budget resolution, included a reserve fund in section  3003 to allow the chairman of the Committee on the Budget to revise  budget aggregates and committee allocations for legislation that would  not increase the deficit over the period of fiscal years 2022 to 2031.   The Senate is considering H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform Act of  2022, which meets the condition of not increasing the deficit over the  relevant 10-year period. As such, I am filing a revision to the  aggregates and committee allocations under the budget resolution, which  were last revised on February 8. Specifically, the Congressional Budget  Office estimates that the bill would increase on-budget direct spending  by $430 million over 5 years but decrease it by $73 million over 10  years.   I am also refiling two tables that I previously filed on February 8  to correct the amounts of budget authority allowable for fiscal year  2022.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:        REVISIONS TO BUDGET AGGREGATES--BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS           [Pursuant to Sections 4004 & 4009 of S.

It also   adjusts for the effects of H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform Act of   2022, reducing both budget authority and outlays by $62 million.
