 Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer's and  Brain Awareness Month.   As a member of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I  am grateful to continue supporting families facing Alzheimer's.  Additionally, I appreciate the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act  that President Donald Trump signed into law in December last year.   Currently, there are more than 5 million Americans who live with  Alzheimer's, with 16 million family members and friends who serve as  caregivers. It is inspiring to know that 313,000 caregivers in South  Carolina provide over 352 million hours of unpaid care.   South Carolina has extraordinary facilities to provide exemplary care  for Alzheimer's patients in a friendly environment, including Carroll  Campbell Place of Lexington Medical Center, honoring our late Governor.   Support and research are provided by the Alzheimer's Association Walk  to End Alzheimer's, with walks held annually in more than 600  communities nationwide, with Taylor Wilson organizing the Midlands  events.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
