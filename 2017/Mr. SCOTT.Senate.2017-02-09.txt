 Mr. President, I rise today to say thank you. Republicans  and Democrats have been talking for a long time this week, and perhaps  that is productive. But without any question, from what we have seen, I  think both sides would agree that the support cast has made this  possible. I think it is important for us to pause for just a moment and  say thank you.   We have pages who are juniors in high school here with us around the  clock, and we want to say thank you to the pages. I think about the  fact that we have law enforcement guarding this place so we can be here  safely, all night long. We have Parliamentarians and clerks who have  been at their places on and off over the last 4 days, nearly around the  clock. I want to say on behalf of our side and the Democrats, I believe  we all are very thankful and appreciative for your long hours and the  time you have served us. Thank you for helping us represent the  American people.   I would also like to point out a few people by name because these  folks have been here for up to 57 hours straight--57 consecutive hours  of doing their jobs. Captioning services: Sandra Schumm, Brenda  Jameson, Doreen Chendorian, Jennifer Smolka, and Laurie Harris.   Official Reporters of Debates, 57 consecutive hours of work: Patrick  Renzi, Susie Nguyen, Julia Jones, Mary Carpenter, Patrice Boyd, Octavio  Colominas, Alice Haddow, Andrea Huston, Carole Darche, Desirae Jura,  Megan McKenzie, Wendy Caswell, Diane Dorhamer, Mark Stuart, and Julie  Bryan.   On behalf of a thankful Senate, we appreciate your time and your  dedication to the American people, allowing us to do what we have been  doing.   God bless.    Madam President, I yield 30 minutes of my time during the  debate of Congressman Price to Senator Hatch.    Yes, sir.
