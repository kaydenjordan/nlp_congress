 Mr. Speaker, my neighbors back home in Florida  work very hard for their health coverage. When they pay their hard- earned copayments and premiums, they expect something meaningful in  return: real health care. That is what the Affordable Care Act  provided; not just a piece of paper, but real health services, an end  to discrimination against preexisting conditions, and all sorts of  other consumer protections.   But in the middle of the night last night, the Republicans turned  back the clock. They have eliminated from the basic health insurance  policy coverage for emergency room visits, hospitalization,  prescription drugs, and more.   They have really embraced the moniker of pay more for less. And on  top of it, remember, this bill rips health insurance away from millions  of our neighbors back home. It raises costs on hardworking Americans,  especially our older neighbors. It is practically an age tax, if you  are over 50 years old. It breaks that fundamental guarantee that has  existed for 50 years, that if your family is struck with an Alzheimer's  diagnosis, a child with a complex condition, a handicap, that you are  not going to live your remaining years in poverty, all the while,  taking your tax dollars and shifting it to millionaires and  billionaires and corporations.   TrumpCare is a recipe for disaster. It is a fundamental violation of  the values we share as Americans, and it should meet its demise today.
