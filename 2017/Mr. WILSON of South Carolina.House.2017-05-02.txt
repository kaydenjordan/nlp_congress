 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, this week marks National  Small Business Week, a time to recognize the remarkable contributions  small businesses make creating jobs.   In South Carolina, small businesses represent 99 percent of our  State's businesses, employing 47 percent of our citizens. I am grateful  for the input from the National Federation of Independent Business,  NFIB, led by Ben Homeyer; the State Chamber of Commerce led by Ted  Pitts; and local chambers from Barnwell to Blythewood and from North  Augusta to northeast Columbia, promoting every corner of the district.   When I meet with members of the small-business community of South  Carolina, I learn how government regulations and government overreach  threaten their businesses and reduce job opportunities.   I support President Trump's commitment to creating jobs and how, in  only 100 days, his administration has proven to be a champion of small  business by cutting harmful regulations and outlining tax reform.   I appreciate the leadership of the small-business administrator,  Linda McMahon, and her advocacy for the 29 small businesses nationwide.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Royce's  determined leadership on this important issue of national security  protecting American families.   I am in strong support of H.R. 1644, the Korean Interdiction and  Modernization of Sanctions Act. In 2003, I traveled to Pyongyang, North  Korea, with the ranking member, Congressman Eliot Engel, in a  bipartisan delegation, along with Congressman Curt Weldon, Chairman  Jeff Miller, Silvestre Reyes, and Solomon Ortiz, where we saw firsthand  the tyranny and oppression of the Communist regime.   Last month, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed H.  Res. 92, a bipartisan resolution I introduced condemning the regime in  North Korea for their recent ballistic missiles, and called for the  consideration of all available sanctions. It passed 398-3.   Since then, North Korea has continued testing missiles and released  yet another propaganda video--this one simulating the destruction of  American troops, aircraft, warships, and even the U.S. Capitol  Building.   After 8 years of ``strategic patience,'' I appreciate the strong  leadership of President Trump and his administration, along with the  Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, and also Secretary of State Rex  Tillerson.   It is clear the regime in North Korea will only respond to strength,  and these sanctions that are proposed in this package would effectively  target the regime and any other individuals who would do business with  North Korea, especially in the shipping and financial industries.   I appreciate the extraordinary leadership of Chairman Ed Royce and  Ranking Member Eliot Engel on the legislation, and I urge my colleagues  to vote in support.                                time  1515     Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, it was my honor to be with  Ranking Member Eliot Engel.
