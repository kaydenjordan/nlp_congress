 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  establishment of a new Kiwanis Club in the First District's Liberty  County.   Kiwanis Clubs across the country are known for making it their  mission to improve their respective communities through engagement of  our youth. Liberty County's chapter is no exception. It is through  their incredible dedication to our community that the Kiwanis Club of  Liberty County aims to improve the lives of every citizen around them.   Our youth are our future, and the drive already exhibited by this  chapter has blessed us with a bright one through strong youth  engagement. We are incredibly grateful for all that they have planned,  and we know that they will be an asset to Georgia's First District.   It is moments like these that make me extraordinarily proud to  represent a district that is so motivated to improve the lives of their  neighbors.   I thank the Liberty County Kiwanis Club leadership, Mayor Allen Brown  of Hinesville, Chairman Donald Lovett of Liberty County, and others for  joining me in recognizing these fantastic people.   Every day we work to ensure a better future, and the Kiwanis Club of  Liberty County is helping us to guarantee just that.                            ____________________
