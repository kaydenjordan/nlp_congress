 Madam Speaker, those who tolerate hate perpetuate  hate. A brief story: I saw the picture, the film, the depiction of the  lady in New York when she was approached by a man who kneed her in her  stomach, forced her to the ground, and kicked her with his feet on  multiple occasions. That kind of hate we cannot tolerate.   He happened to have been a person of color. It must be known that  regardless as to who you are, regardless as to your race or your color,  Madam Speaker, if you perfect that kind of hate, you should be  prosecuted to the fullest extent that the law allows. Those who  tolerate hate perpetuate hate.    Madam Speaker, the great writer and intellectual  Carlyle was right, ``No lie can live forever.''   Kill 300 people? No lie can live forever.   Destroy an entire business district? Try to hide it? No lie can live  forever.   Hundreds hospitalized, families destroyed. No lie can live forever.   One hundred years later, truth crushed to Earth has arisen, and no  lie can live forever.    Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Chu for her diligence  and her persistence in getting this done.   This is a moment for sober reflection. This is a time for us to  understand that there is a lot of pain in the Asian-American community.   There are people who are suffering, and it gives us an opportunity  now to let them know that they are not alone, to let them know that  liberty and justice for all applies to them, to let them know that we  will stand against the hate as we stand with them. It is a time for  sober reflection.
