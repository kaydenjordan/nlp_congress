 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Children's Health Insurance Program that so many of our vulnerable  young people depend on for their healthcare coverage. Across the  country, 8 million young people use CHIP, more than 300,000 people in  Illinois alone. But their coverage and, consequently, their health and  future are now in jeopardy because this House has failed to reauthorize  the program for the first time in 20 years. Yesterday marked 100 days  since the authorization lapsed.   Before the new year, Congress temporarily extended limited funding,  but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is already warning  that some States won't have funding to make it through the month of  January.   It is beyond shameful that this House can pass trillions of dollars  in tax breaks for those with the most security but not see its way to  provide health insurance for the children most in need.   This is a vital program. This is a popular program. This is a program  that traditionally enjoys bipartisan support. There is no reason to  continue to extend the uncertainty.   I urge my colleagues to act and reauthorize the CHIP program as soon  as possible to offer much-needed stability to families and their  children depending on this coverage.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan  resolution, H. Res. 676, offered by my friends, Chairman Ed Royce and  Ranking Member Eliot Engel, of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I  thank my friend from Florida and my friend from California for leading  us in this conversation today.   Less than 2 weeks ago, on December 28, protests began in towns and  villages throughout Iran. These quickly and organically grew to become  the largest antigovernment demonstrations the country has witnessed  since those remarkable demonstrations in the summer of 2009.   Iranian citizens have taken to the streets to decry the regime's  corruption, economic mismanagement, and destabilizing activities  abroad, including support for such terrorist groups as Hezbollah.   The Iranian people, the good men and women seeking relief from the  failings of the current regime, deserve our support. Their voices  deserve to be heard. Not surprisingly, the response of the regime in  Tehran to these protests have been predictably draconian.   News reports suggest dozens of Iranians have been killed in the  crackdown on protests and more than 1,000 Iranians have been arrested.  In an effort to silence the protesters, the Iranian Government has  blocked access to social media platforms used to organize and spread  word of the demonstrations.   This most recent crackdown is part of a long history of human rights  abuses by the Iranian Government, both at home through violent  oppression and abroad through funding of groups that support terror.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that last month the House passed my amendment  to the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act to help crack down on  Iranian human rights abusers and ensure U.S. sanctions are best  positioned to improve the human rights situation in Iran.   This is but one step. We need to do more to stop Iran's repression  and persecution of different religious faiths, including Sunni Muslims,  Christians, and Baha'is. We need to do more to stop the regime's  arbitrary and unlawful killings. We must do more to protect the Iranian  people's right to freedom of expression.    This resolution is an opportunity for the American  people to stand with the peaceful Iranian protesters and condemn the  maligned activities of the oppressive Iranian regime.   In the days ahead, I urge this administration to hold the Iranian  regime accountable to its international human rights obligation as well  as work with our allies at the United Nations to condemn and sanction  Iran for its ongoing human rights violations.   The Iranian Government is seeking to silence its people. Today's  resolution shows we are watching and that we stand with the people of  Iran. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.
