 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 666, the Department of  Homeland Security Insider Threat and Mitigation Act of 2017. H.R. 666,  the Department of Homeland Security Insider Threat and Mitigation Act  of 2017, authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to address the  homeland and national security risk posed by trusted insiders.   Typically, trusted insiders are given unrestricted access to mission- critical assets such as personnel, facilities, and computer networks.  While DHS, like other Federal agencies, conducts extensive vetting of  prospective employees, there is a risk that someone with insider status  exploits their position to damage the United States through espionage,  terrorism, or the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive national  security information.   As the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I am  supportive of the Department of Homeland Security's current Insider  Threat Program. It is targeted at preventing and detecting when a  vetted DHS employee or contractor with access to U.S. Government  resources, including personnel, facilities, information, equipment,  networks, and systems, exploits such access for nefarious, terroristic,  or criminal purposes.                                time  1430    Though I support the DHS program, I do have some concerns about DHS  and other Federal agencies deploying continuous evaluation programs  without transparency and congressional oversight. I am concerned that  Federal agencies, with the understandable urge to protect their IT  systems and facilities, are racing to acquire the capability before  knowing whether such costly systems are even effective.   Therefore, I would like to reiterate to this Congress, as I did last  Congress, that prior to establishing any such program, under which  certain DHS employees would be subjected to ongoing automated credit,  criminal, and social media monitoring, the Department engage Congress  about not only the potential costs and benefits of such a program but  what protections would be in place for workers subject to such a  program.   Mr. Speaker, we live at a time when the threats to our Nation are  complex. When this bill was considered last Congress, the prospect that  a foreign intelligence agency would carry out an espionage campaign to  influence the outcome of our Presidential election was material for the  movies or for a good spy thriller. Today, in light of the Russian  Government's actions in the 2016 elections, we have a greater  appreciation for the importance of counterintelligence efforts. As  such, this bill is particularly timely. None of us wants to see someone  exploit their access to DHS networks to carry out cybercrimes or other  criminal activity.   Even as DHS works to detect and prevent such threats, it is important  that such activities be carried out in a transparent way so as not to  compound the chronic morale challenges that exist within its workforce.  Each time DHS considers making an adjustment to its insider threat  program, thoughtful consideration must be paid to whether the  operational drawbacks and costs for such an adjustment outweigh the  benefits of such a change.   That said, I commend General Taylor, the previous Under Secretary for  Intelligence and Analysis at DHS, for the attention he gave to the  insider threat challenge. I look forward to continuing to work with the  Department's successor to bolster security within the Department.   I would also like to give Mr. King particular credit for his interest  in this effort to make sure that problems don't come from the inside if  we can help it.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 666.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.  [[Page H778]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 697, the Department of  Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by thanking the chairman of the  Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee, Mr. King, as well as  Chairman McCaul for their support for my bill. I reintroduced H.R. 697,  the Department of Homeland Security Clearance Management and  Administration Act, to reform how the Department manages its security  clearance processes.   This measure, which the House approved by voice vote in November,  2015, specifically addresses how DHS carries out the complex and  expensive tasks of, number one, identifying positions that warrant  security clearances; number two, investigating candidates for  clearances; and number three, administering its clearance  adjudications, denials, suspensions, revocations, and appeals  processes.   Since September 11, there has been a massive proliferation of  classified material across the Federal Government. Along with the  enormous growth in classified material holdings has come a sizeable  growth in the number of Federal positions requiring security  clearances.   H.R. 697 reflects regulations issued by the Office of Personnel  Management and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to  help ensure that national security positions are properly designated by  Federal agencies. By doing so, agencies can avoid the costly exercise  of recruiting, investigating, and hiring individuals at clearance  levels and salaries well above what is necessary.   Simply put, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 697 seeks to put DHS on a path to  right-sizing the number of classified positions in its workforce.  Specifically, my bill directs DHS to ensure that the sensitivity levels  of national security positions are designated appropriately across the  Department and its components. It also requires the Department's chief  security officer to audit national security positions periodically to  ensure that such security designations are still appropriate.   Additionally, the bill directs DHS to develop a plan to ensure that  adjudications of eligibility for a security clearance are done  accurately across the Department. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, in response to  growing security threats from data breaches, my bill also provides  safeguards for the protection of applicants' personal information.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, passage of H.R. 697 will help ensure  that the Department of Homeland Security takes targeted steps to  improve critical aspects of its secured clearance program.   If enacted, H.R. 697 would make DHS a leader among Federal agencies  with respect to security clearance and position designation practices.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues' support, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 642, the Fusion Center  Enhancement Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, last Congress, the House approved this measure to update  the law to reflect the evolution of the Department of Homeland  Security's National Network of Fusion Centers.   H.R. 642 clarifies that fusion centers are State and locally owned  and operated, and requires the Department's Office of Intelligence and  Analysis to provide support to centers in its network by deploying  personnel and providing access to timely information.   Importantly, H.R. 642 also adds several new responsibilities to DHS'  Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis with respect to the grant  guidance, nationwide suspicious activity reports, and fusion centers'  access to information.   The bill makes several technical changes to existing law to help  ensure more information sharing resources are made available to  Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials at our National  Network of Fusion Centers.   If enacted, H.R. 642 will go a long way to provide States and  localities that have invested significant resources in standing up  fusion centers with the support they need to keep their communities,  and ultimately the Nation, secure.   I urge passage of H.R. 642.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to express my support for this bill.  I urge passage of H.R. 642, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2017,  which, if enacted, would send the message that Congress values the  investment that States and localities have made to address the  challenges of a post-9/11 world and stand with DHS in supporting the  National Network of Fusion Centers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 642.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 526, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board  Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 526 authorizes, within the Department of Homeland  Security, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB, to coordinate  and integrate the Department's intelligence policies and activities as  related to counterterrorism.   Since 2010, this internal body, comprised of top DHS officials, has  helped to harmonize counterterrorism programs and activities across  DHS.   H.R. 526 directs the Board to meet on a regular basis to coordinate  and integrate the Department's counterterrorism efforts and set forth  the leadership and composition of the Board.   H.R. 526 also requires DHS to report to Congress on the Board's  status and activities.   To ensure that the Board remains an integral part of counterterrorism  policy recommendations and responses across the Department, H.R. 526  would codify it in law.   At this time, when the Homeland Security challenges we face are, in  many ways, more complex and diverse than ever before, it is essential  that the new DHS Secretary and any successors have a mature, stable  mechanism for counterterrorism decisionmaking just as his predecessors  had.   Mr. Speaker, again, H.R. 526 will authorize, within the Department of  Homeland Security, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board to coordinate  and integrate the Department's intelligence activities and policies as  related to counterterrorism.   This Board already plays a central and necessary role within DHS.   Enactment of H.R. 526 will ensure that the Counterterrorism Advisory  Board will remain in place for years and decades to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 526.   I yield back the balance of my time.
