 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District 2021 Congressional Art  Contest winner, Isabella Kern.   The annual art competition, organized by the Congressional Institute,  showcases the artwork of high school students from across every  congressional district in the country.   Isabella just graduated from Richland High School earlier this month.  Her artwork titled ``America's Working Woman'' is an oil painting on  canvas.   Isabella's work was selected by an independent panel of judges from  70 entries, which is the largest group of students to participate in  the 15th District's congressional artwork competition.   All the winning pieces will be displayed for the year in the Cannon  tunnel, where they will be viewed by Members of Congress, staff, and  many visitors to the Capitol every day.   Congratulations, Isabella, and congratulations to all those in  Pennsylvania's 15th District and throughout the Nation who participated  in this competition and expressed their creative skills.                            ____________________
