 Mr. Speaker, this week, we witnessed the weakening of  the Presidency due to the actions of this President.   Now, I realize that President Trump is not constrained by customs,  norms, or decorum, but his actions this week contravened his oath to  preserve, protect, and defend the United States Constitution.   Yes, this President likes to act tough with tweets and trash talk,  but he has proven that he is unwilling to get tough with adversaries  when he stands face to face.   What is worse is that he is willing to sell out our intelligence  agencies in order to suck up to the leader of a nation that has  attacked us and continues to attack many democracies around the world.   Hopefully, his actions will motivate this body, our Congress, to act.  Let's condemn these comments. Let's protect the special counsel. Let's  protect the integrity of our elections. Let's fully implement the  Russian sanctions passed last year and pass even harsher ones, if  Russia does this again.   By doing anything, we can keep this President in check. When we do  that, we restore the credibility of our Presidency. If we do that, we  uphold the credibility of this Congress by fulfilling our oath to our  democracy, so help us God.                            ____________________
