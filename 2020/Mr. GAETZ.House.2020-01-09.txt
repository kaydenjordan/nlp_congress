 Mr. Speaker, I take a backseat to no Member of this body  when it comes to defending the President.   This resolution offers no criticism of the President, no critique. It  doesn't criticize the President's attack on Soleimani. As a matter  fact, this resolution doesn't even say Soleimani's name in it. Yet it  does articulate our very robust basis for self-defense, at times even  preemptory self-defense to defend our troops. And it also articulates  our nondelegable duty as the Members of the United States Congress to  speak to matters of war and peace.   I represent more troops than any other Member of this body. I buried  one of them earlier today at Arlington, and that sergeant died a  patriot and a hero.   If the members of our armed services have the courage to go and fight  and die in these wars, as Congress, we ought to have the courage to  vote for them or against them. And I think it is ludicrous to suggest  that we are impairing the troops from doing their job by not doing our  job articulated in the Constitution to speak to these matters of war  and peace.   I support the President. Killing Soleimani was the right decision,  but engaging in another forever war in the Middle East would be the  wrong decision, and that is why I am voting for this resolution.
