 Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the life  of Lilla Weinberger, a beloved daughter, friend, and activist who  devoted her life to the causes of democracy and the literary arts.   Lilla Weinberger was born in 1941 in Pasadena, CA. She became  involved in the women's movement while at CalArts. After college, she  worked at the Library of Congress and carried out research and worked  on speeches for President Lyndon Johnson's landmark education  legislation. She moved to Lenox, MA, and there, she was integral to the  building of the first-ever domestic violence shelter in the  Commonwealth.   In 1991, Lilla moved to Sonoma, CA, and founded Readers' Books, which  became a cherished institution. She became deeply involved in the  independent bookstore community and served on the board of the Northern  California Independent Booksellers Association from 1997-2003.   Lila was a strong believer in political participation and grassroots  democracy. She was an active member of the Barack Obama Presidential  campaigns in 2008 and 2012. She became the northern California regional  head of the Obama campaign in 2012 and later became Obama's field  director in Maryland. In 2013, Lilla returned to Massachusetts and  became the regional field director for my first U.S. Senate campaign.  She was our warrior in western Massachusetts and became an  indispensable member of our campaign operation.   I am honored to commemorate the remarkable achievements of Lilla  Weinberger, a distinguished leader, our dear friend, and a truly great  American.
