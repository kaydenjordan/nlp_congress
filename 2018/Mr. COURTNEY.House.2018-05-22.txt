 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill.   I want to begin by thanking the chair and ranking member of the full  committee for their leadership in getting this bill to the floor and  their commitment to regular order.   The bill before us has already gone through several rounds of  bipartisan input, from the thousands of individual requests from  members of the House Committee on Armed Services to more than 420  amendments and more than 14 hours of debate at full committee markup,  to more than 560 amendments submitted from the whole House for  potential debate this week.   I believe that this commitment to regular order is one of the main  reasons, when we pass this bill this week, it will be the 58th year in  a row that the House has passed a defense authorization.   I also salute my friend and colleague, Chairman Rob Wittman, for his  inclusive and bipartisan approach to his role on the Subcommittee on  Seapower and Projection Forces.   This year's mark continues a multiyear, bipartisan effort by the  Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces to push the Navy to  explore options to build up important capabilities. To that end, the  bill before us recommends 3 additional battle force ships above the 10  ships in the President's request.   It also continues the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel program  to ensure that future mariners at our State maritime academies have  new, American-made training ships and follows on last year's work on  the subcommittee to recapitalize the Ready Reserve Force.   This bill also builds on the work our subcommittee has done to ensure  that the Navy and industry have the resources to expand our undersea  force. The need and rationale for a larger force of 66 fast attack  submarines was laid out in the Navy's 2016 Force Structure Assessment,  which was based on a thorough analysis of strategic challenges that are  emerging in the maritime domain.   This year, and for the second year in a row, the committee heard  blunt and powerful testimony from both Admiral Harris of Pacific  Command and General Scaparrotti of European Command that their  requirements for submarines are not being met by our current force  structure and warned that the expected decline in the undersea fleet  carried unacceptable risk for the country.   Last year, the Committee on Armed Services responded to these  warnings by including authorization to procure additional submarines in  our mark--authority that was eventually carried to the final NDAA and  this year's omnibus.   Navy officials have recently testified before the subcommittee about  their intention to use this new authority to provide options for  additional submarines in the next 5-year construction contract.  Therefore, this year, the NDAA will make a downpayment on two  additional submarines by providing authorization to fund the long-lead  materials necessary to take advantage of industrial base capacity in  fiscal years 2022 and 2023.   I also note that this shipbuilding plan was based on the 2016 Force  Structure Assessment and is not tied to the Nuclear Posture Review. The  shipbuilding plan is about platforms; the posture review is about  armaments. Its call for low-yield nuclear weapons is a profound  departure from our existing strategic defense, and I want to associate  my remarks today with Mr. Smith regarding that issue.                                time  1815    This bill and the committee report also include several provisions  which I sought in committee, including additional support for our  Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, continued support for DOD  impact aid, and ensuring that our troops receive imminent danger pay in  a timely matter.   Finally, I want to highlight the hard work of the staff for their  tireless effort to put together the Seapower sections of this bill.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I thank Dave Sienicki, Bruce Johnson, Phil MacNaughton,  and Megan Handal. None of this is possible without the countless hours  they put in and the invaluable expertise they provide us.   Mr. Chair, I again thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith  for a productive and collaborative process that has led to, I believe,  an excellent product here today.
