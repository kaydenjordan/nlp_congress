 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1477) to require a threat assessment and strategy to counter  Russian influence in Venezuela, an assessment of foreign acquisition of  CITGO assets in the United States, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1477         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Russian-Venezuelan Threat       Mitigation Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Russian Federation's increased presence in the       Western Hemisphere is of concern to the United States and our       allies in the region.        (2) In December 2018, the Russian Federation sent two Tu-      160 nuclear-capable bombers to Venezuela for joint exercises       with the Venezuelan military. The Tu-160 can carry       conventional or nuclear-tipped cruise missiles with an       estimated maximum range of around 3,000 miles.        (3) Russian and Venezuelan forces took part in a joint 10-      hour exercise across the  [[Page H2782]]       Caribbean in December 2018 with the Tu-160 nuclear-capable       bombers.        (4) Nicolas Maduro and his regime have turned to the       Russian Federation, one of its strongest political allies,       for financial support during its current economic crisis and       to counter international support for Juan Guaido.        (5) In January 2018, Russia sent contractors linked to the       Wagner Group to provide security for Nicolas Maduro.        (6) Nicolas Maduro secured loans from the Russian       Federation to be repaid through future oil exports, but fell       behind on those payments in 2017. News reports in December       2018 suggest that Russian State oil company Rosneft has lent       Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PdVSA)       $6.5 billion partly as prepayment for crude oil, $3.1 billion       of which remained outstanding as of the end of September       2018.        (7) In 2016, PdVSA secured a $1.5 billion loan from       Rosneft, and PdVSA used 49.9 percent of its shares in United       States-based and Venezuelan-owned company CITGO as       collateral. A Venezuelan default could lead to potential       Russian ownership of United States energy infrastructure.        (8) At the conclusion of a 3-day visit to Moscow in       December 2018, Maduro announced $6 billion worth of Russian       investment pledges focused on the oil and mining sectors as       well as the export of 600,000 tons of Russian wheat to       Venezuela to cover its 2019 needs.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 1477, the Russian-Venezuelan  Threat Mitigation Act, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1477.   I thank Ms. Wasserman Schultz for authoring this bipartisan bill, and  I am proud to bring it to the floor. I appreciate the Congresswoman's  tireless leadership on Venezuela day in and day out, particularly at  such a difficult moment for that country.   Ms. Wasserman Schultz has the largest Venezuelan American  constituency in the country and works nonstop on behalf of her  constituents in supporting the Venezuelan people.   Russia's unwavering commitment to Nicolas Maduro should not come as a  surprise to any of us. This is part of Putin's larger aspirations for  global reach and influence and Putin knows the importance of having a  loyal Russian ally in South America.   In recent years, Russia has increased its support for the Venezuelan  security forces. Just a few months ago, Russia sent two nuclear capable  bombers to Venezuela for a training exercise.   Just yesterday, two Russian military aircraft landed near Caracas  reportedly carrying 100 Russian troops.   This legislation responds to the increasing security relationship  between the Maduro regime and the Kremlin. Specifically, it requires  the State Department to provide a threat assessment of Russian  influence in Venezuela and its impact on the United States and our  allies in the region and a strategy for the United States to counter  this threat. It also requires the President to monitor the risk of any  foreign acquisition of CITGO assets in the United States.   Finally, it puts into place visa bans on individuals working on  behalf of the Russian Government in direct support of the Venezuelan  security forces. In short, this legislation takes a crucial step in  restricting Maduro's access to financial, political, and military  support from Vladimir Putin.   Congress must pass this legislation to continue to squeeze Nicolas  Maduro and his repressive regime.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 14, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1477, Russian-Venezuelan Threat Mitigation Act.  [[Page H2783]]         I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary. I acknowledge that the Committee will not seek a       referral of or formally consider H.R. 1477 and agree that the       inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does not       waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in H.R. 1477 which fall within your Committee's       Rule X jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, March 20, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to advise you that the Committee       on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to review the       provisions in H.R. 1477, the ``Russian-Venezuelan Threat       Mitigation Act of 2019,'' that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to waive       sequential referral, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I would once again like to thank Ms. Wasserman Schultz  for authoring this important legislation and for her leadership on  behalf of the Venezuelan people.   As we all know, Vladimir Putin is seeking to expand Russia's  nefarious influence in many parts of the world, always against  democracy, always in opposition to the idea that ordinary people have  the right to stand up for human rights and against corruption,  including in Venezuela.   This is the struggle of our time. This legislation makes it clear  that we stand united with our allies in Latin America and across the  world in rejecting the Kremlin's support for the corrupt Maduro regime.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
