 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, January 27, we observed  International Holocaust Remembrance Day. This day marks the 74th  anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.   Today I rise because we have a sacred duty to remember the lives lost  to Nazism, an abominable evil.   We must remember so that we never forget.   We must never forget the events of the Holocaust so that we may stand  together against anti-Semitism and against any such acts leveraged in  the future against the Jewish people and all people everywhere.                            ____________________
