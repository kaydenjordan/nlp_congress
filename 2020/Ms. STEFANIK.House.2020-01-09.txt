 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate  Kelly's Angels on their 10-year anniversary. This charitable  organization has been serving the children of the Capital Region of New  York for the past decade.   After Kelly Mulholland, a local teacher and mother of two from my  district, tragically lost her battle with cancer in 2007 at the age of  37, her husband, Mark, founded Kelly's Angels in her honor.   Their mission is to provide grants for children in upstate New York  who have lost parents or siblings to cancer or other illnesses.  Children receive fund grants to use for whatever the child can dream  up.   The goal of these grants is to bring a smile to a child's face,  create positive new memories, and help with the healing process.   Kelly's Angels has worked with countless families in our local  communities over the past decade, and their work continues to have a  positive impact on so many lives.    On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, I want to  congratulate and thank Mark, his children, McKenna and Connor, and the  entire Kelly's Angels team for achieving this milestone.   I thank them for their amazing work. We are so proud of them.                            ____________________
