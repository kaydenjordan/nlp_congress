 Mr. Speaker, last Friday, November 8, the Department of  Health and Human Services announced that the new Medicare part B  premiums starting in January 2020 will increase by $9.10 a month, a 6.7  percent increase over last year.   In dollars and cents, this means that premiums will go to $144.60 a  month, up from $135 a month. As seniors know all too well, that $144  will be deducted automatically from their Social Security checks, which  is a bitter pill given the fact that Social Security itself is slated  only to rise by 1.6 percent starting January 1.   Very simply, that $9-a-month increase for millions of seniors will  chew up a large part of any COLA that they can possibly receive  starting in January.   So, Mr. Speaker, I just want to footstop that point about the fact  that the Social Security system's COLA, which is tied to general  inflation in the economy, is going up 1.6 percent; whereas, the  Medicare part B premium, which is tied to healthcare costs, is going up  6.7 percent.   This is something that we know is endemic throughout the healthcare  system. In the State of Connecticut, the Department of Insurance  increased commercial insurance rates, that went up again above  inflation, and identified the fact that prescription drug cost was the  primary cost driver.   The Center for Medicare Services last Friday, when they announced the  Medicare part B premiums, also confirmed the fact that it is  prescription drug costs that are driving that 6.7 percent increase.   The increase in prescription drug costs that Medicare paid from 2018  to 2019 was 10 percent, and they are projecting that it is going to go  to 10.10 percent in 2020; thus, we have a $9 increase coming up in  terms of people's premiums.   This is not going to come as a great surprise to the American people.  If you go back to last year's election in 2018, the exit polls showed  that the number one issue that people cared about and were concerned  about and wanted Congress to act on was healthcare costs--more  specifically, prescription drug costs.   That was an election that had the largest voter turnout since 1914 in  a midterm election and elected a new majority with a 10-million-vote  plurality.   So, that is the context that we are in right now, at a moment where  this Congress, and particularly the House of Representatives, is poised  to take up H.R. 3, which is the Lower Drug Costs Now Act. And in the  midst of all the media focus on impeachment, it is important to know  that the committees that have cognizance over healthcare--the Ways and  Means Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Education  and Labor Committee,  [[Page H8832]]  on which I sit--reported out basically the same version of H.R. 3.    And it is, again, a matter of just a couple of weeks for the  Congressional Budget Office to finish scoring the bill that we are  going to take up that measure for a vote.   What does it do? It basically unhandcuffs the Department of Health  and Human Services to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies. By  law, they have been prohibited, with what is called the noninterference  clause, from negotiating lower drug prices.   The VA system has been negotiating prescription drug costs for  decades, and, in fact, they get a much better price for veterans in  America than the folks who, again, are covered by Medicare.   So that noninterference clause is going to be scaled back. DHS is  going to be able to negotiate the 250 highest brand-name drug costs  tied to an international price index--because America pays the highest  drug costs by far. The next highest country is Switzerland, and they  pay 25 percent less than we do here in the U.S.   Again, what do those savings mean in terms of folks on Medicare?  Already CBO has told us, for people on part D, which is the outpatient  prescription drug benefit, they, again, will see a reduction in the  out-of-pocket costs, which today are unlimited in terms of any  copayments that they are paying for medications. That will be capped at  $2,000.   I have a constituent up in Killingly, Connecticut; she is a retired  teacher. She has AFib. She is on Medicare part D. It has been a great  help to her. But those copayments, because the AFib medication is so  expensive, cost her $13,000 a year.   That will be brought down to $2,000 a year if we pass H.R. 3, and  that is just one example of the benefits--$350 billion in savings to  Medicare over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.   Again, this is a program, Medicare, which is slated to go into  negative territory, according to the trustee, starting in 2026. We are  giving a $350 billion lifeline to Medicare to make sure that it is an  enduring program moving forward in the future.   That is why organizations like AARP, the National Committee to  Preserve Social Security and Medicare, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic  Social Justice, Patients for Affordable Drugs Now, and the Small  Business Majority are supporting H.R. 3.   It is time to sit up and pay attention to what just happened last  week to Medicare and pass H.R. 3 for America's patients and seniors.                            ____________________
