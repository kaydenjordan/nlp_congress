 Mr. President, it is my honor to recognize Mr.  Mitchell Waldman for his long and exceptional record of service on the  occasion of his retirement at the end of the month. Mr. Waldman has  served our Nation for more than 42 years in various national security  roles across the executive and legislative branches of government and  in the private sector, providing counsel to Senators, Secretaries,  CNOs, and CEOs.   For the past decade, Mr. Waldman has served as executive vice  president of Government and Customer Relations for Huntington Ingalls  Industries, America's largest military shipbuilding company. At  Huntington Ingalls, Mr. Waldman has been responsible for leading the  company's engagements with the legislative branch, the executive  branch, business and trade associations, and think tanks. Before this  appointment, Mr. Waldman served as vice president for business  development of advanced programs and technology for Northrop Grumman's  aerospace systems sector.   Before joining Northrop Grumman, Mr. Waldman served as national  security advisor to my good friend, former U.S. Senator for Mississippi  Trent Lott, as well as a national security consultant in the office of  the Senate majority leader. Mr. Waldman has held a number of executive  positions for the U.S. Navy, including Deputy Assistant Secretary of  the Navy (Ships), Director of Cost Engineering and Industrial Analysis  for Naval Sea Systems Command, and Deputy Program Manager for  Amphibious Warfare Programs.   Mr. Waldman received a bachelor of science in Mechanical Engineering  from the University of Florida and a juris doctor from Catholic  University of America's Columbus School of Law. He is also a graduate  of Yale University's executive management program and the defense  systems management college program managers course. He has been honored  with the U.S. Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the State of  Mississippi Distinguished Civilian Service Award, and the D.C. City  Council of Engineering Societies Architect of the Year award.   Mr. Waldman's contributions also extend to his service on the board  of directors for the Shipbuilders Council of America, the National  Bureau of Asian Research, the Armed Services YMCA, the Naval Aviation  Museum Foundation, and the Naval War College Foundation. Additionally,  he is a member of the external advisory board for the University of  Florida's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.   I would like to express a heartfelt ``thank you'' to Mr. Waldman for  a career marked by the utmost devotion to our country. I would also  like to wish him good luck as he begins a new phase in life; may the  new journey be as fulfilling as his career has been. It is with sincere  respect and kindest regards that I wish Mitch Waldman, his wife Debbie,  and his daughter Emily: ``Fair winds and following seas.''                            ____________________
