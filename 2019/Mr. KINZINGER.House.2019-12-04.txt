 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of this legislation, I rise in strong  support and encourage its swift passage.   By some estimates, nearly 48 billion robocalls were made in the U.S.  in 2018, which is a 57 percent increase over 2017.   This antirobocall bill provides the FCC new authorities to impose  substantial fines on violators--up to $20,000 per violation, and  possibly higher in some cases. It requires phone companies to verify  callers and help block robocalls at no extra charge.   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake: This legislation is a big step forward.  But given the rapidly changing technology, combined with the fact that  many of these calls come from overseas, we can't let up, and more will  need to be done.   Thankfully, this bill requires a number of reports to Congress over  the coming months that will allow us to start to crack down on these  perpetrators even harder.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work we have done, bicameral and  bipartisan. I thank those involved.
