 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  Diwali and honor its message of light triumphing over darkness.   This Sunday, families in San Joaquin County and across the world will  gather to celebrate the festival of lights with their families and  friends.   Diwali holds a special place in the hearts of the South Asian  community and serves as a beacon of hope, unity, and joy.   My wife grew up celebrating Diwali with her own family. From lighting  diyas to decorating her doorstep with rangoli, it is a chance now to  make sure that that tradition lives on with my own daughter and her  Indian heritage celebrating the values that Diwali embodies.   I am so grateful to the South Asian community whose hard work,  dedication, and vibrant culture are such an important part of San  Joaquin County and across the United States.   Madam Speaker, I hope this year's Diwali is filled with joy, love,  and plenty of good sweets.                            ____________________
