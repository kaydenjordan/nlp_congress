 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724,  which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban that prevented South  Carolina resident and data scientist Nazanin Zinouri from returning to  the United States after visiting her mother in Iran.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
