 Mr. President, I understand that this week it is the  intention of the majority leader to put on the floor of this Chamber a  resolution that is related to taking on the enormous challenge of  climate chaos. If I just heard that announced, I would say ``well  done'' because it is way past time for us to wrestle with this calamity  affecting all of our States and all countries around the globe.   Temperatures across the planet are going up. All kinds of impacts are  being felt. So if the majority leader said, ``Yes, we are going to rise  to our responsibilities and have a serious debate on the floor; we are  going to take a bill to committee; we are going to wrestle with how we  in America cannot only take on carbon pollution here but show the type  of leadership that mobilizes countries around the world and mobilizes  leadership around the world,'' well, then, I would say ``well done.''   But, unfortunately, that is not what is about to happen. The majority  leader says he doesn't want to talk about climate. So he wants to put a  resolution on the floor with no debate in the committee, no serious  effort to develop a series of policies to take on this calamity, and  just to create a farce out of this Chamber. This Chamber, which I love,  is being used in this horrific fashion, taking very serious issues that  threaten our economy and threaten our natural resources and making fun  of them and choosing to do nothing.   It was Henry David Thoreau who said: ``What is the use of a house if  you haven't got a tolerable planet to put it on?'' But I am sure that  when Henry David Thoreau spoke he had no inkling of the challenges we  would be facing here in the year 2019.   The challenge in this year of 2019 is that in a single human lifetime  the carbon dioxide in the air has gone up 30 percent--trapping enormous  quantities of heat, raising the temperature of our oceans, where 90  percent of the heat is trapped, changing the weather that we experience  in all kinds of ways, and driving a huge increase in forest fires in  our country. If that alone were the impact, that would be enough to  take action. In fact, if we just look at that one issue of forest  fires, looking at the Fourth National Climate Assessment, it is  estimated that the change in climate has doubled the acres burned by  forest fires--just that one issue.   In my home State of Oregon, we really see this. In the Northwest  there is a beautiful forest. The landscape, particularly west of the  Cascades, has the most incredible old-growth forest and timber stands  you would ever see, and it is burning at an unprecedented rate.   Why is that? Well, for one, we have summers that are hotter and dryer  than before. That hot, dry period extends for about 2 months longer  than before. Then, we have storms that are more likely to have  lightning strikes than before. Combine this very dry forest with  lightning strikes, and you have a huge problem on your hands. It isn't  just some remote forest that is burning. It is our natural resources,  our ecosystems, and our timber stands. It is also having an impact on  the commerce of our cities and the recreational industry.   That is not the only impact that we see in my home State of Oregon.  We also see that the acidification of the Pacific Ocean from carbon  dioxide is starting to make it hard for shellfish to make shells. Most  significantly, 10 years ago we discovered that the acidity of the  Pacific Ocean was killing the newly born oysters as they tried to  create a shell and to do so in more acidic water. We have to change the  chemistry of the ocean water now. We have to buffer it in order to  enable the oyster industry to survive. What kind of canary in the coal  mine is that? What kind of warning is it that the shellfish is in  trouble because the ocean is becoming too acidic?   You may say: Why does that have anything to do with carbon in the  atmosphere? It has everything to do with carbon in the atmosphere,  because the ocean waves absorb the carbon dioxide, it becomes carbonic  acid, and that acid makes the ocean more acidic.    I stand on the beach in Oregon and look out at the Pacific Ocean. Of  course, you can only look out at about 20 miles of the sea, but all you  see is water. It is hard to imagine that you would have to go thousands  of miles to hit another continent. Yet, that ocean, as vast as it is,  has changed its chemistry in our lifetime, not just becoming more  acidic but becoming warmer. In fact, we have a calamity ongoing right  now off the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington. The kelp is  disappearing. With the kelp disappearing, that is a concern for every  fisherman. The kelp forests provide a lot of shelter and food for a lot  of species. How do we know what impact that will have on our fisheries,  which are so important to our coastal economy?   We have the fact that the change in snowpack is affecting our winter  sports. The lowered average snowpack just means warmer, smaller trout  and salmon streams in the summer. People want to fish. They want  healthy streams, not streams that are too tiny and too hot for the  salmon and the trout. You see the impact we are having on forests,  farming, fishing, and on the cities from smoke and on human health as  people inhale that smoke. It is not just an impact on the economy. It  is an impact on our health and our children's health. That is just in  my State.   So I would ask my colleagues across the aisle, every one of them, to  say: Do you know what? We have a responsibility to take on issues that  are doing great damage.   That damage isn't just wildfires. We are seeing more intense weather  events across the country. This is in all kinds of places--severe  weather storms, droughts, hail, tornadoes, and, probably most  significantly, more powerful hurricanes, like Hurricane Michael and  Hurricane Florence just last year in 2018. Of course we saw the trio of  hurricanes in 2017.   You say: Are hurricanes connected to all of this? How can that be?   Hurricanes take their energy from the ocean. When the ocean is  warmer, it creates a fiercer hurricane. It takes that energy, and it  becomes winds that are moving faster and a hurricane that is larger and  endures longer when it hits land.   It is estimated that extreme weather events cost Americans nearly a  half trillion dollars over the last 3 years. In 2017 alone, between the  fires and the hurricanes, damages were estimated at $300 billion. That  is real damage. That is real economic damage happening here in the  United States of America. When talking about $1 billion of damage, that  is talking about a lot of families being set back a long way. We are  talking about a lot of infrastructure being ripped up, and we are  talking about lives lost.   Despite this enormous damage and despite lives lost, the majority  leader wants to create a farce over an issue threatening our country  and our planet? That is just wrong. It is way beyond wrong--to see the  face of a calamity and to do nothing. Well, it could go with all kinds  of adjectives--none of them complimentary, not a one.   We should be the opposite here, taking on the responsibility of  addressing these issues that are having an impact--having an impact in  the heartland, having an impact on our soy and corn crops, having an  impact on the coasts, having an impact in the Southeast, with  hurricanes, and the Northeast, with Lyme disease and spreading tick  infestations, the loss of the moose, and the lobsters heading north  along the ocean into Canada.   So we must not bury our heads in the tar sands. We cannot allow the  political donations that are present now in our corrupted governmental  system to deter us from doing the work we need to do. Yet that appears  to be exactly what is happening. We have a broader responsibility  here--a responsibility to our sons and daughters. We have a  responsibility to our grandchildren and their sons and daughters and  their grandchildren.  [[Page S1947]]    This contamination of our atmosphere cannot be easily undone. Carbon  dioxide stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. So we have to  prevent it from being put there in the first place. There is so much we  can do together. There is so much we can do to say this challenge is  real, to say we will work together as Americans to take this on and to  help lead the world in ending this horrific damage that will persist  for hundreds of years.   There is so much to do. We can create millions of good-paying jobs  together for America and export products to the world instead of buying  products from the world. We can make sure that as we do that and as we  invest in an energy transformation, not only do we create millions of  good-paying jobs, but we also make sure that rural America is not left  behind, that our former fossil fuel communities are not left behind,  and that our frontline urban communities that have so often been left  behind are not left behind. We can make an economic renaissance that  goes into every corner of our Nation where often economic improvements  have not gone before.   These elements are the core elements of the Green New Deal. One is to  face reality and together say: Yes, we have a big challenge in front of  us of devastating consequences and growing consequences. Maybe it was a  theory 20 years ago, but today it is a reality in every town across  this country. It is a big calamity. We should say we will work together  to take it on. That is the second basic principle, coming together, and  then there is a surge of activity to develop alternatives and deploy  alternatives to the use of fossil fuels.    The third piece of this puzzle is that in so doing, we will create  millions of good-paying jobs. Isn't that what so many leaders run on? I  certainly love the idea of good-paying jobs.   My dad, a union mechanic, was able to raise a family and be part of  the great middle class of America and be part of the American dream:  buy a house, take the family camping on vacations, participate in  having a 40-hour workweek, and get paid overtime if you had to work  more. Yet that dream is further and further out of reach. Don't we want  to create those better paying jobs in the process of renovating our  energy economy?   Years ago, I undertook tearing the insides out of a house in the  1980s and then rebuilt that house. When you rebuild a house, there is  plumbing, wiring, framing, sheetrock, windows, and roofing. I would buy  a lot of stuff to renovate that house. That type of construction  renovation puts a lot of people to work. If construction renovation  puts people to work, think about how renovating our entire energy  economy puts people to work. That is the third core principle.   The fourth is to make sure those economic gains go to those who have  previously been left behind. That is an important message for rural  America. That is an important message for urban frontline communities  previously left behind. There is so much work to do and so many ways we  can make sure these communities participate.   When I go out to Oregon, I do a townhall in every county every year-- 36 counties. Twenty-two of them are rural. In political terms, you  would describe them as deep red. People are frustrated by the very low  wages and the very low number of jobs in those rural communities. Now  we have an opportunity to say we have to go to work in an intensive  way--a way that can create jobs all across this Nation and all across  rural America. Instead, we have the majority leader bringing the issue  to the floor as a farce. That is profoundly disturbing.   I encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let us not  miss this opportunity before us--an opportunity for America to lead, an  opportunity for America to build its economy, an opportunity for  America to lead the world. We cannot afford to miss that opportunity.  America cannot afford for us to miss that opportunity, and the world  cannot afford for us to fail.   Thank you.                            ____________________
