 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida for his  long service to this Nation's veterans, as well as his family's service  to our veterans. It is appropriate we are here the week of Veterans Day  bringing important legislation to the floor once again, a committee  that understands our responsibility, is not political or partisan, it  is to this Nation's veterans in keeping the promise.   Mr. Speaker, I do rise in strong support of H.R. 918, as amended, the  Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act offered by Mr. Coffman.   I would also like to take note of the work that Mr. Coffman has done  on many issues. This one, in particular, is near and dear to my heart.  His leadership has helped get us to the point where we are making  progress on this.   As you heard the gentleman from Florida say, the issues that come  with service in this Nation's military can be physical injury or they  can be the mental injuries of war. We also understand that with that  comes changes in behavior, and there are reasons that people are  removed from service, and I am incredibly proud that this committee has  taken this issue head-on. Of those who are removed because of issues  that they started to acquire from their service in uniform, this  legislation is going to ensure that those people with less than  honorable discharges get the care; specifically, focusing on military  sexual trauma, the idea that we have warriors in uniform who are  assaulted, in many cases, by fellow servicemembers, and because of the  inability to reintegrate in that unit, they are discharged with less  than honorable paper, precluding them from getting the services that  they have earned.   With more than 20 veterans a day--and I think those numbers are  probably low--taking their own lives, this issue of making sure that  all servicemembers and all veterans have access to mental healthcare,  removing those barriers, is of prime importance.   Secretary Shulkin has made the first step in this. Mr. Coffman has  continued to make sure that this committee stays focused on this,  continuing to add more and more access. For that, this legislation  ensures the initiative becomes permanent. It puts it into law and it  takes us the next step forward. For that, I am grateful.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. O'Rourke), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Economic  Opportunity, but, more importantly, probably the most effective voice  in this Congress on veterans' mental health and suicide.    Mr. Speaker, I have two more speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms.  Gabbard), a veteran herself, a veteran of the conflicts in Iraq, and a  strong voice for our veterans and specifically for our veterans with  mental health issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer), who, since coming to Congress, has focused on  the issues of care for veterans, and for that I am grateful.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank all of the speakers here who  laid out exactly what this bill does. It is the right thing to do. It  is something that needs to move forward.   I would also suggest that, as we approach Veterans Day, one of the  best ways we can honor those who gave service to this country is  conduct our business in the House of Representatives the way it was  done on this piece of legislation: in a bipartisan manner, with common  goals, common values, smart thinking that was put into it to move this  forward for the care of a fellow citizen, and doing the right thing.   So, for that, I thank everyone involved with this, and I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 918.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1133.   And, again, the gentleman was very clear: by allowing the VA to  provide healthcare to non-VA eligible donors, veterans can more easily  receive lifesaving donations from their families and friends. Family  members of veterans are often the best match for providing a veteran  with a live organ donation and are typically more willing to be a live  donor.   Under current law, a veteran can receive only a live organ donation  from another veteran receiving the transplant at a VA hospital.   This is one of those pieces of legislation that, I think, when many  of us saw it brought forward, makes great common sense. It is the right  thing to do. I understand possibly why they put that in there. But all  of us know that it is going to be that exact scenario that it is going  to be a family member or someone near who is going to want to do the  transplant. If the best place to do that for the veteran is at the VA  hospital, and they can get them in, it makes great sense to do it.   So I do want to also thank Representative Carter for bringing this  forward.   This is, again, improving care, and making sure that we are focusing  on the issues that we can make a difference on.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Judge Carter. Everybody  make note of this. Common sense is going to prevail. We are in full  support of H.R. 1133.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote accordingly, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the manager's amendment to H.R.  1900, as amended, the National Veterans Memorial and Museum Act.   I would also like to say that when I came to Congress, this is how I  thought things were supposed to work: citizens  [[Page H8555]]  come together, they come up with a great idea, they decide that they  are going to honor our Nation's veterans, they talk to their Members of  Congress, they bring it here, we all work together, we come up with a  plan to put it in place, and we come to the floor to pass a piece of  legislation.                                time  1515    This is one of those times where that little cartoon, ``I am just a  bill sitting on Capitol Hill,'' actually worked that way. For that, I  am grateful for the work that has been done.   I would especially like to thank Chairman Roe for his willingness, as  we looked at this bill, to put some guardrails in place making sure  that before we designate the memorial and museum to U.S. veterans of  all eras, that it truly is the National Veterans Memorial and Museum.   The materials provided to Members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee  clearly demonstrate the intent to create an architecturally stunning,  state-of-the-art institution in the heart of the country that honors  veterans and educates the country about those sacrifices. That is an  incredibly noble cause.   Just as important to the eventual success of this effort is the  responsibility of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee to ensure that  it be established and operated to the highest possible standards  forever, as are the museums and cemeteries under its jurisdiction run  by the National Cemetery Administration and the American Battle  Monuments Commission. I feel the legislation we are voting on today  does exactly that.   Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the gentlewoman  from Columbus, Ohio (Mrs. Beatty). I would also like to thank the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers) for working with us on this. The  gentleman truly represents the best of what it means to be a  representative. His good-faith effort to continue to improve on a piece  of legislation, taking in the concerns that people had to make it work,  it is, to me, incredibly encouraging. I thank the gentleman for that.  His work is going to ensure that this is going to be a spectacular  museum and monument to our Nation's veterans.   Under the bill before us today, the museum will submit a report to  Congress before it opens. The report will address the issues of budget,  governance, operations, vision, and veteran outreach.   There is a provision we are adding as part of the manager's amendment  that allows Congress to remove that designation after 5 years. We will  not need to do that. This will be a wonderful facility. We put this in  place as part of our responsibility of oversight.   With the addition of these provisions, I believe the committee has  done its due diligence before recommending the House to confer this  national designation.   In addition, it has put in place the necessary guardrails to ensure  that this will be built in Columbus, Ohio, to the highest standards. I  am proud to say this will be the National Veterans Memorial and Museum.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his words. I  appreciate his work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty), a staunch and truly effective advocate for her constituents  and for veterans across this Nation. This museum will reside in her  district.  [[Page H8556]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank everyone who spoke here. It is the way it is supposed to  work. I am very excited about this.   Mr. Speaker, I would encourage you to go and look. This is going to  be spectacular. It is at nationalvmm.org, if you want to see where they  are and the progress that is being made. We are going to be open here  soon in the spring. I am going to take Mrs. Beatty up on this as a  veteran myself.   I think of the countless families and veterans who will take their  children and walk through the halls and tell the story. This is an  important piece of our history. It is important to tell the story and  it is important for us to preserve these stories.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2123, the VETS Act of 2017.   Since its very inception, the Veterans Health Administration has been  a leader in medical advancements and the delivery of healthcare. This  legislation would ensure it continues this history of leadership by  allowing VA providers to engage in the delivery of telemedicine to  veterans all over the country, regardless of where the provider is  located. These are paper barriers, these are legal barriers, not  barriers of technology, to allow us to deliver care.   Telemedicine and medicine, in general, is changing so rapidly, we  need to make sure that barriers are not put in place, especially for  rural veterans, and many of us have them all over.   Last week, I did a field hearing in International Falls, Minnesota,  which, by the way, will be 1 degree tomorrow for all of you, just so  you know. Those folks are veterans. They have served, but they are  miles from a VA facility. The technology that we have, and we know it  works, allows them to get that.   If we have veterans sitting on State borders, if we have veterans  sitting in remote areas, it sometimes makes it difficult. It will give  VA the tools it needs to remain a leader in the use of telehealth  technology.   I am particularly thankful to Representatives Thompson and Brownley  for their leadership. They identified a problem, worked on it, and came  up with a workable solution that we can put into statute, making sure,  the bottom line, again, that every veteran, regardless of geographic  location, gets the best, most advanced care possible.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, it makes sense. Removing some of these  paper barriers, as the gentleman from Michigan said, geography,  weather, other things, it makes sense to use the technology to improve  the care.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2123, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2601, the VICTOR Act. This  legislation will again eliminate barriers to high-quality organ  transplant centers for certain veterans seeking their services by  allowing veterans access to a transplant center, regardless of its  location, when a provider determines there is a medically compelling  reason to do so, or when the veteran would face unusual or excessive  burden in receiving the transplant at a VA facility.   That is smart. That is common sense. It makes the case that the  transplant facilities at the VA are good, but, as Dr. Dunn pointed out,  a diverse society, a diverse geographic spread of veterans, certain  cases come up that make it medically wrong to try and transport someone  to a further facility. And for all of those reasons, this is, again,  one of those things that is just smart, all in the interest of the best  care for our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, it makes great sense. We are in full  support of the bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R.  2601.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3634, requiring the VA  to provide electronic documentation of the GI Bill beneficiary housing  stipend. Once again, I want to thank Mr. Himes, whom we are going to  hear from in just a moment, for responding to constituents, responding  to a need, and crafting a piece of legislation that makes sure--as  currently the VA does not provide sufficient information about the  exact amount of housing stipend that a beneficiary receives under GI  Bill benefits.   Many veterans rely on their housing stipend to pay for their housing  while they are attending school; and, therefore, it can be necessary  for them to show proof of their housing allowance as proof of income.  Without this proof of income, veterans are often finding themselves  unable to secure housing before the start of a school term.   This is--once again, it is being used a lot today, but this is a case  that I would concur--a commonsense piece of legislation that asks for  documentation that the VA can electronically provide to allow all of  our veterans to more easily use their earned benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes), the author of this piece of legislation and a  staunch supporter of our Nation's veterans.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut once  again. This is a good piece of legislation. It will speed the benefits  that were earned by our Nation's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3634, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I feel like we are on a roll, Mr. Speaker. We should stay here all  day. Bipartisan, commonsense legislation improving the lives of  veterans, it kind of feels like what we came here for.   I rise in strong support of another one of those, H.R. 3705, as  amended, the Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act introduced by the  gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree).   Again, you heard it from the vice chairman, if a veteran incurs an  overpayment in benefits, VA sends out a series of letters notifying him  or her of  [[Page H8562]]  this debt and the steps that can be taken to address the issue. The  letter is time stamped when mailed and, if what VA is asking for is not  received within a specific timeline, the veteran loses the ability to  take certain actions toward addressing or disputing the debt.   Many veterans come to every one of our offices reporting never  receiving these letters. I know all of us have heard that story. These  are people who I know and trust. It got sent to the wrong address,  something happened, and they never got it.   Further, the letter VA is sending is full of complicated legal terms  and citations of public laws. We know these letters alarm and confuse  veterans unnecessarily. I have personally had them come in, show them  to me, and as the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee-- and it is a VA letter--I don't understand what they are asking for in  this from a veteran who receives it out of nowhere.   The bill before us today represents a real bipartisan effort to  ensure that veterans get timely notices of overpayments or debt, and  that these notices are respectful, informative, helpful, and  collaborative.   It does it in three ways. First, H.R. 3705, as amended, directs the  Secretary to develop a way veterans may elect to receive debt  notification letters by email in addition to receiving standard mail  notices. Imagine that in 2017.   Second, it directs VA to conduct a study of the problem of veterans  not receiving debt letters and to provide a description of the  nonlegislative actions the Secretary could take to reduce the number of  incorrect addresses, particularly by using the other VHA databases.   At this point in time, I would also note we are taking steps in our  committee to make sure now, when you leave the service, that we are  able to capture emails, we are able to capture alternate addresses to  make sure because a lot of times veterans are in transition, they are  moving, those types of things are happening.   Third and most importantly, the bill requires that, in the future,  debt notices provide a clear explanation in understandable language for  why the debt is owed and what due process options a veteran has  available to her or him.   The CBO has estimated the cost of this measure to be insignificant.   The approaches in the bill are the first steps to remedying a  longstanding problem and will make a positive change for the thousands  of veterans who receive overpayment notices.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Disability Assistance and Memorial  Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Mike Bost and Ranking Member Elizabeth  Esty for working together on this legislation, in addition to Dr. Roe.  We are also going to hear from the author of this piece of legislation.  Certainly I encourage support of H.R. 3705.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree), who is the author of this good, smart, overdue piece of  legislation.     In closing, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Maine  for her remarks. This is a good piece of legislation. As I have said,  everybody who serves in this House has received veterans in their  office either carrying this letter or talking about a letter they never  received. This makes it much better. It gives the benefit of the doubt  back to the veteran and makes it easier for them to get this solved in  the right manner.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in support of H.R. 3705, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3949 allows multi-State apprenticeship programs to  go through GI Bill approval in just the State that they are  headquartered in, streamlining the approval process so that programs  have a lower administrative hurdle to jump over before being able to  provide training to veterans.   Currently, non-Federal apprenticeship programs that have locations in  multiple States must go through the approval process with the State  approving agency in each of the States where it operates before it can  be approved for GI Bill benefits in that State.   In order to encourage more high-quality apprenticeship programs to  obtain approval for GI Bill benefits so that they can serve more  veterans, this bill would allow multi-State programs to simply seek  approval from the State approving agency in the State where they are  headquartered.   Once they have obtained the State's approval, the program will  automatically be approved in all of the other States in which it  operates.   We are encouraging apprenticeships. They are a great way for our  veterans to use their earned benefits to get into well-paying, long- term careers. We should encourage more companies and industries to do  that. This piece of legislation is smart and does that. In just a  moment we will hear from one of the authors of it explaining how it  will do that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), who is not just a national voice, but a global  voice on manufacturing entrepreneurism, and apprenticeships; and who is  one of the authors of this piece of legislation.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California and his  coauthors.   Again, this is smart. He is leaning into this, bringing innovation.  He came to the Veterans' Affairs Committee and looked at ways that we  can streamline this process. It is a good piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 4173. I would like to  thank the gentleman, Mr. Banks of Indiana, for his work on this. This  is a piece of legislation very near and dear to my heart.   One of the first pieces of legislation I worked on when I got to this  House in 2007 was the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act,  which was dealing with the loss of a young warrior from Iowa. One of  the pieces of legislation that came out of that was the Veterans Crisis  Line, with the idea that we needed that.   That was a good piece of legislation, but as time has gone by, Mr.  Banks has pointed out ways to improve that. I am in full support. I am  grateful for the thought that he has put into this. I am grateful for  the gentleman from Florida's recognition that we may never know with  absolute certainty how many lives we save, but I think each of us know  that this has been an invaluable service. It is one we should continue  and try to make better.   Mr. Speaker, I am in full support, and I reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H8565]]         Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, over the last 2 days, we have passed 14 bills out of  this committee, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, affecting  everything from suicide and suicide prevention to transplant, to the  delivery of GI bills, to the streamlining of the bureaucracy inside the  agency, all with a bipartisan effort on what can we do as a nation to  best deliver on our promise of the earned benefits that we so deeply  owe to those who served us. It is appropriate that we are doing it the  week of Veterans Day.   But I want to remind people, this is what is possible, Mr. Speaker.  This summer, the New York Times wrote a story, and it said, if you  really want to know how Congress is supposed to function, look at the  VA Committee. They were pointing out, these are not easy things.   People, Mr. Speaker, may think, well, everybody supports veterans,  but it is hard to get policy right. It is hard to find funding. It is  hard to agree on the best way to deliver it. But I would have to say,  the last 2 days are proof positive of it. We can do it. We must do it.  We are obligated to do it.   When people think of Veterans Day, ways that you can observe Veterans  Day, I am always of the belief that the best way to honor veterans is  to attempt to live our life in a manner that reflects the dignity and  the sacrifice that they gave in their service.   As we sat here today, it may be easy to take it for granted. The  public gets frustrated over what happens or what doesn't happen here.  The idea that there are billions of human beings on this planet who  don't get the chance to self-govern, who don't get the chance to openly  and freely debate, to try and  [[Page H8566]]  craft a society we want to live in, and we do it here because of the  sacrifice that was given to keep this Nation free.   So the work we do here--and it is often said, you shouldn't get a pat  on the back for doing what you are supposed to do. That is not what  this is about. This is about a recognition that this Nation cares  deeply about the daughters and sons who will serve us. This Nation  expects the Congress to make sure that they are cared for in a manner  that reflects their sacrifice, and they want us to do it in a  bipartisan manner that celebrates the idea of self-governance.   So with that, I would say, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this  piece of legislation as the final piece of this package. I am proud of  the work and to call my friend from Florida a dear friend, someone who  I know that, between you and your father, has given decades of service  to our Nation's veterans.   There are reasons to be optimistic. There are reasons to believe that  we can get through this. There is reason to believe that, come Veterans  Day, our better days lie ahead of us.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4173, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
