 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and his  kind remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1237, the COAST Research Act,  of which I am an original cosponsor.   Those of us who live on the coast understand that the coast is an  essential part of our lives. In my own State of Florida, approximately  80 percent of the population lives along the coast. About 6 million  people work in our coastal communities and produce nearly $280 billion  a year in wages and contribute over $700 billion in gross domestic  product.   Today, we face uncertainty about the sustainability and the  resilience of our coasts. Parts of our coast have come under assault  from the ocean itself, even before anyone imagined anything about sea  level rise.   Acidification presents uncertainties in the ocean and could pose  severe effects to the biodiversity of our marine wildlife.   Along the Space Coast, we have seen a recent plague of algal blooms  that foul our estuaries and threaten our economy. It is serious and it  is heartbreaking.   The message is clear: We need to take care of our precious coast so  that we can continue to enjoy the lifestyle and the economic well-being  that we all cherish.   We must work with the Federal Government in the interest of improving  our coastal resilience. That is why I have joined Congresswoman Suzanne  Bonamici in directing NOAA to pick up the role of leading research for  coastal acidification.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record four letters of support for the  COAST Research Act from the following organizations: the Consortium for  Ocean Leadership, the Surfrider Foundation, the Pacific States Marine  Fisheries Commission, and the Northwest fisheries groups.                                Consortium for Ocean Leadership,                                      Washington, DC, March 1, 2019.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Bonamici: On behalf of the Consortium       for Ocean Leadership (COL), which represents our nation's       leading ocean science, research, and technology organizations       from academia, industry, and aquariums, I am writing to       express support for the Coastal and Ocean Acidification       Stressors and Threats (COAST) Research Act (H.R. 6267).       America relies on our ocean and coastal communities for our       basic individual needs as well as our overall security and       prosperity. Keeping these environments, and therefore their       communities, safe from the myriad threats associated with       ocean acidification is paramount to our ocean security. COL       applauds the COAST Research Act in its mission to strengthen       existing ocean acidification initiatives and introduce new       strategies to better understand and manage this environmental       stressor.        Ocean acidification, which occurs as the ocean absorbs       higher concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide,       threatens the health of the entire ocean. As corals,       shellfish, and many types of plankton struggle to create and       maintain their shells or exoskeletons in more acidic waters,       ocean food webs are disrupted. This, in turn, threatens the       crucial balance in many ecosystems, as well as our own food       security, and jeopardizes the stability of those whose       livelihoods depend on a healthy ocean. Combatting the causes       and mitigating the effects of ocean acidification requires       sustained congressional support and interagency       collaboration, as well as engagement from stakeholders in the       private sector and academia. I strongly commend the COAST       Research Act's commitment to advancing ocean acidification       research and monitoring efforts, as well as promoting       cooperation among stakeholder groups.        I offer my sincere thanks to you, Congresswoman Bonamici,       along with Congresswoman Chellie Pingree and Congressmen Don       Young and Bill Posey, for your bipartisan efforts to help us       better understand ocean acidification and improve overall       ocean health by strengthening federal investments in the       research and increasing monitoring of changing ocean       conditions. Our lives and our future may well depend on it.            Respectfully,                                              Jonathan W. White,                                                   RADM (Ret.), USN,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                             Surfrider Foundation,                                        Clemente, CA, March 7, 2019.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      Washington, DC.      Re Support for Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors and           Threats (COAST) Research Act.         Dear Honorable Congresswoman Bonamici: On behalf of       Surfrider Foundation's 160 Chapters and student clubs and our       250,000 supporters, activists and members worldwide, we write       to express our enthusiastic supports for Coastal and Ocean       Acidification Stressors and Threats (COAST) Research Act. The       Surfrider Foundation (Surfrider) is a non-profit grassroots       organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of our       world's oceans, waves and beaches.        As climate change continues to impact our ocean and coast,       local communities need to plan ahead to better understand and       plan for a changing climate. Ocean acidification (OA) is       particularly concerning for Surfrider. The current       understanding of ocean acidification impacts on ocean and       estuarine ecosystems is inadequate and must be improved to       fully prepare for and adapt to changing environmental       conditions and manage our natural resources in nearshore       locations. In addition, more integration and coordination is       needed between local, state, and national entities to ensure       adequate scientific research and investments in related       topics such as nutrient loading, hypoxia, ocean       acidification, and harmful algae bloom research and other       observational systems are targeted to meet coastal       communities' needs.        Surfrider is particularly pleased to see the legislation       focuses on adaptation strategies for ocean acidification and       expands the definition of ocean acidification to include       estuaries. In addition, we are pleased to see that the bill       would expand the Interagency Working Group's strategic       research plan to also address socioeconomic effects of ocean       and coastal acidification and assess adaptation and       mitigation strategies.        Furthermore, establishing an Advisory Board to increase       coordination among stakeholders, and requiring NOAA to       facilitate an Interagency Working Group's strategic research       plan, that coordinates monitoring and research efforts among       federal and local agencies and stakeholders is critical to       ensure success of this important piece of legislation.        Thank you for introducing such important legislation.            Sincerely,                                          Stefanie Sekich-Quinn,                                       Surfrider Foundation, Coastal                                              Preservation Manager.

[[Page H4325]]                                          ____                                              Pacific States Marine                                            Fisheries Commission,                                        Portland, OR, March 4, 2019.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Bonamici: The Pacific States Marine       Fisheries Commission has a standing resolution adopted by the       Commissioners to support and encourage new funding should be       identified to augment coastwide research and monitor changing       ocean conditions, harmful algal blooms, and ocean       acidification.        We have had an opportunity to review the Coastal and Ocean       Acidification Stressors and Threats (COAST) Research Act. The       bill would reauthorize the Federal Ocean Acidification       Research and Monitoring Act to continue funding research       through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration       and the National Science Foundation. The bill would designate       NOAA as the lead federal agency in the coordination of the       federal response to ocean acidification. The bill also       broadens the program to include marine estuaries.        The bill, as introduced, strengthens the federal research       programs that focus on ocean acidification. West Coast and       Alaska ocean stakeholders are already feeling the       socioeconomic impacts of ocean acidification. We view ocean       acidification research as an important ongoing federal       responsibility in seeking to address the negative impacts to       these stakeholders. Pacific States therefore supports the       your efforts and that of other Members of the Ocean Caucus in       seeking to expeditiously move the Coast Research Act through       the House of Representatives.            Regards,                                                      Randy Fisher,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                     March 10, 2019.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Bonamici: From coast to coast, ocean       acidification is having a broad range of impacts on the       health of our ocean and coastal communities. Coastal       industries are continuing to face the reality of an       increasingly acidic ocean. In 2017, researchers at Oregon       State University recorded some of the highest levels of ocean       acidification in the world off the coast of the Pacific       Northwest. Additionally, 63 percent of test sites on the west       coast experienced levels of acidification known to cause       commercial oyster production failures.        Our Pacific Northwest economies, our recreational and       commercial fishing, and shellfish industry as well as our       great northwest tourism economy--all depend on a healthy       ocean. And because we are already seeing the effects of ocean       acidification, we support your efforts and we support H.R.       1237, the Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors and       Threats (COAST) Research Act of 2019.        Much of our knowledge and understanding of ocean       acidification that has emerged in the last decade can be       credited to the federal funding authorized by Federal Ocean       Acidification Research and Monitoring (FOARAM) Act of 2009.       FOARAM established the federal government's work on ocean       acidification by creating the NOAA Ocean Acidification       Program and an interagency working group on ocean       acidification. FOARAM's authorization expired in 2012. The       COAST Research Act amends FOARAM to further improve our       ability to understand acidification in the open ocean as well       as in the coastal zone.        We support the COAST Research Act and believe it will help       our coastal communities better prepare for the effects from       ocean and coastal acidification. Thank you for your       leadership to strengthen the nation's focus and investment in       oceans and coastal acidification.            Sincerely,      Lyf Gildersleeve,        Owner, Flying Fish Company--Sustainable Seafood.      Grant Putnam,        President, Northwest Guides and Anglers Association.      Liz Hamilton,        Executive Director, Northwest Sportfishing Industry       Association.      Joseph Bogaard,        Executive Director, Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition.      Greg Block,        Executive Director, Sustainable Northwest.      David Moskowitz,        Executive Director, The Conservation Angler.      Kurt Beardslee,        Executive Director, Wild Fish Conservancy.      Guido Rahr,        Executive Director, Wild Salmon Center.     Mr. Speaker, we must not fail to preserve the  sustainability and resilience of our coastal resources, our  environments, and our economies.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the COAST Research Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and his  kind words.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 988, the National Estuaries  and Acidification Research Act.   First, I want to thank Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici and Congressman  Brian Mast for working with me and our staff to advance this important  bipartisan legislation. I also want to thank the National Academies of  Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine for their valuable input.   The NEAR Act is a national proposal with a very special connection.  People in my district, the Eighth Congressional District of Florida,  understand in a very deep way the economic and environmental importance  of the ocean and our estuary.   My district is bounded on the east by the Indian River Lagoon, which  is North America's most diverse estuary. As the name implies, our  estuary is a lagoon. It is an estuary separated from the ocean by  barrier islands. The exchange of waters between the lagoon and the sea  makes it an estuary.                                time  1000    The lagoon is 156 miles long, but it is only a half mile to 5 miles  wide and averages just 3 feet in depth. Our lagoon is a wondrous  nursery for sea life, but its physical features make it especially  vulnerable to environmental threats. Unfortunately, the Indian River  Lagoon and other valuable estuaries throughout our country are being  threatened by ocean acidification, along with other stressors.   EPA tells us that, when carbon dioxide is released into the  atmosphere, about one-third of that carbon dioxide is absorbed by  seawater, creating carbonic acid. We have seen this happen in the  ocean, but this process is now seeming to occur in estuaries and  coastal zones.   Ten years of Federal investments in ocean acidification research show  that acidification hurts tourism, recreational fishing, and coastal  communities that depend on healthy marine ecosystems. Shellfish are  especially at peril.   The threats of coastal acidification to our environment and our  economy  [[Page H4331]]  are significant. The story of my district and the Indian River Lagoon  plays out along our entire national coastline. More than half of the  U.S. population lives in coastal areas.   Coastal watershed counties provide an estimated 69 million U.S. jobs  and contribute an estimated $7.9 trillion to the GDP, annually. That is  why I joined with Congresswoman Bonamici to cofound the bipartisan  Congressional Estuary Caucus to work for policies that preserve and  restore our estuaries and to help support other efforts like research  and development to contribute to healthy estuaries.   Regrettably, we don't know a lot about how increasing ocean  acidification affects a nearshore water body like the Indian River  Lagoon. That is because acidification often acts, alongside other  coastal processes, like runoff, erosion, and upwelled water from the  ocean.   These estuary conditions aren't present in the same way in the open  ocean, and they make it difficult to measure acidification's impact  from what we know about the open ocean. As a result, we don't yet have  a great way to measure how acidification plays out in estuaries. We  need more research to support efforts to prevent and mitigate coastal  acidification.   The NEAR Act is a great step toward increasing our knowledge of how  acidification affects our estuaries. The study proposed in this bill  can give us invaluable information to bolster our efforts to preserve  and restore healthy estuaries.   Mr. Speaker, when we take care of our environment, we take care of  ourselves; and, therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in taking  this important step toward understanding how ocean acidification  affects our precious estuaries and support this bill today.
