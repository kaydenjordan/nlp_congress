 Mr. Speaker, today Congress has a rare opportunity to help  millions of Americans achieve their version of the American Dream.   The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act  is the most significant progrowth, deregulation bill this Chamber has  considered in years. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will reduce  the amount of red tape that prevents Americans from accessing the  credit they need to buy a home, a car, or start or expand a business.  It will foster economic growth and make regulation efficient,  effective, and tailored. Perhaps most importantly, it will empower  individual Americans to make independent financial decisions and  informed choices in the marketplace.   Dozens of the provisions in S. 2155 originated right here in the  House, and I am pleased to see the text of my Home Mortgage Disclosure  Adjustment Act and Keeping Capital Local for Underserved Communities  Act, legislation that I worked on closely with my colleague from  Wisconsin, Representative Gwen Moore, included in the bill today.   Whether it is in Rockford, St. Cloud, or Forest Lake, Minnesota, I  consistently hear from small banks and credit unions that want to be  that next critical source of capital and support for families,  businesses, and communities around the State. This bill will allow them  to be just that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his tireless work on  this legislation, and, knowing full well that our work here is far from  complete, I urge my colleagues to make history today. Support giving  more Americans the opportunity to achieve their American Dream, and  pass S. 2155.
