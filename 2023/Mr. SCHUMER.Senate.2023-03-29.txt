 Mr. President, 4,487--4,487. That is the number of  American servicemembers who perished in Iraq by the time the last  combat troops departed in 2011, over a decade ago. Joining them are  over 32,000 American servicemembers and civilians wounded in action and  tens of thousands more who struggled--many to this very day--with  everything from toxic burn pit exposure to PTSD.   It is with these brave servicemembers and civilians in mind and their  families and all who have been impacted by the war in Iraq that the  Senate, today, votes to repeal the Iraq authorizations for use of  military force from 2002 and 1991. The United States and Iraq--the  entire world--have changed dramatically since 2002, and it is time the  laws on the books caught up with those changes.   These AUMFs have outlived their use. These repeals will not harm our  servicemembers abroad nor will they hinder our ability to keep  Americans safe. Every year we keep these AUMFs on the books is another  chance for a future administration to abuse them. War powers belong in  the hands of Congress so we have an obligation to prevent future  Presidents from exploiting these AUMFs to bumble us into a new Middle  East conflict.   I am glad that repealing these AUMFs has been a bipartisan effort,  and I hope this process can be--it should be--a blueprint for how the  Senate works over the next few years. We will have amendments without  being dilatory. We will have debate without stall tactics. We will  continue to look assiduously, diligently for other opportunities to  advance bipartisan bills.   There are many Members and staff I wish to thank for making today's  vote possible because this effort has been years--years--in the making.   First, thank you to Chairman Menendez, of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, as well as Senator Kaine. To watch him work on  this bill, not only day in and day out, not only month in and month  out, but year in and year out because he had a such firm belief that it  was the right thing to do, was a joy. Thank you also to Senator Young,  who worked very hard to make this happen and who brought so many of his  colleagues along.  [[Page S1008]]    I want to thank staff who did the great work here too: Megan Bartley,  Andrew Keller, Elisa Catalano Ewers, JC Jain, Nick Barbash, Lauren  O'Brien, Brandt Anderson. And, of course, there is my staff. I have  been blessed with the greatest staff in the world as you will hear  about soon enough, about one of them: Lane Bodian, Meghan Taira, and  Mike Kuiken.   The American people are tired of endless wars in the Middle East. We  owe it to our servicemembers and our veterans, as well as to their  families and all communities impacted by the war, to repeal these AUMFs  today. I urge a strong ``yes'' vote later this morning.                          Fire Grants and Safety Act    Mr. President, on fire grants, as I said a minute ago, we are trying  to move on bipartisan legislation that really matters to the average  American person. One of these is going to be the Fire Grants and Safety  Act. Later today, the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on the motion  to proceed to the Fire Grants and Safety Act.   This bipartisan legislation would make sure that both SAFER and AFG-- two Federal grant programs that are paid and that volunteer  firefighters rely on--remain available. If we don't extend these  grants, they will expire in a few months and leave our firefighters  without access to the resources they need to keep our communities safe.   Our firefighters, paid and volunteer, are brave. They risk their  lives for us. They run to danger, not away from it. We need to ensure  they have the equipment and personnel necessary to do their jobs for  their own safety and the safety of those they protect. We need this  especially in smaller, more rural, more suburban areas where there  often isn't enough revenue to afford more resources.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes so we can move forward quickly on  this legislation.                                 Debt Ceiling    Now, Mr. President, on the debt ceiling, we are almost a quarter of  the way through 2023, and House Republicans have still failed to answer  the most important question of their majority.   What is your plan?   What is the plan of House Republicans' to raise the debt ceiling? We  hear a new explanation, seemingly every day, from some new corner of  the Republican Conference, but none of it adds up to what Republicans  need most--a clear, detailed, and serious plan.   Even this week, Speaker McCarthy has, in desperation, tried another  new and obviously failing approach. He laid out a new round of vague  conditions, each one more amorphous than the last, and none of them  with any specifics. Then he pulled a huge number out of the sky--$4  trillion--without telling us where, when, or how we would get to it.  That is not a plan. Everyone knows that.   Republicans have been utterly flailing. One day, they say they will  release a budget. Then they say they can't release a budget. One corner  of the party says certain programs are off the table. Then another  group of Republicans suggest the opposite. House Republican leadership  is doing everything except the one thing they must do: Show the  American people your plan, House Republicans. Show us your plan.   So when Speaker McCarthy points fingers at Democrats, all he is  doing--it is so obvious--is trying to deflect from problems he has in  his own conference. That is what is going on every time we hear a new  idea, read a new letter, or hear a new set of talking points from the  Republicans. They are far too divided to unite around a single  proposal. The MAGA wing is pulling in one direction, and those in the  middle are pulling another way. There is no consensus in the Republican  House caucus.   The solution to the debt ceiling, however, is staring the Republicans  in the face. Do what we have done before, Democrats and Republicans,  under President Trump and under President Biden. Stop the  brinksmanship. Stop threatening default. Work with Democrats on a clean  extension of the debt ceiling. No more kicking the can down the road.   Speaker McCarthy, where is your plan?   Democrats and Republicans worked together, as I said, under President  Trump. Even when the Republicans had the majority and the Democrats  could have blocked it, we didn't. We knew our responsibilities to the  people of America, who would be so devastated by a lapse in the debt  ceiling and that their interest rates, their car costs, their home  costs, and so much else would go up.   Well, we did this before by working together in a bipartisan way,  without brinksmanship, without hostage-taking, and we should do it  again this year.                              Women's Healthcare    Mr. President, nominations on hold.   For years, for years--decades--both parties have cooperated in the  Senate to confirm military promotions, nonpolitical. It is simply the  military doing its job and promoting people who deserve it. We have  worked and cooperated to confirm those promotions to ensure our  military's work continues unimpeded and our national security remains  strong.   But, today, one Member--only one Member, the Senator from Alabama  Senator Tuberville--is now blocking more than 180 military promotions  because he objects to women in the military accessing reproductive  care. In doing so, the senior Senator from Alabama is putting the  security of America in jeopardy, and he risks permanently politicizing  the confirmations of routine military promotions.   As Secretary Austin warned yesterday--this is our Secretary of  Defense, who is a former four-star general--``not approving the  recommendations for promotions actually creates a ripple effect  throughout the force that makes us far less ready than we need to be.''    `` . . . far less ready than we need to be,'' Senator Tuberville.  This is our national security. That is what Austin said.   Now, the senior Senator from Alabama claims that his hold has nothing  to do with the Supreme Court's decision on Dobbs. Of course, it does.  It has everything to do with it. He is telling women in the military  they are not allowed to make their own decisions about their health.   That is wrong. I assure the Senator that our women in the military  are more than capable of making those decisions for themselves, and I  assure the Senator that the vast majority of Americans do not agree  with him that he should make the choices for women in the military, who  risk their lives for us, about their health.   It is disappointing. It is disappointing to see that more of my  colleagues on the other side have yet to call out the Senator from  Alabama's reckless stunt. I thank those who, indeed, have raised their  voices, but we need more. Republicans, who claim to be such great  supporters of our military, must announce the harm the Senator from  Alabama is causing.   All of us on both sides feel deeply passionate about issues from time  to time. I respect that Senator Tuberville, whose views dramatically  differ from mine, has deep feelings about this.   Well, Senator Tuberville, I have deep feelings on certain issues--so  do the other 99 Senators--but we don't hold up military promotions and  risk our national security because of those deep feelings.   If every one of us did what the Senator from Alabama is doing, the  military would collapse. So we ought to move forward. I implore my  Republican colleagues to speak out and prevail on the Senator from  Alabama so we can get these promotions confirmed, get our military  operating to its full capacity, and continue working to protect the  Nation.                          Tribute to Gerry Petrella    Mr. President, in tribute to one of the greatest staffers, certainly,  whom I have ever had and I think that the Hill has had in a very long  time, I would quote Tina Turner: ``Simply the best.''   I will spare him and his parents, who are in the Gallery, my singing  it, although we did talk about doing karaoke together at some point.   Well, that is what they will say--what they already say about the  person whom I wish to honor here today at the end of my remarks.   It is never, never easy to say goodbye to a member of your team. We  in ``Schumer Land,'' as we call our group, have such a close-knit  staff. We are friends. We are pals. We have each other's backs. We  protect each other. It is a beautiful thing. Even when people leave,  they are still part of our family,  [[Page S1009]]  and we see them all the time. We saw many of them last night as we said  goodbye to Gerry at a local pub--an appropriate place, I might say, to  do that.   So it is never easy to say goodbye to a member of your team, but it  is even harder when that person has worked with you--or put up with you  depending on whom you ask--for 15 years. It is still harder when that  person happens to be Gerry Petrella. His real name is Gerard Anthony  Petrella, reflecting his Irish and Italian roots. I have nicknames for  some of my staffers. They just pop up. He has always been Gerald even  though his name is Gerard. I think it is 15 years he has been Gerald.  It hasn't stuck with anyone but me, but it is there.   Well, it is with immense gratitude--sorrow as well--that I close  today by saying thank you, thank you, and bidding farewell to one of  the very best to ever do it here in the Senate--our policy director,  Gerry.   I met Gerry when he was a staffer for a local town official.   I said: Boy, this guy is good.   And we are always on the lookout, myself and my two great chiefs,  whom I am so grateful for, Mike Lynch and Martin Brennan--two tough  Irish guys who have kept this Jewish kid going forward for a long time.  Anyway, we always are looking out for good staff, and when we saw this  guy, we said: We have got to get him.   Brennan sat down with him and said: Oh, he is good.   I sat down with him. He reminded me, last night, that I had him drive  to come talk to me before the Super Bowl of the Giants and Patriots-- the first one. They won two, I remind my friends from Massachusetts and  New England. I met him, and I said oh boy. So Gerry began running our  Long Island office.    He did an amazing job, an amazing job. So good, that after he had  done 4 years there--whatever Gerry does, he works his heart out. He  never burns himself out because he has got incredible energy. But he  works his heart out. It was time for a change. So we asked him to come  be our director--a new position--of economic development here in  Washington. The number of jobs, the number of projects, the number of  things he created was just amazing.   Then, of course, he became our policy director. When I became the  leader, he became the policy director of the whole Senate. He did  amazing things there, as I have said before.   Rarely, rarely can you say when someone leaves, no matter what else  they do in their lives, they have so benefited millions of Americans,  many of whom have seen the benefits already--$35 insulin for Medicare-- and many more who will see those benefits for years to come. They may  not know it was Gerry Petrella who did it, but we do. We do. He changed  the world.   His work was so important. We had the greatest 2 years that this  Senate has seen. We led the country, we led the party, we led everybody  in doing this with the BIF, and the IRA, and the CHIPS and Science  bill, and the PACT Act, and the gun bill, and so much else--marriage  equality. They wouldn't have happened without Gerry Petrella. That is  about the greatest compliment you can pay to someone.   So, Gerry, thank you. Thank you for never giving up on me after all  these years. Thank you for coming to the office every single day and  pushing, pushing, pushing.   He is not only brilliant, he not only comes with good ideas, but he  is a jackhammer--rat-a-tat-tat. He keeps pushing and pushing and  pushing until he gets it done.   So thank you for doing that, for setting the tone of our team, for  defining our vision, for laying out a strategy and executing in good  times and bad. Thank you for working to the bone to find a path forward  to pass our agendas, especially when it seemed out of reach. Thank you.   And I don't want to neglect the fact that he has deep feelings on so  many different issues, and he had the luxury and the ability to get  those done. So I also thank Gerry for staying true to himself and his  values as he worked in the maelstrom that is Senate legislating on such  important bills.   Gerry is a man on fire with love for his country, love for the  issues, love for the work.   Thank you, Gerry.   Thank you to Gerry's parents, who, as I mentioned, are here in the  Gallery.   Thank you to George, who had both of his parents often in the office  for many long hours--cute little George--and our great legislative  director, Meghan Taira.   Gerry, thank you for all these great years. You will always be in our  family. You will always have a place here in the Senate. My very best  on the next wonderful chapter in your life. God bless you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleagues, our  chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Menendez;  Senator Kaine, who has worked on this bill not for days and not for  months but for years and never gave up hope; Senator Young; Senator  Risch; and so many others--thank you, Senator Young--who worked so hard  to make this day happen.   Twenty years after the start of the Iraq war, the Senate finally,  finally, finally declares today the time has come  [[Page S1016]]  to repeal the legal authorities that began that war in the first place.   This is bipartisan, and that is one of the beauties of this.  Democrats and Republicans joined to say that it has been long enough,  that the Iraq war has long been over. These authorizations for the use  of force against Iraq are no longer necessary for our security.   Make no mistake, this vote repealing the Iraq war powers is one for  the history books.   The American people, as we know, are tired of endless wars in the  Middle East. Every year we keep these AUMFs on the books is another  chance for future administrations to abuse them.   We owe it to the over 4,000 who died in Iraq, to their families, to  our servicemembers who served there, to our veterans, and all of the  communities impacted by the war--we owe it to all of them to act.   There is a very good chance that both Chambers can pass these AUMF  repeals before the end of this year so this bill can be signed into  law. This is not just going to be a one-House action. We have good  support in the House of Representatives, the President is for it, and  the odds are high that this much needed legislation will become law.   Again, I hope this process can be a blueprint for how the Senate  works over the next few years. We sat down with our Republican  colleagues--and, of course, it is the right of the minority to offer  amendments--and came to an agreement. The amendments were not dilatory.  The amendments were not gotcha. They were sincere attempts to change  the bill. But by allowing amendments, we allowed this bill to go  forward, and we would like that to be a metaphor for the future.   We will look diligently, assiduously for opportunities to continue  the Senate working successfully on bipartisan legislation in the  future.   I yield the floor.                                Vote on S. 316     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 73, Matthew P. Brookman to be United States District Judge  for the Southern District of Indiana; that the Senate vote on the  nomination without intervening action or debate; that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the  Senate resume legislative session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res. 15, which was received  from the House and is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res. 25, which was received  from the House and is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Foreign Relations be discharged from further consideration  and the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 76.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, introduced earlier today: S. Res. 135, Osceola Turkey Day;  S. Res. 136, AmeriCorps; S. Res. 137, Ombudsman Appreciation Day.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Thursday, March 30; that following the prayer and the pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that following the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the  motion to proceed to Calendar No. 28, S. 870, and that all time be  considered expired; further, that at 1:45 p.m., the Senate proceed to  executive session to resume consideration of the Taylor-Kale nomination  and vote on the confirmation of the nomination; that upon disposition  of the nomination, the Senate resume legislative session; finally, that  if the nomination is confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:37 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, March 30, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
