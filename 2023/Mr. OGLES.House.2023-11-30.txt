 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the unprovoked assault on Israel on October 7  shocked millions around the world and demonstrated the unrelenting  brutality of Hamas.   While many countries around the world supported Israel as it  confronted this single deadliest day for the Jews since the Holocaust,  many did not. Many of the countries that pointedly refused to condemn  Hamas are located in the Middle East.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment expresses a sense of Congress that all  U.S. allies in the Middle East should publicly and unequivocally  condemn the anti-Semitism displayed by the Iranian-backed terror  groups, including Hamas.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345    Mr. Chairman, Kuwait, a country that American soldiers liberated from  Saddam Hussein, expressed its grave concern and blamed Israel for the  blatant attacks. Kuwait further urged the international community to  stop the provocative practices by the occupation.   Talk about victim blaming, Mr. Chairman, especially when the guilty  party, Hamas, has proudly taken responsibility for attacking and raping  Jewish civilians.   Lebanon, a country which at this point is effectively controlled by  the terrorist group Hezbollah, congratulated the resisting Palestinian  people. Hezbollah hailed Hamas for its large-scale heroic operation, an  operation that saw an 8-year-old girl have her hands cut off and then  being left to bleed to death.   Tunisia declared its full and unconditional solidarity with the  Palestinian people following Hamas' brutality on October 7, an attack  that saw a pregnant woman have her mouth duct-taped and her baby cut  out of her stomach. In no uncertain terms, the country, a listed major  non-NATO ally, maintained their position to fully stand by the  Palestinian people until they recover their entire land.   Qatar, a country whose state-controlled media outlet, Al Jazeera,  which should also be known as the Qatari news network, is the  mouthpiece of Hamas terrorists and blamed Israel for being solely  responsible for the ongoing escalation and stressed their unwavering  stance on the justice of the Palestinian cause and for the  international community to compel Israel to cease its blatant violation  of international law. These attacks saw women bound, gang-raped, and  then murdered, attacks that saw a baby put in an oven and baked alive,  the father's eyes gouged out and the mother raped.  [[Page H6009]]    On November 1, the Kingdom of Jordan, a country which was given well  over half a billion in taxpayer dollars in this last year's omnibus,  recalled its Ambassador to Israel.   Other countries, including Oman, Turkiye, and Egypt, choose to  equivocate instead of condemning Hamas.   Wherever you are on the political spectrum, the attack was inhumane.  It was brutal. It was blatant, and those culpable should be punished.   The international community, including many of the Arab states that I  have mentioned, should join with the international community in  condemning Hamas and should speak for the innocent.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, most Americans would be surprised and  disgusted to learn that Iran has been given approximately $50 billion  in a sanctions relief package by the Biden administration.   More to the point, it was done in exchange for a promise from Iran  that they wouldn't produce weapons-grade uranium. That is it. That is  all we apparently got.   Think about the implications of this deal. The Ayatollah, who  embraces chants of ``Death to America'' and ``Death to Israel,'' can  produce even more deadly long-range missiles, but that is fine by Joe  Biden. How about highly enriched uranium? Somewhere in Foggy Bottom,  Antony Blinken is nodding his head: Sure, why not?   The Ayatollah can put his country on the cusp of the nuclear  threshold and hold it over us as a constant threat. He can continue to  pocket billions of taxpayer dollars made available by the so-called  adults in charge at our State Department.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, civil. On October 7, Iran sponsored the murder,  rape, and torture of innocent civilians.   Civil. I do not trust Iran with nuclear material.   Civil. They raped little girls.   Civil. I should think not.   This is a no-brainer, Mr. Chairman. This administration--whether due  to side deals, incompetence, or just selling out America--is bringing  the world's most grievous, grotesque sponsor of state terrorism closer  to nuclear capabilities.   Mr. Chairman, I am from the South. You can put lipstick on a pig, but  it is still a pig.   Iran should be punished for what happened in Israel. Hamas should be  driven into the sea. Respectfully to my colleague, we should take  extraordinary measures to send a message to the world that this will  never happen again.   Iran must pay and pay dearly. This is but a first step.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the world is in a precarious place. We see  the CCP making moves in the Pacific against Taiwan. Russia has made a  move against Ukraine. Iranian-backed terrorists killed innocent  civilians.   There should be no relief for Iran. There should be no sanctions  relief for Iran, for they are not civil. They do not belong at a seat  at the table with the rest of the world. They need to be driven into  the stone age, where they belong and how they behave.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, while Hamas terrorists were brutalizing  Israeli citizens, Hamas' top leadership was celebrating from a  penthouse in Doha.   Qatar claims to be our ally. They want to hold a special place with  the United States. We have a forward operating base there.   While they are claiming to be our friend, they are literally housing,  aiding, and abetting terrorists from Hamas, roughly a dozen who are  worth billions, flying on private jets, drinking champagne, and  partying while Israeli citizens are being slaughtered.   Qatar has the opportunity to stand with the United States, stand with  the innocent people of Israel who were murdered.   This sense of Congress simply urges that Qatar should condemn Hamas,  turn over Hamas leadership to U.S. and Israeli custody, and pledge  never to facilitate the transfer of covered Iranian funds to Iran.   Mr. Chairman, there is a direct link between the money that was wired  to Doha and terrorism. Iran has said they will use the money however  they see fit. It is time for our allies or so-called allies to be our  allies.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, a thief that robs your house, then 2 days  later mows your lawn, is still a thief. A country that houses  terrorists is still an accomplice. It is a fact.   While they are giving over or assisting with the release of the  hostages, they have the opportunity to give over the Hamas leaders who  planned and orchestrated the attack, but will they do it? Of course  not, because they are guilty.   Qatar reportedly gives Hamas between $360 million and $480 million  per year. To my friend, I wonder how many of those dollars from Qatar  given to Hamas bought bullets, bought antitank mines, paid for the  training of the soldiers that raped children.   I wonder how many of those millions of dollars built the training  camps in Gaza. When the militants, the terrorists went in, they were  well armed. They were well trained. I wonder how many of the millions  of dollars Qatar gave Hamas to pay for that. Al Jazeera, the terrorist  news network, has praised the attack. It is controlled by Qatar.   If my child or children that I love stick their hand in the cookie  jar, just because I love them doesn't mean that they will escape  punishment.   Qatar may claim to be our friend, but they just got caught with their  hand in the cookie jar, and perhaps they should be punished.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, with respect to Qatar's recent activities on  the world stage, I will just say this: Qatar should not get a pass  whenever it decides to stop playing law breaker in order to start  playing first responder.    I think it is a misnomer to think that without Qatar, that somehow  negotiations wouldn't take place. The reality of the situation on the  ground is the reason why Hamas is negotiating, because Israel is  kicking their butt and is going to continue to do so. These  negotiations would happen with or without Qatar.   Qatar benefits from our Air Force base there.   If my colleague from my own party thinks giving money to Qatar so  that Hamas can rape little girls, then that is his choice, not mine.   You can't pretend to be our friend when you are funding an  organization that attacks and brutalizes innocent civilians. You can't  have it both ways. It just doesn't work that way. You can't have your  network praising the attacks.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, if I were to describe to you a group that  has just seized a cargo ship and what Israel has since referred to as  an Iranian act of terrorism, you might come to the conclusion that  perpetrators can't distinguish between civilians and military targets.   If I were to also tell you that the same group just earlier this week  shot two ballistic missiles at a U.S. warship, you might come to the  conclusion that these perpetrators are the enemies of the United  States.   Finally, if I told you that this group is guilty of kidnapping and  torturing U.S. citizens, you might come to the conclusion that we need  to wipe these people off the face of the Earth.   You might think that the Biden administration would agree, but  apparently it does not, and that is to the detriment of our national  security.   This is a sense of Congress that the Houthis continue to benefit from  the Biden administration's unwillingness to unequivocally condemn.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).    Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, if Americans knew that the Biden  administration was treating a state sponsor of  [[Page H6045]]  terrorism like a major ally, they would be infuriated, but that is  exactly what is going on with Qatar, a tiny but very wealthy country in  the Persian Gulf.   Qatar is a friend to anti-Semites. As the general stated, clearly,  they must hate Israel and the Jewish people. They are one of the  largest sponsors of state terrorism in the world. They regularly play  host to leaders of Hamas and the Taliban. In fact, Qatar provided Hamas  leadership with a venue to celebrate the horrific atrocities of October  7.   Only in a world where Joe Biden is President would we be supporting a  terrorist country as part of our foreign policy. Last year, President  Biden designated Qatar as a Major Non-NATO Ally, a special designation  given to about 20 countries, like Taiwan and Israel, and an honor meant  to highlight an extremely close bilateral relationship. In a sense, we  do have a close relationship with Qatar, far too close.   Qatar has given over $5 billion--that is b as in bravo--to U.S.  colleges, which makes them the number one foreign donor to our very own  educational institutions. Researchers at the Institute for the Study of  Global Antisemitism and Policy have presented a strong link between the  funding of U.S. universities by Doha and the active presence of anti- Semitic groups on those campuses.   Needless to say, we should be extremely wary about the impact of  these donations on our young people. For decades, Congress has allowed  these donations to flow into our universities without any supervision  or meaningful disclosure requirements.   Meanwhile, American Jews are harassed on campuses or compelled not to  reveal their Jewish heritage. Since the start of the October 7 war, 73  percent of Jewish students in the U.S. have been victims or witnesses  to on-campus anti-Semitism.   Qatar has the honor of hosting a major airbase outside of Doha. The  presence of that airbase all but ensures their safety and that they  will never be attacked. You would hope, at the very least, Qatar would  try hard to ensure that it is not spreading anti-Semitism or supporting  anti-American sentiments, but we have seen this anti-Semitism. We have  seen it alive and well on Qatar's state-owned media outlet, Al Jazeera,  or, as I like to say, AJTN, Al Jazeera terrorist network.   Unfortunately, criticisms of Qatar come in muted in this town. Doha  has certainly poisoned the well, purchasing the loyalties of university  elites, influential think tanks, some of the best lobbyists that money  can buy, and even politicians, which is why so many D.C. institutions  whitewash Qatar's support for terrorism.   On top of this, as I mentioned earlier, Qatar lets the leaders of  Hamas and the Taliban stay at the most expensive hotels in Doha and  provides up to $480 million, half a billion dollars, to Hamas to keep  their military afloat.   Qatar will tell you that this is going to nonmilitary uses, but we  have heard throughout testimony today that money flowing to Qatar,  flowing to Iran, is fungible.   As the former chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen, once put it, in Qatar, there are three buckets: terror  financed by the government, terror financed through Qataris, and terror  financing that Qatar doesn't stop.   That is the former chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  commenting on something that has been known for decades, known in this  town, that Qatar openly and actively supports terrorism.   Let's look at a few more examples. In 2003, Congress was informed of  Qatar's funding to charities that support al-Qaida, including the bin  Laden-endorsed charity, the Qatar Charity. The same year, The New York  Times also reported that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11  and one of the terrorists responsible for murdering 3,000 Americans,  fled to Qatar from Kuwait in order to avoid apprehension.   We also know that Qatar has provided support for al-Qaida's affiliate  in Syria, al-Nusrah Front. Qatar has provided support to numerous  terrorist groups, including the Taliban, the Muslim Brotherhood, and,  of course, its most visible beneficiary, Hamas.   What would you call a group that supports terrorists or a country  that supports terrorist groups like al-Qaida, al-Nusrah, the Taliban,  the Muslim Brotherhood, and Hamas? You would call them a state sponsor  of terrorism.   That is what this administration needs to do. It needs to remove  Qatar's Major Non-NATO Ally status until such time that Qatar denounces  terrorism and any support for terrorism or terrorist groups. If they  don't, maybe it is time to label them as a state sponsor of terrorism.   Earlier today, this House passed, in a unanimous fashion, my  amendment to call on Qataris to condemn Hamas, turn over Hamas  leadership to the U.S. or Israeli custody, and prevent Iran from  receiving any funds.   If the Emir of Qatar were here on the House floor, I would tell him  to pick a side. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.  Enough equivocating.   Let me be clear. I do not wish ill on Qatar. In fact, I am open to  dialogue.   To the people of Qatar, I wish them well, but I want to ensure that  my country has partners it can trust. Qatar has demonstrated time and  again its unwillingness to abandon its two-faced approach toward  relations with the United States and with terrorists.   Mr. Speaker, regarding the atrocities, what does Qatar have to say  when a mom and her 10- to 12-year-old daughter were brutally raped,  left naked, and murdered in their home?   What does Qatar have to say when a baby was put into an oven, the  father murdered, and the wife brutally raped? What does Qatar have to  say?   When women were being gang-raped, their breasts cut off, and the  terrorists were playing with them, tossing them around like toys, what  does Qatar have to say?   When they were sexually abusing men and cutting off their genitals,  what does Qatar have to say?   When the pregnant mom, her mouth gagged, was being held while they  cut the baby out of her womb, what does Qatar have to say?   They blame Israel.   They need to pick a side. For too long, they have been on the wrong  side.   Let me make one final note on Qatar, and it is in reference to a  comment made earlier by my colleague from Texas. He mentioned Qatar's  role in helping to release hostages from the clutches of the Hamas  dogs, the terrorists of Hamas. Most Americans taken by Hamas on October  7 are still in custody. What has Qatar done?   Many people, Israeli and otherwise, are still in Hamas custody. What  has Qatar done?   I would say they are stalling for time to allow Hamas to regroup, to  flee, and to rebuild. It is time that families and children be  reunited. We want every hostage released now.   We pose a question to you: Do you think Qatar is the best  intermediary for releasing hostages? I don't think they are.   I am grateful for every hostage that has been released, but while  Qatar is helping to release some hostages, they are also ensuring  Hamas' preservation.   I said earlier today that someone who robs your home and then offers  to cut your grass 2 days later is still a thief. It does not change who  they are.   Given the level of financing Qatar provides Hamas on an annual basis,  they could have at least compelled the release of all Americans.   Let me mention briefly, Mr. Speaker, my Trust But Verify Act, which  would delist Qatar's MNNA status, Major Non-NATO Ally status, until the  President certifies that they are no longer providing support for  international terrorism, and the President must recertify this every 90  days.
