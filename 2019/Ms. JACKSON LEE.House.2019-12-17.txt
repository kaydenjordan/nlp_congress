 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the House  Amendment to Senate Amendment to H.R. 1865, which makes the  consolidated appropriations needed to fund critical departments,  agencies, and programs of the federal government through September 30,  2020.   I thank Chairman Lowey, Ranking Member Granger, and their fellow  House conferees  [[Page H10596]]  for their work in reaching this bipartisan agreement.   Specifically, this legislation provides $540.4 billion and reflects  conference agreements for the FY 2020 Labor-Health and Human Services- Education, Agriculture-Rural Development-Food and Drug Administration,  Energy and Water Development, Interior-Environment, Legislative Branch,  Military Construction-Veterans Affairs State-Foreign Operations, and  Transportation-Housing and Urban Development appropriations bills.   Madam Speaker, in total this appropriations package provides:   1. $35.9 billion in base defense funding;   2. $484.5 billion in base nondefense funding;   3. $0.6 billion for defense Overseas Contingency Operations;   4. $8 billion for nondefense OCO;   5. $6.2 billion for defense emergency requirements;   6. $4.6 billion for nondefense emergency requirements, program  integrity, and wildfire suppression; and   7. $0.6 billion for 21st Century Cures Act funding.   I appreciate the Appropriations Committee working with me to include  the following Jackson Lee Amendments in the legislation:                                  LABOR-HHS    1.

Amendment reprograms Office of Inspector General account to  provide $2 million to investigate the Department's delay in releasing  over $5 billion in Hurricane Harvey Disaster Community Block Grant  funds.   Madam Speaker, left to our own devices, House Democrats clearly could  and would have made many different and better funding decisions, but  this agreement is the best deal attainable in the circumstances, and  importantly, it responsibly funds the government for the remainder of  the fiscal year.   Coming from a border state, I am very pleased that this legislation  does not provide the President the billions of dollars he demanded for  a wasteful, ineffective, and immoral concrete wall.   Madam Speaker, the bipartisan agreement before us rejects the Trump  Administration's attacks on the environment by blocking the  Administration's deep cuts to initiatives to protect clean water, clean  air and public lands and it invests more than $9 billion in the EPA and  Land and Water Conservation Fund.   The agreement reinforces and strengthen America's global leadership  by rejecting the Trump Administration's radical cuts and securing $9.1  billion in security assistance for allies, including $3.03 billion for  Israel, $5.9 billion for PEPFAR and $1.7 billion for the Food for Peace  program.
