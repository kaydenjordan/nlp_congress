 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this important document as  well.   Friends, we may have vastly different views on how best to create a  more perfect Union, along with different styles and different  temperaments, but we all share a commitment and, frankly, a  responsibility to bring the voice of the people to Washington, D.C.   I am honored to represent much of Pinellas County and my hometown of  St. Petersburg, Florida, and I promise to fight for the needs of my  home. But I pledge to do so in keeping with what is known as the Golden  Rule: Do unto others as you would have done unto you. This is a rule  that I strive to live by every single day.   Poll after poll shows that Floridians and, frankly, all Americans are  fed up with the divisiveness and rancor of Washington. As we move  forward debating the issues of the day, let us be mindful of the words  of President Abraham Lincoln: ``Though passions may have strained, it  must not break our bonds of affection.''                                time  1730    I am proud that our freshman class--yes, this awesome freshman  class--has put forward its commitment to civility. It states that,  despite our political differences, at the end of the day we must work  together to move our country forward, putting people over politics and  treating one another with mutual respect and much more grace even when  we may disagree.   I thank, again, the gentleman from Louisiana and the gentlewoman from  California for their leadership and for their friendship, putting  people over politics. God bless you all, and God bless America.
