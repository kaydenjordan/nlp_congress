 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support  of S. 2683, the Child Care Protection Improvement Act.   As a father of three and a member of the Education and Labor  Committee, the issue this legislation seeks to improve is near and dear  to me.   After reauthorizing the Child Care and Development Block Grant in  2014, which passed with broad bipartisan support, Congress added a  requirement for States to implement background checks for any childcare  employee put in charge of supervising children.   Childcare is an essential service as well as a source of employment  for many Americans, so safety and care are of the utmost concern.  Parents want to know that their children are in a good, honest, and  safe environment.   However, since this reauthorization, implementation has been very  problematic. Many States have experienced a great amount of  difficulties actually performing robust background checks.   In fact, as of March 1, 2020, only three States have been able to  fully implement the required background checks.   If passed, this bill will establish a task force at the Department of  Health and Human Services to monitor background checks and to make  recommendations for improving implementation at childcare businesses.   Keeping children safe from harm is a parent's number one concern when  they leave them in someone else's care.    Parents will be more assured when they know their caretaker and all  of  [[Page H4449]]  its employees have histories absent of criminal activity, sexual abuse,  or any other forms of neglect.   We are facing so many challenges in this Nation at this time, but  regardless, we can never stop working to make our children safe.   I thank my colleague, Senator Burr from North Carolina, for leading  this initiative in the upper Chamber. I thank my colleagues in the  House for doing the same. I look forward to its passage here in the  House.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation.
