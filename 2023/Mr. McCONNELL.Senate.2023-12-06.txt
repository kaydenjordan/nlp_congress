 Mr. President, later today, Senate Republicans are  going to deny cloture on a bill that fails to address America's top  national security priorities in a serious way. As we have said for  weeks, legislation that doesn't include policy changes to secure our  borders will not pass the Senate.   The situation unfolding at our southern border on President Biden's  watch is a crisis of historic proportions. It is glaring, it is acute,  and it is undermining America's national security.   President Obama's DHS Secretary used to say that 1,000 border  crossings a day ``overwhelms the system.'' Today, they are reporting  encountering over--listen to this--10,000 people a day down at the  border--a large town's worth of illegal aliens each day. Thanks to a  broken asylum and parole system, the vast majority of them are admitted  into the country before their legal status is even determined.   Mr. President, 10,000 arrivals a day would mean a population the size  of a middle-sized town in Kentucky every month--every month. The sheer  volume has forced officials in the Tucson, AZ, sector, which has  recently accounted for nearly 3,000 of those daily arrivals by itself,  to shut down one port of entry altogether.   This is the crisis undermining America's national security right here  at home, and today, some of our Democratic colleagues are showing just  how little they want to do anything about it.   Senate Republicans know this isn't an either-or proposition. We know  that national security begins with border security.   I have spent months highlighting the undeniable links between the  threats we face in Europe, in the Middle East, and in the Indo-Pacific,  but Democratic leadership appears to be telling us today that they are  willing to risk each of these urgent priorities to avoid--avoid--fixing  our own borders right here at home. Apparently, some of our colleagues  would rather let Russia trample a sovereign nation in Europe than do  what it takes to enforce America's own sovereign borders.   Now, it wasn't always like this. Democrats didn't always have such a  hard time following the logic that national security begins right here  at home.   I am reminded of the commission President Reagan set up in the mid- 1980s to assess the importance of peace and security in the Western  Hemisphere. It was a bipartisan exercise that included everyone from  Henry Kissinger to the former chair of the DNC and the president of the  AFL-CIO. The commission concluded that America's security in the world  ``depends on the inherent security of its land borders'' and that our  adversaries would reap ``a major strategic coup to impose on the United  States the burden of defending our southern approaches.''   ``[A] major strategic coup'' for our adversaries. A past generation  of Democrats understood the logic implicitly when it pertained to the  threat of Soviet influence. Well, that logic applies even more today to  the instability, cartel violence, terror, and drugs pouring over our  southern border.   But in today's Democratic Party, some of our colleagues appear to be  so terrified of their radical base that they are convinced open borders  are worth jeopardizing U.S. security around the world, that securing  America's borders is less urgent than helping our partners defend  theirs.   The Democratic leader has insisted repeatedly that border security is  an important issue, but whatever our colleagues want to call the issue,  their actions suggest they are not at all interested in actually  solving it.   Demanding serious border policy changes isn't injecting an unrelated  issue into the conversation. President Biden's own request wanted us to  throw billions of dollars at this exact problem. Fixing a badly broken  asylum and parole system isn't hijacking the supplemental; it is  strengthening it. Securing our southern border isn't extraneous to our  national security; it is essential.   I know some of our Democratic colleagues understand this. I know not  all of them are beholden to the same radical base that demands open  borders at home and supports an intifada abroad. I invite them to work  with Republicans on meaningful, lasting border security.   But if today's vote is what it takes for the Democratic leader to  recognize that Senate Republicans mean what we say, then let's vote,  and then let's finally start meeting America's national security  priorities, including right here at home.                                     Coal    Mr. President, now on another matter, for millions of Americans,  expensive heating bills and rolling blackouts are becoming the hallmark  of the holiday season under President Biden. So it came as no small  surprise when the Biden administration's climate czar, John Kerry,  proclaimed this week that no coal plants should be ``permitted anywhere  in the world''--``anywhere in the world.'' Goodness. Our former  colleague may have bought himself applause from the jet-set crowd  assembled at the conference, but his ban on coal would make energy even  less reliable and affordable here at home.    As my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Capito, pointed out  yesterday, many States in Middle America still rely on coal to keep  their lights on. Kentucky, West Virginia, Wyoming, Missouri, Utah,  North Dakota, Indiana, and Nebraska all use coal to generate over 50  percent of their electricity.   President Biden's handling of the economy is turning in dismal marks  from working Americans. But the climate activists in his administration  continue to wage war on the most affordable forms of American energy  they rely on.   Unfortunately, Middle America is used to footing the bill for  Washington's radical climate agenda. For 8 years under President Obama,  Kentuckians watched the War on Coal kill jobs and cripple communities  across Appalachia. These same communities continue to pay dearly under  President Biden. Kentucky coal miner employment has never--never-- recovered from the Obama-era coal purge. Hasty plans to phase out  fossil fuels only force more miners into early retirement in Kentucky  and threaten the livelihood of Middle America.   The sort of power grid failures we have seen in California, Texas,  and Kentucky will become even more common if Democrats' full-speed- ahead climate strategy continues. Meanwhile, our top strategic  adversary is scaling up coal production. Despite the Biden  administration's pleading, China continues to forge ahead with new coal  projects and resurrect retired plants. Time and again, the President's  climate czar has happily accepted empty climate pledges from our  adversaries at the expense of American jobs and job creators.   So Democrats can repeat their tired green energy talking points until  the cows come home, but the reality for Americans is all the same: less  reliable and more expensive energy this winter.                            ____________________
