 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Noelle  Lambert of Manchester as July's Granite Stater of the Month. Noelle is  a Paralympic athlete who founded the Born to Run Foundation, which  helps young people who have lost a limb achieve their  [[Page S5139]]  dreams by providing them with specialized prosthetics.   A lifelong athlete, Noelle was recruited to play Division 1 lacrosse  at UMass Lowell. In her freshman year, Noelle was in a moped accident  that severed her left leg.   Noelle did not let this devastating accident stop her from finishing  out her college lacrosse career. With the help of nonprofit  organizations, Noelle received a specialized prosthetic for running  that allowed her to continue competing. A specialized prosthetic like  the one Noelle needs can cost up to $50,000 and is rarely covered by  insurance, so the help Noelle received from these charities was  essential in her return to competition.   Inspired by the nonprofits who helped her compete at an elite  collegiate level and determined that others in need of prosthetics  receive the help that they need, Noelle started her own nonprofit to  help other children and young adult amputees.   Already, the Born to Run Foundation has donated specialized  prosthetics to 14 individuals, including one as young as 4 years old.  With the assistance of prosthetics provided by Born to Run, individuals  have been able to run, weightlift, or simply take a walk on the beach  again.   If her work leading Born to Run wasn't enough, Noelle is also a  world-class athlete and national record holder who qualified for the  U.S. Paralympic Team and is competing at the Tokyo Paralympics in the  100-meter dash in the T63 division.   Noelle's grit, perseverance, and compassion for others represent the  best of the Granite State. Her ability to turn a traumatic experience  into an opportunity to help others is an inspiration to us all, and I  am honored to recognize her.                            ____________________
