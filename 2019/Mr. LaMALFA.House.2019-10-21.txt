 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a great  constituent and also a great friend. His name is John McArthur. He  passed away recently at the age of 96.   John was just 21 years old in 1944 when his father died, tragically,  of a heart attack, meaning John was tasked to take over the family  farming and ranching business. In fact, if the name ``McArthur'' sounds  familiar to those of us from northern California, that is because his  family founded the town of McArthur, California, where he lived much of  his life.   In the years since, John has helped establish many important staples  of his community, including the McArthur Volunteer Fire Department, the  McArthur Firemen's Carnival, the Fall River-Big Valley Cattlemen's  Association, and the Junior Livestock Sale. He and Shirley were very  involved in the fair each year and the events that went on there.   John actually introduced new crops to the Fall River Valley by  providing the first 10 acres for growing strawberries in McArthur.  Lassen Canyon Nursery, among others, remains a thriving business  operation more than 60 years later.   John and his business partners also tried their hand at planting and  growing potatoes. I am a rice grower in real life, so we had a little  bit of a rivalry for the starches that go on your plate and a little  fun with that.   While they were successful, they ran into trouble when it actually  came to harvesting the crop. Through that failed endeavor, he  established that the land was right for growing potatoes and was soon  able to lease it to successful potato growers for many years  thereafter.   On a personal level, John and his wife, Shirley, were known for their  welcoming nature. Their home was always open, hosting friends and  neighbors for cocktail hours or just hanging out at the McArthur  residence overlooking the valley. They have an amazing view off their  back deck, looking over the valley there.   The events became so frequent that John and Shirley thought that  maybe it would be better to cut down on the Old Crow a little bit and  slip some iced tea in there. But John and Shirley, they are those type  of people. People just wanted to be around them.   On my trips up to the McArthur area, whether it was for the fair or  just passing through, I frequently liked to stop in and visit with  them. John always had a smile, a laugh, a good story, and a very  welcoming nature about him. It is one of the fortunate parts of being  able to serve in an elected capacity these years I have at the State  level and now here in the Congress.   His life spanned nearly a century. He outlived most of his childhood  friends, but his personality, coupled with his generosity, kindness,  and involvement in his community, ensured that he had no shortage of  new friends.   During his time on this Earth, he has been a witness to a lot of  change. He watched as California's population grew from 4 million to  over 40 million today. He was always fighting for agriculture, adding  to our water supply, and sticking up for rural values.   Ask anyone in McArthur, John was clearly a pillar of the community  that bears his last name. He helped to establish it early on and  continued to help grow it through the years until his last days.   As a friend, I will miss him. I know he is sorely missed up there.  Blessings to Shirley and blessings to all of the McArthur family in  that great community, one that I am always proud to represent and very  happy when I get a chance to visit and hang out with folks.   Indeed, he is a pillar, and they don't make them like John McArthur  anymore. Let's hope his legacy helps spawn new generations of people  with that same attitude, that same strength, that same can-do that has  made America strong, made his community strong, and made the fiber of  northern California the great place it is.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the failure of  House Democrats to run a fair and transparent process, ostensibly  toward an impeachment.   We have yet to hold a vote on whether or not to actually open up a  true impeachment inquiry. Instead, Democratic leaders have simply  decided it for themselves. That goes against all precedent established  in this Chamber and under the Constitution.   Last week, I attempted to attend one of their closed-door impeachment  hearings, or to simply view testimony transcripts, but was promptly  asked to leave.   This is exactly what a partisan, secretive, and unfair process looks  like. Why would Members not have access to an unclassified hearing and  not be able to view materials that should be public, as they normally  would? What is there to hide?   Last week, the Republican whip,   Steve Scalise, filed a rule change  to allow all Members of Congress access to documents related to this  impeachment show and the documents associated with it.   I am fully supportive of this rule change. We will vote on this  measure soon, and now my colleagues from the other side of the aisle  must show the American people whether or not they support giving them  the transparency they deserve in this process.                            ____________________
