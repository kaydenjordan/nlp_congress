 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of U.S. Navy veteran Glenn Smith, a Stark County World War II  veteran who passed away last week at the age of 95.   Glenn was a Navy Seabee and served our country from August 1943 to  July 1945. He was born in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, where his  father was a coal miner for over 50 years.   In a story familiar to many in the heartland, Glenn made it through  the Great Depression by scrapping steel for extra money. He would grow  up to be part of the greatest generation to ever live, the generation  that freed the world from tyranny.   Glenn was drafted into the Navy at age 19 and shipped out alongside  7,600 other men to Honolulu on Christmas Eve 1943. Glenn would go on to  serve in the Pacific theater and, at the end of the war, was flown from  Saipan to Pearl Harbor, where he took the USS Constellation home.   My office had the honor of presenting Glenn, in October of last year,  with his military service medals earned during World War II. Glenn  received the World War II Victory Medal and Asiatic-Pacific Campaign  Medal.   Madam Speaker, today we remember Glenn's life and service and thank  him  [[Page H540]]  for all he did to protect this great Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4704, the Advancing  Research to Prevent Suicide Act. I was proud to join my friend,  Congressman McAdams, in introducing this legislation, and I thank him  for his leadership and his efforts to reduce suicide rates.   H.R. 4704 directs the National Science Foundation to support  multidisciplinary research to discover the root causes of the growing  suicide epidemic across the United States.   The Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act will work to address  suicide from all angles. The research authorized under this bill will  look at social and economic factors, the use of technology, and the  stigma associated with mental health conditions.   Madam Speaker, just this past week, I participated in a suicide  prevention roundtable organized by my office to hear from local  community leaders and stakeholders about the ongoing efforts to prevent  suicide among youth and veterans and to stop suicide contagions from  spreading. I left the meeting encouraged by the ongoing efforts in my  community, but I also left knowing that there is still much to be done.   Madam Speaker, I want to provide my colleagues with some raw data to  give a full picture of the scope of the crisis in our country and in my  home State of Ohio.   The National Center for Health Statistics and the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention released data ranking suicide as the 10th most  common cause of death among Americans of all ages in 2017. Between 1999  and 2017, the suicide rate increased by 33 percent in the United  States.    Nationally, the veteran suicide rate is 1\1/2\ times the rate of  nonveteran adults, with 6,139 veterans dying from suicide in 2017  alone.   Closer to my district, according to a report published by the  Northeast Ohio Youth Health Survey, between August 2017 and March 2018,  the suicide rate among Stark County youth ages 10-19 rose to more than  7 times the national rate and 11 times the 2011-2016 Stark County rate.  Furthermore, between 2000 and 2016, suicide rates increased by 36  percent in the entire State of Ohio.   Personally, three of my own college football teammates have taken  their lives in the past 12 months alone.   We all know we have a mental health crisis in this country, but for  me and my constituents, the suicide problem has impacted far too many  close to home, as seen by the suicide rates in Stark County and the  State of Ohio.   Too many times, when I have met with a group of constituents to  discuss an international trade or veteran-related policy issue, often,  the biggest problem on their mind is the growing suicide threat.   In 2018, a high school near my district suffered from what CDC called  a suicide contagion, when six students killed themselves within a 6- month timeframe.   I sincerely believe that if we want to make a dent in the issue at  hand, we need to be more proactive in finding the causes of suicide  clusters and suicide contagions. Our children, our veterans, and our  neighbors cannot wait much longer. It is imperative that we dig in and  put in the work to find the roots of this crisis.   The more we know about the fundamental causes, the better equipped we  will be as a country to tackle the problem head-on, and that is what  this bill does.   Madam Speaker, again, I thank Congressman McAdams, Chairwoman  Johnson, and Ranking Member Lucas for bringing this bill to the House  floor today. I am encouraged by the bipartisanship already shown on  this initiative, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to  see this bill signed into law.   Suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States in  2017 and the second leading cause of death among people ages 10-34.   For our Nation's veterans, it is an epidemic. We lose 17 veterans in  America a day to suicide.   This bill will support basic research at the National Science  Foundation that will inform better interventions and improve their  outcomes.   Madam Speaker, I again thank Congressman McAdams for his work on this  bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 153, the Supporting Veterans  in STEM Careers Act.   I thank Dr. Neal Dunn and Congressman Conor Lamb, who led the House  version of this bill, for their work to support our Nation's veterans.   S. 153 will help veterans put their training and experience in  military service to new and important uses and help America stay  competitive in research and innovation on a global scale.   In the last decade alone, jobs requiring some level of STEM expertise  have grown by more than 30 percent, including jobs that do not require  a bachelor's degree. Nearly 7 million jobs are unfilled in the United  States due to a shortage of skilled workers, many in STEM and related  fields.   In my home State of Ohio, we have been focusing on boosting and  expanding our cyber defense capabilities to the Ohio Cyber Range. In  order for the program to be more efficient and ready for any  cyberattack, we need a cybersecurity workforce properly trained in the  STEM field.                                time  1800    S. 153 gives our veterans the opportunity to acquire new skills and  better prepare them for jobs of the 21st century.   At the same time, veterans and transitioning servicemembers represent  a valuable, skilled talent pool from which to help meet this critical  need.   S. 153 will improve outreach to veterans through the National Science  Foundation's programs to support and train STEM workers. We can serve  our veterans and help them translate their experience into meaningful  STEM work.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Dunn).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I again want to thank Dr. Neal Dunn and Congressman Conor Lamb for  their work to support our Nation's veterans.   This bill will improve outreach to veterans through the National  Science Foundation's programs to support and train STEM workers. We can  serve our veterans and help them translate their experience into  meaningful STEM work.   I again urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation and  send it to the President's desk.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
