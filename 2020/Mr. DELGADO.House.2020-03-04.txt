 Madam Speaker, I rise today because our communities need  peace of mind when drinking water from their personal wells. This is  felt acutely in rural communities, where a lack of water infrastructure  leads people to use wells as their main water supply.   That is why I joined colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  introduce H.R. 6053, which will give folks an easy-to-use tool through  the EPA which would enable them to test their own well water. This tool  will empower our communities and assure them that they are drinking  water that is clean of toxic chemicals.   I will keep championing work at the Federal level to hold the EPA  accountable to set a safe drinking water standard, make sure PFAS is  regulated under the Clean Water Act, and more. At the same time, we can  make sure our communities have the tools they need to feel safe when  using well water.                            ____________________
