 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, tonight, I am pleased to be joined by many  of my colleagues in the Congressional Progressive Caucus to talk about  the long overdue investment we would need to make in the care economy,  something that our infrastructure has always relied upon.   I introduced the Care for All Agenda earlier this spring calling for  the Federal Government to dramatically expand and strengthen the care  economy.   The American Families Plan outlines the next step we need to take to  get there, which must include improving work conditions and  compensation for care workers nationwide.   The care economy impacts all of us: Our children, elderly loved ones,  family members with disabilities, childcare workers, home health aides,  nurses, and so many more. Care is something we all need at different  stages in our lives.   The care economy includes our essential workers who put their lives  on the line every day during the most devastating global pandemic in a  century. Many of us will be caregivers ourselves, if we haven't been  one yet.   Ask any working family about how hard it has been to find affordable,  quality childcare even before COVID.   Ask a childcare worker if they can afford to send their own child to  the center they work at.   Ask any one of the vast majority of workers who do not have paid  family and medical leave how hard it is to care for a loved one who is  ill while holding on to their job.   Ask anyone who qualifies for long-term care under Medicaid but has  been unable to access it due to the healthcare workforce shortage.   Ask a home health aide how much they make hourly, and the need to  redesign our care infrastructure will become abundantly clear.   Just as our physical infrastructure is crumbling, the United States  today suffers from a lack of care infrastructure. These two truths are  intertwined.   Our crumbling infrastructure disproportionately harms Black, Brown,  Indigenous and low-income communities. The negative health impacts  arising from fossil fuel use, industrial pollution, and toxic materials  in our homes and schools are literally making us sick.   We need to invest in eliminating carbon emissions, and we also need  to invest in the caregivers we are counting on to heal us now.   We are calling for a broader shift to a society based on care for the  people, communities, and the planet we share.   We are still grieving more than 600,000 lives lost to COVID in our  country, many of them caregivers themselves. In this last year, we saw  how badly we need a robust care economy and what happens when our  investment in care doesn't match our needs.   I know that for some, talking about caregiving as infrastructure  sounds like a new idea and a ``nice to have.'' None of this work is  new, and all of it is necessary.   I have heard directly from New Yorkers who rely on caregivers every  day; like a constituent of mine in Westchester, who was born with  diastrophic dysplasia, and wrote in about how we need to do better by  our caregivers and pay them a living wage. Now in her fifties, she  qualifies for Medicaid and needs home-based care. The home health aide  who cares for her has to work two additional jobs to make ends meet.  That should give us all pause.   One of the biggest champions for caregivers and domestic workers, Ai- jen Poo, said that: ``The definition of infrastructure is that which  enables society and the economy to function. So  [[Page H2808]]  what is more fundamental than the ability to take care of our loved  ones?''   Caregiving is almost always provided by women, especially Black and  Brown women. This work has historically been made invisible, which  creates opportunities for the exploitation and poverty wages many of  our caregivers face without protection or recourse.   When it comes to finding care, millions of families are left with no  option but to figure it out, which we know so often means women not  taking paid work in order to provide unpaid care for their own  families.   The American Families Plan will help us bring the care economy out of  the shadows with key investments in childcare, paid leave, Medicaid,  home and community-based services, and more.   This goes so much deeper than making it possible for families to  enter and remain in the workforce. We need to ask ourselves what kind  of systems and structures we want in place not only for people to  survive, but also to thrive and reach their full potential.   Given how common it is to need care and not get it, we must ask  ourselves: Are we, as a nation, structured to listen? Are we structured  to care?   We need to listen to the caregivers and the families who rely on them  so that we make the most powerful investments that will not only boost  our economy, but also allow us to heal and truly move forward as a  society.   We need to rebuild our Nation with a new foundation; a foundation  rooted in love, care, and equality. That is the kind of thinking we  need in the infrastructure package.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield to my other colleagues who will  highlight other critical care economy needs. I yield to the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), the chair of the Congressional  Progressive Caucus.     Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Takano), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Omar), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr.  Kahele), my brother.    Thank you so much, Mr. Kahele. I now yield to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    I now yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), my friend and sister.    Madam Speaker, the American Families Plan recognizes that  childcare is infrastructure, and that it is not enough to settle for  any childcare that enables a parent to go to work. This needs to be  high-quality childcare that every child can access.   Babies are born learners, and it is well established by brain science  that a child's environment and interactions in the first 1,000 days of  life, whether positive or negative and long before they enter a  kindergarten classroom, are highly formative during this critical  period for learning and growth.   When those formative early childhood experiences include inadequate  nutrition, homelessness on other adverse childhood experiences, or  ACEs, such as those brought on by a global pandemic, we know that a  child's brain and body are changed in ways that are linked to poor  health and learning outcomes later in life.   Without reliable supports in place to buffer our kids from the  stress, that stress can quickly turn toxic.   The good news is that ACEs are preventable on a national scale if we  are collectively willing to put in the investment worthy of our kids.   As the Representative for New York's 16th District and a former  educator and school leader, I believe our goal for healthy early  childhood development needs to be more ambitious than the prevention of  ACEs, which aims to protect our kids from the worse effects of stress  and trauma. That should be the floor.    We, ourselves, need to move past a scarcity framework and embrace a  framework of shared abundance.   That looks like affordable, reliable access to quality childcare  where young children, in the context of an intergenerational community,  are empowered to explore themselves and their world with pure wonder;  where they grow into self-directed learners, collaborative leaders, and  adaptive community-centered problem solvers.   Madam Speaker, I now would like to speak a little bit about the child  tax  [[Page H2812]]  credit. The child tax credit has been in place for years, and it is  supposed to help offset the many expenses of raising children. This  includes food, childcare, diapers, healthcare, clothing, and taxes.   But before the American Rescue Plan, it wasn't accessible to the  families who needed it most because it wasn't fully refundable.  Families that didn't earn enough income could not benefit.   The American Rescue Plan changed that when it enacted a much-needed  expansion of the child tax credit, making it fully refundable and  increasing the maximum credit from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child  up through age 17, and $3,600 per child for children under age 6.   Because of the American Rescue Plan, nearly 66 million children will  benefit from the child tax credit, making this the single largest  contributor to reducing child poverty.   In my district, which includes the Bronx and Westchester, 124,400  children will gain from the expanded child tax credit.   The average benefit for 41,800 households in my district is $2,800,  lifting 9,200 children out of poverty and 4,700 children out of deep  poverty.   This is historic, but we can't be satisfied with reducing child  poverty. We need to completely end child poverty and eliminate it.   The American Families Plan would extend the child tax credit  increases from the American Rescue Plan through 2025. The  infrastructure we want for building back better shouldn't tolerate  childhood poverty, and the American Families Plan moves us forward on  that necessary path.   Before I close, I want to use my time on the House floor to share the  experience of a New Yorker who needs home care services and wrote into  my office. Her experience seeking care paints a very telling picture  about the state of our care economy, and makes the case for the strong  investments in the American Families Plan that we have heard tonight.   She shared that seniors and people with disabilities like her  struggle to find the home care she needs because the job pays under $13  an hour in most of New York State.   One week into the COVID lockdown, her home health aide contracted the  virus from a relative, a nursing home worker who contracted it through  their own caregiving job.   The first health aide has been unable to return to work because the  virus has caused long-term complications from their immediate family  members, for whom they are the primary caregiver.   Just 1 week after her first health aide contracted the virus, a  second health aide fell ill.   While the second health aide did recover, the health aide's childcare  provider closed permanently.   The second health aide wants to return to work, but, due to the low  wages, they are unable to afford childcare.   Not being able to find a full-time health aide to provide her care  means she is unable to receive assistance with all of her needs. Some  days she only gets help to eat and use the toilet once per day. She  cannot shower as frequently as she would like.   She shared: ``I live in constant fear that should something happen to  my health aide, that my literal independence will be taken from me  overnight. I don't know when this situation will improve, and I have no  other resources to lean on should my situation worsen.''   The solution, however, is simple. We need home care jobs to be  recognized and treated as quality, dignified jobs with family- sustaining wages. If we pay home care workers a living wage, these jobs  will be filled immediately because of the high demand. We need to  ensure our home care jobs never become minimum wage jobs again.   I want to thank her for sharing her personal experience and allowing  me to share it tonight. It goes to show how connected and  interdependent we all are on one another and the care economy.   We need to meet this dire moment with a substantial, transformative  investment in the care economy, and we must do that with the American  Families Plan.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
