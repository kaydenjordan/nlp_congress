 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of  [[Page H3458]]  Judge Patricia Gifford, who recently passed away, unexpectedly, just  shy of her 80th birthday.   She was a pillar in the Marion County, Indianapolis, Indiana,  community; a role model for so many lawyers and judges; and a dear  friend. She will be forever remembered for inspiring women and  redefining the role of women in the courtroom.   She was one of only two females in her law school class. She was part  of a team of the first women in the country appointed to prosecute only  sex crimes cases, primarily rape cases, and she was the sixth female to  assume the bench in Indiana.   In 1992, Judge Gifford gained international recognition for presiding  over the famous rape trial of former heavyweight boxing champion Mike  Tyson. The extensive international media coverage could have easily  turned that trial into a circus, but not under her watch. Judge Gifford  was widely praised throughout the country for keeping order throughout  the trial and presiding over a fair trial. Those of us who practiced in  her court expected nothing less.   She retired after a 30-year distinguished career on the bench. The  people of Indiana's Fifth Congressional District, and especially those  in Marion County, are forever grateful for Judge Gifford's many  contributions to our Hoosier community.   We join her family--her husband, Bob Butsch; her daughter, Jennifer  Butsch Petit; and her family--in mourning our loss.                            ____________________
