 I thank my colleague from Texas.   I represent Orange County, California. I would like to say that  California is now the sixth largest economy in the world. My home  county of Orange County, if it were a country today, would be the 32nd  largest economy in the world.   My district is exploding with jobs, unemployment at a record low. We  have biotech, high-tech, tourism, home to Disney land, the Angels. We  also have recycling, manufacturing. You name it, it is there.   It is about Americans working hard; former immigrants, now Americans,  also working hard; and new immigrants, like DACA students, DACA members  of my community, also holding hands with all of us, working hard to  enrich our communities, our neighborhoods, our county, our State, and  our Nation.   Today, DACA recipients, model immigrants. Nobody in this body would  ever debate the fact that we want immigrants who come to work hard,  follow the laws, pay taxes, learn English, and study hard. Those are  model citizens that any nation in the world would want, and we have  them here in this country.   Just a few weeks ago, my daughter came home, 17 years old, from high  school. Two of her best friends came with her, and they said: We want  help, Mr. Congressman. You are a Congressman. We want some help.   And I said: What is the issue?   They said: We are both DACA students, and we are afraid. We are  concerned. We want to go to college. We don't know what is going to  happen.   I didn't have any answers for those two young ladies, but, really,  the answer I gave them was the same answer I give all the DACA  individuals, students I meet in my district, which is: Let me fight the  fight for you in Washington, D.C. What you have got to do is continue  to study hard, continue to follow the law, and don't give up praying.   I am convinced that, in this body, there are enough people to vote  for DACA students, to vote to change the laws. Why? Because it is the  right thing to do.   This is a country of immigrants, and nobody, again, can debate the  fact that these are good immigrants. These are good, hardworking folks  who want a shot. They don't want a gift, but they want the opportunity  to earn American citizenship.   These folks have taken an oath, the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag  and our country to defend it against foreign and local enemies. These  folks are Americans in the true sense of the word. Let's give them a  shot, a true shot, at being Americans.    If the gentleman will yield.    I would like to say, they serve in our military. They are  police officers, teachers, doctors, nurses. They are part of our  fabric.    Mr. Speaker, I also am honored to join my colleagues from  across the aisle tonight to talk about Attorney General Sessions'  decision to rescind the Cole memo, which has guided the State of  California as well as other States in pursuing reasonable cannabis  regulation.   As a California State senator, we relied on the Cole memo to help  craft California's cannabis industry regulatory framework.                                time  2045    I personally introduced legislation to regulate medical cannabis that  was sponsored by the public safety community of the State of  California. We all relied on the Cole memo. We all relied on regulating  medical marijuana to make sure that it was chemical free, that it was  tested, labeled, and that cannabis was kept away from our children, our  neighborhoods, and our schools.   I remember working on this legislation, and one day I got a phone  call from a Republican doctor who wanted to lecture me about my bill. I  assumed he was opposed to the legislation, but, you know what, I wanted  to hear him out. So I had him drive out to my district office. And  during the meeting, he told me about his daughter, a young Miss  Moynihan, who from birth to the age of 10--she was 10 years old--had  had seizures. And every year, those seizures had gotten worse and  worse. And the medication he had to use to keep the seizures under  control had gotten stronger and stronger with terrible side effects on  his beloved daughter.   Finally, Dr. Moynihan fell across medical cannabis. He used it. It  was like a miracle. His daughter was getting better with no negative  side effects. But then he said, ``Lou, I want to make sure that my  daughter's seizures stop, but I want to make sure she doesn't get  high,'' meaning what he wanted me to do in my legislation was to make  sure that my legislation carried language to make sure that medical  cannabis was tested and properly labeled.   All this doctor wanted was medical cannabis for his beloved daughter.  And there are many patients like young Miss Moynihan that rely on  medical cannabis, but she also relies on the proper regulation, and  labeling, and manufacturing of medical cannabis.   Attorney General Sessions' doing away with the Cole memo effectively  says to the State of California: You can no longer regulate medical  cannabis. This will not be available for the young Moynihans of the  State of California. I ask Attorney General Sessions to reinstitute the  Cole memo. Let States do what States do best. Let's respect the  sovereignty of our States, and let's move forward, not backward.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I just want to add,  think about all of the progress that we made as a country, as a nation  in regulating cannabis, medical cannabis, how so many States have  relied on that Cole memo to be lawfully abiding citizens, lawful  citizens, lawful businessmen, and States have also relied on that memo  to make sure that their regulatory framework fits within Federal  guidelines.   Much time, energy, effort, and resources have been invested by these  States to make sure that we are following Federal law. And overnight,  the Cole memo is gone. All of that work these States have put together  is out the door. How do we tell all of these citizens that want to  follow the law, want to pay their taxes, want to do what is right under  the law that they are now criminals? This is not right. It is  inconsistent with our due process. And at the end of the day, again,  these are States' rights.   We have given effectively these powers, these abilities to the States  to regulate medical cannabis. We cannot just turn our back and say: We  didn't mean it. Sorry. Let's move forward.   I don't believe we can return to those days when we would lock up  individuals for minor sources of cannabis. We can't go around the  streets and arrest people for cannabis anymore, and, of course, Dr.  Moynihan has to have the ability to continue to medicate his daughter.
