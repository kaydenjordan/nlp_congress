 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Benny Tate,  whose leadership and guidance have made him an incredibly valuable  member of his community in Milner, Georgia, and our Third District.   Dr. Tate has been the senior pastor of Rock Springs Church in Milner  for over 25 years. In that time, when it started as a church of just  60, it has now grown to a church of over 6,000.   Through this work, Dr. Tate has also shepherded the creation of  several ministries, including the Rock Springs Medical Clinic, the Rock  Springs Christian Academy, the Potter's House for Women, and Impact  Christian Ministries for the homeless.   Benny has been married to his wife, Barbara, for over 30 years, and  they have one daughter, Savannah Abigail, who is here with him today.   I want to commend Dr. Tate for his commitment to our community. There  is not a week that goes by where he isn't a welcoming part of the Third  District of Georgia.   The grace and love he has shown to his parishioners and neighbors  throughout his 25 years in Milner is unparalleled, and I am truly  honored to have Dr. Benny Tate here with us today.                            ____________________
