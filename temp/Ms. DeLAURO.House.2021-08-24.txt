 Madam Speaker, this rule allows us to move forward on  rebuilding our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, restoring the power  of the Voting Rights Act, and an historic budget resolution that  advances our priorities by making critical investments to expand our  Nation's social safety net to continue to build back better.   For far too long, the deck has been stacked for the wealthy and the  well-connected, while middle-class hardworking families and the  vulnerable have been left behind.   After decades of disinvestment, we have an opportunity today to make  history, to deliver on a promise we made to the American people: to  build a stronger, fairer future for our kids; a once-in-a-lifetime  moment, creating more jobs, cutting middle-class taxes, while simply  asking the biggest corporations and the top 1 percent to pay their fair  share of taxes.   What are the transformative issues in this bill: expanding to improve  the child tax credit already acclaimed to cut child poverty and hunger  with only one payment; guaranteeing affordable high-quality childcare;  tackling the long-term healthcare crisis; access to long-term services  and supports for aging loved ones and those with disabilities;  universal pre-K; 2 years of tuition-free community college; maximizing  the Pell grant award; launching the first-of-its-kind paid family and  medical leave benefits; historic investments ranking alongside the New  Deal and the Great Society, standing the test of time and strengthening  our society.   President Roosevelt didn't just rebuild America. He created Social  Security, and when it came to infrastructure and human needs, he did  both. So to meet today's moment, we must and we can do both. We have  that opportunity not to throw money at a problem but to build the  architecture for the future.   Today, we must advance this rule and the budget resolution,  demonstrating our commitment to our values, making a difference in the  lives of so many Americans. This is a moral imperative. And to  paraphrase President Franklin Roosevelt: This is our rendezvous with  destiny, a watershed moment. Don't let the moment pass. It will not  come back again. Let's seize it with action, with hope and unity of  purpose for a better, stronger America.                                time  1430
