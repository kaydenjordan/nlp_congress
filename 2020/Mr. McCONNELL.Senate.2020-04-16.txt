 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be  recognized, notwithstanding the order for a pro forma session today.    Mr. President, 1 week ago, I warned that the Paycheck  Protection Program was running out of money and tried to pass a clean  funding bill. Senate Democrats blocked it.   So here we are a week later with absolutely no progress. This morning  the program ran out of money and shut down, just as I warned a week  ago. Even now, Senate Democrats are still blocking funding. Every  Senate Republican was ready to act today--today--but Democrats have not  let us reopen the program.   So, look, it is absolutely surreal to see Democratic leaders treat  support for workers and small businesses as something they need to be  goaded--goaded--into supporting. This really should be above politics.   Five million more Americans lost their jobs just last week. That  makes 20 million layoffs in just 1 month. Americans need Democrats to  stop blocking emergency paycheck money and let this job-saving program  reopen. I hope our colleagues will come around soon.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, as if in executive session, I ask  unanimous consent that the order of March 26 with respect to Executive  Calendar No. 556 be modified to occur on Monday, May 4, with all other  provisions of the previous order remaining in effect.    So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when  the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn to then convene for  pro forma sessions only with no business being conducted on the  following dates and times; and that following each pro forma session,  the Senate adjourn until the next pro forma session: Monday, April 20,  2 p.m.; Thursday, April 23, 5:30 p.m.; Monday, April 27, 8 a.m.; and  Thursday, April 30, 1 p.m.   I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate adjourns on  Thursday, April 30, it next reconvene at 3 p.m. Monday, May 4; and that  following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired,  the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two  leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning  business be closed; further, upon the closing of morning business, the  Senate proceed to executive session to consider the Feitel nomination,  under the previous order; finally, I ask to renew the appointments  authority of the order of March 26.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:06 and 27 seconds p.m.,  adjourned until Monday, April 20, 2020, at 2 p.m.
