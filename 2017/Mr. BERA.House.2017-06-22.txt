 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce the House to our  guest chaplain, Reverend Kevin Kitrell Ross, Senior Minister of Unity  of Sacramento.   Kevin is regarded as a respected interfaith social justice leader,  committed to building bridges of understanding and cooperation across  race, culture, class, and religious lines.   Whether in his role leading one of the Nation's most diverse and  integrated congregations, conducting diversity and implicit bias  trainings, or being an outspoken activist for healing the crisis  between law enforcement and communities of color, Kevin is dedicated to  strengthening communities through dialogue, direct encounter, and  education.   A South Side of Chicago native, Kevin is a Morehouse College  graduate, a senior fellow of the American Leadership Forum, a member of  the Interfaith Council of Sacramento, and a three-time delegate to the  Parliament of the World's Religions.   Kevin and his wife, Anita, have three children and reside in Elk  Grove, California. Anita is the founder of Women for Equality. They are  both committed to building a world that works for all.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming Reverend  Kevin Ross and thank him for offering today's opening prayer in the  U.S. House of Representatives.                            ____________________
