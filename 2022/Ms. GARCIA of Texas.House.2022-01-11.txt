 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to  the critical investments we are making in our schools. Schools are the  pillars of our communities. They are the places where our children  learn and grow every day. Making sure that these spaces are safe for  our Nation's children is one of our most important responsibilities.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, many of these facilities are not up to  the task. School boards have been sounding the alarm for years about  lead pipes, poor air quality, and now COVID-19 issues hurting our  children's education. And for too long, help has not come.                                time  1015    But this month, during School Board Recognition Month, I am proud to  be able to tell schools in my district and around the country that help  is on the way.   Thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, passed by this  Chamber, we are bringing billions of dollars to make safe, healthy  schools for our kids. That means billions of dollars to remove  dangerous lead pipes  [[Page H13]]  from schools; millions of dollars to buy masks and protective equipment  for teachers, staff, and students; and millions of rapid, accurate  COVID tests so everyone can get tested and stay safe.   We are also investing billions to improve air quality in schools  across America.   The impact of these investments cannot be overstated. We all know how  dangerous lead contamination is for our kids. Lead poisoning can cause  developmental problems, mental and physical health issues, and even  death. No child should be poisoned by their own school water fountain-- not in Texas, not in America, not anywhere. That is why this law is  investing $2.9 billion to replace lead pipes in Texas schools and make  sure our children have clean, safe drinking water.   It is for those same reasons, Mr. Speaker, that we are also putting  tax dollars to work for cleaner air in schools. Poor air quality hurts  students every day, making it harder to learn and contributing to  illnesses like asthma.   Recently, poor air circulation and filters have been driving up  COVID-19 cases in schools. We can keep our kids safe in their schools  by installing better filters that clean out the COVID virus before it  travels between classrooms; we can keep our kids safe by providing them  and their teachers with masks to help stop the spread; and we can keep  our kids safe by making sure that if anyone does feel sick, they can  immediately get a free COVID test.   There are over 193,000 schoolchildren in my district. I am proud that  the investments we are making will help each and every one of them.  These are important measures we are taking right now to make schools  safe and a great place to learn and grow for our students, for the  teachers, the bus drivers, the cafeteria workers, and all those that  keep our schools open and safe.   Houston ISD alone has over 29,000 employees working hard every day  for our kids. They have been on the front lines of this pandemic,  helping our children stay on track, even as this disease has disrupted  almost everything in their lives. It is absolutely vital that we bring  these important tools for safe schools to them as well. Making sure  that our educators and staff have rapid tests, masks, and vaccines will  keep everyone in schools stay safe and healthy.   But we must also finish the job and build back better, which will  include billions for universal pre-K, which boosts our education  system, and reinstate the child tax credit, which will lift children  out of poverty.   I am proud of the work of this Congress, and I am proud of the  critical investments to my district, in our schools, in Texas, and  across the country.   We have made incredible progress this past year to help our  educators, our students, and our communities bounce back from COVID-19.  I am thankful for the hard work of President Biden and my colleagues in  the House and the Senate. Thanks to our collective efforts, students,  teachers, and faculty will have safe schools, clean water, and a  brighter future.                            ____________________
