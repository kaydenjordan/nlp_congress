 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Kelly.  What inspiring words. I thank Congressman Smith for his incredible  leadership. I am so proud to stand with my colleagues today to support  the right to life.   I commend all of those who will be coming to our Nation's Capital  this week, including from my home State of West Virginia, to let their  leaders--us--know that we are a country that values life and human  decency.   Each and every life is a precious gift from God. It is our  responsibility to stand up for the unborn who were made in God's own  image. They have no voice. We must be their voice. I am proud to join  my colleagues in using our voices to protect life and to stand up for  the unborn. I am proudly pro-life.   As we near the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we grieve for the lost  lives. We pledge to protect the babies yet to be born. No taxpayer  should be forced to pay for abortions. That is why I have consistently  supported legislation to repeal ObamaCare and to defund Planned  Parenthood.   I was also proud to be a cosponsor of the recently passed Pain- Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would stop late-term  abortions and the torturous pain that comes as the result of this  despicable practice.   I am also a proud cosponsor of the bill that will be taken up later  this week, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This  legislation ensures that babies born after a failed abortion attempt  are given the appropriate medical care to live and are treated as human  beings.   Mr. Speaker, every life--born and unborn--is precious, and I am proud  to stand here with my colleagues to reaffirm our values--that life is a  gift from God, and every baby deserves life.
