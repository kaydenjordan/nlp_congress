 Mr. Speaker, America is less safe when the words and  actions of our leaders cast unnecessary suspicion on our fellow  citizens. America is less safe when families, including children, are  targeted by government officials based on their ethnicity or by their  country of origin.   Reports of unjust, prolonged detentions of Iranian Americans and  permanent residents at our borders should be alarming to everyone. It  calls to mind the unjust internment of Japanese Americans during World  War II.   My own parents were toddlers in Japanese American internment camps,  and they, along with 120,000 others, were unjustly incarcerated, having  committed no crimes or acts of disloyalty.   What happened to my family was the result of a failure of political  leadership. All of us in this body have a duty to remain vigilant and  to defend the dignity of all citizens. To do nothing is to be complicit  in violating the spirit of our Constitution and the individual  liberties it guarantees.                            ____________________
