 Mr. Speaker, I have a message for the liberal so- called mainstream media.   You are essential to democracy. You have an almost sacred  responsibility to inform the American people, but they don't believe  you anymore.   Your coverage of the President and conservative Republicans is now  obviously so slanted, so biased, that you have lost your credibility;  in fact, polls show that it is at a record low.   In trying to destroy this President, you are destroying yourself. Is  that what you want?   Remember the Chinese proverb: ``When you set out on a journey of  revenge, dig two graves.''   Why not trust the American people with the facts and let them make up  their own minds rather than telling them what to think? I don't know of  [[Page H8667]]  any other way you can restore your credibility.                            ____________________
