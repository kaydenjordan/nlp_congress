 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express concern  about the skyrocketing prices of lumber, which is adding to the  instability of the housing market. Lumber prices have hit record highs;  yet, there is still tariffs on imports of softwood lumber. With high  tariffs, our low housing inventory will still not improve.   According to the National Association of Homebuilders, America's  housing affordability crisis and price swings in lumber have added more  than $18,000 to the price of a new home; meaning Americans needed an  average income of $144,000 to afford a home last year, more than double  the median household income in my district. With almost no stock and  rising prices, prospective buyers are faced with terrible bidding wars,  wars that can only be won by cash-only investors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Biden Administration to make the high price  of lumber a priority to improve the affordable housing market.                            ____________________
