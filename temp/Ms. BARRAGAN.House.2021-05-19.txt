 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National  Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States  Capitol Complex Act.   So many questions have surfaced since the attempted insurrection from  January 6, but one question encompasses everything: What happened?   A truth-telling commission will set the record straight about the  January 6 uprising, its causes, and potential remedial measures. This  is about a fact-finding and truth-telling mission. It was the very  absence of these two things that helped bring the insurrection on  January 6.   We can't move on until we look back and make sure we know what  happened, why, and make sure it never happens again.    On behalf of fallen Capitol Police Officer Sicknick, the men and  women of the U.S. Capitol Police, the congressional and Capitol Hill  staff that keep our offices running, and the American people, we must  uncover the truth.
