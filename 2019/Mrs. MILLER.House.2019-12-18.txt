 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 755.   Today is a disappointing day. It is the day my colleagues from across  the aisle cast the vote that they have spent the last 3 years obsessing  over, the vote to impeach our duly-elected President.   There are two charges claimed by House Democrats, and there is zero  cause for either.   While President Trump has led, our country has thrived, and  Washington liberals have failed.   Despite the commitment of many of our colleagues to obstruct the  Trump administration's agenda at every turn, our country continues to  succeed.   In this body, however, we have not been able to deliver on what  Americans want and need. We still have not finished securing our  border. The opioid epidemic still rages in our communities. Our  infrastructure is still in dire need of an overhaul. We still have not  reached a bipartisan resolution on drug pricing.   If Congress hadn't spent the last year stuck in a divisive, ugly,  partisan impeachment debacle, think of what we could have done, the  lives that could have been saved, the communities that could have been  improved, the crisis on our southern border ended, and the positive  work that we should do for our country. But we didn't, all because of  divisive political theatrics.   Congress can do better than this, and America deserves better.
