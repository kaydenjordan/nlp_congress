 Mr. President, already this Senate has passed seven  resolutions to undo harmful regulations that hold our country back.  Using the tools provided under the Congressional Review Act, we have  taken action to stop Obama-era rules that have threatened jobs, our  economy, and even the success of our students.   Today, we will have another opportunity to block a regulation, one  that undermines congressional intent and States' rights. The proposal  now before us would end the Obama administration's unemployment drug  testing rule and return power to the States so that they can best  address this issue at the local level. Congress granted the Labor  Department authority to design a rule regarding States' ability to  drug-test citizens applying for unemployment insurance; however, as we  saw all too often, the Obama administration went beyond its legal  authority in creating a regulation that severely limits the role of  State and local governments. That is why we heard from several  Governors, including those from Mississippi, Wisconsin, Utah, and  Texas, who called for Congress to overturn this regulation. As they  said in a recent letter, the Department of Labor should go back to the  drawing board and put forth ``a new rule that allows increased  flexibility for States to implement unemployment insurance drug testing  that best fits the needs of each state.'' With a new, smarter rule,  these Governors believe their States will be better able to implement  drug testing for those seeking unemployment insurance and help  individuals suffering from substance abuse to access necessary care and  treatment so that they may reenter the workforce as healthy and  productive members of our society.   I thank Senator Cruz for his leadership in sponsoring the Senate  companion to the bill we will vote on today, as well as Senator Cornyn  and Senator Hatch, the Finance Committee chairman, for working to  advance this resolution. We should pass it now so that we can restore  the power back to the States where it belongs.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, in election  after election, the American people have made their voices clear: They  want an end to ObamaCare. In my home State of Kentucky, ObamaCare  premiums are up by as much as 47 percent, and almost half of the  counties only have one  [[Page S1784]]  option for an insurer on the exchange. The pain individuals and  families are feeling across the country is palpable. They have watched  their bills skyrocket and their options disappear. ObamaCare has made a  mess all across our country.   Again and again, Kentuckians have called for relief from this  partisan law. Republicans have heard their call, and we have adopted a  three-pronged approach to stabilize the healthcare market and help it  grow into the future.   The first prong is the legislation currently being considered by  committees over in the House. Yesterday, the Congressional Budget  Office underlined some important things we have been saying about the  House bill. It will ultimately drive down premiums by 10 percent, in  their estimation. It will provide further relief to the middle class by  cutting taxes--a tax cut of $883 billion. It will also reduce the  deficit by $337 billion, according to CBO.   That is only considering one part of our three-pronged approach. It  does not take into account the other actions Congress, the Governors,  or the executive branch can take to further provide relief, lower  costs, and improve access. Obviously that means the CBO's statistics,  on average, are premature and may not represent the final number of  Americans covered under the plan.   Last night, we confirmed Seema Verma to head the Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid Services, known as CMS. In that role, Administrator Verma  has very broad authority to regulate how ObamaCare interacts with the  Medicaid Program.   ObamaCare spent years raiding Medicare funds and putting Medicaid on  an unsustainable path. Now she has the ability to work with States on  much needed reforms.   The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, just met  with Senate Republicans to discuss what he is doing to lessen the  burdens of ObamaCare on the American people.   ObamaCare gave significant regulatory flexibility to the Health and  Human Services Secretary, as well as the CMS Administrator. Secretary  Price and Administrator Verma now have the ability to make serious  policy shifts to benefit the American people.   With the three-pronged strategy, we can begin to put the troubles of  ObamaCare behind us. We can work together to make the health care  marketplace more accessible and affordable.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding rule XXII, following leader remarks on Wednesday, March  15, the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of  Executive Calendar No. 23, Daniel Coats to be Director of National  Intelligence; that the time until 10 a.m. be equally divided in the  usual form; and that at 10 a.m., the Senate vote on the motion to  invoke cloture.
