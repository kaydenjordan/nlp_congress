 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Glen McCall of Ottumwa, Iowa.   Glen passed away peacefully on March 2 at Ottumwa Regional Health  Center following a long battle with pulmonary fibrosis.   A native Iowan and an Army veteran, Glen and his wife, Kay, lived in  Iowa for almost 60 years. He worked at CSI in Humeston as a radio  technician for years and then worked as a farmer in Leon before moving  to Ottumwa as an entrepreneur to open McCall Communications, a two-way  radio sales and service shop. Glen and Kay ran the store for almost 40  years.   Glen was always happy to give his neighbors a helping hand and was a  longtime member of the Rotary Club of Ottumwa, serving as secretary for  decades.   His kindness, compassion, humor, and ever-ready smile were  appreciated by all those whom he encountered.   Glen dedicated his life to serving and helping the community he loved  and making Ottumwa the best place to live, work, and raise a family.  [[Page H1307]]    Glen's wife, Kay, their children, four grandchildren, six great- grandchildren, and all his loved ones are in my prayers.   I would also like to extend a joyful, happy 25th birthday to Caroline  and Charlie Kiley.   We also stand with Ukraine.                            ____________________
