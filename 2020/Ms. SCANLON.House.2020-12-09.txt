 Mr. Speaker, it has been 257 days since the first major  COVID relief package was signed into law--257 days. In that time  period, COVID cases in the U.S. have skyrocketed, and we have lost  almost 290,000 Americans.   The devastation this virus has wrought on our families, our  communities, and our economy is enormous. But it would have been so  much worse if we had not provided that early relief to our families,  our small businesses, and workers impacted by the spring surge. And  economists are clear that we need to provide more direct relief in  order to buoy the economy, much less to keep people safe.   The relief that we are seeking, that the American people are seeking  is not a handout. It is a lifeline. It is critical to get relief in the  hands of families, small businesses, frontline workers, and local  governments so we can get the virus under control. But, also, so we can  get the country back to work once we do so.   Mr. Speaker, time is of the essence. Unemployment is running out,  small businesses--and especially, restaurants--are closing. Families  are facing eviction and foreclosure.   Mr. Speaker, fighting this pandemic has been hard enough on the  American people. Getting them the relief they need to stay safe and  healthy shouldn't be.                            ____________________
