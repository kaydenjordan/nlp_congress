 Madam Speaker, we know that maternal mortality has  been increasing in the U.S. while declining in other countries,  unfortunately. We know these rates are even worse for Black women,  Madam Speaker.   We also know that lack of broadband in today's society can lead to  isolation, poorer education outcomes, and fewer work opportunities.  What we don't know is how broadband access impacts maternal health  outcomes. Finding this out is our goal.   At the end of the day, we all want to lower maternal mortality rates  and ensure that babies are both healthy and grow up with the love and  support of their mothers.   I am proud to co-lead this legislation, a bipartisan piece of  legislation, with my good friend, Mr. Butterfield, who we are going to  miss because he is retiring after this term, and Ms. Blunt Rochester,  another fellow member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this great bill.    Madam Speaker, I thank Subcommittee Chair Doyle, the  ranking member of the subcommittee, and the chairman of the full  committee as well for their support.   The spectrum landscape has changed dramatically since 2003, Madam  Speaker, with increased demand for wireless spectrum, fueling new  technologies and possibilities.   While spectrum auctions have occurred over the years, the memorandum  of understanding between NTIA and the FCC has not been updated to  reflect the ever-changing landscape.   While these agencies have recently made strides to update the MOU  since I introduced this bill last Congress, codifying this action will  ensure that these agencies are held accountable to get the job done.   After hearing from both the NTIA and the FCC leadership over the last  several weeks, I am glad to see this legislation move forward in the  House and encourage the Senate to also see its importance in preventing  agency miscommunication as we manage the Nation's spectrum.   Madam Speaker, we need to get this through.
