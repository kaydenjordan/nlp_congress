 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Water Conservation Rebate Tax Parity Act,'' which I introduced today.  Representative Jared Huffman (D-CA) has introduced companion  legislation in the House of Representatives.   Access to water has always been a major issue in California and  throughout the Western United States. That issue has only become more  pressing as climate change increases the risk of drought in the West.  Right now, 87 percent of California is facing ``Extreme Drought''  conditions and 33 percent of the state is experiencing ``Exceptional  Drought'' conditions, the most severe category.   A growing number of States, including California, have begun offering  rebates to homeowners to improve the water efficiency of their homes.  Unfortunately, many homeowners are unaware that they are required to  pay federal income taxes on these rebates and are surprised to be stuck  with that bill. Still other homeowners aware of the tax implications  are disincentivized from making these efficiencies to their homes.   The ``Water Conservation Rebate Tax Parity Act'' would exempt such  State and local rebates for water conservation improvements, as well as  improvements to better handle storm water runoff, from taxable income.  This would eliminate the unexpected bill homeowners face, increasing  the incentive to make these improvements, which benefit all of us.   I note that such State rebates for energy conservation improvements  are already excluded from taxable income. Thus, my bill would simply  put water conservation rebates on par with energy conservation rebates  for tax treatment.   It is critical that Congress explore many ways to address climate  change and mitigate the impacts that we are already seeing. Encouraging  homeowners to make their properties more water-efficient is one way to  do that.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Padilla, and Mr.          Tillis):   S. 2432. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude  from gross income amounts received from State-based catastrophe loss  mitigation programs; to the Committee on Finance.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Disaster Mitigation and Tax Parity Act,'' which Senator Burr and I  introduced today. Representative Mike Thompson (D-CA) has introduced  companion legislation in the House of Representatives.   Encouraging homeowners to take steps to reduce the risk of natural  catastrophe damage to their homes has long been a goal of policy  makers. In California, it has been a special challenge to incentivize  individuals to purchase earthquake insurance and to harden their homes  against potential earthquake damage.   The threat of natural disasters and extreme weather events has become  a much greater problem in recent years due to climate change, which is  driving an increasing frequency and severity of wildfires, droughts,  hurricanes, and other catastrophic events. This, in turn, is reducing  the availability and increasing the costs of insurance for individuals  and businesses.   A growing number of states, including California, have begun offering  rebates to homeowners to improve their homes to mitigate against damage  from such events. Unfortunately, many homeowners are unaware that they  are required to pay Federal income taxes on these rebates and are  surprised to be stuck with that bill. Other homeowners who are aware of  the tax implications are disincentivized from making these improvements  to their homes.   The ``Disaster Mitigation and Tax Parity Act'' would exempt such  State rebates for disaster mitigation improvements from taxable income.  This would eliminate the unexpected bill homeowners face, increasing  the incentive to make these improvements, which benefit all of us.   I also note that such State rebates for energy conservation  improvements are already excluded from taxable income. Thus, our bill  would simply put disaster mitigation rebates on par with energy  conservation measures.   I am pleased that Congress is exploring many ways to address climate  change-related matters. Encouraging homeowners to make their properties  more resistant to natural catastrophe damage is one way to help.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE:   S. 2437. A bill to amend the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003  to require the Secretary of Agriculture to expedite hazardous fuel or  insect and disease risk reduction projects on certain National Forest  System land, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture,  Nutrition, and Forestry.
