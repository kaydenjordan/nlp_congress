 Madam Speaker, this is a consequential week for the  country that we love and its future.   House Democrats are preparing to ram through the most expensive  spending package this institution has ever seen, with a combined price  tag of $5.5 trillion.   $5.5 trillion, let that astronomical figure sink in.   This package contains a $2.1 trillion tax increase on hardworking  families and job creators, the largest in history. It bypasses needed  infrastructure priorities in favor of Green New Deal pet projects, and  it adds mountains of debt burden to our kids' and grandkids' future.   Meanwhile, all of this reckless spending comes at a time when  inflation is already sky-high, and it will only make the cost of daily  necessities continue to go up and up.   There is simply no justification for a package so expansive, so  excessive, and so extreme.   For the sake of America's future, we need to stop this socialist  spending spree in its tracks.                            ____________________
