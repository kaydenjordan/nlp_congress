 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Build Back Better  Act, which will make historic investments across the country.   We are in the middle of a housing crisis, and I have worked hard for  funding to assist this crisis that we have in housing. As chairwoman of  the Financial Services Committee, I have considered this my  responsibility.   It is not lost on me that more than 580,000 people experience  homelessness on any given night, and millions of families are at this  very moment sacrificing their next meal to pay the rent. Many more have  been kept out of their dream of homeownership.   With more than $151 billion for housing in this bill, Democrats are  helping families achieve housing stability and housing affordability.    Housing is infrastructure. The Build Back Better Act provides the  largest investment in America's housing infrastructure in history. This  investment is critical to creating a fair and equitable Nation where  everyone can thrive.   As this bill goes to the Senate, in it we have $10 billion for first- generation home buyers; we have $25 billion in Section 8 rental  assistance; we have $25 billion in the HOME program, CDBG, and the  housing trust fund to build more affordable units.   So I would ask for support of this very significant legislation. It  is indeed a game-changer. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  Build Back Better Act.
