 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Buck) for his efforts and leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I think it is really important that  we talk about law enforcement; we talk about what their role is. These  are the peacekeepers. The men and women right here on Capitol Hill, the  Capitol Police, they are the ones who prevent chaos, that allow for  order to stand here in the Capitol complex.   In the State of Louisiana, in my hometown of Baton Rouge, back on  July 17, we had an extraordinary event. We had five of our law  enforcement officers who were responding to a shooter with a long gun;  clearly, someone that was dressed and armed in a way to not be helpful  to the community. While the rest of us were running away from that  shooter, these five men were running toward him.   As a result of that, Deputy Brad Garafola lost his life, and his  wife, Tonja, is right now a widow.   Matthew Gerald lost his life, and Dechia, his wife, is now a widow.  Dechia found out 2 weeks after his death that she was pregnant, and he  has never seen that baby. That baby doesn't have a father today.   We had Montrell Jackson, another Baton Rouge police officer, who lost  his life, and his wife, Trenisha, is now a widow.   We had Bruce Simmons who got shot, and while he did survive, he is  still struggling with recovery, and he and his wife, Pam, continue to  go through that from the July 17 shooting from last year.   Nick Tullier was also involved in that shooting, and I have been  wearing my ``Pray for Nick'' band now for months. Nick Tullier  continues to be in the hospital even today.   This bill allows for the protection of our officers. It clearly  distinguishes that these are the peacekeepers, these are the people who  are putting their lives on the line to make sure that we have order, no  longer chaos.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation, and I urge  everyone to support this unanimously.
