 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 114) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit an annual report  regarding performance awards and bonuses awarded to certain high-level  employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 114         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Section 5317(g) of title 38, United States Code, is amended       by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and inserting ``December       31, 2027''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 114, as amended, a bill  to authorize appropriations for the Veterans Choice Program. This bill  would authorize and appropriate $2 billion for the Department of  Veterans Affairs' Veterans Choice Fund.   Allowing the Veterans Choice Fund to run dry is not a viable option.  The Choice Program has provided critical care to millions of veteran  patients.   In March, Secretary Shulkin testified that the expiration of the  Choice Program would be a ``disaster'' for veterans. Just a few weeks  ago, the Acting Under Secretary for Health reiterated that sentiment  when she testified that veteran wait times would increase if the Choice  Program went away.   Congress created the Choice Program in response to a nationwide wait- time scandal in 2014 to increase access to care through VA community  providers for veterans who either cannot access care at a VA medical  facility within a timely manner or who live far away from the nearest  VA medical facility. Since the Choice Program was signed into law  almost 3 years ago, it has gone through many growing pains and evolved  considerably.   We know from a Government Accountability Office report from earlier  this year that most of the veterans who use the Choice Program do so  because VA does not offer the service that veteran needs.   We also know that veteran demand for care through the Choice Program  has never been higher, and, consequently, the remaining money in the  Veterans Choice Program will run out in mid August, a few short weeks  from now.   We cannot allow that to happen, and with passage of S. 114, as  amended today, we won't.   There are allegations that providing more money for the Choice  Program is  [[Page H6152]]  inappropriate unless we also provide more money for the VA healthcare  system. I fail to understand the logic of that argument.   First, providing money for the Choice Program is providing money for  support to the VA healthcare system. Choice is a VA program. Through  it, VA patients and veteran patients are able to access care that would  have otherwise have required either a long, possibly debilitating wait  or an excessive travel time.   Second, the idea that Congress has been pouring money into VA  community care programs to the detriment of addressing VA's in-house  capacity is simply erroneous. VA's bottom line has increased  substantially since the turn of the century while most other government  agencies have seen theirs stagnate or reduced.   Madam Speaker, VA's budget has gone up four times since 2001. It has  quadrupled. Two weeks ago, former Secretary Principi testified that  since he left the Department in 2005 to the most current VA budget  submission released in May, VA's budget increased a stunning 268  percent. That growth will likely continue, which is appropriate, given  our Nation's commitment to serving her veterans.   Yet, especially considering that the Choice Program is just 3 years  old, the idea that Congress is focused only on growing VA's external  capacity is false.   That said, there are certainly priorities that remain unaddressed in  the bill before us, and I am committed to continuing to work on those  in the coming months.   However, providing $2 billion today will ensure that the Choice  Program remains funded for the next 6 months, solving our most pressing  issue and preventing yet another veteran access crisis like the one  that led to the creation of the Choice Program 3 short years ago while  we addressed other important issues.   An important point to note is that the bill's costs are paid for  using the same offsets that were used in the original act creating the  Choice Fund.   I look forward to working with the minority, our colleagues in the  Senate, and other stakeholders to charter a long-term path forward for  the Choice Program and to address other needs to ensure that the VA  healthcare system remains strong and stable for generations to come.   I am grateful to Ranking Member Walz for his leadership and  commitment in working very closely with me to come to a mutually  agreeable solution today and to committing to continue to stand  shoulder to shoulder in finding solutions in the months ahead. He has  been a great partner.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  S. 114, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I think the one way that we don't have the Veterans  Choice Program work for veterans is not vote for S. 114. Just to  clarify a couple of things, this $2 billion is emergency spending that  our Budget Committee agreed to.   I want to just for a minute kind of go over how we got to this  position where we are right now.   The Veterans Choice Program, in April, we were told, would last until  next January or February. So we passed the CHOICE Act, and the  President signed it into law. We found out a short 60 days later that  the funds would run out in mid August--the 7th to the 15th of August is  when the Secretary told us--so that kind of caught us off guard, and we  had to get moving rather quickly.   The June 28 letter that my good friend, Mr. Walz, referred to sort of  got us started with this process. I want to go through it because the  process is important about how we are here today.   The Members need to understand that my efforts to work with the  committee's ranking member and, indeed, all members of the committee on  a path forward which addresses the concerns of all of the  organizations, I have done that.   Let me begin by saying I fundamentally disagree that we have  neglected the needs of our internal VA healthcare system. We just  passed a MILCON-VA bill last week. I stated the reasons for that in my  earlier remarks. I think the Secretary's op-ed this morning in USA  Today clearly makes the point.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record that article.                      [From USA Today, July 24, 2017]   Veterans Affairs Secretary: VA Health Care Will Not Be Privatized on                                 Our Watch                             (By David Shulkin)         As a physician, my professional assessment is that the       Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress       over the past six months--but it still requires intensive       care. In order to restore the VA's health, we must strengthen       its ability to provide timely and high quality medical care       while improving experiences and outcomes for veterans.        I believe the best way to achieve this goal is to build an       integrated system that allows veterans to get the best health       care possible, whether it comes from the VA or the private       sector.        This is not a novel idea. No health care provider delivers       every treatment under the sun. Referral programs for patients       to get care through outside providers (known as Choice or       Community Care at the VA) are as essential to the medical       profession as stethoscopes and tongue depressors. But VA       attempts to offer veterans these options have frequently       stirred controversy.        Some critics complain that letting veterans choose where       they get certain health care services will lead to the       privatization of VA. Nothing could be further from the truth.        VA has had a community care program for years. Congress       significantly expanded these efforts in 2014 in response to       the wait time crisis. As a result, since the beginning of       this year, VA has authorized over 18 million community care       appointments--3.8 million more than last year, or a 26%       increase, according to the VA claims system.        But as VA's community care efforts have grown, so has our       capacity to deliver care in-house. The VA budget is nearly       four times what it was in 2001. Since then, the department's       workforce has grown from some 224,000 employees in 2001 to       more than 370,000 today, according to the Office of Personnel       Management. And we're delivering 3 million more appointments       at VA facilities per year than we were in 2014.        In other words, community care or private capacity and VA's       internal capacity are not mutually exclusive. We are ramping       up both simultaneously in order to meet the health care needs       of the veterans we are charged with serving. Our fiscal 2018       budget continues this trend. It will spend $2.7 billion more       for in-house VA care, compared to a $965 million increase for       community care. This means that the total dollar increase for       medical care within VA is three times that of the increase       for community care. Overall, when all funding sources are       taken into account, we expect to spend $50 billion on health       care services within VA and $12.6 billion on VA community       care in fiscal 2018.        Even though these numbers make it abundantly clear VA is       not at all headed toward privatization, I understand the       underlying concerns of some critics. They don't want to lose       all that VA has to offer. I don't either--and we won't.        Many of VA's services cannot be replicated in the private       sector. In addition to providing some of the best quality       overall health care in the country, VA delivers world class       services in polytrauma, spinal cord injury and       rehabilitation, prosthetics and orthotics, traumatic brain       injury, post-traumatic stress treatments and other behavioral       health programs. The department plays a critical role in       preparing our nation's doctors and nurses--70% of whom train       at VA facilities. And we lead the nation in innovation, with       VA research having contributed to the first liver transplant,       development of the cardiac pacemaker, advancements in       treatments for PTSD, cutting-edge prosthetics, and many other       medical breakthroughs.        All of these factors underscore that fears of privatization       are simply unfounded. President Trump is dedicated to       maintaining a strong VA, and we will not allow VA to be       privatized on our watch. What we do want is a VA system that       is even stronger and better than it is today. To achieve that       goal, VA needs a strong and robust community care program.        Veterans deserve the best. If a VA facility isn't meeting       the community standard for care, doesn't offer a specific       service, or doesn't have an appointment available when it's       needed, veterans should have access to care in their       community.        This is precisely what they have earned and deserve. It's       what the VA is working with Congress and Veterans Service       Organizations to deliver. And it's what the system needs to       remain a valuable resource for our country's great veterans,       now and in the future.     Madam Speaker, I respect the veterans service  organizations and their point of view, and I am a member of most of  them. I, therefore, reached an agreement with the ranking member on a  plan to fund the Veterans Choice Program for 1 year, fund the life  safety maintenance issues at VA facilities, approve 28 VA clinic  leases, provide the Secretary with the tools to be more competitive in  attracting and retaining VA physicians, and conduct a long-overdue  asset review of VA's aging facilities.   When the ranking member and I briefed the VSOs on this plan and then  committee members--two separate meetings--it was clear that we needed  to take some time to work out the differences. There was some concern  there. And I have said that is fine. I think we can take a two-phased  approach.   Phase one was the one we are talking about today, and we agreed on  that. It is necessary to fund the Veterans Choice Program for 6 months  to ensure that the veterans get needed healthcare without long drives  and waits. That is exactly what we were dealing with 3 years ago.   The second phase, which we would consider 6 months from now, would  [[Page H6155]]  consider the remaining items I have talked about between the ranking  member and me. During the interim, the committee would conduct open,  transparent hearings on asset review and anything else--the leases or  anything else--that was in that agreement. There was full transparency  about this plan among committee members, which is why I found it a  little disheartening now what I am hearing.   The reality is, right now, we don't have an agreement from the Senate  or a bill to act on, so it is time for us to act because time is  growing short.   There are veterans out there, Madam Speaker, that are getting  chemotherapy as we speak. There are pregnant veterans who need to know  if they can have their baby and have it paid for by the VA. I could go  on and on. That is why we need to remove this right now. Then we would  have time to work these other issues out.   And just a couple of VA staffing issues. You hear the concern that VA  is going to be privatized and so forth. I hear that all of the time.  Well, this is what the VA has done, as far as their facilities are  concerned, since 2010. I arrived here in 2009.   Since then, the VA has added 3,600 physicians, almost 13,000 nurses-- and they are one of the largest employers of nurses in the country-- almost 4,000 LPNs, and over 3,200 nonphysician healthcare providers. I  could go on and on. The increase in medical services has been over $10  billion since then. So there have been huge increases.   And just a couple of things from the VA Secretary's editorial in USA  Today: ``But as VA's community care efforts have grown, so has our  capacity to deliver care in-house. The VA budget is nearly four times  what it was in 2001. Since then, the Department's workforce has grown  from some 224,000 employees in 2001 to more than 370,000 today,  according to the Office of Personnel Management.''   That doesn't sound like an organization that is being privatized. It  has grown in that capacity.   ``And we're''--the VA--``delivering 3 million more appointments at VA  facilities per year than we were in 2014.''   They have grown that capacity internally.   In our fiscal 2018 budget, the trend continues. We are going to spend  $2.7 billion more on in-house VA care compared to a $965 million  increase in community care. So there is a $3 billion increase in in- house VA care versus out-of-VA care, or outside care.   I think these are all good things. I think the fact that more  veterans are getting care, more appointments are being made, whether  they are in or out of the VA, is a good thing. But to make the argument  that this is privatization is clearly not there.   I would like to say that we can work these out. We need to make sure  we take that anxiety away. The Secretary has clearly stated that he has  to have this passed. I would simply pass it. It gives us 6 months,  Madam Speaker, to work on these issues, and I am more than happy to do  it. I have stated so to every organization out there.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I do agree with my good friend, the gentleman from  Minnesota, Tim Walz. We are not going to leave here until we pass this,  because there are veterans out there who are ill, who have served this  country honorably, who need care.   I am a physician. I have worked in a VA hospital, I have worked in a  medical unit in Southeast Asia many years ago, I have seen the results  and injuries of war, and I have seen the results and injuries of  current wars. And we are going to do this.   I know when I sat down and we put this compromise package together,  and as openly as I could, I brought in the VSOs, I brought in both the  Republican and Democrat sides, which we typically just check all that  at the door in this committee, which I am thankful for,  [[Page H6156]]  and work just for veterans, and there were some issues that were  brought up. And I recognized that, and I said: Well, the smart thing to  do is we know that Choice runs out of money in 2 to 3 weeks. We have to  fund the veterans' healthcare now, and we will take these other issues  up as a package and have time to debate them and discuss them. That is  all this is about. It is about emergency spending. We recognize that,  and that is okay with our side.   I say the easiest way to do this is put this $2 billion bill on  President Trump's desk, he will sign it, and veterans will have access  to this Choice Program for the next 6 months. That is what the  Secretary wants. He wrote a very eloquent editorial in USA Today about  this entire issue.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time  left on our side.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume. I want to clarify a couple of things that have been said  here today.   Madam Speaker, we did work out an agreement. When I met with all of  the interested parties, which I thought was our job, both the ranking  member and myself did this, as we always do, we found out some issues  that were there.   The primary thing we have to do right now is to provide healthcare,  or we will be right back to where we were in 2014, when there were  waiting lists around the country and veterans dying waiting on care.   Maybe not in urban America, but in rural America where I live, many  of these hospitals and veterans absolutely rely on this for their  health and welfare. The further they live away from a VA facility, the  more they rely on Choice.   Let me go over this again so that it is clear. I got into Congress in  2009. I was elected then and sworn in then. The VA was spending $93.7  billion on all VA care; that is the disability claims, healthcare, and  cemeteries. In this fiscal year, that budget is going to be $186  billion, where basically the discretionary budget in this Congress has  been flat, so that money has come from other places, education,  environment, other places that we have invested in our veterans, which  is, and I believe to this day, a good thing to be doing.   We have gone, in 2001, from 224,000 people, that is not a small  organization, to 370,000 people who work for the VA today. They are  providing that money.   I guess what I was hearing from the other side of the aisle was if we  didn't have the Choice Program, the wait times would have gotten  shorter. I mean, that is the reason we have the Choice Program, was the  VA wasn't doing it.   The fact is, they have hired people. I mentioned here just a moment  ago, since 2010, when I first got here, they have hired 13,000 more  nurses, 3,600 more doctors, 3,200 more physician extenders, nurse  practitioners and PAs. So the VA has increased its capacity, and they  have seen millions of more visits.   This week, we are going to take up the VA appropriations bill. I  misspoke a minute ago; I said last week. This week, we are taking up  the MILCON-VA appropriations bill where we talk about those things,  about the money that we are going to spend in the VA. That is going to  be debated this week.   This is a separate issue. This is about providing healthcare for  veterans after August 15, that is 2 to 3 weeks from now, when that  program will be shut off and veterans in the middle of care will not be  able to get care.   It is a simple vote. We can work these other things out in the next  few months after this very easily.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Obviously, this has been a robust debate about a very important  issue, which is providing timely healthcare for veterans who have been  waiting. The ranking member and I negotiated in good faith and put an  agreement together, which fell apart this weekend.   We had met basically with both the VSOs and the committee members and  had an agreement to go forward. I then backed up on that agreement  because I realized it wasn't a consensus, and just divided it into two.   The most pressing need, Madam Speaker, is to provide healthcare,  whether it is chemotherapy or obstetrical care, surgery that a veteran  may need, timely visits to the doctor. In 2 to 3 weeks we are up that  close, and one of the reasons is, as has been stated multiple times,  the VA gave us some  [[Page H6158]]  really bad information 2 months ago. We thought this was going to last  for 6 more--8 more months before we ran out of money in this vital  program for veterans.   This is going to get passed. For all veterans or people out there,  citizens of this country watching this, we are going to provide this  for our veterans.   And I might add that not all VSOs do oppose this. Many were  mentioned, but many others do not oppose this legislation.   I think it is critical that we get this done, Madam Speaker, get this  off the table this week, signed into law, work the other part of the  agreement that we had agreed to out in the next coming weeks. I will be  willing to work as expeditiously as possible to get this done.   Once again, I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3218) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  make certain improvements in the laws administered by the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(3) Sites.--The sites listed in this paragraph are the       following:        (A) Camp Siebert, Alabama.        (B) Fort McClellan, Alabama.        (C) Huntsville Arsenal, Alabama.

(4) Factors of consideration.--In making a determination       under paragraph (1), the Secretary--        (A) shall consider--        (i) that contemporaneous records of testing of full-body       exposure to a covered substance frequently may be unavailable       because such tests were classified or such records were lost       or destroyed;        (ii) that many veterans were sworn to secrecy following       testing described in clause (i);        (iii) each statement based on personal knowledge of a       veteran who served at a site listed in paragraph (3);        (iv) information in the report from the Secretary of       Defense under subsection (b)(2); and        (v) any evidence the Secretary considers relevant; and        (B) may not determine that testing of full-body exposure to       a covered substance did not occur at a site based solely on--        (i) information contained in the Department of Defense and       Department of Veterans Affairs Chemical Biological Warfare       Database; or        (ii) any list of known sites of testing of full-body       exposure to a covered substance maintained by the Department       of Veterans Affairs or the Department of Defense.        (5) Presumption of exposure.--In carrying out paragraph       (1), when the Secretary of Veterans Affairs makes a       determination regarding whether a veteran experienced full-      body exposure to a covered substance, the Secretary--        (A) shall presume, unless there is affirmative evidence to       establish otherwise, that the veteran experienced such       exposure by reason of the service of the veteran in World War       II--        (i) based on the locations listed in paragraph (3); and        (ii) consistent with the places, types, and circumstances       of service of the veteran in accordance with section 1154 of       title 38; and        (B) shall resolve each reasonable doubt in favor of the       veteran.        (6) Effective date of award.--The effective date of any       award of disability compensation resulting from       reconsideration of a claim under paragraph (1) shall be fixed       in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier       than the date of the receipt of the claim for compensation       described in paragraph (2).        (b) Investigation and Report by the Secretary of Defense.--      Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall--        (1) investigate and assess each site--        (A) where the Army Corps of Engineers has uncovered       evidence of testing conducted by the Department of Defense       during World War II to assess the effects of full-body       exposure to a covered substance on humans; or        (B) with regards to which more than two veterans have been       denied claims for compensation under chapter 11 of title 38,       United States Code, in connection with exposure to a covered       substance at such site; and        (2) submit to the appropriate congressional committees and       the Secretary of Veterans Affairs a report on testing       described in paragraph (1)(A), including--        (A) a list of each location where such testing occurred,       including locations investigated and assessed under paragraph       (1);        (B) the dates of each such testing; and        (C) the number of members of the Armed Forces who       experienced full-body exposure to a covered substance in each       such testing.        (c) Investigation and Report by Secretary of Veterans       Affairs.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall--        (1) investigate and assess--        (A) the actions taken by the Secretary to contact       individuals who experienced full-body exposure to a covered       substance in the course of testing described in subsection       (b)(1)(A);        (B) the number of claims filed with the Secretary for       disability compensation under chapter 11 of title 38, United       States Code, arising from testing described in subsection       (b)(1)(A); and        (C) the percentage of claims described in subparagraph (B)       that the Secretary denied.        (2) submit to the appropriate congressional committees and       the Secretary of Defense a report regarding the       investigations and assessments carried out under paragraph       (1).        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The terms ``active military, naval, or air service'',       ``veteran'', and ``World War II'' have the meanings given       such terms in section 101 of title 38, United States Code.        (2) The term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (A) the Committees on Armed Services of the House of       Representatives and the Senate; and        (B) the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate.        (3) The term ``covered substance'' means--        (A) nitrogen mustard gas;        (B) sulfur mustard gas; or        (C) Lewisite.        (4) The term ``full-body exposure'', with respect to a       covered substance, has the meaning given that term by the       Secretary of Defense.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3218, as amended, the Harry W.  Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, which I introduced  with Ranking Member Walz and every member of the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs 2 weeks ago.   This bill and how it got to this point today is a shining example of  how well Congress can and should work together. It is the result of  tireless work of many veterans service organizations and the bipartisan  efforts of committee members.   I am proud that the improvements and enhancements to the GI Bill that  this Chamber will advance today will empower servicemembers, veterans,  survivors, and dependents for generations to come.   This is the first major improvement to the GI Bill since 2011, and it  encompasses 17 bills introduced by our colleagues, many who serve on  the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and also others who share our  committee's commitment to the men and women who have raised their right  hand side to serve.   This package includes over 30 provisions and brings forward many  enhancements that veterans' groups have requested for years. I have  said it before and I will say it again, this isn't a package that comes  along every day.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3218, as amended, is aptly named after Mr. Harry  W. Colmery, who is credited with actually writing by hand the first  draft of the World War II-era GI Bill. It is only appropriate that we  honor him today for his work on the first GI Bill decades ago.   This package would do a number of things, and I want to focus on just  a few key improvements. First, it would eliminate the 15-year time  limit to use the GI Bill benefits for future eligible beneficiaries and  anyone who left active service on or after January 1, 2013.   Madam Speaker, the GI Bill, when I used it for 2 years after I got  out of the military, was, at 10 years, you could no longer use it. This  is a lifetime commitment to the American people, to our veterans, if  they can exercise their GI Bill benefit at any time.   Let me repeat that. For the first time in the history of our GI Bill,  future beneficiaries and some veterans will be able to carry these  benefits with them throughout their life.   Secondly, the bill would provide significant increases in GI Bill  funding for  [[Page H6166]]  reservists and guardsmen, including those who are currently serving on  orders but do not accrue GI Bill eligibility, as well as dependents,  surviving spouses, and surviving dependents.   It would also provide 100 percent GI eligibility for post-9/11 Purple  Heart recipients.   Finally, it would increase opportunities for veterans to complete a  science, technology, engineering, math degree, or other high technology  program. That particular issue is one that I know Leader McCarthy has  advocated for. It is a privilege to have him as an original cosponsor  of the bill, and we thank him for his leadership in getting the bill to  the House floor promptly.   The provisions I just mentioned only scratch the surface of the  benefits that our veterans and survivors will receive under this bill.   The amendment to this bill before the House today provides technical  and conforming changes to ensure the bill is budget-neutral over the  10-year budget window, clarifies that students impacted by the closure  of ITT Tech would be able to have their GI Bill eligibility restored if  they are unable to transfer their credits, and, starting in fiscal year  2022, would provide eligibility for a Yellow Ribbon Program to Active  Duty servicemembers.   Madam Speaker, we owe a debt of gratitude to all the VSOs who pushed  for this package. And I would be remiss if I didn't single out and give  my sincere thanks to the Student Veterans of America, the American  Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America,  Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, the Military Order of the  Purple Heart, and Got Your Six for working tirelessly across the Hill  over several months to help us make this happen.   I commend and thank them because, without a doubt, we would not be in  this Chamber today on the verge of this historic moment without their  efforts.   Finally, I thank Ranking Member Walz for his strong leadership and  support in making this package come together. I also express my  appreciation to Senators Isakson and Tester for their efforts in  negotiating a strong package we can all agree on. I know they are  planning to hold a markup on this companion bill to H.R. 3218, as  amended, this week, and I would expect that they can pick up and pass  this bill and get it to President Trump's desk before the August  District Work Period.   Madam Speaker, this is a strong bill that would help thousands of  student veterans for the rest of their lives. I urge my colleagues to  support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                        Committee on Armed Services,                                        House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, July 20, 2017.      Hon. David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       3218, the ``Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance       Act of 2017.'' There are certain provisions in the bill which       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed       Services.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important       legislation, I am willing to waive this committee's further       consideration of H.R. 3218. I do so with the understanding       that by waiving consideration of the bill, the Committee on       Armed Services does not waive any fixture jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the legislation       which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the committee       report on H.R. 3218 and into the Congressional Record during       consideration of the measure on the House floor. The       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment to any       House-Senate conference on this legislation and requests your       support if such a request is made. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                     William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, July 21, 2017.      Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman, House Committee on Armed Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thornberry: In reference to your letter on       July 20, 2017, I write to confirm our mutual understanding       regarding H.R. 3218, as amended, the ``Harry W. Colmery       Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017.''        I appreciate the House Committee on Armed Services' waiver       of consideration of provisions under its jurisdiction and its       subject matter as specified in your letter. I acknowledge       that the waiver was granted only to expedite floor       consideration of H.R. 3218, as amended, and does not in any       way waive or diminish the Committee on Armed Services'       jurisdictional interests over this legislation or similar       legislation. I will support your committee's request for       appointment to any House-Senate conference on H.R. 3218, as       amended. Finally, I will also support your request to include       a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the       committee report on H.R. 3218, as amended, and in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration.        Again, thank you for your assistance and cooperation with       these matters. Sincerely,                                                David P. Roe, M.D.,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I think one of the greatest  things in here is the lifetime benefit. When I was in my early  twenties, I wouldn't have put a big bet on being 40 years old. So I  know you don't ever think you are going to get there, but you do. With  the changing workforce today, it is a huge benefit that I think that  veterans going forward are going to appreciate and the country will  benefit from.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Fitzpatrick), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my distinguished colleague, a  senior member and vice chair of the committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford), an active member of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer), my good friend. We have served on  the Education and the Workforce Committee together since he has been  here, and he is in his fourth term.    Madam Speaker, it sounds like the gentleman who  spent 2 years and didn't have anything to show for it was in the U.S.  Congress, but that is another story altogether.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana  (Mrs. Brooks), my good friend, whom I served with on the Education and  the Workforce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   This was a process, and it took several months working with the VSOs,  with our staffs, with Mr. Walz's team and our team and others to get  this bill where it is. And I think, as Mr. Walz said, that as people  dig into this bill, it is truly, I believe, an outstanding piece of  legislation that honors the people who serve this country and will give  them a benefit when they come home.   If you are 25 years old and you come home and you have a job from the  military, you separate after a few years of service, and your job  leaves when you are 42, you have lost that benefit now.   Now, you can go back and get retrained. We know that the average  person is going to have five, six, seven different occupations during a  professional working career. This will allow our veterans, I think some  of the absolute finest people that grace this Nation, to be able to be  the ones who are the leaders in the future because of the education  benefit that they have earned with their service.   I thank my friend, Mr. Walz, for his work on this and leadership on  this, along with his team and our team here.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 282) to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act  to authorize spouses of servicemembers to elect to use the same  residences as the servicemembers.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 282         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Military Residency Choice       Act''.       SEC. 2. RESIDENCE OF SPOUSES OF SERVICEMEMBERS FOR TAX                     PURPOSES.         (a) Residence for Tax Purposes.--Section 511(a)(2) of the       Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. 4001(a)(2)) is       amended by adding at the end the following new sentence:       ``The spouse of a servicemember may elect to use the same       residence for purposes of taxation as the servicemember       regardless of the date on which the marriage of the spouse       and the servicemember occurred.''.        (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to any return of State or local       income tax filed for any taxable year beginning with the       taxable year that includes the date of the enactment of this       Act.       SEC. 3. RESIDENCE OF SPOUSES OF SERVICEMEMBERS FOR VOTING.         (a) In General.--Section 705(b) of such Act is amended--        (1) by striking ``State or local office'' and all that       follows through the period at the end of paragraph (3) and       inserting ``State or local office--''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(1) a person who is absent from a State because the       person is accompanying the person's spouse who is absent from       that same State in compliance with military or naval orders       shall not, solely by reason of that absence--        ``(A) be deemed to have lost a residence or domicile in       that State, without regard to whether or not the person       intends to return to that State;        ``(B) be deemed to have acquired a residence or domicile in       any other State; or        ``(C) be deemed to have become a resident in or a resident       of any other State; and        ``(2) the spouse of a servicemember may elect to use the       same residence as the servicemember regardless of the date on       which the marriage of the spouse and the servicemember       occurred.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on the date that is 90 days after the       enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 282, the Military Residency Choice  Act. The Military Residency Choice Act would change the way military  spouses claim State residency by allowing a spouse to claim the same  State of residence as their servicemember spouse, even if they have  never physically lived in that State.   I want to commend Representatives Stefanik and Wittman for their work  on this bill, and I will allow them to describe it in greater detail in  a moment.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 282, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik), coauthor of the bill and my  colleague on the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this commonsense legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1058) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  clarify the role of podiatrists in the Department of Veterans Affairs,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1058         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Provider Equity Act''.       SEC. 2. ROLE OF PODIATRISTS IN DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS.         (a) Inclusion as Physician.--        (1) In general.--Subchapter I of chapter 74 of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the       following new section:       ``Sec. 7413. Treatment of podiatrists; clinical oversight         standards         ``(a) Podiatrists.--Except as provided by subsection (b), a       doctor of podiatric medicine who is appointed as a podiatrist       under section 7401(1) of this title is eligible for any       supervisory position in the Veterans Health Administration to       the same degree that a physician appointed under such section       is eligible for the position.        ``(b) Establishment of Clinical Oversight Standards.--The       Secretary, in consultation with appropriate stakeholders,       shall establish standards to ensure that specialists       appointed in the Veterans Health Administration to       supervisory positions do not provide direct clinical       oversight for purposes of peer review or practice evaluation       for providers of other clinical specialties.''.        (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the       item relating to section 7412 the following new item:  ``7413.

(b) Modification and Clarification of Pay Grade.--        (1) Grade.--The list in section 7404(b) of such title is       amended--        (A) by striking ``PHYSICIAN AND DENTIST SCHEDULE'' and       inserting ``PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON (MD/DO), PODIATRIC SURGEON       (DPM), AND DENTIST AND ORAL SURGEON (DDS, DMD) SCHEDULE'';        (B) by striking, ``Physician grade'' and inserting       ``Physician and surgeon grade''; and        (C) by striking ``PODIATRIST, CHIROPRACTOR, AND,'' and       inserting ``CHIROPRACTOR AND''.        (2) Application.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall       apply with respect to a pay period of the Department of       Veterans Affairs beginning on or after the date that is 30       days after the date of the enactment of this Act.       SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF REDUCTION IN AMOUNT OF PENSION FURNISHED                     BY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR CERTAIN                     VETERANS COVERED BY MEDICAID PLANS FOR SERVICES                     FURNISHED BY NURSING FACILITIES.         Section 5503(d)(7) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and inserting       ``September 30, 2026''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1058, as amended, the VA  Provider Equity Act. This legislation would recognize the professional  contribution of hardworking podiatrists within the Department of  Veterans Affairs healthcare system.   The VA standard for compensating podiatrists has not been updated in  41 years. In that time, education and training for podiatrists has been  revolutionized.   As a result of the VA's failure to recognize and respond to  advancements in podiatry practice, it has created significant  disparities in pay and advancement opportunities for podiatrists  practicing at the VA in comparison to their peers in the private  sector.   Consequently, the VA struggles to recruit and retain experienced,  qualified podiatrists--those we want caring for our veterans--at a time  when veteran need for podiatry care is increasing.   This legislation would solve that problem by allowing VA podiatrists  the opportunity to seek leadership opportunities at VA medical  facilities and making podiatry pay equal to physician and dentist pay  within the VA healthcare system.   I am grateful to my good friend, fellow veteran, and committee  member, Dr. Brad Wenstrup, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health,  for his leadership in recognizing what an important issue this is and  being thoughtful and tenacious in pursuit of a solution to it.   I am proud to join Dr. Wenstrup in fully supporting this legislation  and urge all of my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup). Colonel Wenstrup is a member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1690) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit an annual report  regarding performance awards and bonuses awarded to certain high-level  employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1690         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans       Affairs Bonus Transparency Act''.       SEC. 2. ANNUAL REPORT ON PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND BONUSES                     AWARDED TO CERTAIN HIGH-LEVEL EMPLOYEES OF THE                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) In General.--Chapter 7 of title 38, United States Code,       is amended by inserting after section 717 the following new       section:       ``Sec. 718. Annual report on performance awards and bonuses         awarded to certain high-level employees         ``(a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the end of       each fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit to the       appropriate committees of Congress a report that contains,       for the most recent fiscal year ending before the submittal       of the report, a description of the performance awards and       bonuses awarded to Regional Office Directors of the       Department, Directors of Medical Centers of the Department,       Directors of Veterans Integrated Service Networks, and any       other individual employed in a senior executive position.        ``(b) Elements.--Each report submitted under subsection (a)       shall include the following with respect to each performance       award or bonus awarded to an individual described in such       subsection:        ``(1) The amount of each award or bonus.        ``(2) The job title of the individual awarded the award or       bonus.        ``(3) The location where the individual awarded the award       or bonus works.        ``(c) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) The term `appropriate committees of Congress' means--        ``(A) the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Committee       on Appropriations of the Senate; and        ``(B) the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Committee       on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.        ``(2) The term `individual' means--        ``(A) a career appointee (as that term is defined in       section 3132(a)(4) of title 5); or        ``(B) any individual who occupies an administrative or       executive position and who was appointed under section       7306(a) or section 7401(1) of this title.        ``(3) The term `senior executive position' means--        ``(A) with respect to a career appointee (as that term is       defined in section 3132(a)(4) of title 5), a Senior Executive       Service position (as such term is defined in section       3132(a)(2) of title 5); and        ``(B) with respect to an individual appointed under section       7306(a) or section 7401(1) of this title, an administrative       or executive position.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 7 of such title is amended by inserting       after the item relating to section 717 the following new       item:  ``718. Annual report on performance awards and bonuses awarded to                certain high-level employees.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1690, as amended, the  Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus Transparency Act.   This bill would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to submit  an annual report to specified congressional committees on the  performance awards and bonuses presented to Senior Executive Service  employees, SES employees.   I believe that, if you do excellent work, you should receive a bonus.  I also believe such a bonus should be justified and that there should  be some level of transparency regarding those who receive a bonus.   Mr. Speaker, I support Congresswoman Tenney's bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney) who is the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, sometimes we sing from the same  song sheet, and sometimes we don't sing from the same song sheet.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1848) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to carry out a pilot program on the use of medical scribes in  Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1848         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(2) Comptroller general report.--Not later than 90 days       after the termination of the pilot program under this       section, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to Congress a report on the pilot program.

(2) Section 526 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992       (Public Law 102-585) is repealed.        (c) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect 90 days       after the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1848, as amended, the Veterans Affairs Medical Scribe Pilot Act of  2017, which I am proud to sponsor.   One of my priorities as chairman of the House Committee on Veterans'  Affairs is to increase access to care for veteran patients. One way to  do that is help hardworking Department of Veterans Affairs clinicians  to be more efficient in the practice of high-quality care.   The Veterans Affairs Medical Scribe Pilot Act of 2017 would do just  that by creating a 2-year pilot program to test the use of scribes in  VA medical centers.                                time  1545    Scribes are increasingly used in the private sector to help doctors  navigate and document a patient's electronic health record. That allows  doctors to place their focus not on a computer screen, but squarely on  the patient.   I jokingly say, Mr. Speaker, that it was electronic health records  that made me a Congressman. Basically, it ran me out of the medical  office. That is a slight exaggeration, but it is not too far off.   Like many doctors I hear from today, I found the increasing amount of  time that I was spending attending to electronic health record  requirements, necessary as they may be, detracted from the quality of  my patients' interactions and significantly slowed down how smoothly my  clinic day would operate. I believe the same is true at VA. Many  doctors now, Mr. Speaker, are spending over half their time entering  information, just basically being data entry people.   Onsite visits to VA medical facilities across the country, my staff  and I always ask VA employees how we can help them provide safer,  better care and see more patients. By far, one of the most common  responses that we hear is a plea to ``give us scribes; give us some  help.''   That is exactly what passage of H.R. 1848, as amended, will do.   This bill also includes provisions of H.R. 1662, a bill sponsored by  Dr. Brad Wenstrup, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, which  would bring VA medical centers in line with every other major  healthcare system by prohibiting smoking on VA medical facility  properties.   I thank Dr. Wenstrup for his leadership on this issue, and I am  grateful to be working with him to make VA medical facilities healthy,  smoke-free places for VA employees to serve veterans and for veterans  to seek care.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support me in supporting  H.R. 1448, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2006) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  improve the procurement practices of the Department of Veterans  Affairs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2006         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Procurement Efficiency       and Transparency Act''.       SEC. 2. INFORMATION ON COST OR PRICE SAVINGS FROM                     COMPETITION.         (a) In General.--Chapter 81 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by inserting after section 8128 the       following new section:       ``Sec. 8129. Information on cost or price savings from         competition         ``(a) Recording of Information.--With respect to any       contract awarded by the Secretary that is reported in the       Federal Procurement Data System described in section       1122(a)(4)(A) of title 41, United States Code, or any       successor system, the Secretary shall record information on       the amount of any cost or price savings realized by using       competitive procedures in awarding such contract.        ``(b) Placement of Records.--The Secretary shall place       recorded information under subsection (a) as follows:        ``(1) With respect to contracts recorded in the Electronic       Contract Management System, or any successor system, in such       system.        ``(2) With respect to contracts not covered by paragraph       (1), in a location determined appropriate by the Secretary.        ``(c) Calculation of Cost Savings.--(1) In carrying out       subsection (a), the Secretary shall calculate the amount of       cost or price savings realized by using competitive       procedures in awarding a contract by--        ``(A) subtracting the total value of the selected offer or       quote from the average of the total values of all offers or       quotes evaluated; or        ``(B) subtracting the total value of the selected offer or       quote from the total value of the median offer or quote       evaluated.        ``(2) If the difference calculated pursuant to paragraph       (1) is negative, the Secretary shall record such difference       as zero.        ``(3) The Secretary shall make calculations under paragraph       (1) with respect to a contract--        ``(A) at the time at which the Secretary obligates amounts       under such contract; or        ``(B) if such contract contains options, at the time at       which the option is exercised.''.  [[Page H6175]]         (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the       item relating to section 8128 the following new item:  ``8129. Information on cost or price savings from competition.''.       SEC. 3. USE OF STANDARDIZED PROCUREMENT TEMPLATES.         To the extent practicable, the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs shall make available and use on a Department-wide       basis the standardized procurement templates used by the       Central Office of the Department, the Veterans Health       Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the       National Cemetery Administration. In carrying out this       section, the Secretary may customize such templates to       address particular procurement situations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2005, the VA Procurement  Efficiency and Transparency Act.   H.R. 2006 is commonsense contracting, transparency, and efficiency  legislation sponsored by my friend, Representative Mike Coffman, an  esteemed member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.   This bill will make clear how much money the VA is saving by  competing contracts and direct the VA to organize its contracting  documents. Procurement difficulties seem to happen year after year, and  I thank Representative Coffman and other Members with reform bills  under consideration today for their work on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 2006, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Coffman), a senior member of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, a veteran of both the Marine Corps and the U.S. Army, and a  great friend.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2749) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  improve the oversight of contracts awarded by the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs to small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2749         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Business       Opportunities for Veterans Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTS UNDER CONTRACTS WITH                     SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY                     VETERANS.         (a) In General.--Section 8127 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (l) as subsection (m); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (k) the following new       subsection (l):        ``(l) Limitations on Subcontracting.--(1)(A) The       requirements applicable to a covered small business concern       under section 46 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657s)       shall apply with respect to a small business concern owned       and controlled by veterans that is awarded a contract under       this section.        ``(B) For purposes of applying the requirements of section       46 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657s) pursuant to       subparagraph (A), the term `similarly situated entity' used       in such section 46 includes a subcontractor for a small       business concern owned and controlled by veterans described       in such subparagraph (A).        ``(2) The Secretary may award a contract under this section       only after the Secretary obtains from the offeror a       certification that the offeror will comply with the       requirements described in paragraph (1)(A) if awarded the       contract. Such certification shall--        ``(A) specify the exact performance requirements applicable       under such paragraph; and        ``(B) explicitly acknowledge that the certification is       subject to section 1001 of title 18.        ``(3)(A) The Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business       Utilization for the Department, established pursuant to       section 15(k) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(k)),       and the Chief Acquisition Officer of the Department,       established pursuant to section 1702 of title 41, shall       jointly implement a process using the systems described in       section 16(g)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       645(g)(2)), and any other relevant systems available, to       monitor compliance with this subsection.        ``(B) The Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business       Utilization and the Chief Acquisition Officer shall jointly       refer any violations or suspected violations of this       subsection to the Inspector General of the Department.        ``(C) If the Secretary determines, in consultation with the       Inspector General of the Department, that a small business       concern that is awarded a contract under this section did not       act in good faith with respect to the requirements described       in paragraph (1)(A), the small business concern shall be       subject to any or all of the following consequences--        ``(i) referral to the Debarment and Suspension Committee of       the Department;        ``(ii) a fine under section 16(g)(1) of the Small Business       Act (15 U.S.C. 645(g)(1)); and        ``(iii) prosecution for violating section 1001 of title 18.        ``(D) Not later than November 30 for each of years 2018       through 2022, the Inspector General shall submit to the       Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of       Representatives a report for the fiscal year preceding the       fiscal year during which the report is submitted that       includes, for the fiscal year covered by the report--        ``(i) the number of referred violations and suspected       violations received under subparagraph (B); and        ``(ii) the disposition of such referred violations,       including the number of small business concerns suspended or       debarred from Federal contracting or referred to the Attorney       General for prosecution.''.        (b) Effective Date.--Subsection (l) of section 8127 of       title 38, United States Code, as added by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to a contract entered into after the       date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2749, as amended, the  Protecting Business Opportunities for Veterans Act of 2017.   H.R. 2749, as amended, is contracting reform legislation sponsored by  my friends, General Bergman and Representative Kuster, the chairman and  ranking member of our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.   This bill will help stop companies that exploit the existing  contracting laws and regulations to take work away from legitimate  service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and veteran-owned small  businesses.   It is crucial that Federal procurement be fair and that veteran  entrepreneurs actually receive the business opportunities that the law  creates for them. This bill is a smart fix for a difficult problem, and  I appreciate my colleagues' work on it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 2749, as amended, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), a new member of our committee and chairman  of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R.  2749, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2781) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to certify the sufficient participation of small business concerns  owned and controlled and owned by veterans and small business concerns  owned by veterans with service-connected disabilities in contracts  under the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2781         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Veteran Enterprise       Participation in Strategic Sourcing Act''.       SEC. 2. SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS CERTIFICATION OF                     SUFFICIENT PARTICIPATION OF SMALL BUSINESS                     CONCERNS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY VETERANS AND                     SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS OWNED BY VETERANS WITH                     SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITIES IN CONTRACTS                     UNDER THE FEDERAL STRATEGIC SOURCING                     INITIATIVE.         (a) Certification Required.--Not later than 180 days after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs shall submit to the Committees on Veterans'       Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate       certification in writing that with respect to each contract       (except for domestic delivery services) awarded under the       Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (managed by the Office       of Federal Procurement Policy) a sufficient number of small       business concerns owned and controlled by veterans and a       sufficient number of small business concerns owned and       controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities       are represented within each category.        (b) Insufficient Representation.--If the Secretary       determines that the representation by small business concerns       owned and controlled by veterans or small business concerns       owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected       disabilities within a category of the contracts awarded under       such Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative is not a       sufficient number, the Secretary shall--        (1) consult with the Administrator of the General Services       Administration to increase the number of such concerns       awarded contracts under such category; or        (2) require the Department of Veterans Affairs to stop       awarding orders under that category of the Initiative,       effective on the date of such determination.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The terms ``small business concern owned and controlled       by veterans'' and ``small business concern owned and       controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities''       have the meaning given such terms in section 8127(k) of title       38, United States Code.        (2) The term ``category'' means--        (A) a type of supply or service for which a suite of       contracts has been established under the Federal Strategic       Sourcing Initiative; or        (B) any further subdivision or grouping within such a suite       of contracts.  [[Page H6177]]         (3) The term ``sufficient number'', with respect to a type       of business concern, means not fewer than two and enough to       maximize the percentage of orders entered into by the       Secretary with such business concerns, as determined by the       Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2781, as amended, the  Ensuring Veteran Enterprise Participation in Strategic Sourcing Act.   H.R. 2781 is another piece of thoughtful contracting legislation  sponsored by a hardworking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee,  Dr. Neal Dunn. This bill will make sure that all small businesses owned  by veterans and service-disabled veterans are never excluded from a  particular group of contracts run by the General Services  Administration, or GSA.   Despite Congress' efforts to give our veterans maximum opportunity in  VA contracting, the system does not always work as it should. This bill  fixes a loophole that has cropped up recently and makes sure veteran  businesses are not inadvertently ignored when VA uses these GSA  contracts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 2781, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Dunn), a veteran and the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Bost), the subcommittee chair on the committee and a  marine veteran.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), the Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee chair and a marine who served with distinction.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   In closing, I would certainly urge everyone to support this  actionable piece of legislation.   During the last 6\1/2\ months, the Veterans' Affairs Committee has  been a very active committee. When we realized that our Choice Program  was running short of funds, the committee, in a bipartisan way, voted  to extend that.   We have also realized that there are 470,000 veterans whose claims  are in appeals and have not been adjudicated. We realize that program  is not functioning as it should. The House acted quickly, was  bipartisan. That legislation has now been passed out of the Senate VA  Committee and is awaiting action by the floor. We hope to have it  passed and signed into law soon.   We knew that the Secretary of the VA said he had problems, that he  couldn't--most VA employees are terrific. Some of my best friends work  at the VA. But there are some not good employees out of the 370,000  there, and the Secretary said, to do his job, to reform the VA, he  needed a bill where he could terminate poor-performing employees, and  this House and Senate gave him that. The President has signed that into  law.   The Secretary has also moved in speeding up the electronic health  record transformation into a modern off-the-shelf system. We debated on  this floor, today, the Post-9/11 GI Bill update, which is a tremendous  benefit for veterans, and decades from now we will look back on this  debate we had on the floor, I think, with some admiration as I do. It  has been a true privilege and pleasure to be on this committee and to  work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take care of  these important issues this committee has produced. It will make this  promise to our veterans of this country; it will continue to produce  results for them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
