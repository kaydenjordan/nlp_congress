 Madam Speaker, the tragic shootings in Atlanta  yesterday killed eight people--six of whom were Asian women.   To the families of the victims, you have my deepest condolences.   This crime has elements that we are trying to address here in  Congress; gun violence, violence against women, and the meteoric rise  of violence we are witnessing against the AAPI community.   Racially motivated violence must be called out for exactly what it  is, and we must stop making excuses or rebranding it as economic  anxiety or sexual addiction.   Madam Speaker, as a woman who is Black and Korean, I am acutely aware  of how it feels to be erased and ignored, and how the default position  when violence is committed against people of color or women is to defer  from confronting the hate that is often the motivation.   Madam Speaker, words matter and leadership matters. We must all  loudly condemn actions and language rooted in fear and bigotry that  harms all of us.
