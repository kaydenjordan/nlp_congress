 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask to speak as if in morning business.    Mr. President, it is flattering when the Republican  Senate leader comes to the floor and mentions your name, and Senator  McConnell did just that this morning.   The issue was the filibuster. Senator McConnell found a quote several  years ago where I spoke in favor of the filibuster to protect minority  rights in the Senate. It is true. I did say that. It was based on life  experience. Having already served in the Senate for a number of years,  I came to understand how it evolved as one of the procedures in the  Senate.   But I have to say to you that my impression of the filibuster  changed, and the reason it changed was none other than the Republican  Senate majority leader, now minority leader, Senator McConnell. You  see, the filibuster really was created in the Senate through its own  rules, as I explained yesterday, and it came to define the Senate in  this respect. The Founding Fathers looked to the Senate to provide two  representatives--literally, Senators--from each State, regardless of  population, so smaller States, back in the original Colonies, like  Delaware, would have the same number of Senators as a large State, like  Virginia. That was their intention.   So the protection of minority rights was kind of built into the  definition of the U.S. Senate, and the filibuster became its  manifestation in the daily procedure of the Senate. Under that  filibuster, of course, one Senator could stop the debate, or at least  slow it  [[Page S1535]]  down, by insisting on a filibuster, only to be stopped by an  extraordinary majority of the Senate voting to return to the regular  business.   That was the case in 1957 because, in August of 1957, Senator Strom  Thurmond took to the floor of this U.S. Senate and initiated the  longest filibuster in its history. For 24 hours and 18 minutes, the man  stood by his desk and spoke without stopping. He didn't have any  permission to leave the floor for any reason and certainly couldn't sit  down without losing his filibuster. He did it. He did it for the wrong  reason, I am afraid, because he was trying to stop the march of civil  rights in this country, but he did it. Determinedly, he achieved that  goal.   When he did, in 1957, that was the broken fifth filibuster in the  history of the Senate in the previous five decades. In other words, if  you went back to 1919 and all the way to 1957, Strom Thurmond's was the  fifth time in history a filibuster was broken. Once every decade, a  filibuster was broken on the Senate floor.   Well, that world has changed--dramatically changed. We can now have  five filibusters in a couple of weeks. We now have, on average, 80  filibusters a year because of the urging and direction of the Senator  from Kentucky, Senator McConnell. He has institutionalized the  filibuster to the point where it is now the normal course of business,  not an extraordinary procedure.   I recounted the fact that I introduced the DREAM Act 20 years ago--20  years ago. Durbin, what kind of a Senator are you that in 20 years you  can't pass the DREAM Act? Well, I brought it to the Senate floor on  five different occasions, and on five different occasions it was  stopped by the filibuster. Other Members can tell the story of their  legislative experience on the floor too.   The point I am getting to is this: It wasn't until Senator McConnell  and the Republicans who follow him decided to make the filibuster just  daily business in the Senate that it was abused to the point where the  Senate stopped doing regular legislative business.   I would like Senator McConnell to come to the floor the next  opportunity he has and explain this to me. In the last calendar year,  2020, the Senate considered 29 amendments on the floor of the Senate in  the entire year. Now, that doesn't count a vote-arama, which is an  aberration that I don't think would ever be accused of being  deliberative. But 29 regular-order amendments during the course of a  year--embarrassing, isn't it? When you think of this great so-called  debating society, 29 times we brought an amendment to the floor? Well,  it was an improvement--an improvement over the previous year, a 30- percent improvement, in fact--because in the year 2019, under Senator  McConnell's leadership, we had 22 amendments.   So when Senator McConnell and others come to the floor and plead for  us to hang on to the traditions of the Senate, I would tell you that  their interpretation of the traditions is strangling this body. They  have beaten the old filibuster to the point where it is hardly  recognizable and is now the regular order of business in the U.S.  Senate.   That is why many of us, frustrated with having worked so hard to come  here, wanting to do the best we can to represent the people who have  sent us here, are so frustrated by the current state of procedure. And  for Senator McConnell and other Republicans to come to the floor and  plead for hanging on to this tradition is actually pleading for the  Senate to continue to do less and less each year.   There are those of us now in control on the majority side--the bare  majority side--on the Democratic side, who really believe there is much  more to be done in the Senate. The American people expect us to  respond.   Now, you might ask: Well, how did you pass the American Rescue Plan  if there is a filibuster used so frequently? It was under a process  called reconciliation, which depends on a majority vote. You can't  filibuster under the reconciliation. That is why this amazing bill,  this new law, the American Rescue Plan by President Biden, is so  sweeping in its reach. We had to try to combine, under this law, so  many provisions that had been affected by the pandemic and the state of  the economy because we knew that returning to the regular order of  business with the filibuster looming every single day would tie our  hands just as sure as we have seen in the past several years.   So, Senator McConnell, thank you for mentioning my name, but if I  became skeptical of the filibuster, it is because of your use of it. I  hope that you understand that you can't have it both ways. It can't be  a rare procedure and be a procedure that dominates the actual business  of the Senate as this has done for so many years.
