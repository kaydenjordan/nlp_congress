 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for this time to talk  about something that is rather important. Something we did today was to  pass a horrendous tax cut that doesn't meet this fundamental goal.   Really, whenever we legislate here, we really ought to keep in mind  our values: What is the purpose? What are we trying to accomplish? What  is the goal? What is the human value that we are trying to put in  place?   I often use this because it is here in Washington at the FDR  Memorial. It is on the marble there: ``The test of our progress is not  whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much.''   Let me read that again, Franklin Delano Roosevelt: ``The test of our  progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have  much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''   I want to use this as my compass, my guiding light on where we need  to go. So this afternoon, this House of Representatives, by a vote of,  I think, just over 200 voted to enact a tax law that goes in exactly  the opposite direction of what FDR would say is our value, our goal.   Here it is. The Speaker of the House came here to bring down the  gavel to announce the vote that he was so proud to have.   Eighty percent of the individual tax cuts don't go to the poor, don't  go to the middle class. They go to the top 1 percent.   How does that fit with what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said to the  American Nation during the height of the Great Depression?   No. You may as well take Franklin Delano Roosevelt's words, turn them  on their head, because this House didn't follow the edict, didn't  follow the value, but did exactly the opposite: gave away, to the top 1  percent, even greater wealth.   How could that be? Why would they do that? Why would they do that?   Well, I don't know why they would do it, but they surely did it. And  in addition to that, not just the wealthy 1 percent, the wealthy 10  percent, why don't you add American corporations to that who are awash  in cash? $2.5 trillion in the bank accounts of American corporations,  and they don't know how to spend it to create jobs in the United  States.    Instead, the Republicans, today, decided they needed $1.43 billion  additional cash as a result of the tax cut that no Democrats, not a  one, but every Republican voted for, $1.43 billion--the number is from  the Joint Committee on Taxation--of new after-tax revenue to American  corporations.   And what do you suppose they are going to do with that? Create jobs  in the United States? Expand their manufacturing? No. Or higher wages  for their workers? No.   I will tell you what they intend to do with it. This is it. The  corporate tax giveaway will give Wells Fargo an 18 percent earnings  increase.   How do they intend to spend it? Hint: Not on jobs.   In his own words, Tim Sloan, CEO of Wells Fargo, December 2017--I  think that is this month--said: ``Is it our goal to increase return to  shareholders and do we have an excess amount of capital? The answer . .  . is yes. So our expectation should be that we will continue to  increase our dividend and our share buybacks next year and the year  after that and the year after that.''   All right, Mr. Sloan. You can thank the Republicans, because when you  buy back your shares, when you increase your dividends, guess what. The  stock price goes up, and we know that your compensation is based on  stock price. Are you going to use that extra money for loans to small  businesses? to farmers? No, you are not. You are not going to make more  loans.   This is replicated across the American corporate culture. This is not  unique. This new after-tax bonus that the Republicans are giving to  American corporations is going to be used for the benefit of the  wealthy. So you can add, if you will, to the tax cuts that are coming  as a result of the reduction in the top income tax bracket for  individuals from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, you can add to it, but, by  the way, their investment portfolio is going to go up also.   This tax program is an abomination, and it is going to hurt every  American over time.   I am joined here tonight by my colleagues who are probably as riled  up about this as I am. I am not sure which one of them came in first.   I yield to the gentleman from the State of Oregon, Peter DeFazio, my  colleague.  [[Page H10235]]        Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for explaining in  some detail what the impacts of this legislation are and who is going  to benefit. The gentleman is a member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, on which I am the ranking member.   I just want to say, we have been waiting for the trillion-dollar  Trump infrastructure plan for a year now, and what we are hearing is,  well, they just can't afford it. We can't afford to rebuild America's  infrastructure.   So let's compare the impact of a few of these tax cuts to what we  could have done or could do with that money. Every tax cut means the  government forgoes revenue.   So let's just take the estate tax. Doubling the exemption from an $11  million to $22 million estate, that costs $100 billion. If we invested  that $100 billion in infrastructure, we would create 1.5 million  working family wage jobs for Americans--1.5 million jobs. Now, I  suppose those people with the cuts in the estate tax, they are going to  trickle something on working people, probably not jobs, though.   And let's look at one of my favorites, the passthrough. We are going  to help small business. Well, no, we are not really going to help small  business. If you work in your small business, you are not going to get  a tax break. If you are a passive investor in a so-called small  business or passthrough entity, you get a big tax break.   Now, the President says he won't benefit. He owns 500 passthrough  businesses according to his financial disclosure. Each one of those  will give him a massive tax break.   Well, that little beauty costs $600 billion. For $600 billion, if we  invested it in infrastructure, we could create 9 million jobs. These  passive investors in oil and gas and real estate, how many jobs are  they going to create? Again, they might hire another manservant or  someone to cut the lawn or someone to wax the yacht, but it's not going  to be 9 million jobs, and it isn't going to be at family wages--Davis- Bacon wages, I might say, really good wages.   Let's just look at one item, the top rate. That only goes to people  who earn over $500,000 a year. They are going to get a substantial  break. About $130 billion it is going to cost us to give a tax break to  people who earn over $500,000 a year, more of the trickle class, and  that would have created 2 million family wage jobs rebuilding America's  infrastructure, and not just benefiting the people who do the work.   And it isn't just construction. It is design. It is engineering. It  is small business. And just think of all the benefits in terms of the  movement of goods and people and how it makes America more competitive.   What a sad day it is when, as you pointed out very well, we are  giving this money--three-quarters of it goes to corporate tax breaks,  three-quarters. The last time we gave corporations a big tax cut under  Bush when they repatriated almost $1 trillion, 93 percent of the money  was spent on stock buybacks, dividends, and executive bonuses. I don't  know what they did with the other 7 percent because those same  corporations actually reduced employment.   So what a false promise this is. A very, very sad day. I thank the  gentleman for bringing this to the attention of the American people.    I thank the ranking member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee for making a very clear case on how we might  better spend our money.   I yield to the gentleman from the great State of California (Mr.  McNerney), my colleague and neighbor.                                time  1745    Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my neighbor and friend, Mr.  Garamendi, for holding this Special Order tonight and allowing us to  talk about what this tax bill means.   Mr. Speaker, today is a sad day in America, as the House passed an  unholy tax scam of a tax bill. This bill was rushed through Congress  with no hearings, no Democratic votes, and no Democratic amendments.  This Republican tax scam is being deceptively sold as a benefit for the  middle class, but the real winners will be the big corporations and  those on the cover of Forbes 400 richest Americans.   The Republican tax scam will increase the national debt by almost $2  trillion, burdening our children or giving a Christmas bonus to the  wealthiest Americans.   The Republican tax scam permanently lowers the corporate tax rate  while the child tax credit increase expires in 2025. In other words,  big corporations get a permanent tax cut while the middle class  receives a temporary tax cut.   This tax scam places a cap on State and local taxes for individuals,  targeting punishment for Democratic States. This is a new low for our  democracy. The Republican tax scam also repeals the Affordable Care  Act's individual mandate. This will cause 13 million Americans to lose  their health insurance. Taking healthcare away from those who elected  us is shameful.   Earlier today, we heard from Ady Barkan, who was recently diagnosed  with ALS. Many will recognize Ady from the video of him confronting  Senator Flake in an airplane.   Ady spoke passionately this morning about the dangers of this tax  scam. As he was finishing, he talked about the opportunity we have to  come back and do a real tax reform, in 2018, and do so in a bipartisan  way. His hope for what a good tax bill should look like struck me. He  said that we should come back and negotiate a tax bill that elevates  human dignity, instead of promoting human misery.   This Republican tax scam will hurt millions of Americans, many who  are already struggling. We need a bipartisan solution to tax reform,  not a special interest scam that benefits the wealthiest.   Mr. Speaker, Americans should have no doubt this tax scam will hurt  them and the economy. Forget about investing in infrastructure. Forget  about investing in education. Forget about investing in research. You  better start worrying about Medicare and Social Security. This tax scam  will make America a Third World nation.   Mr. Speaker, this tax scam is a disgrace.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Perlmutter), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Perlmutter), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Perlmutter), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Perlmutter), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Perlmutter), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Perlmutter), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Perlmutter), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman's final sentence was  ``rushed through.'' There has not been one substantive hearing in  either House. There has been a markup hearing, but that is not a  substantive hearing.   No Democratic amendments have been accepted. Not one economist has  been called to testify--not one accountant, not one tax lawyer. No  hearings whatsoever.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline) to share with us his perspective.    Mr. Speaker, did I hear Mr. Cicilline correctly that  the action taken here on the floor is not dispositive, but has to be  modified in the Senate and brought back because they screwed up?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cicilline for bringing to our  attention some key elements here: The deficit issue, which we will  discuss a little longer today. Also, the issue of really growing  American jobs: growing wages, growing the future, and creating a better  future for American workers. I know that has been the gentleman's  passion and his work. We will go through all of those things in the day  ahead.   This bill may very well become law, but I would surely like to see  exactly how the President is going to do with this. I suspect this  passthrough business in which he has 500 passthrough corporations--he  is not an active investor. He will make out very, very well, and the  working men and women of the middle class are going to lose.   I am just looking at this. This is the distribution tables from the  Joint Committee on Taxation, December 18, 2017. Income category, a  distribution of individual income tax side of the proposal. 2019, a  small $127 million reduction for everybody making less than $10,000. In  2021, they are actually paying higher taxes. So the very, very bottom,  in just 3 years, they are going to pay higher taxes.   I notice that my friend from North Carolina has joined us, and I  thank him so very much for joining us. I know he has a few things on  his mind, as do Mr. Cicilline and I.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price)  to share with us his views on what has happened today and where we are  going.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding. I am thankful that Mr. Garamendi has taken out this Special  Order and that so many colleagues have come out to express their views  on this travesty of a tax bill that was passed by the House today and  that appears to be on its way to the President's desk.   Speaking of the President and how much he will benefit from that, I  am sure my colleagues have heard the saying that he campaigned like a  populist and is governing like a plutocrat.   Wouldn't you say this bill is a pretty good exhibit A with respect to  that?    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, oh, absolutely. And I  would say, also, that maybe it is an oligarch, and maybe we are  creating one of those Russian oligarch societies here in which a few  who are well connected to this President are going to do very, very  well.   We are not talking about the Russia thing here today, but it gives me  some pause to think: Why are they working so hard to end the Mueller  investigation? But that is another subject for another day.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. It is, indeed. But the Russian role  model seems alive and well as we look at the development of the  American economy and where we may be going.   Mr. Speaker, I am sure my colleague will agree that our Republican  friends know this is a very, very unpopular piece of legislation. It is  striking, isn't it? They decided that they were going to go into the  hole $1.5 trillion, forget about revenue neutrality. They are going to  go into the hole and borrow $1.5 trillion. Even with that, they have  not been able to write a bill that most of the American people feel a  benefit from. It is extraordinary.   Well, the fact is that most of the American people won't benefit from  this bill. I think they are on to that. The latest polling shows that  Americans oppose this bill by a margin of 2 to 1. That is, of course,  before they have even felt the effects of this bill.   I think Republicans know that this opposition is only going to get  stronger the more people figure out what is in this bill. That may be  why they have rushed this thing to passage in the most chaotic  legislative process I can ever remember.   They released thousands of pages of text on this bill last Friday and  expected to vote on it today, of course.    Maybe that is the reason why they held no hearings. The less people  know, the better.   Maybe that is why we have had almost no debate.   Maybe that is why they won't even allow for a complete scoring of the  bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation or the Congressional Budget  Office.   Maybe that desire to cover up the consequences of this is the reason  they have added these questionable provisions, to provide a fig leaf of  coverage for hesitant Members, skittish Members who want to be able to  explain this vote back home.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard for years Republican colleagues decry  fiscal irresponsibility, a lack of regular order in these Chambers and  a lack of orderly, responsible procedures. They have talked about tax  reform that simplifies the Tax Code, that benefits hardworking  families.   Well, what we have seen today and what we have seen in recent days as  this bill came to the floor is just a total contradiction of all that  they have professed to stand for all these years. These words are  nothing but lip service and false promises. They have sloppily drafted  this bill behind closed doors. They plan to raise taxes on 86 million  middle class families, and they plan to add $1.5 trillion to the  national debt.   Despite claims that this bill will benefit the middle class, 83  percent of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.   And they have also taken aim at healthcare, as if the tax travesties  weren't enough. By eliminating the so-called individual mandate, the  GOP tax scam will explode premiums, and it will add 13 million  Americans to the ranks of the uninsured.   The bill is a windfall for large corporations that want to ship  American jobs overseas. They want to cut staff. They drive down wages  and salaries. This bill will facilitate that.   Plain and simple, the Republican tax scam asks hardworking families  and future generations of Americans to foot the bill for huge tax cuts  for corporations and for the wealthiest.   And we haven't seen the end of it yet. Do you know what is coming  next? You can bet that, once this bill passes, Republicans are going to  pivot. They are going to pivot in a heartbeat to pose as the guardians  of fiscal rectitude.   Having abandoned any pretense of revenue neutrality in this bill and  having added $1.5 trillion to the national debt and having triggered a  $25 billion Medicare sequester cut, they are, all of a sudden, going to  sound the alarm: Poor us. We are broke. Our country is broke. We have  got to squeeze Medicaid now. We have got to squeeze Medicare. We have  got to squeeze Social Security. We have got to squeeze investments in  transportation, housing, education, and research.   You can see it coming. We have seen this bad Republican movie before,  although never on such an epic scale.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, we don't need to  guess what they are going to do. The Speaker of the House of  Representatives, Mr. Ryan, has said very clearly that next year will be  step two. They will take on what he calls the social safety net: Social  Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps. That is where the cuts  are going to come. This is not our words. These are the words of the  leadership of this House of Representatives, the words of the Speaker.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is absolutely  right. This has been in Republican budgets forever, this war on the  kind of safety net provisions that so many of our fellow citizens  depend on.   Fiscal rectitude, indeed. They are willing to go $1.5 trillion in the  hole,  [[Page H10238]]  willing to borrow that money, to take the national debt to dangerous  levels.   But it is a matter of being able, then, to say: Poor us. Our country  is broke. We can't afford to invest in our people. We can't afford to  build our infrastructure. We can't even afford to leave intact the  safety net that people have spent their lives depending on.   It is a travesty. This tax bill is not just about taxes. It is about  keeping faith with the American people; and that faith, this very day,  has been broken by the Republican Party.   Mr. Speaker, I should say this. They had an opportunity to do this  the right way. This wasn't inevitable. This wasn't written in stone.  They could have worked with Democrats in Congress in a bipartisan way  to figure out how to grow the economy and how to simplify our Tax Code.   Do you remember that? Simplify the Tax Code and file it on a  postcard. This bill makes the Tax Code far, far more complicated. It is  a dream bill for tax lawyers and accountants.   So no more simplification. That has been forgotten.   They were going to lower the tax burden for middle class families. We  could have figured out how to do that without exploding the debt. There  are many, many things we could have achieved together.   We have, here, a once-in-a-decade opportunity, and they have blown  it, they have squandered it, and that is a source of great regret. In  fact, the Republicans have jeopardized our economic future to give tax  cuts, tailor-made, for corporate lobbyists and, as they have actually  said, to make their donors happy--to make their donors happy.   Mr. Speaker, we hope against hope that the Senate might yet do the  right thing, and when they have to clean up this bill to bring it back  to the House for yet another vote, that our House colleagues--it was a  narrow vote. It was a narrow vote. It would be wonderful to turn it  around. But we certainly need to make sure that there is no mistake how  this has happened, what has happened, and we must start, this very day,  to figure out how to make our economy and our country whole and to make  it work for all of our people.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for this opportunity. This is  very, very useful to be able to have this kind of extended discussion.  Even though the subject matter is not happy--we have had a very bad day  here in the House of Representatives--it is important for us to pick  up, move ahead, and realize the task that lies ahead.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Price of North Carolina so  very much. His thoughtful discussion of this is much appreciated.   He mentioned the deficit issue. $1.5 trillion does not include the  interest on the $1.5 trillion. So if you were to add the interest to  the $1.5 trillion, it would actually probably be over $2 trillion to  $2.3 trillion that this will cost. The actual reduction in revenues,  $1.5 trillion, interest on top of that another $600 billion or so, so  we are looking at something really serious here.   I would like to go through some of the numbers.   I looked at this. This is not something that is off 10 years from  now. This is now.   In 2019, the structural deficit that is already in place, without  even talking about this additional burden of increased deficit, the  underlying structural deficit in 2019 is right around $600 billion.  This tax bill will add maybe $250 billion to $300 billion of additional  debt in 2019. So we are going to get very close to $1 trillion of  deficit in 2019.   And, by the way, the military budget is increased by about, I think  it is over $50 billion. That is not paid for, so that is additional  debt. That is going to be here on the floor tomorrow or the next day.   In addition to that, there is this ongoing effort to deal with the  hurricanes, fires, and so forth. That is another $120 billion that is  not paid for.   So if you take $120 billion, you take $50 billion, and you take the  $250 billion to $300 billion in the tax bill and you add that to the  $600 billion that exists to begin with, in 2019, it will be over $1  trillion of new debt. And I will guarantee that the exodus, the  migration of the deficit hawks from Washington, D.C., during December  of 2017 will reverse in the warmer weather, coming back next year. And  those deficit hawks will come back, they will come back to Congress,  and they will go right after the programs that FDR talked about: those  who have the least.   Our colleague, Mr. DeFazio, from the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee talked about what we could do if we had the  money in infrastructure or if we had that billion dollars; 15,000  people would be employed. But we won't--we won't--have an  infrastructure program, and they will be back here.                                time  1815    They will be back here to make cuts in the social safety net, as the  Speaker has already said he intends to do. Medicaid, $800 billion to $1  trillion reduction in Medicaid over the next decade.   Who are the beneficiaries of Medicaid?   We think they are the people on welfare. Well, yes, but some 60  percent of Medicaid recipients are seniors, seniors in nursing homes  and long-term care facilities.   I thank Mr. Price very much for joining us.   I think I am going to stop for just a moment and turn to my colleague  from the great State of Maryland. If the gentleman would care to join  us, I yield to Mr. Raskin for his remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Raskin so very much for his  remarks. The voice of Maryland is strong and powerful and quite  correct. Mr. Raskin spoke of income inequality.   The wealthy in America, the top 1 percent, own as much wealth as the  bottom 90 percent?    Mr. Speaker, this bill would seem to further the  skewing of wealth to the wealthy.    Mr. Speaker, that is interesting. Perhaps the House of  Lords is in our future.   I was just thinking, as Mr. Raskin was talking, of an old comic book  that used to be popular. It was one of the Donald Duck comic books, and  I remember it was Uncle Scrooge McDuck. I guess, in his treasury, he  was playing with the dollars, throwing the coins up into the air. I am  wondering if that is what we are really into here.   The superwealthy are just accumulating more and more wealth. For the  benefit of the economy? Not really. It doesn't trickle down. There is  absolutely no evidence that it does. In fact, there is plenty of  historic economic evidence that trickle down doesn't work, but pushing  up from the bottom would. We could have had a tax bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Well, if their tax bill is for their donors, we have a  pretty good idea who the beneficiaries of the tax bill are. So the  donors are the plutocrats, the superwealthy. It is Wall Street. Very  much it is Wall Street because this is really about raising the stock  price.   I think Mr. Raskin may not have been here when I put this up, but I  am going to do it one more time. It has been clear that before the  1980s, 50 percent, maybe 55 percent, 60 percent of the after-tax income  of corporations went into creating a bigger corporation, into  manufacturing jobs, plant equipment, hiring more people, paying better  wages.    Beginning in the mid-1980s or so, that began to shift so that, today,  exactly the opposite occurs. Maybe 70, 80 percent of the after-tax  profits now go into buying back stock, increasing the stock price,  higher dividends.   Case in point: the corporate tax giveaway in this bill, which is  actually--I said earlier it was $1.4 trillion reduction in corporate  taxes over the next decade. It is actually $1.3 trillion. My apologies  for being incorrect.   $1.3 trillion reduction in corporate taxes. For a company like Wells  Fargo, a rather major bank, the corporate tax giveaway will give Wells  Fargo an 18 percent earnings increase.   How does Wells Fargo intend to spend it?   Not on jobs.   Here is what the CEO of Wells Fargo, Mr. Tim Sloan, said in December  of 2017. That is this month. He said: ``Is it our goal to increase  return to shareholders, and do we have an excess amount of capital? The  answer to both is `yes.' So our expectation should be that we will  continue to increase our  [[Page H10240]]  dividend and our share buybacks next year and the year after that and  the year after that.''   So where are the jobs?   May I cite one other example. Lowering the corporate tax rate was  said to be an incentive for corporations to invest. Well, here is one  of the great American corporations.   Are they investing?   I think not. They are buying back stock.   AT&T, another major American corporation, effectively reduced its tax  rate to 8 percent over the last decade. So they are paying not 21  percent, as this bill would require. They are paying 8 percent.   Did they create jobs?   No. During that same period of time, they laid off 80,000 workers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Raskin, if he would like to make a few  closing remarks, and then I will wrap up.                                time  1830     Mr. Speaker, they could be raising wages. I yield to  the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, they could be raising wages. I yield to  the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, from their own mouth comes from the truth  of what Mr. Raskin said. They have said it very clearly, they need to  do this for their contributors.   Who are their contributors? Well, the wealthy, the superwealthy, and  the rest.   Mr. Speaker, I think we are going to wrap it up here. I want to thank  Mr. Raskin for his participation. I want to thank my colleagues who  came to the floor tonight to express their dismay at what has happened.   Now, because the bill was rushed through without any public hearings,  there were errors in the bill that require that the Senate take the  approved conference committee report and modify it, which I suppose  means there has to be yet another conference committee, modify it,  remove the errors that are in conflict with the Senate rules, and send  it back here. Presumably, that will be done tomorrow.   Maybe now, as we bring to the attention of the American public the  way in which this tax bill is harmful to the economy, harmful to the  American middle class, and will result in 83 million Americans  immediately paying higher taxes, and over the period of time, everybody  that is less than $100,000, maybe $150,000, will be paying higher  taxes, but the wealthy and the corporations will go on and have their  lower taxes for many, many years to come, all of that hopefully will  begin to sink in on the American public, and they will rise up in  indignation and call a halt to what is a major rip-off of the American  Treasury and America's future.   So we will continue to talk about this in the days ahead, and those  who have voted for this are going to be held responsible and  accountable as the days and the months go by.   Keep in mind that the Texas Two-Step is very much in play, and that,  in the days ahead, in the next year, as the weather warms, the returned  migration of the deficit hawks will take place, and they will go after  Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, education, children's health, and  other programs that men and women of America rely upon, and perhaps  many, many more.   We will be fighting this fight for many months to come.   Mr. Speaker, keeping in mind the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,  I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
