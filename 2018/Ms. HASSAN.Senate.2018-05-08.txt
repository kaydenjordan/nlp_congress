 Mr. President, today I would like to honor the life of  U.S. Marine Corps First Sergeant David H. Quinn of Temple, NH.   In 1941, First Sergeant Quinn enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps  Reserves. He would train at Parris Island, SC, and Quantico, VA, before  being assigned to a newly created amphibious tractor battalion based in  Dunedin, FL, which was preparing for war in the Pacific Theater.   His unit brought him to San Diego, where he was promoted to first  sergeant, and eventually to New Zealand for further training in  amphibious assaults. It was there that he met Zoe Boeson, who was  working to become a nurse. David and Zoe were married on June 28, 1943,  just 4 months before his unit shipped out.   In 1943, with Company C, 2nd Amphibious Tractor Battalion of the 2nd  Marine Division, First Sergeant Quinn arrived on Betio in the Tarawa  Atoll as part of Operation Galvanic. The island was critical to the  U.S. island-hopping campaign and also to the Japanese, who used it as a  base for attacking U.S. Forces in the Central Pacific.   The marines successfully captured Betio, but 1,029 marines were  killed and approximately 2,700 men wounded on what came to be known as  bloody Tarawa. Among them was First Sergeant Quinn, who passed away on  November 20, 1943. Though he and his new bride, Zoe, had spent just 4  months together prior to his death, she later remarked that they  enjoyed more happiness in those 4 months than most people find in a  lifetime.   Like many others, First Sergeant Quinn's remains were unidentified  until 2016, when a DNA sample led to a positive match with his nieces.  On May 4, 2018, nearly 75 years after his death, First Sergeant Quinn  was reunited with his family and buried with full military honors back  home in Temple, NH.   Though this expression of gratitude is long overdue, we must never  miss an opportunity to thank those men and women in uniform who have  put their life on the line to keep us safe, secure, and free. We must  never forget their sacrifice.   I hope you will join me in honoring a brave Granite Stater, First  Sergeant David Quinn. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
