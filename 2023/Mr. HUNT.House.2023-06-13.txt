 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 495, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 44) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives  relating to ``Factoring Criteria for Firearms with Attached  `Stabilizing Braces' '', and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.J. Res. 44.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.J. Res. 44 provides for congressional disapproval for  the rule submitted by the Biden ATF relating to factoring criteria for  firearms with attached stabilizing braces.   On January 31, 2023, the ATF issued a final rule that effectively  bans pistol stabilizing braces nationwide. The ATF's rule redefined a  firearm with an attached stabilizing brace as a short-barreled rifle  subject to regulation under the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the  National Firearms Act of 1934.   Let's be clear about what is happening here today. With one stroke of  a pen, unelected bureaucrats in Biden's ATF changed regulatory  definitions that will turn millions of law-abiding citizens into felons  overnight. That is a fact.   If the owners of the roughly 40 million stabilizing braces in  circulation today do not obtain a special registration, surrender,  destroy their brace, or turn their brace in to the ATF by May 31, 2023,  they could now face criminal penalties up to 10 years in Federal  prison, with fines of up to $250,000.   This isn't happening because Congress passed a law or because a judge  issued a ruling. This is an example of the executive branch making law.  This is a Federal agency usurping the legislative authority that  Congress has under the Constitution.   Congressional Democrats couldn't pass a bill that outlawed pistol  stabilizing braces, so the Biden administration has utilized executive  fiat to achieve the desired outcome.   To make matters worse, the rule directly contradicts a prior 2012  determination made by the Obama ATF. President Obama's ATF said that a  firearm equipped with a stabilizing brace would not be subject to the  National Firearms Act controls. The ATF says one thing for a decade and  then does another which will then turn millions of law-abiding citizens  into felons literally overnight.   Now, American citizens who own these pistol stabilizing braces and  relied on the statements made by the ATF are in violation of Federal  law and are subject to serious criminal penalties.   The Second Amendment is imbued in the Bill of Rights for a reason. It  preserves the First Amendment and all other unalienable rights afforded  to the American people. We don't need to reimagine the Second  Amendment. We don't need to curtail it. We most certainly won't be  repealing it with a 28th amendment.   This ATF rule is an affront against the rights of the American  citizen and an assault on the Second Amendment, and it must be  defeated.  [[Page H2836]]    This resolution will nullify the ATF rule and further protect one of  our most basic rights and reclaim Congress' lawmaking authority given  to us by our Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a cost estimate for  H.J. Res. 44 prepared by the Congressional Budget Office.  H.J. RES. 44, A JOINT RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL UNDER CHAPTER 8 OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES CODE, OF THE RULE SUBMITTED BY   THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, FIREARMS, AND EXPLOSIVES RELATING TO ``FACTORING CRITERIA FOR FIREARMS WITH ATTACHED `STABILIZING BRACES' '',    AS REPORTED BY THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY ON MAY 17, 2023 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                            By fiscal year,  millions of                                                     dollars--                                         --------------------------------                                             2023    2023-2028  2023-2033 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)..............          0          0          0 Revenues...............................        -14       -243       -506 Increase or Decrease (-) in the Deficit         14        243        506 Spending Subject to Appropriation                *          *         **  (Outlays)............................. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ * = between zero and $500,000. ** = not estimated.

Increases on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive       10-year periods beginning in 2034? <$5 billion.        Mandate Effects:        Contains intergovernmental mandate? No.        Contains private-sector mandate? No.        H.J. Res. 44 would disapprove the final rule ``Factoring       Criteria for Firearms With Attached `Stabilizing Braces,' ''       which was submitted by the Department of Justice and took       effect on January 31, 2023, the day it was published in the       Federal Register. The resolution would invoke a legislative       process established by the Congressional Review Act to repeal       the final rule and prohibit the department from issuing the       same or a similar rule in the future.        The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives       (ATF) regulates firearms under the National Firearms Act of       1934 (NFA) and the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA). The NFA       requires certain guns, including short-barreled rifles, to be       licensed and registered with the ATF and subjects them to       various taxes, including a $200 tax on the transfer of those       weapons and on the production by anyone other than a       qualified manufacturer. The final rule reclassifies certain       firearms equipped with a stabilizing brace that allows the       user to fire from their shoulder as short-barreled rifles.       Thus, the owners and manufacturers of those weapons are       subject to taxation under the NFA. Disapproval of the final       rule would return those firearms to regulation under the GCA,       which does not require registration or transfer and       production taxes.        The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that       by disapproving the rule, H.J. Res. 44 would reduce revenues       by $506 million over the 2023-2033 period (see Table 1).

Components may not sum to totals because of rounding.         The Department of Justice would incur administrative costs       to undo the rule and revert to the previous regulations.       Based on the costs of similar activities, CBO estimates that       it would cost less than $500,000 over the 2023-2028 period to       implement H.J. Res. 44; any spending would be subject to the       availability of appropriated funds.        The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Jeremy Crimm       and Margot Berman. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel       Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.                                                  Phillip L. Swagel,                             Director, Congressional Budget Office.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Hudson).

[[Page H2840]]         Mr. Speaker, I am a Texan, I am a veteran, and I am a gun  owner. I am a gun owner of multiple AR-15s, primarily for hunting, and,  of course, to protect my three little kids at home, a 4-year-old, a 2- year-old, and a 5-month-old. No one is going to walk into my house and  harm my children or my wife--my family. That, I can assure you.   Mr. Speaker, 6 percent of all gun homicides are at the hands of an  AR-15 and weapons that are outfitted with a pistol brace--6 percent,  and 60 percent are at the hands of a handgun, and the rest are weapons  designated not as the two that I just mentioned--6 percent.   This is clearly an attempt to diminish our Second Amendment rights  because if you just take away 6 percent of the gun homicides, it leaves  you with 94, and I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that a homicidal maniac  who wants to arbitrarily murder people will find another weapon of  choice.   I hear the words weapon of war oftentimes, as well. I am an A-64  Delta Apache pilot. I flew 55 combat air missions in Baghdad. That is a  weapon of war. A civilian-made AR-15 is nothing that I would ever take  to battle.   Now, I also recognize that we do have a mass shooting problem in this  country, and my colleagues on the left want to, of course, blame the  AR-15. However, Mr. Speaker, I stand before you to blame the homicidal  maniac.   I walk in these Halls every single day, and I am surrounded by brave  men and women who carry AR-15s and weapons every single day. I have to  walk through a metal detector just to get in this building every single  day. Just because I wear this pin does not make me more important than  my children.   So what I offer is that instead of trying to erode our Second  Amendment rights, I would offer let's protect our kids. Let's ensure  that they have the same protection that we have in the Halls of  Congress.   There are over 400 million guns currently in circulation. By the way,  the overwhelming majority of the people who don't use weapons are law- abiding citizens like myself. I refuse to allow the erosion of our  Second Amendment rights to further disarm our population, making us  less safe as a further push toward communism, because that is what  happens.   When you disarm your population, then the government runs amok. We,  especially down in Texas, are not going to allow that to happen.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly encourage my colleagues to support this  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Donalds).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared  to close.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this resolution,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
