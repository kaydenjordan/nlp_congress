 Mr. Speaker, the January jobs report  with gains is terrific.   Over 225,000 jobs were created and wages increased. New job creation  has achieved a 50-year high with record highs for women and younger  citizens.   I am grateful that President Donald Trump and Republican policies  have put the American economy into high gear, reducing taxes and  regulations.  [[Page H1058]]  This first job report of the decade shows that America's economy will  continue to thrive in 2020, thanks to President Trump.   Following an acquittal after the impeachment hoax; providing a peace  plan for Israel; inspiring the Nation with the State of the Union  Address; providing new trade agreements with China, Mexico, and Canada;  and the announcement of Opportunity Now, this job report rounds out  another week of winning for President Donald Trump.   All Americans celebrate the lowest levels of unemployment ever for  African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
