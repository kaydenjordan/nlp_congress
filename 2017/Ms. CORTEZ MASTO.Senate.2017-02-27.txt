 Mr. President, I speak in unity with my colleagues  and highlight the irreparable harm that will be done to our environment  and communities now that Scott Pruitt has been confirmed to be the head  of the Environmental Protection Agency.   Mr. Pruitt has focused his career on working against the EPA's  fundamental mission of protecting our Nation's environment, instead  pushing an antienvironment agenda dictated by big corporations that  have funded his campaigns and political career.   Mr. Pruitt has been serving as Oklahoma's attorney general since  2010, during which he has spent countless hours working to undermine  and repudiate the very Agency he is nominated to run.   Throughout his tenure, Mr. Pruitt sued the EPA 14 times over orders  that seek to protect our environment and the health and safety of our  communities.   Included in Mr. Pruitt's lawsuits were efforts to undercut basic,  commonsense measures that are essential to Americans' health and  safety: EPA safeguards for clean air and clean water. Yes, Mr. Pruitt  supports undoing measures that ensure the air we breathe is not  polluted and the water we drink is free of contaminants.   And during his confirmation hearing, Mr. Pruitt contradicted his own  record and biography, calling into question his knowledge of basic  principles. Pruitt claimed he believes that the EPA has ``a very  valuable role.'' And yet his own LinkedIn profile brags that he is ``a  leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.''   Almost 4,000 Nevadans reached out to my office urging me to vote  against Mr. Pruitt.   I want to read some stories from Nevadans who voiced their concerns  about Mr. Pruitt and what is at stake for them--as well as countless  other families across the country.   From Jean Pierre LeBarry of Las Vegas, NV:         I am of Basque descent, as is my whole family. I grew up in       Northern Nevada, as many other Basque folks did, on a ranch.       We did not have running water or even electricity. We did       have our sheep though. We were sheep ranchers, across the       great state of Nevada the industry flourished, but before I       had heard Al Gore say anything about climate change, I saw       its effects in our state [Nevada]. We stopped getting as much       snowfall; we would scour the desert for water to keep our       herd alive on the range. Year after year it got worse, slowly       killing our industry, thinning our herd, and giving me first       hand example of how severe climate change is. This was more       than 30 years ago I saw these changes taking place. After I       left the ranch, I worked as a government employee for the       Bureau of Land Management, until I retired. To see how much       disregard Scott Pruitt would have for my family and their       struggles with the deterioration of our climate; it is       appalling that anyone would dare to confirm his nomination to       head the Environmental Protection Agency, the very agency he       has tried so hard to dismantle already.    From Sharon Ingram-Bevans of Reno, NV:         My Husband was a Vietnam Vet and he died last March after a       10 year illness directly related to environmental pollution.       He was stationed at Camp Le Juhen North Carolina, exposed to       drinking water full of jet fuel, and some great general's       idea to have young Marines scrape and repaint Agent Orange       boxes while serving in the Refugee camps at Okinawa Japan.       Our Daughter has Thyroid disease due to this exposure also.       If we only paid attention to how we use and dispose of       substances we might have a better world to give to our       children. There is no Planet ``B'' and even rich people need       clean air and water.    From Brittany Lamborn of Las Vegas, NV:         I was born and raised in Nevada. My sister, brother, and I       grew up in the Las Vegas valley, surrounded by majestic       mountain ranges, fragrant pines, and breathtaking sunsets.       Away from the glitz and glamour of the Strip, I could lose       myself in the beauty of Red Rock or walk the trails on Mt.       Charleston. My mom would take us to Gilcrease Orchard to pick       fresh produce. My dad would take us on stargazing trips to       Cathedral Gorge in Panaca. I have never wished for another       home. Home means Nevada.        Now I have two young children of my own. I put on a brave       face every morning so that they do not see my fear that       increases with each day. I fear that these God given wonders       will not be protected for them. I fear that the overwhelming       need to consume will eat up our natural resources. And I fear       that, unchecked, we will do irreparable harm to the only       planet we have. When the dust has cleared, I fear: What will       be left for our children?        Climate change is a fact, not a feeling or an opinion. We       need someone at the helm of the Environmental Protection       Agency that will protect every Gilcrease Orchard, every Red       Rock, and every Cathedral Gorge in the United States. Scott       Pruitt is not that man.    I know I am not the only Senator whose office was contacted by  countless constituents, urging us to put the health and safety of our  children and our environment first and oppose Mr. Pruitt's nomination.   I promised Nevadans I would come to Washington and fight for them and  their priorities, and that is why I could not support Mr. Pruitt to  lead the EPA. I urged my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do  the same.                            ____________________
