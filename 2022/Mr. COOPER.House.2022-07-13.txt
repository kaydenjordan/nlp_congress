 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 7900, the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023. Chairman Smith  and Ranking Member Rogers have put together an outstanding piece of  legislation.   I also thank my ranking member, Mr. Lamborn, for his tremendous  cooperation throughout the year and all the members of the Subcommittee  on Strategic Forces for their valuable contributions to the bill.   This bill strengthens our national security at a time when our  country is facing new and evolving threats in almost every theater.  This bill takes care of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and  guardians, and it invests in the tools that we need to protect  ourselves, our allies, and our partners, as well as to deter our  strategic competitors.   The Subcommittee on Strategic Forces has within its jurisdiction some  of the most technical, complex, and consequential issues involved in  our national security. At the top of that list are nuclear weapons. It  is absolutely essential that American nuclear forces and their command  and control infrastructure remain safe, secure, and reliable.   This bill makes certain that the Departments of Defense and Energy  are well positioned for the immense task of sustaining our legacy  forces while also recapitalizing our nuclear enterprise for the next 70  years.                                time  1515    This bill ensures that both Departments are pursuing balanced  approaches, emphasizing deterrence but also nonproliferation and arms  control. We must remain focused on the highest priority efforts and  realistic in our plans for future programs. Plutonium pit production is  a prime example of where greater realism is needed.   Regarding space, the subcommittee this year focused on the ability of  China and Russia to degrade and destroy our national security  satellites. This bill presses the Department to publicly release a  strategy on how they will defend our on-orbit assets. It also requires  the new Space Force to continue tactically responsive space efforts,  authorizes additional funds to do so, and encourages increased  competition within phase 3.   Please support H.R. 7900.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Foster  amendment.   Why?   To the average Member, this may sound complicated, but it is all  about nuclear testing. We need to stop North Korea and other nations  from doing nuclear testing, and if they do, then we need a trusted  international source to monitor exactly what they are doing.   It does not help us in America to be blind, and it does not help the  House of Representatives to blindly follow what the Senate does,  particularly Senate inaction, because the other body is notoriously  unable to conduct its work.   The important fact that Members need to know is: all of the heads of  our national labs say that we do not need to test. The heads of Sandia,  Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, and Oak Ridge certify annually. We do  not need to test, and we need to stop other nations who are trying to  test.   This amendment helps us stop those other nations. This amendment  helps us stop North Korea. This amendment helps us stop other rogue  nations and major powers like China and Russia from testing.   Mr. Speaker, let's support the Foster amendment, and let's keep  America strong. This is a very important principle for us to stand up  for, and I thank Mr. Foster for offering this important amendment.
