 Mr. Speaker, almost exactly a year ago, on August 10,  2022, President Joe Biden signed into law the Honoring our PACT Act,  which has been correctly described as the largest healthcare and  benefits expansion in the history of the Department of Veterans  Affairs.   This was the result of a 5-year effort by veterans service  organizations, from The American Legion to the Iraq and Afghan Veterans  of America, and many others, to bring external pressure on Congress to  pass a measure which will knock down barriers so that people who are  suffering the ill effects of toxic exposure will actually have the care  they earned by wearing the uniform of this country and serving in some  of the most difficult parts of the world.   After that measure was signed and had to overcome a last-minute  filibuster by Senate Republicans, which resulted in a 5-day sleep-in on  the steps of the Capitol when they finally relented and allowed a  bipartisan vote to move forward and the bill to the President's desk,  there was a lot of concern as to whether or not the VA would actually  move quickly to enact and implement these measures.   A year into the law, I am happy to report that over 300,000 PACT Act  claims have been approved; over 100,000 new veterans have been enrolled  in VA healthcare from the PACT Act planning population; and over 4  million toxic exposure screenings have been provided.   The toxic exposure screening is a quick 10- to 15-minute review to  find people who may be eligible for PACT Act benefits. It is open to  all veterans, if anyone is listening, not just veterans who are  enrolled in the VA. All veterans are entitled to have a toxic exposure  screening.   The questions asked are whether or not you were exposed to open burn  pits in the Middle East, Gulf war-related exposures, Agent Orange  during the Vietnam war, radiation, contaminated water at Camp Lejeune,  or other exposures.   In my district, the Second Congressional District, over 1,000  veterans have filed PACT Act claims, and many have been successful in  terms of getting their claims approved.   One gentleman who served during the Vietnam war was in Thailand and  had Agent Orange illnesses, but because the law prior to the Honoring  our PACT Act only covered people who were actually in-country in  Vietnam, he was denied coverage. He was successful in getting a 100  percent disability approved.    Another gentleman who served in Guam, another new country that was  added to the law because of the Honoring our PACT Act, was also able to  get a 100 percent disability with a backpay award.   This is real. It is happening in real time. Ten days ago, we held a  PACT Act claims clinic where staff from the local veterans department  showed up to screen and also present claims. It was supposed to be only  3 hours. It went way over time. Two hundred veterans were screened, and  75 claims were submitted right there on the spot.   I will end, Mr. Speaker, by saying people should be aware of the fact  that, on August 9, which is just days away, if someone files an intent  for a claim or a claim, you are going to be entitled to a backpay award  to the date that President Biden signed this measure into law. Any  claims filed after August 9 will not be entitled to that backpay award.   Claims will still be open and can be approved by the Department of  Veterans Affairs, but in terms of getting that backpay award from the  date of enactment, it is critical that people file either an intent to  file a claim or a claim itself to be eligible for those benefits.   If people have questions, they can go to VA.gov/PACT to answer any of  those questions.   This was a great effort that was the result of a grassroots push by  veterans all across our country. We must make sure that every single  veteran gets the benefits that the law opened the door to.                            ____________________
