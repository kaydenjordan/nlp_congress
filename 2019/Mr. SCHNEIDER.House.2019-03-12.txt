 Madam Speaker, no American should face legal  discrimination because of who they are or who they love.   As a Nation, we have made stunning progress toward realizing this  dream of full equality and acceptance for our LGBTQ family, friends,  and neighbors. But despite our success, including repealing Don't Ask,  Don't Tell and achieving marriage equality as the law of the land,  there is more work to do.   In many States across this country, LGBTQ individuals remain  vulnerable to discrimination, with little recourse. Unlike other groups  protected by civil rights laws, LGBTQ Americans can be fired from their  jobs, evicted from their apartments, or refused service at  [[Page H2655]]  a restaurant simply because of who they are.   The current patchwork of State laws is not enough.   That is why I am proud to join with my colleagues to again introduce  the Equality Act to ensure protections already extended to other  protected classes are equally available to LGBTQ Americans.   It is time we prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual  orientation and gender identity in education, employment, housing,  credit, Federal jury service, public accommodations, and the use of  Federal funds.   Let's make full equality a reality for all of us.                            ____________________
