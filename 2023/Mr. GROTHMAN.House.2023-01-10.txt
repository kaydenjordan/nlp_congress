 Mr. Speaker, the population ought to be aware of the  fact that very late in the last month the administration released the  new figures on what we will call legal immigrants crossing into this  country. This was before there were any changes in title 42, and a lot  of the focus lately has been on title 42.   We had another all-time record in November with 210,000 people  crossing the border and staying here. This is a national scandal. Just  making a brief appearance at the border shouldn't get Joe Biden off the  hook. 210,000. By comparison, a year ago, it was 140,000. Two years ago  it was under 25,000. When you are going under 25,000 to 210,000, that  should be the headline in every paper of the country, and I don't care  whether you release the numbers late in the day on a Friday or not.   I hope this institution does all we can to pick up the mantle that  President Biden has dropped and do something about the massive increase  in illegal immigration.                            ____________________
