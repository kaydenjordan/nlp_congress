 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk a big game about  deficit reduction. They used the same parliamentary procedure, budget  reconciliation, when they were in power and in control of this  majority, and they blew a $2 trillion hole in the deficit.   House Democrats here today, putting people over politics, have put a  bill on the floor that would reduce the deficit by billions of dollars.  Apparently, that is not enough for my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle.   This bill will lower costs. It will create better-paying jobs for the  American people, and it will invest in climate action and the  existential threat of our time facing my constituents in Colorado.   Since 1982, Colorado has experienced natural disaster after natural  disaster that has cost our State over $55 billion, including the most  destructive fire in the history of my State just this past December.   It is time for us to take this climate crisis seriously. That is  exactly what this bill does, through investments in R&D, through  investments in energy storage and battery technology, and so much more  to enable our transition to a clean energy future.   I am proud to support this bill because I believe it delivers for the  American people. Mr. Speaker, I certainly urge my colleagues to support  it, as well.
