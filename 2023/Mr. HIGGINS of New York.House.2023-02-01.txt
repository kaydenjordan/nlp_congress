 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the  incredible life and service of World War II veteran Paul Woods.   Mr. Woods joined the United States Army in 1941. During the war, he  bravely fought for America's freedoms abroad and racism at home.   Mr. Woods is known to say: ``A bullet knows no race, rank, or status.  We were all brothers on the battlefield.''   On February 20, Mr. Woods will celebrate his 100th birthday. It is my  honor to celebrate this American hero and to thank him for his selfless  service on behalf of a grateful Nation.                            ____________________
