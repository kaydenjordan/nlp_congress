 Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to stand here today as we  work to pass gun violence prevention legislation.   I would like to share a letter from a fifth grader constituent of  mine, Alex, from Northfield, Illinois, that perfectly explains why we  must pass H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112.   Alex writes: ``I don't want to see innocent people dying for no  reason. I want all children to feel safe at school. I want all adults  to feel safe at work. I want all people to feel safe in their city. I  think stronger gun laws will help and also make sure that everyone that  buys a gun has to have a thorough background check.''   Well, Alex, you are absolutely right, and we are about to finally  ensure that everyone who purchases a gun undergoes a comprehensive  background check. The next step is banning assault weapons.   This fifth grader and students around the country are telling us to  do something real to make them safer, and finally, at long last, the  House of Representatives will take action today.                            ____________________
