 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 132) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to  convey certain land and appurtenances of the Arbuckle Project,  Oklahoma, to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 132         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Arbuckle Project Maintenance       Complex and District Office Conveyance Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE OF MAINTENANCE COMPLEX AND DISTRICT OFFICE                     OF THE ARBUCKLE PROJECT, OKLAHOMA.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior shall, as       soon as practicable, convey to the Arbuckle Master       Conservancy District, located in Murray County, Oklahoma, all       right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the       Maintenance Complex and District Office, Arbuckle Project,       Oklahoma, consistent with the terms and conditions set forth       in the Agreement between the United States and the Arbuckle       Master Conservancy District.        (b) Definitions.--        (1) Agreement.--The term ``Agreement'' means the Agreement       between the United States and the Arbuckle Master Conservancy       District for Transferring Title to the Federally Owned       Maintenance Complex and District Office to the Arbuckle       Master Conservancy District (Agreement No. 14AG640141).        (2) District office.--The term ``District Office'' means       the headquarters building located at 2440 East Main, Davis,       Oklahoma, and the approximately 0.83 acres described in the       Agreement.        (3) Maintenance complex.--The term ``Maintenance Complex''       means the caretakers residence, shop buildings, and any       appurtenances located on the lands described in the       Agreement, to include approximately 2.00 acres, more or less.        (c) Liability.--Effective upon the date of conveyance of       the Maintenance Complex and District Office under this       section, the United States shall not be held liable by any       court for damages of any kind arising out of any act,       omission, or occurrence relating to the Maintenance Complex       and District Office, except for damages caused by acts of       negligence committed by the United States or by its employees       or agents prior to the date of conveyance. Nothing in this       section increases the liability of the United States beyond       that provided in chapter 171 of title 28, United States Code       (popularly known as the ``Federal Tort Claims Act''), on the       date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Benefits.--After conveyance of the Maintenance Complex       and District Office to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy       District--        (1) the Maintenance Complex and District Office shall not       be considered to be a part of a Federal reclamation project;       and        (2) such water district shall not be eligible to receive       any benefits with respect to any facility comprising that       Maintenance Complex and District Office, except benefits that       would be available to a similarly situated person with       respect to such a facility that is not part of a Federal       reclamation project.        (e) Communication.--If the Secretary of the Interior has       not completed the conveyance required under subsection (a)       within 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the       Secretary shall submit to Congress a letter with sufficient       detail that explains the reasons the conveyance has not been       completed and stating the date by which the conveyance will       be completed.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise an extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   H.R. 132, sponsored by Congressman Tom Cole of Oklahoma, conveys two  buildings and two acres of land of the Federal Arbuckle Project to the  Arbuckle Master Conservancy District, Oklahoma. The district has  operated and maintained the project for decades, and completed  repayment of its capital costs for the project in 2012.   While noncontroversial, legislation is necessary in order to  facilitate this and other Bureau of Reclamation title transfers. Under  current law, these buildings and land remain in Federal ownership until  legislation is enacted to transfer the title to the district. Mr.  Cole's bill achieves this objective.   This title transfer is a win-win for the district and for the Federal  Government. The district will no longer be subject to certain Federal  paperwork requirements, and the Federal Government will be relieved of  all future liability and financial responsibilities associated with  these facilities and land.   I urge the adoption of this measure, which overwhelmingly passed the  House on a bipartisan basis in the last Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).
