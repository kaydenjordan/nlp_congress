 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight with my colleagues to  speak about the important issue of border security.   We are in the midst of a crisis on our southern border, and it is  time for our colleagues across the aisle to stop playing politics and  to start focusing on our national security.   While Washington Democrats toe the party line and oppose President  Trump and anything he supports, our Nation is under assault from  unchecked illegal immigration, from terrorists, from human traffickers,  and from drug smugglers.   Sadly, as West Virginia and the Nation are battling an opioid  epidemic,  [[Page H539]]  the Democrats continue to turn a blind eye.   In the last year alone, the amount of fentanyl and heroin confiscated  at our southern border was enough to kill every man, woman, and child  in the United States.   The security of our Nation rests with a strong border. We need to  build this wall.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the opportunity to discuss  this important issue.
