 I thank Senator Grassley. The Senator's question really cuts  to the heart of the issue. It cuts to the heart of the very reasons why  we have an independent judiciary and exactly why it is that our system  of government that operates under the U.S. Constitution depends so  critically on individuals just like Judge Gorsuch. It depends on people  like Judge Gorsuch sitting on the Federal bench.   There are, I believe, two fundamental differences between the  judiciary on the one hand and the two political branches on the other  hand; that is, the two branches in which people serve after being  elected to office, meaning the legislative branch where we work, and  the executive branch headed by the President.   First, the legislative and executive powers sweep far more broadly  than does the judicial power. Article I enumerates a list of lawmaking  powers that are granted to Congress, and article II vests executive  power in the President. By comparison, the judiciary's power is far  more circumscribed. It is far more limited.   The judiciary has the power to decide only a limited and defined set  of disputes--those that qualify as cases and controversies under  article III of the Constitution. To be clear, in the context of  deciding a particular case, the judiciary has the power to invalidate  an act put in place by the elected branches of government--the power to  say what the law is, as Chief Justice John Marshall explained it in the  landmark case Marbury v. Madison.   But that power is limited. It is limited, among other things, by  article III of the Constitution and by jurisdictional requirements like  standing and mootness and ripeness as explained in greater detail by  Supreme Court precedent.   The judiciary's authority to say what the law is points to the second  major difference between the courts on the one hand and the political  branches on the other. While the function of the judiciary is an  exercise in reasoned judgment, the functions of the executive and  legislative branches are exercises of power.   There are many ways in which the Constitution and the political  theory underlying it limit the exercise of that power. The Constitution  protects minority rights, and it conditions the exercise of legislative  or executive power on winning elections, and that, in turn, means  winning the trust of the American people--of the voters throughout the  country.   These twin ideas--the consent of the governed and the protection of  minority rights within an essentially majority-rule system--are pillars  of our constitutional order. But make no mistake, coercion underlies  the laws that we make in this body and their enforcement by the  executive branch.   By contrast, the judicial function is ultimately an exercise in  reasoned judgment. As Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 78:  ``neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment'' are exercised by the  judiciary. This is the essential difference between the judiciary and  the other branches: The judiciary exercises judgment while all the rest  of us exercise will.   The Framers, of course, understood this well. And as Hamilton  continued in his explanation of Federalist 78:         Courts must declare the sense of the law, and if they       should be disposed to exercise Will instead of Judgment, the       consequence would equally be the substitution of their       pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if       it proves anything, would prove that there ought to be no       judges distinct from that body.    Put another way, a judge who chooses to exercise will instead of  judgment is no longer acting as a judge. That person is instead  functioning essentially as a superlegislator.   It should be clear to all fair-minded people that Judge Gorsuch is  someone--and has established himself as someone--who understands these  distinctive features of the Federal judiciary. When you read his  opinions, you see that his only agenda is to understand the governing  law and then to apply that law to the set of facts in the case before  him.   As we will see next week during his confirmation hearings, his  opinions carefully analyze the statutes and applicable precedents to  determine the outcome of each and every case. In some cases, that means  Judge Gorsuch reaches results that Senator Gorsuch or President Gorsuch  or King Gorsuch probably wouldn't choose, were he deciding cases in any  of those capacities. But Judge Gorsuch understands, of course, that he  is a judge and not a king and not a President, not a Senator, not a  Congressman, and he understands that this means his only job is to  adjudicate cases based on the law according to the facts before him. As  he said the night he was nominated: ``A judge who likes every outcome  he reaches is very likely a bad judge--stretching for results he  prefers rather than those the law demands.''   When you examine his record, you see that one of the defining  characteristics of Judge Gorsuch is his independence--his judicial  independence. That is distinctively the hallmark of a good judge. You  see that he decides cases based on the law, not based on the parties  before him and not based on his own political or ideological  preferences.   In the coming weeks, some of our colleagues may try to argue that  Judge Gorsuch hasn't done enough to prove his independence since being  nominated to the Supreme Court. If this criticism is raised against  him, it will be a weak one. It will be one that doesn't apply here. The  fact is that Judge Gorsuch has spent his entire career as a judge, and  as a lawyer before that, proving his independence.   To his would-be critics, I would say, read and analyze his opinions.  They speak for him. They speak for themselves. They speak for the rule  of law. Study his approach to judging. Listen to what he says about  judicial independence and, just as importantly, look at his actions.  His actions prove his independence.   I have done these things. I have examined Judge Gorsuch's record. And  on that basis, I am confident that he will not hesitate to apply the  law appropriately in every case. There is absolutely no reason--no  reason that I can find anywhere in his record--to prove otherwise.   I think I have only scratched the surface here today. I look forward  to hearing Judge Gorsuch's testimony before the Judiciary Committee  next week.
