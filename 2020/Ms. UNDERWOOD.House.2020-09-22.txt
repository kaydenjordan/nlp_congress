 Madam Speaker, I rise today in solemn recognition of  the grave milestone our Nation soon will be reaching: 200,000 lives  lost to the COVID-19 pandemic--among them, 8,457 Illinoisans.   They were our nurses and doctors, our heroes on the front lines of  the fight against this virus.   They were our grandparents who were forced to spend their final  moments alone.   They were our essential workers, our vulnerable neighbors, our  closest friends.   Their families have been devastated with grief, made worse by the  painful reality that we cannot gather safely to mourn our losses  together.   To every American who has lost someone to the coronavirus, I extend  my deepest condolences, and I grieve with you.   I commit to you that I will continue to honor the lives lost with  action through making investments in health and our economy to ensure  that America recovers from COVID-19 stronger than ever.                            ____________________
