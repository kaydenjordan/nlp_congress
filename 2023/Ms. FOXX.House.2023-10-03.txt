 Madam Speaker, medical education based on competency and  merit is necessary to lead the world in healthcare and medical  innovation.   Americans sign up for a healthcare system free of racial  discrimination. Medical schools must instill this fundamental precept  in our country's future healthcare professionals.   That is why the Education and the Workforce Committee pressed the  Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the medical school accreditor,  on its diversity, equity, and inclusion standards for applicants and  its mandate for diversity.   LCME responded to the committee inquiry and publicly clarified that  accredited medical schools will not treat applicants differently on the  basis of race. With lives on the line, racial discrimination must play  no part in our Nation's healthcare system.   The committee will continue to push for merit-based education  standards for all professions in the American workforce.                            ____________________
