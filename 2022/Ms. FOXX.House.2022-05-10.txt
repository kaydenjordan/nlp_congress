 Mr. Speaker, in honor of National Charter School Week, I am  here to talk about the importance of school choice.   Families should be empowered to find the best learning environments  for their children instead of being forced into failing public schools  that may not meet their child's needs.   Piedmont Community Charter School, located in Gaston County, North  Carolina, is an amazing example of a school that puts students first.  This school isn't afraid to hold its students to a high standard or to  provide a challenging curriculum.   Schools like Piedmont should inspire us all to renew and strengthen  our support for education freedom. Instead of trapping children in a  race to the bottom, charter schools like Piedmont are pushing students  to the top. More options mean more successful students.   Happy National Charter School Week.                            ____________________
