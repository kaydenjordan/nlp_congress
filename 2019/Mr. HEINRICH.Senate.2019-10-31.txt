 Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I remember  and recognize the life of former U.S. Senator Kay Hagan of North  Carolina.   I am grateful that I had the privilege to serve with Senator Hagan  here in the United States Senate. Her approach to her job was something  we would all do well to learn from. Kay was a model of civility,  optimism, and selfless service to the State she loved.   Early in her life, Kay served as a Capitol Hill intern for her uncle,  Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida. Her duties included operating the  Senators-only elevator. In time, she would go on to prove that she  belonged on that elevator, too.   After 10 years in the North Carolina Senate, she won election to the  United States Senate and served her home State with dignity. Even in  the face of one of the most expensive and challenging election  campaigns in this body's history, Senator Hagan remained focused first  and foremost on how to find common ground in this Chamber and the ways  she could deliver for her constituents in North Carolina.   I am particularly grateful for the model that Senator Hagan set as  the cochair of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus. In that role, she  worked hard to forge bipartisan consensus around a comprehensive  package of bills to increase public access for hunting and fishing and  to extend important fish and wildlife conservation programs.   Julie and I are keeping her husband, Chip; their three children,  Jeanette, Tilden, and Carrie; and all of their grandchildren in our  hearts. We will all miss Kay.    Mr. President, it is an honor to recognize the years of  dedication and service of my friend and departing chief of staff,  Joseph R. Britton.   Joe has served as my chief of staff for more than 4 years and has  managed my Senate office in a professional and purposeful manner. He  has overseen my team with incredible leadership and has consistently  motivated us all to work hard and make a difference for New Mexicans  each and every day.   Joe's career on Capitol Hill began in 2003, when he served as a  legislative assistant for U.S. Senator Ben Nelson from his home State  of Nebraska. He then served as legislative director and deputy chief of  staff in the office of U.S. Senator Mark Udall. He also served as a  senior adviser to former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack  before coming to my office in 2015. He brought with him passion and  expertise in healthcare, public lands, budget, and appropriations  policy.   As chief of staff, Joe has led both our Washington, DC, and New  Mexico offices in Albuquerque, Roswell, Las Cruces, Farmington, and  Santa Fe. Joe visited every corner of our State. It is a testament to  his dedication to maintaining strong working relationships that New  Mexicans know that they can count on our office to be reliable,  accessible, and in their corner. Joe took the time to learn about New  Mexico and understand our rich history, our thriving culture, and the  complex, pressing issues we face in the Land of Enchantment. Throughout  his service, Joe has shared my mission and drive to solve problems and  find ways to make a difference for New Mexicans.  [[Page S6330]]    I recognize that Joe couldn't be where he is or who he is today  without the love and support of his family. For her support of him and  constant dedication, I thank his wife, Katie. I would also like to  recognize Joe and Katie's children, Louise and Jamey, for lighting up  their parent's lives. We all look forward to seeing them grow up in the  years ahead.   On behalf of the American people, the people of the State of New  Mexico, and on behalf of my team that Joe has so ably led for the past  4 years, I thank him for his service. While I am sad to see him go, I  know that he will continue to make a difference in the lives of  everyone he meets. Joe has been doing that from his first day on  Capitol Hill.   I ask my colleagues in the United States Senate to join me in  recognizing the dedicated service of my chief of staff, Joseph R.  Britton.                            ____________________
