 Mr. Chair, I rise with my Joint Economic Committee  Democratic colleagues to address the terrible effects that the  Republican budget will have on this country's health.   I listened with rapt astonishment to Speaker Ryan's recitation of the  percentage increases in the premium costs for insurance, for insurers  on the Obama exchanges. But the Speaker omitted important facts.   Number one, more than 80 percent of ObamaCare customers get subsidies  to help them pay the cost of these premiums. They do not pay the full  cost and will not feel the brunt of these increases.   Number two, these increases are uneven. Yes, Arizona is up, but Rhode  Island will decrease 14 percent. The Speaker cherry-picked the highest  ones, omitting the overall increase.   But most importantly, number three, most people are unaffected  because most people get their insurance through their employer,  Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA. Only a small fraction of Americans  actually buy insurance on the individual market. Premiums, for the  average single person through the employer market last year, were  exactly the same as those for families; only up 3 percent.   As an employer myself who offers health insurance to more than 300  people, and someone who is very concerned about the debt, my great  concern is that the Republicans seem willing to throw out our total  commitment to managing our debt for this repeal.  [[Page H507]]    I have listened to my friends in the Freedom Caucus lament about our  national debt and together we have made significant progress on the  budget deficits.   But blowing up ObamaCare will blow up our national debt, the most  fiscally irresponsible act since we waged two wars without paying for  them.   A study by the Commonwealth Fund projects that repealing ObamaCare  will cause the State of Virginia to lose up to 100,000 jobs and $50  billion in business output.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this most fiscally  irresponsible plan.
