 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, some of our Nation's finest answered the call  of duty here in our Nation's Capitol over the last 2 weeks to assist  with the peaceful transition of power and make sure that it was in fact  peaceful. These dedicated men and women in the National Guard have  taken an oath to protect that bedrock document, the Constitution of the  United States, and, indeed, they have fulfilled that duty.   Some of our very finest in the National Guard came here to serve from  my home State of Utah; 321 troops that have discharged their duties  with distinction and honor came from the Utah National Guard.   The majority of Task Force Utah consisted of soldiers from the 2nd  Battalion, 222nd Field Artillery, 65th Fires Brigade, also known as  Triple Deuce. Additional soldiers came from 204th Maneuver Enhancement  Brigade and the 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne).   I rise today to honor and thank these really selfless women and men.  These past weeks, the Utah guardsmen were stationed at the Madison  Building of the Library of Congress, just across the street from the  Capitol. For many of these soldiers, it was their first time ever  visiting Washington, D.C.   Major Brent Mangum of the Utah National Guard remarked that as the  soldiers were stationed at buildings, they saw these quotes on the  walls--quotes from our Founding Fathers--and as they were working in  these buildings, you could see them pausing during the day, reading the  quotes, and then stopping to reflect on them.   I, myself, had the great privilege, in a couple of different groups,  to give some of these men and women a tour of the Capitol Building  before they left to go back to Utah. It was a great honor to meet and  get to know these dedicated guardsmen and to learn from their stories  and to see firsthand their caliber as people and, most importantly  perhaps, their visible commitment to the United States of America.   This idea, this principle, in this great land of ours--the greatest  civilization human history has ever known--was something that they are  independently committed to defending and protecting, even at the  sacrifice of their own security and their own ease, which they would  have otherwise enjoyed over the last couple of weeks.   One of the most remarkable things about these citizen soldiers is the  way in which they tirelessly serve their communities, and I say that  meaning both inside and outside of their Guard duty.   My Salt Lake City office was lucky enough to have one of these fine  young soldiers, Alfredo Lopez, as an intern a few years ago.   Alfredo immigrated with his family from Peru at the age of 10, and  they began to build a life here in the United States. In addition to  serving the people of Utah in my State office, he also was on Active  Duty with the Marine Corps before he joined the National Guard.  Alfredo, in all of his endeavors in our country, has sought only to  give back. He is grateful for this country and wants to make sure it is  a strong, safe, and secure place in which to live.   Another guardsman who was here, Jay Bartholomew, is a prison guard at  the Gunnison prison in Sanpete County, UT. He is the son of my friend  Scott Bartholomew, a county commissioner in Sanpete County. Jay has  followed in his family's footsteps to serve his local community.   Other guardsmen in Utah are engaged in their communities in all sorts  of ways. Some are teachers, some are firefighters, some are policemen,  and some are medical professionals. You name it; they have done it.   Many have now answered the call of duty on the frontlines of another  crisis as our Nation faces the current pandemic. These guardsmen have  played a significant role in providing testing, moving and storing  personal protective equipment, and other support missions to assist  Utah's Department of Health COVID-19 response.   Now, Utah Governor Spencer Cox has entrusted them with another  critical mission. The Guard will be on the frontlines to help ramp up  the delivery of vaccines to our State. The Guard has put together teams  that can mobilize throughout Utah to deliver vaccinations and antibody  infusions within a matter of hours and save a whole lot of lives and  prevent a whole lot of suffering in the process.   I have no doubt that they will continue to administer this duty with  dedication and with excellence, just as they do with every other  assignment with which they are tasked. In everything they do, members  of the Utah National Guard seek to serve and strengthen our  communities, our country, and our State, and we are all better off for  it.   It has been such an honor to have these selfless men and women in our  Nation's Capitol. I have enjoyed getting to know them and look forward  to visiting again with them soon, and I thank them for their service                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, I would like to discuss another  important matter. This past week, we marked the anniversary of a deadly  day in American history. It has resulted in the loss of millions of  innocent American lives. That is the anniversary of Roe v. Wade.   Since January 22, 1973, more than 60 million unborn children have  been lost to the scourge of abortion. This week, we honor and remember  those lives, as well as those who have been hurt by the pains of  abortion.   In a normal year, tens of thousands of Americans would be marching  down Constitution Avenue this Friday to do so. This year, as with so  many other things, the March for Life will instead be virtual. But,  nonetheless, Americans will continue to march, whether virtually or in  person where they can.   The theme of this year's march is ``Together Strong: Life Unites!''-- a fitting theme following a year ripe with division, violence, and  loss. Now, more than ever, we must unite as a nation, turning with hope  toward the future--hope that our Nation will heal, hope that justice  will prevail, and hope that the grievous act of abortion will be  forsaken. Given our country's history, in which we have stubbornly made  mistakes but, thankfully, have come around in the end, there is much  reason for hope. But we cannot heal and we cannot unite if we don't  honor and respect all of the American people, born and unborn.   So many of the deepest injustices in our country's history stem from  one dark dangerous thing; that is, when we have rejected the dignity of  the human person, when we have denied the humanity of our brothers and  sisters, when we have discriminated against others based on the way  they look, think, love, or worship, and when, because of that, we have  looked at them not as people but as things and as mere objects to be  acted upon.   As abolitionist William Lord Garrison put it, the worst kind of  oppression to be regarded with the greatest degree of indignation and  abhorrence is ``that which turns a man into a thing.''   Now, we have discriminated against a whole class of people not based  on the color of their skin but on their age and development.   But it doesn't change the truth. The truth is that a baby inside the  womb can respond to human touch by the age of 8 weeks and feel pain by  the age of 20 weeks--who can recognize her mother's voice even before  she is born; who has a perfect little nose, fingernails, and a beating,  fully functioning heart, her own distinct unique DNA, and her own  unique unrepeatable soul.   Science and medicine are only confirming what we know deep down, that  unborn human beings are in fact little  [[Page S146]]  persons. The evidence is only getting plainer by the day.   When we deny the humanity of our brothers and sisters, as we have  seen throughout our history and over the past year, the inevitable and  tragic result is violence. Abortion does undeniable violence to the  baby and undeniable violence to the mother. Thankfully, looking back at  the past decade, we have made significant strides toward building a  culture that respects, values, and even protects all human life, even  in its simplest, earliest stages of development.   Many States have ensured that public funds are directed toward  pregnancy health centers, rather than abortion facilities, providing  life-affirming alternatives to families in need. And in just the last  decade alone, States have passed more than 400 pro-life laws--more than  one-third of all pro-life laws that States have passed since Roe v.  Wade was decided. This is indeed reason for hope.   Through our laws and with our lives, we ought to affirm the truth  that the lives of both the mother and the baby matter and that  healthcare should heal, protect, and preserve both of those lives.   I have introduced legislation to help our laws affirm that very  truth. Through my bill, the Abortion Is Not Healthcare Act, we have a  chance to stop the tax deductibility of abortions, which are currently  categorized as ``medical care'' by the IRS, because we must be serious:  Whatever else it may be, of course, elective abortion is not  healthcare. That is why physicians literally take an oath to do no  harm. The government should not offer tax benefits for a procedure that  kills hundreds of thousands of unborn children each and every year.   We also have the chance to prematurely stop the use of American  foreign aid--the opportunity permanently to stop the use of American  foreign aid--from funding or promoting abortions overseas and  perpetuating violence against women and of children abroad, especially  baby girls.   The Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act will save countless  lives across the globe, and it affirms the truth that the lives of all  unborn children, regardless of where they are from, have dignity and  worth.   As the lyrics of a children's song in my church--a song that I sang  in Sunday school as a child--say about each one of us, I am a child of  God. We are all one human family, all children of God--these littlest  among us, too, who cannot yet sing for themselves, but they will soon.  They will soon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
