 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As a businessman, I know firsthand the power of small businesses as a  driver of economic growth, not just for the owners but for the 60  million small business employees in the United States.   While the underlying bill makes the playing field fairer for American  workers, my amendment clarifies that the National Labor Relations Board  jurisdictional standards for small businesses remain consistent,  ensuring small businesses have the stability they need to develop long- term business plans.   The NLRB uses businesses' gross annual volume to determine whether a  company is subject to its standards, with different thresholds for  different types of businesses. My amendment ensures existing thresholds  do not change.   Madam Chair, we cannot keep shifting the goalposts for millions of  Americans. Small businesses need stability to strategize and  consistency to create jobs.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support small  businesses across America and adopt this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Chair, once again, I reiterate the previous comments  that this bill and the supporting amendments deserve the bipartisan  support that we have already seen. I encourage Members across the aisle  to reconsider those ideas and support the passage of this bill.   Madam Chair, if the gentlewoman is ready to close, I am as well, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
