 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 771.   I firmly stand with Israel in the face of terrorism from Hamas.   When I visited Israel in August, I saw how they were surrounded by  threats. Now, those threats have come true in the most violent and  terrible possible way.   Let me be clear, our goal is the eradication of terrorists and  terrorism from the face of this Earth.   We call on and expect the Israeli army to try to minimize civilian  casualties. We should make every reasonable effort to protect innocent  Palestinians, but there can be no cease-fire until Hamas releases all  hostages, stops its rocket attacks, and surrenders the leaders of the  terrorist attack.
