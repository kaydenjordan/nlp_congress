 Mr. Speaker, I rise because it is Women's History Month.   I rise because I returned from Michigan on the heels of a Women's  History Month event that I held yesterday in Farmington Hills, where I  looked the women of my district in the face and promised them that I  would return to the House of Representatives to seek to enshrine their  rights into law.   Mr. Speaker, I rise because in the second year of this pandemic,  maternal mortality increased by 40 percent, and in the following year,  the Supreme Court repealed Roe v. Wade.   I rise because four women in Texas are suing for their right to  bodily autonomy. Women are standing up and saying that they do not want  to be subject to sepsis while trying to give birth to a child.   I rise because, in South Carolina, women will be prosecuted to a  deeper extent than a rapist.   Mr. Speaker, I rise because I will not stop until we have enshrined  women's rights into the law of this land.                            ____________________
