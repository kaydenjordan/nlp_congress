 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into  the Record the names of my staff who worked tirelessly to serve the  constituents of Massachusetts and to pass the Inflation Reduction Act.  Many of these staffers stayed up late into the night on Saturday,  August 5, 2022, and into the next day on Sunday, August 6, 2022, in  order to secure the passage of this transformative piece of  legislation.   As I told my team in the hours after the bill passed the Senate, we  made history today. There are tremendous policy achievements in this  legislation: a plan to cut carbon emissions by 40 percent over the next  8 years, capped spending on prescription drugs for seniors and  finally--finally--authorizing Medicare to negotiate some drug prices.  For the first time in 30 years, we have raised corporate taxes for  behemoth corporations. Policy is my love language, but that is because  all this wonkiness is ultimately about people--little kids who have  fewer asthma attacks and older people who don't have to choose between  filling a prescription and having a meal and maybe a breakthrough that  means both our democracy and our earth will survive. Making these kinds  of changes is exactly why I am here.   To all of you, I offer my deepest thanks. Without you, I couldn't  fight the righteous fights. But with you, we have already made big,  structural change--and I am convinced there is more to come.
