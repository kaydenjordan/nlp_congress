 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Victoria Mejias, a  leader from my district in Omaha, Nebraska, who has overcome the  physical impairments of multiple sclerosis, or MS, to help those in  desperate need, those who need to find new homes, new jobs, and new  schools in the wake of Hurricanes Maria, Sandy, and Katrina and the  tornados that rampaged Pilger, Nebraska, and Joplin, Missouri.   Victoria has been involved in missionary work for many years and has  always had an active interest in serving others in need. She found her  second calling by assisting disaster relief efforts and facilitating  the relocation of those most affected.   In 2017, Victoria found her work hitting closer to home than ever  before. Victoria, who is the daughter of a Puerto Rican family,  assisted in the relief efforts for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands when they were devastated by the powerful category 4 hurricane  which claimed an estimated 3,057 human lives and caused $91 billion  worth of damage.   She worked fervently alongside U.S. veteran Joel Ortiz to initiate a  relief project that would help relocate affected families to Omaha and  the surrounding areas. With her efforts, displaced families would have  a place to call their home away from home.   The result was the birth of an organization which Victoria is proud  to call her own, Heartland United for Puerto Rico. This organization  has assisted approximately 50 families in relocating to areas  throughout Nebraska and Iowa and continues to make influential impacts  in the lives of these individuals who lost nearly everything.   Unfortunately, much of Victoria's efforts have been slowed as she  continues her fight against the horrible impacts of MS. MS can be  treated through disease-modifying therapies which work to reduce the  frequency and severity of relapses, but they do not cure MS. In fact,  there is no known cure.   Multiple sclerosis attacks the immune system's healthy cells and  affects the ability of the central nervous system to control the  activities of the body.   In 2006, Victoria encountered her first difficulty with this disease  when she lost her balance and fell to the ground, having no feeling of  support from her legs beneath her. She was formally diagnosed with MS  in 2016.   The diagnosis, although challenging, gave her a sense of relief, as  she finally knew her experience was real and valid.   She continues to suffer from many effects of the disease, such as  broken legs and color blindness, and is no longer physically able to  have the same influence she once had, but Victoria has the motivation  to be a transformative leader within her community and does not let  this stop her.   When you meet Victoria, she will tell you that being self-aware of  your challenges is a strength, not a weakness.   What Victoria has accomplished in the lives of others is an  achievement difficult for many who do not suffer from any physical  limitations. Therefore, we should all draw inspiration from her  example, her determination, and her achievements, all while struggling  with the debilitating effects of MS.   May we all strive to be leaders in our communities, as Victoria has  and will continue to be.   Victoria, we salute you and pray for your strength. We pray for your  healing from this burdensome disease. Thank you for being such a great  example and inspiration to all of us.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to advocate in support of a  disaster assistance package for recent floods, storms, fires, and  others. Last month, my district and home State of Nebraska was hit by  devastating flooding, destroying more than 2,000 homes, 340 businesses,  and taking several lives, making it the worst natural disaster to hit  the State in our 152-year history.   Many families and communities in my district have been severely  impacted. For several days in March, the only way in and out of Valley  and Waterloo, two towns in our district, was either by boat or  helicopter. Next door to our district, one-third of Offutt Air Force  Base was under water to include 60 structures.   The economic impact has also been severe and will hurt the State of  Nebraska for years to come. Current estimates reveal that the cost of  the damage will surpass $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. This includes  $449 million in damaged roads, levees, and other infrastructure.   Currently, 200 miles of Nebraska roads are in need of repair. What  once was a short drive of minutes, in some cases may take hours,  disrupting everyday commerce and travel.   The Nebraska Department of Agriculture estimates that the March  floods will have $400 million in losses for livestock, $36 million in  livestock feed loss, and $440 million worth of potential crop loss from  delayed and prevented planting. Nebraskans are a strong and resilient  people, but they need to know that we are with them and will help them  through these difficult times.   While Nebraska has been experiencing these horrible floods, I take  solace in our first responders and National Guard. I cannot thank these  brave men and women enough for helping so many in our community. In  many small communities across Nebraska, first responders are only  volunteer, often rushing out to help others while their own homes were  in peril. These heroes selflessly saved countless lives and property.   I want to give a shout-out to the Waterloo Fire Department  volunteers; they rescued nearly 200 people as volunteers over the  course of a week. I think of the Salvation Army leader who ran the  collection center, working countless hours while his own home was  underwater.   In these trying times, I urge my colleagues to put politics aside and  come together to help Nebraskans and other Americans hurting from these  natural disasters that have occurred over the past year. We are  Nebraska strong. We do need that Federal support.
