 Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Minnesota delegation, I  offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 333         Resolved, That the House has heard with profound sorrow of       the death of the Honorable Walter F. Mondale, a former Vice       President of the United States of America.        Resolved, That the Clerk communicate these resolutions to       the Senate and transmit a copy thereof to the family of the       deceased.        Resolved, That when the House adjourns today, it adjourn as       a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased.   The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.  [[Page H1995]]                                ____________________
