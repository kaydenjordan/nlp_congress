 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a remarkable  Arkansan at the end of a 38-year Army career.   LTG Aundre Piggee, who will retire in September, is the Deputy Chief  of Staff of the Army for Logistics. His nearly four-decade career has  taken him literally all over the world, but his roots are and always  have been in Arkansas.   The general was born in Stamps, AR, which is a small town in  Lafayette County with fewer than 3,000 people. The son of a World War  II Army veteran, the general didn't have his sights set on a career of  military service from a young age. After graduating from high school,  he chose to go to the University of Arkansas Pine Bluff, which is about  2\1/2\ hours from home. He was a smart kid, so he received an academic  scholarship to attend school.   There was no real reason for him to choose to go into the ROTC. In  fact, according to him, the only reason he entered the Army ROTC was  because the school allowed him to substitute it for an otherwise  mandatory physical education class that would have required him to walk  all the way across the campus. That seemingly mundane decision to save  himself a few steps each day and maybe allow him to sleep in a few more  minutes ended up being a life-changing decision for him. It set him on  a path to an extraordinary career that he probably couldn't have  dreamed of at the time.   Years later, the general served in jobs in Fort Hood, TX; Seoul,  South Korea; Kaiserslautern, Germany; MacDill Air Force Base in  Florida, and many other places. He deployed to Kuwait, Bosnia, and  Iraq. He commanded thousands of soldiers and managed an $11 billion  Army portfolio. He led capacity-building efforts in Iraq and headed  train-and-equip missions in Syria. He also directed logistics works in  the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. For his exemplary  service, the general earned the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the  Distinguished Service Medal, and many other recognitions.   Throughout all of his great accomplishments and prominent positions,  he has maintained a strong connection to his alma mater and his  Arkansas roots.   For his work with and on behalf of his school, the current chancellor  at UAPB, Laurence Alexander, said of the general:         He not only serves as a beacon of light and hope to our       university and our community, but also to our state and our       country. He continues to positively impact the lives of many,       as well as inspiring a new generation of future military       leaders.    For all of his accomplishments, the general was inducted into the  Arkansas Black Hall of Fame last year. Now he has decided that it is  time to take off his Army uniform and pursue his next adventure with  his wife, Kassi.   The general has risen to such incredible heights during his career.  He is a hero in the sense of his outstanding military service, but more  importantly, he is a hero in the sense that when you talk about duty,  honor, country, and integrity, he is the guy who is a great example for  all of us, one of the best we can find and look to. I am so proud to  call him a fellow Arkansan and a friend. On behalf of all Arkansans, I  wish him and his wife, Kassi, much happiness in the next chapter of  their lives.   Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame Class of 2019 inductees and celebrate  their contributions to our State and our country.   Founded in 2014, the Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame honors women whose  contributions have influenced the direction of Arkansas in their  community or the State as a whole. The  [[Page S5245]]  AWHOF recognizes women, contemporary or historical, who have achieved  prominence within the State. By providing a place for women in the  State to be admired, the AWHOF inspires future generations of young  Arkansas women to achieve great things.   Alice Andrews is a conservationist and a leading voice for  environmental protection in Arkansas. As a farmer's daughter, Alice  developed an interest in the environment and protecting land and water  resources. Alice's conservation efforts began with advocacy work for  the Buffalo River designation in 1972, which protects the river from  industrial uses that may change its natural character or surrounding  habitat. She has continued her efforts by serving on the Arkansas  Trails Council, being appointed to the Arkansas Scenic Rivers  Commission and serving as president of the Ozark Society. Alice has  also been credited with helping preserve the landscape where iconic  landmarks including the Big Dam Bridge, Two Rivers Bridge, and the  River Trail, can be found. Her continued support and consultation with  nonprofits, governments, and local churches have made Arkansas a better  place for many generations to live, work and play.   Olivia Myers Farrell is among Arkansas's most influential women in  media. She graduated from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock  before starting her career as part of the advertising department at the  Arkansas Writers Project at the Arkansas Times. She then cofounded  Arkansas Business and Southern magazine in the years following. Olivia  has been honored as a Young Achiever by the National Council of Women  of the United States--one of only six women selected in 1984 and the  first Arkansas woman to receive the honor. She then became the CEO and  principal owner of the Arkansas Business Publishing Group, which has  received numerous awards for outstanding journalism by its  publications, including Arkansas Business, Little Rock Family, and  Little Rock Soiree. In 1998, she cofounded the Arkansas Women's  Foundation to improve the educational status and skills of Arkansas  women and girls in STEM fields, promote philanthropy by and for women,  and enhance the economic viability of emerging leaders in Arkansas. Her  efforts in the community earned her the Distinguished Citizen Award  given by former Governor Mike Beebe in 2012.   Jo Luck attended Hendrix College before graduating from David  Lipscomb College with a degree in education in 1963. Jo went on to earn  a master's degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of  Government and served as the assistant director in the Governor's  Office of Volunteer Services before becoming the first director of the  Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. Under Governor Bill  Clinton, she became the executive director of the Arkansas Department  of Parks and Tourism. Under Jo's guidance, the economic impact of  Arkansas' tourism industry more than doubled. In 1992, she became  president and CEO of Little Rock-based Heifer International--a global  nonprofit dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty--where she served  until 2010. Under her leadership, the organization's state-of-the-art,  LEED-certified headquarters was designed and built. In 2011, Jo was  appointed by Barack Obama to serve on the U.S. Agency for International  Development's Board for International Food and Agricultural  Development. She has worked throughout her career to improve food  availability around the globe and promote sustainable agricultural  practices.   Charlotte Tillar Schexnayder was born in Tillar, AR, in 1923. When  she was 16 years old, she enrolled in the University of Arkansas at  Monticello while also freelance writing for the McGehee Times. She went  on to become editor of the McGehee Times in October 1944. She and her  husband Melvin worked at the newspaper for 6 years before purchasing  the Dumas Clarion, which they owned for more than four decades.  Although the paper was largely known for local news, Charlotte took an  editorial stand on many issues, including the desegregation of Central  High School in Little Rock along with economic and development issues  in Dumas, AR. Along with being a critical voice in local media,  Charlotte was a board member of the Dumas Chamber of Commerce and  served as the first female president of the organization. In 1975,  Governor David Pryor appointed Charlotte to the Arkansas Board of  Pardons and Parole, making her the first female to serve on the group's  board. Charlotte went on to become president of many journalism  organizations, including Arkansas Press Women, the Little Rock chapter  of the Society of Professional Journalists, the National Federation of  Press Women, the Arkansas Press Association, and the National Newspaper  Association. In 1984, she was elected to the State house of  representatives where she served until 1999. While in office, she was  the lead sponsor for several bills, including the expansion of the  Freedom of Information Act, a bill creating the Arkansas Ethics  Commission, and the creation of a sales tax for a research center and  endowed chair at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in  alcohol abuse prevention. Charlotte's consistent efforts to improve her  community and State are both courageous and groundbreaking.   Carolyn Witherspoon graduated from the University of Arkansas at  Little Rock in 1974 and continued her education at the UALR School of  Law, where she graduated with honors in 1978. Throughout her legal  career, Carolyn has advocated for promoting a healthy work-life balance  and supported and founded organizations that serve women. She served as  the commissioner of the Arkansas Real Estate Commission from 1978 until  1981, when she became the president of the Arkansas Association of  Women's Lawyers. Her law practice has centered on representing private  and public employees in defending employment-related matters, including  title VII litigation. Her practice has led her to serve as president of  the Pulaski County Bar Association and the Arkansas Bar Association,  where she became the first woman to hold that position. As one of the  top lawyers from Arkansas, she has been honored to serve on the Union  Internationale des Advocats. Carolyn has also earned recognition from  the American Psychological Association, the Society for Human Resources  Management, and the State of Arkansas. Her firm has been honored with  the WE WORKs Award three times for incorporating flexibility in  workplace practices. Under her direction, Cross, Gunter, Witherspoon,  and Galchus is the only firm in the State of Arkansas with 50 percent  ownership by female attorneys. Her community involvement includes  serving on the Arkansas Coalition Against Sexual Assault and as former  president of the Women's Foundation of Arkansas, as well as providing  legal services to low-income people through a program known as VOCALS.  We can be proud of Carolyn's contributions to the legal community in  our State, country, and internationally.   Diane Frances Divers Kincaid Blair was born in Washington, DC in  1938. She graduated cum laude from Cornell University's Department of  Government in 1959. When she returned to Washington, she served as an  analyst for the President's Committee on Government Contracts, a  research assistant with the Senate Special Committee on Unemployment,  and legislative secretary and speechwriter for former U.S. Senator  Stuart Symington of Missouri. After marrying Arkansan Hugh Kincaid, she  moved to Fayetteville in 1963. Diane completed her master's degree  through the Department of Political Science at the University of  Arkansas in 1967. The following year, Kincaid became a part-time  lecturer in political science at the University of Arkansas at  Fayetteville and in 1979 became an assistant professor of political  science. In 1971, Governor Dale Bumpers appointed Diane to chair the  Governor's Commission on the Status of Women. In 1976, Governor David  Pryor selected her to chair a commission on public employee rights. In  1980, she was appointed to the commission for the Arkansas Educational  Television Networks, where she served until 1993. She also served as an  advisor for the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1992 and 4 years later worked  on the President's reelection campaign. President Clinton appointed  Diane to the board of directors of the U.S. Corporation for Public  Broadcasting, which she later chaired. Diane authored two books,  including ``Arkansas Politics and Government: Do the People Rule?''  which is used by many Arkansas colleges and  [[Page S5246]]  universities as part of their curriculums. Blair passed away in 2000 of  lung cancer, but left behind a legacy of service and dedication to the  State of Arkansas.   Louise McPhetridge Thaden was born in Bentonville on a small family  farm and became interested in aviation at an early age. She attended  the University of Arkansas, but never graduated. Instead, she continued  to pursue her love of flying, taking her skills to Kansas and  eventually California and working various jobs until she eventually  earned her pilot's license. She became the only female pilot to  simultaneously hold the women's record for speed, altitude, and solo  endurance, beating out Amelia Earhart and other pilots at the National  Women's Air Derby in 1929. Together Earhart and Thaden formed the  Ninety-Nines, an advocacy group for women pilots. Additionally, Louise  opened a flight school for women at the Penn School of Aviation and  raised the scholarship money for its first 12 students. In 1932, she  set a refueling endurance record of 196 hours in the air over Long  Island. In 1936, Louise became the first woman to win the Bendix  Transcontinental Air Race from New York to Los Angeles. She was the  1937 recipient of the Harmon Trophy, which is the highest honor given  to a female pilot. Her achievements have been honored in numerous ways,  including by the community of Bentonville, where its airport now bears  her name, as well as by former Governor David Pryor's declaration of  August 22 as ``Louise M. Thaden Day.'' She was posthumously inducted  into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame in 1999. Louise's  pioneering and competitive spirit will continue to inspire future  generations of pilots and women for many years to come.   The final inductee, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority's Beta Pi Omega  Chapter, was chartered in Little Rock in 1937. It is the oldest  graduate chapter in the State of Arkansas. The chapter's 265 members  regularly complete service projects and host health fairs, workshops,  education programs, voter drive, and fundraisers. The group's members  use their education, skill, and expertise to make an impact in the  community. Beta Pi Omega has sponsored the chartering of two new Alpha  Kappa Alpha chapters in the State, Gamma Alpha Chapter at Philander  Smith College and Epsilon Phi Chapter at the University of Arkansas at  Little Rock. Through the years, over 500 High School seniors and  college students have received scholarships or other assistance from  Beta Pi Omega. The chapter has been recognized for its programs and  partnerships with the Little Rock School District, American Heart  Association, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, and Lions  Club International. Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority's Beta Pi Omega chapter  has demonstrated a true commitment to improving Arkansas for future  generations of citizens in all corners of the State.   Congratulations to the 2019 Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame inductees.  We are grateful for their contributions to our State and the work they  have done to inspire all Arkansans to achieve great things and help  their neighbors and fellow citizens through their efforts to uplift and  improve their communities.                            ____________________
