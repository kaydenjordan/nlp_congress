 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, many of us here in the Senate thought we  would be opening the new year with an impeachment trial, but that is  not what is happening this week because the Senate is still waiting-- waiting for Speaker Pelosi to actually send over the Articles of  Impeachment.   Democrats rushed impeachment through the House, throwing fairness and  due process to the winds in their haste to impeach the President, but  now they are apparently content to just sit on the Articles of  Impeachment for the foreseeable future. If Democrats really believe  that this impeachment is a serious matter, that there is literally a  crime spree in progress, as they have claimed, they would have already  sent over the articles. The truth is, Democrats' impeachment efforts,  which basically started before the President had even taken the oath of  office, have been politically motivated from the start. Democrats  thought they could damage the President politically by rushing to  impeach him, and now they think they can damage the President  politically by stalling a trial.   Speaker Pelosi is also attempting to force the Senate to conduct the  trial she would like it to conduct in hopes of getting the outcome she  would prefer--demonstrating once again the fundamentally political  nature of the Democrats' impeachment quest. Here in the Senate, we will  continue working on the business of governing until  [[Page S40]]  the Speaker decides she is ready to stop playing games.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr.  Perdue).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                             Committee on Finance    The Committee on Finance is authorized to meet during the session of  the Senate on Tuesday, January 7, 2020, at 9:30 a.m., to conduct a  hearing.                       Select Committee on Intelligence    The Select Committee on Intelligence is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Tuesday, January 7, 2020, at 2:30 p.m., to  conduct a closed briefing.                            ____________________
