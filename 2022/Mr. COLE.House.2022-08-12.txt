 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for  yielding.   (Mr. COLE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, it is worth asking why we are here at all  right now, quite frankly. We face no emergency. The government is not  about to shut down. Nothing in this bill is actually going to take  effect in the immediate future. We are simply here because my friends  on the other side want to create the illusion that they are doing  something positive before the midterm election.   I think they also fear that the American people will actually have a  chance to look at this monstrosity over a month and their own Members  would then have to go home and give a full accounting of what they have  done here. Sadly, we are going to rush this through without appropriate  consideration.   It is worth noting, Mr. Speaker, 180 of our own Members-plus are not  even here. They are not here because they have submitted a declaration  because we are in a health emergency.   What health emergency?   We have vaccines, we have therapeutics, the airports are full of  people. People are traveling pretty easily, but 180 Members won't be  here--both parties. Again, that is a sad commentary on the manner in  which we are operating this House.   This bill comes before us in a process that I can only describe as  lousy. No committee of jurisdiction in either the Senate or the House  has dealt with this bill as written. No House Member has had any  meaningful input in this legislation. The reality is this bill was  negotiated in back rooms by two Senators and rammed through the Senate  on a partisan vote. My friends have picked it up without changing it,  without considering it, and they are going to ram it through here  today. That is a process that they ought to be embarrassed by.   There are two reasons to oppose the legislation itself, Mr. Speaker.  The first is simply because of what is in it. The Democrats are  repeating the mistake they made last year. They are going to try and  spend their way out of inflation--a novel approach.                                time  0945    We see how well that worked when they rammed through the American  Rescue Plan under reconciliation. It is going to work exactly the same  way again.   On top of that, we are going to try and tax our way out of recession.  That is a novel, new economic idea: Raise taxes while you are in a  recession, something other administrations of both parties have always  rejected as a bad idea. But my friends, feverishly intent upon action,  are going to do it here.   We are going to do one thing, and I guess that could start  immediately. We are going to hire, as my friend from Texas suggested,  87,000 new IRS employees. Only my friends on the other side think that  is a good idea. Nobody thinks 87,000 new IRS agents are going to do  anything to help us with inflation, or help us with the problems that  we have in energy, or help us in any meaningful way improve the economy  or the lives of the average American.   What is not in this bill is another reason to vote against it. It  does nothing to deal with inflation. Indeed, during the Rules  Committee, we submitted a letter from 280 economists that said this is  going to make it worse, not better.   They can rely on Mr. Summers. I will rely on the 280 economists from  both parties and every point of view who said this is not going to work  when it comes to inflation. There is nothing in this bill that is going  to increase energy production in the United States, nothing at all.   Finally, there is nothing meaningful, as my friend from Texas pointed  out, that will actually reduce the deficit. That deficit doesn't begin  to come down until 7 years from now under this legislation. That  assumes everything stays the same for 7 years. That is not going to  happen.   For those reasons, Mr. Speaker, we ought to reject this rule. We  ought to submit this bill to the appropriate committees of jurisdiction  in this House, allow them to do their work, and continue to negotiate  with the Senate. There is no emergency. There is no hurry here. We  don't need to ram this through.   For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I urge the rejection of the rule and  the rejection of the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule to provide for consideration  of the Senate amendment to H.R. 5376, the grossly mis-named Inflation  Reduction Act. Instead of actually doing something to address the  current economic crisis, the bill is instead yet another partisan tax- and-spend bill. My friends on the other side of the aisle will tout the  deficit reduction as good for reducing inflation--and that's true. But  the bill we are considering isn't a serious attempt at deficit  reduction. Eighty percent of the deficit reduction they claim in this  bill doesn't even show up for seven years. And the deficit reduction  they claim is laughable when you consider the one point nine trillion  spending bill they put on American's credit card just last year.  Americans need relief now.   I shouldn't be surprised but I am disappointed at the Majority's  egregious surrender of the House's institutional prerogatives. When you  have a process that is this bad, you should expect bad results. And the  process on this bill was about as bad as it gets. The bill before us  was written behind closed doors with just two senators negotiating its  provisions. No Member of the House had any input into the package, nor  did any but a few senators. Nor have we been given an opportunity to  amend this package when the Majority completely rewrote the original  bill at the Rules Committee, when we first considered this on the floor  in November of last year, or today since every Republican amendment to  this package was blocked in the rule. Instead, the House is preparing  to pass exactly what the Senate produced behind closed doors. At least  the Senate had the luxury of a CBO score during its consideration. The  House isn't even afforded that. This is an embarrassment.   The Majority pushed through a reckless one point nine trillion dollar  reconciliation bill last year, stubbornly insisting it would not lead  to inflation, even though economists were warning us the exact  opposite. Today, hardworking American taxpayers are suffering for their  hubris.   Instead of learning their lesson, the Majority is once again pushing  another foolhardy tax-and-spend package through on partisan lines. They  were wrong last year and they are wrong again this year. Unfortunately,  it will be the average American who again pays the price in the form of  more inflation, fewer jobs, slower growth, and a lower standard of  living for every family in America.   It is easy to see why when you think about the policies that are  actually included in this bill. A tax hike on corporations that will  inevitably pass their increased costs onto consumers. A six hundred  percent increase in the budget of the IRS so they can hire an army of  eighty-seven thousand new agents. Massive spending on Green New Deal  priorities, including giving subsidies on luxury electric vehicles to  high-earning individuals. Policies like these are bad enough in good  times, but raising taxes when we are in a recession to give subsidies  to the rich to buy luxury electric vehicles just doesn't make any  sense.   But we should also talk about what is not in this bill. Despite the  title, there's nothing in this bill that will reduce inflation. There's  nothing in this bill that will address our current energy crisis, and  in fact, the policies in here will make it worse. While my friends in  the Majority are willing to pour tens of billions of dollars into  Solyndra-style green energy programs, there is nothing in this bill  that will lower the price of gasoline, nothing that will make it  cheaper to heat and cool homes, and nothing that will ensure energy  independence for America. The Majority could have chosen to prioritize  these things but didn't.   Instead, the Majority is showing what their priorities truly are. An  army of new IRS agents to harass taxpayers at all income levels. A  massive and unaffordable tax increase that will make the recession  worse. Massive new spending programs on the Green New Deal. Subsidies  for high-income folks to buy luxury electric vehicles. It all adds up  to a bad deal for taxpayers, a bad deal for the economy, and a bad deal  for the nation.  [[Page H7565]]    Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, this bill will make inflation  worse, not better, and will make the recession longer and deeper. We  should not make the exact same error the Majority made last year in  passing yet another tax and spend boondoggle. We cannot tax and spend  our way out of a recession, and we cannot tax and spend our way into  lower inflation. The nation has already suffered enough after last  year's reconciliation bill. Doing so all over again will only make this  suffering worse.
