 Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Carbajal, my good friend, for his  leadership on this amendment.   I am proud to cosponsor this amendment which would prohibit future  oil and gas sales off the West Coast, including my beautiful home State  of Washington.   The fact is the people of Washington State don't support drilling off  our coast. Our commercial and recreational fishermen who generate  billions in economic impact for our State don't want to see our  fisheries compromised by another disaster like the 1988 spill which  released more than 230,000 gallons of oil and affected over 110 miles  of our coastline.   The 17 Native American Tribes who have fished throughout the Puget  Sound watershed since time immemorial don't want to see our coastline  exposed to these harmful and polluting activities.   Our shellfish growers, who support roughly 3,200 jobs in our State,  don't want to see their jobs threatened. They saw how the Deepwater  Horizon spill devastated Louisiana's coastal economy.                                time  1615    Coastal towns including Ocean Shores, Westport, Aberdeen, Hoquiam,  Montesano, Long Beach, and Ilwaco have passed resolutions saying they  don't want it.   Even former Department of the Interior Secretary Zinke in his  testimony before the Appropriations Committee last year admitted that  the oil and gas industry doesn't want to drill off the coast of  Washington because there aren't the resources or infrastructure to do  it.   He also said, ``I think I'm going to mark down Washington as opposed  to drilling.''   Mr. Chair, I believe this body ought to mark Washington State down as  off-limits to drilling, and this amendment does that.   This matters to our economy. It matters to our region's identity. The  survival of the last 76 southern resident orca left in the world  depends on keeping the Puget Sound protected from the harmful impacts  of oil and gas development.   There is a lot at stake here. That is why I urge my colleagues to  support the will of the residents of the State of Washington and pass  this amendment.
