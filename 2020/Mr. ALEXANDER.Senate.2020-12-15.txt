 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, all postcloture time on the Kirsch  nomination expire at 5 p.m. today; further, that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; finally, that  the mandatory quorum call with respect to the Crytzer nomination be  waived.    Madam President, in Jon Meacham's biography of  President George W. Bush--actually, I believe it is in the biography of  President George H. W. Bush--Meacham quotes Prescott Bush, H.W. Bush's  father and Senator Prescott Bush, of Connecticut, as saying that the  Senate is the place where everybody in politics ultimately wants to be.  Senator Prescott Bush, of Connecticut, said that the U.S. Senate is the  place in politics where everybody in politics ultimately wants to be.   I have noticed that over the years, after an election, usually we  have lost about 10 Members of the Senate--sometimes a couple more,  sometimes a couple less. This year, it is 7. If you look at Georgia and  what one has to go through to stay here or to get here given the amount  of money being spent and the number of things being said in those two  races, you would think that there might be a shortage of people today  who would want to follow Senator Prescott Bush's advice but apparently  not.   Instead of 10 people leaving this year, it is only 7, and only 4 of  us are retiring voluntarily. I would like to take just a minute or two  about each of the other six U.S. Senators who will not be coming back  in the next Congress.    I yield the floor.
