 Madam Speaker, I rise for every child who was  ever raised in this beautiful country but told they are not American;  for every Dreamer who has lived in fear that they will be forced from  the only home they have ever known.   Madam Speaker, Dreamers are teachers, students, and healthcare  workers. They feed us, care for us, and inspire us. They strengthen our  economy. Now is the moment. We must give them the same opportunities  and protections that they deserve as Americans.
