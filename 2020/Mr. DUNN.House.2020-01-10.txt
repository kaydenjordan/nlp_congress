 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  three-war veteran, Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Daube.   Colonel Daube is a highly decorated veteran, having served in World  War II, Korea, and Vietnam, amassing over 5,000 flight-hours between  the Navy and the Air Force. He flew the P-51 Mustang, multiple fighter  jets, and heavy metal. He even served in the space program. His name is  enshrined on the Wall of Honor in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.   Colonel Daube's record of service is emblematic of why we all revere  the Greatest Generation. Now, at 95 years old, he is still the cheerful  warrior. He lives in Callaway, Florida, near his son, Dr. Skip Daube,  who has been my friend for over 25 years.   I was honored to serve them both Thanksgiving dinner at Tyndall Air  Force Base this year, and it was a time of great comradery.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in saluting a living hero from our  father's generation, Colonel Daniel Daube.                            ____________________
