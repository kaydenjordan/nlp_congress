 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote on the  nomination of Ana Reyes, who has been nominated to the U.S. District  Court for the District of Columbia.   Ms. Reyes first immigrated to this country when she was 5 years old.  At the time, she could not speak any English. That quickly changed  through her hard work and with the help of her first-grade teacher, Pat  Harkleroad, who came to Ms. Reyes' Louisville, KY, elementary school an  hour early each morning to provide one-on-one English lessons.   Born in Montevideo, Uruguay, Ms. Reyes built off of this foundational  experience to earn her B.A. summa cum laude from Transylvania  University in 1996 and her J.D. magna cum laude from Harvard Law School  in 2000.   After clerking for the Honorable Amalya Kearse on the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Second Circuit, Ms. Reyes joined Williams & Connolly as  an associate in 2001. Promoted to partner in 2009, Ms. Reyes has spent  her career specializing in complex litigation and international  arbitration, trying 10 cases to verdict, judgment, or final decision.   Although she has been in private practice for her whole career, Ms.  Reyes has illustrated her commitment to public service by devoting over  3,300 hours to pro bono work. While her pro bono work spans several  fields, including criminal defense, a significant amount of her efforts  has been directed towards representing asylum seekers fleeing political  persecution, torture, and gender-based violence.   The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Ms. Reyes as  ``well qualified'' to serve on the D.C. District Court and, if  confirmed, she will be the first Hispanic woman and the first openly  LGBTQ+ person to ever serve on the D.C. District Court.   I look forward to supporting this highly-qualified nominee and urge  my colleagues to join me in doing so.    I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Casey)  and the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), are necessarily  absent.   The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 46, as follows:                         [Rollcall Vote No. 17 Ex.]                                  YEAS--52       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Fetterman      Gillibrand      Graham      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--46       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Budd      Capito      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Mullin      Paul      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--2       Casey      Feinstein           The nomination was confirmed.

If confirmed, she will be the first Black woman to serve on the  District of Oregon. This will be just one in a history of firsts  Justice Nelson has accomplished.   Born in Kansas City, MO, Justice Nelson was the first Black  valedictorian at her Arkansas high school post-integration in 1985. She  went on to earn her B.A. summa cum laude from the University of  Arkansas at Fayetteville in 1989 and her J.D. from the University of  Texas at Austin in 1993.   Justice Nelson began her legal career at Multnomah Defenders, Inc., a  public interest law firm in Portland, OR, representing indigent  defendants charged with State crimes for 3 years. She then joined a  Portland-area law firm as an associate, where she represented a wide- range of clients, from individuals to private businesses and labor  unions, for 5 years. In 2004, she became the coordinator and senior  attorney for the student legal and mediation services at Portland State  University. During her time in practice, she tried more than 40 cases,  including 25 jury trials.   In 2006, Justice Nelson was appointed to serve as a circuit court  judge for the Multnomah County Circuit Court. She presided over  approximately 315 cases over 12 years of service on that court.   In 2018, Justice Nelson became the first Black justice to serve on  Oregon's highest court. Since then, she has authored 33 majority  opinions.   Senators Wyden and Merkley strongly support Justice Nelson's  nomination, and the American Bar Association has unanimously rated her  ``well qualified'' to serve on the District of Oregon.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this highly- qualified nominee.
