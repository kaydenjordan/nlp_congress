 Mr. Speaker, today is tax day, the day that hardworking  Americans finish preparing their taxes; and it is already clear,  looking at the new tax bill, that it will overwhelmingly benefit CEOs,  shareholders, and the wealthiest Americans.   Since the passage of this Republican tax bill, corporations have  already funneled $250 billion to CEOs and shareholders through stock  buybacks, money that is not going to workers. Stock buybacks  overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans and corporate  executives. In fact, the richest 10 percent of American households hold  84 percent of stocks.   The CBO just released information showing that this tax bill will  increase the deficit by $1.9 trillion.   So let's get this straight. The Federal Government borrows almost $2  trillion from our children and our grandchildren so that we can funnel  hundreds of billions of dollars to the wealthiest Americans. Is that  what we should be doing here?   I think not.                            ____________________
