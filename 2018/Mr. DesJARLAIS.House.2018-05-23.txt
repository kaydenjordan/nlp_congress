 Mr. Chair, I join the gentleman in expressing my  opposition to this amendment. The NNSA's mission is, arguably, one of  the most critical national security roles across the U.S. Government.   As my colleague from Alabama pointed out, after years of insufficient  funding, our Nuclear Security Enterprise is now facing a myriad of  infrastructure problems and potential failures. To quote Los Alamos lab  director Dr. Charlie McMillan: ``One of the things that keeps me up at  night is the realization that essential capabilities are held at risk  by the possibility of such failures.''   The amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado would only  exacerbate these problems. Most of the cuts made by this amendment  would come from high-priority deferred maintenance and infrastructure  repairs. With a $3.7 billion infrastructure and maintenance backlog,  these cuts are unacceptable and pose a serious threat not only to the  NNSA mission, but to the occupational well-being of its employees as  well.    Under the leadership of Chairman Thornberry and Chairman Rogers, the  committee has worked hard over the past 2 years to mitigate these  infrastructure issues and prevent the occurrence of a single-point  failure within the Nuclear Security Enterprise. It is critical that we  continue to push forward with these efforts and resolve these  outstanding issues. As such, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose  this amendment.
