 Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate Mr. Steve  Kelley of Carlisle County, Kentucky, for being named the 2019 Kentucky  Farm Bureau Farmer of the Year.   It is with great pride that I can say this is the fourth year in a  row that a farmer in Kentucky's First Congressional District has been  recognized as Kentucky Farmer of the Year.   After receiving his bachelors and masters degrees in agriculture from  Murray State University, Steve embarked on a decades-long career  farming over 2,500 acres in Carlisle County. His solar farm, as well as  his grain, livestock, and timber operations, sets Steve apart and  highlights the ambitious future he sees for agriculture in the  Commonwealth. He believes that it is his purpose to ``leave his  farmland in better condition than when he received it.''   I am honored to congratulate the 2019 Kentucky Farmer of the Year,  Mr. Steve Kelley, and his family on his unwavering work ethic,  dedication to the Carlisle County Farm Bureau, and outstanding role in  the agriculture community.                            ____________________
