 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Congresswoman DeLauro and  Ranking Member Cole for their support for my amendment and support for  the fire services.   I rise as the proud co-chair of the Congressional Fire Service Caucus  to be on the front lines fighting for the brave men and women who put  their lives on the line every day.   We know that firefighters are routinely exposed to a variety of  carcinogens in chaotic and uncontrolled environments, but we do not  have a good sense of the full impacts of their exposure. This is why we  passed the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act into law last year. That  bill was championed by Representative Chris Collins of New York, and he  has cosponsored this amendment today.   Mr. Chairman, along my journey to create a National Firefighter  Cancer Registry I heard the struggle of a cancer survivor who has  dedicated--all of them dedicated their lives to the fire service. While  some beat the odds we, unfortunately, lost Fire Chief Gene  Dannenfelser, of the Haddon Heights Volunteer Fire Department in 2017.   Gene fought a courageous battle with 9/11-related lung cancer. To  honor him, and all those brothers and sisters struggling, we fought to  get this bill into law.   This bill directed the Centers for Disease Control to develop a  specialized cancer registry for firefighters to provide scientists and  medical professionals data to better understand cancer trends among our  firefighters. But for the registry to be effective, it needs the  resources to maximize firefighter participation.   I appreciate that the committee included a line item for the  registry. This amendment merely ensures the Firefighter Cancer Registry  is fully funded. The registry will help us improve our knowledge of  cancer incidence in firefighters.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from 11 fire services  organizations, including the International Association of Fire  Fighters, in support of this amendment.                                                       June 7, 2019.      Hon. Bill Pascrell, Jr.,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chris Collins,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Pascrell & Congressman Collins: On behalf       of the nation's fire and emergency services, we write in       support of your amendment to H.R. 2740, the Fiscal Year 2020       Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Legislative       Branch, Defense, State, Foreign Operations, and Energy and       Water Development Appropriations Act. Specifically, your       amendment will fully fund the Firefighter Cancer Registry at       the authorized level of $2.5 million.        During the 115th Congress, both the House and Senate       unanimously approved the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act       (P.L. 115-194). The bipartisan legislation instructed the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to create a       specialized national registry to provide researchers and       epidemiologists with the tools and resources needed to       improve research collection activities related to the       monitoring of cancer incidence among firefighters.        Studies have indicated a strong link between firefighting       and an increased risk of several major cancers. However,       certain studies examining cancer risks among firefighters       have been limited by the availability of important data and       relatively small sample sizes that have an       underrepresentation of women, minorities, and volunteer       firefighters. As a result, public health researchers are       unable to fully examine and understand the broader       epidemiological cancer trends among firefighters. The       Firefighter Cancer Registry is an important resource to       better understand the link between firefighting and cancer,       potentially leading to better prevention and safety       protocols. It is critical that Congress fully fund the       program in Fiscal Year 2020 to ensure the CDC has adequate       resources to engage in a robust public outreach effort to       promote the Registry and encourage participation by a large       and diverse group of firefighters.        Thank you for offering this important amendment and your       continued leadership  [[Page H4548]]       and support for America's fire and emergency services.            Sincerely,          Congressional Fire Services Institute, Fire Apparatus             Manufacturers' Association, Fire and Emergency             Manufacturers and Services Association, International             Association of Arson Investigators, International             Association of Fire Chiefs, International Association             of Fire Fighters, International Fire Service Training             Association, International Society of Fire Service             Instructors, National Fallen Firefighters Foundation,             National Fire Protection Association, National             Volunteer Fire Council.     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Mr. Chair, I thank Madam Chair for her comments.   Mr. Chair, I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in  supporting the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
