 Madam President, I rise today to honor the  soldiers of Bravo Company (Wolfpack), 3rd Battalion (Warrior), 124th  Infantry Regiment Florida Army National Guard. This year marks the 20th  anniversary since Bravo Company was deployed to the Middle East. The  137 soldiers were the first Florida Guardsmen deployed to war since  World War II.   These brave soldiers conducted thousands of patrols, hundreds of  checkpoints, performed raids, and participated in countless supporting  operations. Most importantly, all soldiers returned home. These  soldiers earned their Combat Infantryman Badge and their Presidential  Unit Citation.   I want to welcome them to Pensacola, FL, 20 years after being  downrange protecting our great Nation. As a Navy veteran and the son of  a World War II veteran, I know firsthand the sacrifices made by our  military members and their families. Thank you for your service; your  courage and dedication to our country will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
