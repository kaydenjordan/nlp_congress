 Mr. Speaker, if nominated, I will not run.   This is an interesting subject, not only for the elderly like myself,  but for young people who need to know about Social Security.   Many times, younger folks, like myself when I was younger, I didn't  talk about Social Security too much. I didn't concern myself with what  was going to happen when I was 65 years of age--or now 66, as the  chairman pointed out.   But this is going to happen. I hate to tell you: You are going to get  older. Mr. Speaker, you are going to get older. You are going to be 66,  and then you are going to be 67, et cetera. Then you are going to have  to address whether or not there is enough money in this insurance plan  for you.   The chairman needs all the credit in the world because we are living  in a time when people do not want to address the problems that every  American is going to face. It doesn't matter whether you are this party  or that party. You are going to be affected by it.   Many people treat Social Security like they treat their health: I am  not sick. I am 25 years of age. I am  [[Page H3300]]  healthy. Why in God's name do I need to be covered by insurance?   Does that sound familiar? We have a big debate going on as to whether  we should mandate the Affordable Care Act. All boats have to rise, or  they will all fall.   Secondly, let's put this into a timeframe, as Chairman Larson alluded  to. Let's put it in a timeframe.   I compare it to, if I may, an analogy of apples and oranges. Allow me  that, please. Give me license to do that.   I compare this to climate change. We started to talk about climate  change on this floor--I wasn't here--25 years ago. We have been talking  each issue to death, like we do a lot of problems, and we don't do  anything.   Two new books just came out in the last week about climate change,  more scientific evidence to prove, to support the idea that we are  running out of time.   Our shorelines are moving. They are moving inland, not moving out,  and this can lead to tremendous devastation.   We know many of these things happen in nature. I have heard that  before. But many things are pushed by human behavior, and matters  become worse.                                time  2000    And the same thing with Social Security. Presidents in the past,  regardless of which party they belonged to, were always willing to make  adjustments so that people had those benefits in this insurance  program--not an entitlement, not an entitlement--so that there was  always adjustments to take care of things.   We have approached that time. We are into that time, and we have got  about 12 to 14 years to make up our mind what direction we are going to  go in. And I suggest that this piece of legislation, which Mr. Larson  has sponsored and I am proudly part of it, this legislation is  actuarially acceptable. We know what is going to happen 30 years, 40  years from now.   If we do this legislation, we reduce the anxiety that is involved.  And even though you are younger, Social Security affects you because  you are paying into it. You don't even know sometimes that you are  paying into it, but you are paying into it. You are paying into a  social insurance program.   So what is going to happen if we do not address environmental issues  is we will be choked to death, literally. That is not hyperbole; that  is science. Sorry about that.   We will cut off food supplies. Some areas of the world are already  being affected by that. And again, we will move our shorelines.   So, seniors, we need to educate younger people. They need to  understand that Social Security takes care of the disabled for young  and old. Younger Americans should be concerned and involved with this  shrinking reserve in our insurance plan which we have paid into.   So, for too long, I think, in my estimation, the Congress has been  silent in the face of this crisis. We are paralyzed on many of the  issues. We don't want to act to make things better. We would rather  they get worse, and maybe the heavens will open and they won't get  worse anymore. I wouldn't count on that. Today we stand up to say the  time for action is now. Seniors, families, future generations depend on  it.   I talk with people in my district, the Ninth District of New Jersey,  every day, even when I am down here, families that are dependent upon  their Social Security check as their only means of income, and we are  thinking in our heads that maybe we should cut benefits in order to  make it better? That will make it worse. That will make it worse.  Serious stuff.   So many people depend on Social Security. Think about it. You are 25  years old. Are you thinking about what is going to happen to you when  you are 67 years of age and you are living--because you haven't saved  enough, or you couldn't save enough, because most people don't have too  much to spend day in, day out. We have seen those numbers over the past  3 months. Are you thinking about what is going to happen to you if you  have to live on a Social Security check for which the benefits have  been cut?   And we raised the age of being eligible for Social Security so we  could fit and stretch the reserve a little longer. Raising the age is  not solving the problem of when someone is eligible. People retire  earlier in this day and age.   We must have courage to act in the face of challenges. Social  Security is this insurance program which we want to protect and expand  and help senior citizens and younger people and the disabled.   Those who pay into that reserve deserve to know they will be taken  care of in their older years, that hard work, paying your dues still  means something in the United States of America. Congress must take up  this Social Security 2100 Act; they must take that up right now,  without delay.   I think, in the Social Security Subcommittee, there are folks on the  other side of the aisle who want to see a positive change, but they  must have the courage to cross the line and make a decision.   The commitment that I made when I first ran for office in 1996, my  first commitment when I ran against an incumbent in my district was  this: Social Security will be one of my first priorities, my top three  priorities in Congress, that I will try everything in my power to  bolster Social Security, and I will never support diminishing the  benefits of the insurance policy that I pay into and you pay into and  everyone pays into. I think that that is critical.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman. I think that his  courage in speaking out--and I am not blowing smoke. I mean this. The  courage to speak out on these issues is going to have long-standing  effects down the line, because when you are 25, you are not thinking  about this. Let's be honest. I didn't. If you talked to me about Social  Security when I was 25, I would have rather watched paint dry on a  wall. How stupid that was.   You are going to get older, God willing, and you want something back  from what you paid into. I mean, is that radical? I don't think that is  a radical idea.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman's resolve in this matter--because the  chairman has gone all over the country to talk about this legislation.  He is serious about it. This is not a photo op. This is not a speech.  This is something that needs to be digested, and then you act upon it.   You ask your Congressman: ``What are you doing about Social  Security?'' Call him up and ask him: ``What are you doing about Social  Security?''   Oh, the Congressman may answer: ``Well, you are not one of those who  is going to lose sight of the fact that these are all things that are  going to get solved sooner or later.''   ``Yeah, but isn't the time shrinking?''   ``Yes, the time is shrinking, but I am learning more about it.''   ``What are you doing?''   Silence is golden. Silence makes no mistakes.   We need to do something about this now, Mr. Speaker. I commit to the  gentleman: You can count on me. This is a sound program.   And, by the way, the COLA doesn't include some of the expenses that  seniors go through, which makes it incredible.
