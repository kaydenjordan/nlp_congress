 Mr. Speaker, we have heard from my colleagues the  reasons why Representative Omar should be removed from this committee,  but I feel like all the reasons have not just yet been stated, which is  why I rise to add to the Record.   We have heard about the comments that were made regarding anti- Semitism and anti-Israeli views, but I rise to add to the Record that  as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have sat there and  heard the Representative actually spew anti-American rhetoric, as well.   I have been in that committee room where the Representative equates  Israel and the United States to Hamas and the Taliban. Absolutely  unacceptable for a member of that committee.   I have also heard the Representative equate that it is the United  States' fault that there is turmoil in Venezuela; that it is not  because of the oppressive socialism and communism that has spread  throughout Central and South America and Venezuela at the hands of the  Maduro and Hugo Chavez regimes. That is unacceptable.  [[Page H647]]    As a New York Representative, to hear the Representative belittle, to  try to diminish the worst terrorist attack on United States soil on  September 11, 2001, as ``some people did something,'' that is  unacceptable, as well.   And I hold the same standard for this side of the aisle that I do the  other, because when another colleague on my side said something about  9/11, I also voted to have her removed from the Committee on Education  and Labor, because I thought that was inappropriate.   So I am being consistent here, and I hope my colleagues will do the  same, to show that this is about consistency and accountability.  Because we should not have an individual with those views on the  committee that is tasked with representing our country and our Congress  to foreign nations.
