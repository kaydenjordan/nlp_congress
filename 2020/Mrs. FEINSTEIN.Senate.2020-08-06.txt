 Mr. President, psychostimulant overdose deaths,  including methamphetamine-related deaths, increased by 27 percent in 1  year. That is a higher rate of increase than any other illicit  substance in our country, including fentanyl.   It is time to sound the alarm. We must take immediate action to  prevent methamphetamine from becoming the next drug overdose crisis  facing our country.   That is why I am introducing the Methamphetamine Response Act with my  colleague, Senator Grassley.   This bill does two things.   First, it declares methamphetamine an emerging drug threat.   Second, it requires the Office of National Drug Control Policy,  ONDCP, to develop and implement a national plan that is specific to  methamphetamine, in accordance the ONDCP Reauthorization, which I was  proud to coauthor, and which was enacted in 2018 as part of the SUPPORT  Act.   This plan must include an assessment of the methamphetamine threat,  including the current availability of, and demand for, the drug, and  the effectiveness of evidence-based prevention and treatment programs,  as well as law enforcement programs; short- and long-term goals focused  on supply and demand reduction and the expansion of prevention and  treatment programs; performance measures related to the plan's goals;  and the level of funding needed to implement the plan, including an  assessment of whether available funding can be reprogrammed or  transferred or whether additional funds are needed.   There is no question that methamphetamine is emerging yet again as a  major drug threat to our Nation.   Between 2008 and 2017, methamphetamine-related treatment admissions  increased from 15 percent to nearly 24 percent. Heroin use among those  admitted for methamphetamine treatment increased from 5.3 percent to  23.6 percent, indicating a significant and troubling increase in poly  substance use.   Between 2018 and 2019, psychostimulant overdose deaths, including  methamphetamine deaths, increased in 27 of the 38 states that provide  drug-specific data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  This amounts to a 27-percent increase nationally.   By the end of 2019, methamphetamine availability, use, purity, and  potency had increased, as street level prices declined.   Data shows that methamphetamine use is no longer limited to Midwest  and Western States but is increasingly prevalent in Northeastern  States.   Emergency room admissions for suspected stimulant overdoses,  including methamphetamine, increased by 23 percent between January 2019  and 2020. These increases occurred in 36 States and the District of  Colombia.   In the first 9 months of fiscal year 2020, methamphetamine seizures  increased by 52 percent.   COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate these trends.   In fact, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has warned clinicians  to be prepared to monitor adverse effects associated with increased  methamphetamine use, including respiratory and pulmonary effects, among  COVID-19 patients.   Additionally, the necessary social distancing requirements associated  with COVID-19 have made in-person treatment more difficult, increasing  the probability that those seeking treatment may not be able to access  it.   These facts alone are enough to declare methamphetamine an emerging  threat, but public reports indicating that Mexican cartels are  stockpiling methamphetamine at the border and are poised to flood the  United States with methamphetamine make the situation that much more  urgent.   In 1 year methamphetamine killed more than 16,000 Americans. Absent  immediate action and a whole-of-government plan, these fatalities will  continue to increase.   Please join me in supporting Methamphetamine Response Act to stop  methamphetamine from becoming the next wave in a series of preventable  crises that have impacted the United States.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER:   S. 4496. A bill to direct the Secretary of Labor to promulgate an  occupational safety and health standard that requires covered employers  to protect employees from injury and death related to grease trap  manholes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
