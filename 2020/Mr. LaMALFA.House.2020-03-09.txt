 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize a local farmer  and agribusiness owner, Jim Paiva from west Chico.   A true Butte County native born in Chico, California, Jim grew up on  his father's dairy farm and eventually pursued a career in construction  for a time. However, he eventually left the industry and went back to  the farm. He began planting orchards in the Chico area, eventually  planting thousands of acres of trees.   He soon saved up enough money to buy a piece of land next door to his  family's old dairy farm, where he purchased an almond huller. He has  since diversified into walnuts, prunes, and even farm equipment sales.   Jim is proof of how hard work can lead to good outcomes, and his  forward thinking for that 7-days-a-week work has really led to his  recent recognition as a leader in his field.   The ``Cec'' Nielsen award he was just awarded this last weekend shows  the forward thinking he has for sustainability, for having his farm and  the people at his farm thinking about how to do things long term. His  commitment to local agriculture is unmatched. He serves as a great  example of entrepreneurial success in Butte County.   Congratulations, Jim Paiva.                            ____________________
