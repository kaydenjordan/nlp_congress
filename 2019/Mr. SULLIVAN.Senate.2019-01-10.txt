 Mr. President, I am glad I had the opportunity to vote  with my colleagues, the majority leader, and my colleagues from  Virginia and Maryland on the bill we just passed here on the Senate  floor to ensure the backpay for Federal workers who will be without  pay, and I hope we can get to a resolution soon on this partial  government shutdown that gets all elements of the government open and  fully funds the border and the significant amounts requested by the  White House that I think most Americans and most Alaskans need and  want.                            Tribute to Urban Rahoi    Mr. President, I hope that you and all the pages here--we have some  new pages in the staff here--had a great holiday season and that  everybody listening back home and watching back home in Alaska around  the country also had a wonderful holiday. I certainly did. It is always  great to be home in my State--spending time with family and my wife, my  daughters, and with friends--which to me is the greatest State in the  greatest country in the world.   Winter is a special time in Alaska. The sun may be low or in some  places it may not rise above the horizon at all, but there is a certain  glow that comes with the snow. With that glow and the Northern Lights  dancing in the sky, particularly in the interior--the place I am going  to talk about in a minute--it is magical. We want to assure anyone  watching to come to Alaska and you are going to have the trip of a  lifetime.   As I have said so many times on the floor of the Senate, it is the  people who make my State so special--tough, hearty, resilient people  who have lived some of the most amazing, meaningful, purposeful lives  and who have the wisdom, the character, the toughness, and, yes, even  the scars to prove it. Stories of character, stories of lives well- traveled, and stories of lives well-lived abound my State.   Last Saturday, in the great city of Fairbanks, AK, I had the great  opportunity and the honor to attend the 100th birthday party--I am  looking at the pages, who all just said ``wow''--of a legend in Alaska,  a man, certainly, of great stories but also of heart, of patriotism,  and of everything that makes Alaska and America great.   As you know, Mr. President, I come to the floor nearly every week,  while we are in session, to honor someone that I refer to as the  Alaskan of the Week, someone who makes our State and our country very  special. I want America right now--if you are watching on C-SPAN, in  the Gallery, or the press--to meet Urban Rahoi, our Alaskan of the  Week--a husband, a father, a veteran, a pilot, a hunting guide, a  developer, and a builder, just to name a few of his defining  characteristics.   Urban has lived a dozen lives, all in only one century--100 years  old. He helped to save America, and he helped to build Alaska--to save  this great Nation of ours and to build one of our greatest States. He  is our Alaskan of the Week.   I believe he may even be watching in Fairbanks--I hope you are,  Urban--in the pioneer home there, maybe with some of the Laundry House  Gang members, maybe even my father-in-law, Bud, and, Craig Compeau. I  hope you are all watching right now.   Urban has had such a full life that it is hard to know where to  start--100 years. Let me give you some of the highlights.   He was born on January 7, 1919, the day after Teddy Roosevelt died,  in Iron Mountain, MI. He grew up during the height of the Depression,  but Urban recently told a reporter with the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner  that the Depression for him and for his family wasn't that bad. His  family hunted. They grew their own food. They worked hard. He said:  ``We had a garden and we had 100 rabbits.'' In many ways, that is how  they got through the Depression.   He began to get interested in airplanes and in flying. When he was  just 15 years old, he took his first solo flight--at 15, a solo  flight--and he was forever hooked.   He was also hooked on the love of his life, whom he met when he was  21 years old, Vienna--Vi, everyone called her--and they got married in  1940.   In 1943, Urban joined the U.S. military during World War II, in the  Army Air Corps, and he flew bombers in North Africa and Italy. ``From  Italy, we would fly bombing missions into southern Germany, Austria,  Romania, and wherever they needed us''--dozens of bombing combat  missions.   And what did he fly? Appropriately, Urban Rahoi flew the B-17s, also  known as the ``Flying Fortresses.'' Those airplanes stayed in the air  even after some of the toughest battles and some of the most vicious  flak--tough as can be, just like Urban. Again, he was a B-17 pilot in  World War II, part of the greatest generation, which saved America and  saved this institution, among others, the U.S. Senate.  [[Page S135]]    Eventually, as it does with a certain kind of an adventurous person,  Urban heard the call of Alaska, and he flew to the State in a PA-12  Cub. He and Vi homesteaded on the Tanana River, near the Richardson  Highway, and began to make a life for themselves in Alaska.   What a rich life it was. They began a family, eventually having three  children--Rick, Eugene, and Holly. Urban also stayed active in the  military, as a member of the Air Force Reserve 449th Fighter Squadron,  in Alaska. He commanded the C-47 squadron and copiloted several  historic military aircraft, including the North American F-82 Twin  Mustang, the Lockheed F-94 Starfire, and the Northrup F-89 Scorpion.   This is a great pilot for America. He began offering private flying  services, and he also built two areas in terms of developments.  Together, they made up these trailer parks with 172 lots. Urban  designed the development of these areas and installed all of the  electrical lines, the water lines, and the septic system--all himself.   Think about that. What American can do that today? He also built a  lodge in an inholding in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.  If that were not enough, he became a big game guide in Alaska, running  a successful big game guiding business, and he built Ptarmigan Lake  Lodge, an inholding in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.   When Alaska became a State, guides were required to become  registered, and they had registration numbers. Urban Rahoi was issued  big game Alaska's State license No. 1--No. 1, the first.   All told, during his career as a pilot, he racked up an incredible  20,000 hours of flying--20,000 hours of flying. That is probably older  than some of you pages. He has seen so much, nearly every part of  Alaska. ``If someone's there, I've been there,'' he said recently,  about all the flights he has taken all over the great State of Alaska.   In 2012, the FAA presented Urban with the Wright Brothers Master  Pilot Award. Here is what the FAA wrote:         He has used his skill as an aviator to train airmen, fight       a war [for America], and maintain the safety standard in       commercial aviation. He has rescued people in trouble and       supplied people in . . . Bush [Alaska] with the necessities       of life. He has contributed to the state of Alaska, and       provided many people a chance to see the wild and beautiful       Alaska we all love.    The party for Urban's 100th birthday last Saturday in Fairbanks was  so reflective of the impact that he has had on the State, his community  in Fairbanks, and, of course, his country. Fairbanks is a tough, tough  place. I love Fairbanks. Fairbanks has been experiencing a bit of a  cold snap. Last Saturday, at Urban's 100th birthday party, it was 30  below zero in Fairbanks. That is a dangerous temperature for some but  not for the people of interior Alaska, who deal with that on a regular  basis. Despite 30-below temperatures, hundreds of people from the  interior of Alaska and beyond, from all walks of life, were there at  the Pioneer Parks' Centennial Center to honor this legend, this great  Alaskan, and this great American.   There were family and friends. We even had a special guest--the  football fans watching know him very well--former Miami Dolphins  football player and Hall of Famer Larry Csonka was there to celebrate  Urban's 100th birthday. Csonka had been sheep hunting at Urban's lodge,  and the two remained very, very close friends ever since.   One of Urban's goals is to be the first 100-year-old to participate  in a snowmachine race in Fairbanks--a race that Urban rides in every  year. Larry Csonka gave him an autographed Miami Dolphins football  helmet to wear as the helmet when Urban participates in this race this  year.   There was a life-sized cake with 100 candles, a slide show of  pictures of Urban and Vi at different phases of their lives--so many  different adventures, World War II, Alaska as a State, so much love, so  much life, so many people celebrating this great American.   I had the opportunity to talk a little bit about Urban at the  birthday party last Saturday in Fairbanks, and I mentioned that here  was a man who had so many qualities--patriotism, service, sacrifice,  perseverance, and, yes, even tougher than Larry Csonka. The football  fans watching know there are not many people in America who are tougher  than Csonka. Urban is, and Csonka acknowledged this.   The one person missing from this great celebration was his beloved  wife, who passed in Urban's arms on January 3, 2010, 3 days before  their 70th wedding anniversary.   She was 92 years old. Vi's memory lives on in their 3 children, 7  grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren, and 1 great-great-grandchild,  and her memory lives on in Urban's heart.   At the ceremony, my good friend who put it together, Craig Compeau,  was the emcee of this wonderful birthday party, and he interviewed  Urban. Toward the end of it, he asked him what the secret for such a  long life was--100 years old.   Urban said it could be summed up in two words: My wife.   Now, isn't that beautiful, America? Isn't that beautiful?   What a great man. What a great life.   So, Urban, here is to flying free, living well. Here is to the State  and the country we all--you--love so much. Here is to being part of the  ``greatest generation'' that saved America and built Alaska, and here  is to the example you have set for all of us, whether U.S. Senators,  whether pages, 100 years old, service to your country, dedication to  your wife. Thanks for all you have done. Thanks for all you have done  to protect and defend this great Nation, to build our great State, and  thank you, Urban, for being our Alaskan of the Week from the floor of  the U.S. Senate. Happy 100th birthday.   I yield the floor.
