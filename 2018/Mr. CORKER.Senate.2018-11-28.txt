 Mr. President, I know Senator Inhofe is trying to get to  fly home. Do we know the order here?    No.    We will both speak very briefly. Why don't you go ahead,  and then I will go.    Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue before us.   On every occasion, I too have done what is necessary to keep us from  alienating our ally Saudi Arabia. I think I was the last man standing,  during the Obama administration, in my trying to make sure that the  JASTA bill, at the time, ended up being corrected in such a manner that  it wouldn't have had unintended consequences. I did so unsuccessfully.  Yet, on multiple occasions, I have stood with others to make sure that  we have not blocked arms sales and that we have not done those things  that might have undermined our relationship.   For those who are tuning in, let me walk through what the process is.   We have a vote, today, on discharging this piece of legislation out  of the Foreign Relations Committee. That is all that is happening  today. There is an Executive Calendar in which we have cloture votes  pending on nominees. That will burn off. Then, sometime next week,  after this is discharged today--if it is so successfully--there will be  another vote to actually proceed to this bill. If we proceed to the  bill, what will happen will be a series of amendments that will be  voted upon. Then there will be another vote at the end of that as to  whether people will actually support the product that will have been  created.   I just want to make it clear that what I am not doing today is voting  for the substance before us; yet I reserve the right to do so. I am  voting on our ability to have a debate as it relates to our  relationship with Saudi Arabia.   We had a briefing today, which was very unsatisfactory, by two people  whom I highly respect. Secretary Mattis and Secretary Pompeo are two  people with whom I work closely and admire greatly. I found their  briefing today to be lacking. I found, in substance, that we are not  doing those things that we should be doing to appropriately balance our  relationship with Saudi Arabia between our American interests and our  American values.   There has been a lot of rhetoric that has come from the White House  and from the State Department on this issue. The rhetoric that I have  heard and the broadcast that we have made around the world as to who we  are has been way out of balance as it relates to American interests and  American values. As I said this morning in the SCIF, where we were  having this briefing, I hope that in the ensuing few days--maybe this  afternoon--the administration itself will take steps to rectify this  balance in an appropriate way.   As to whether the Crown Prince was involved in this killing, it is my  belief that he was. It is my belief that he ordered it, but I don't  have a smoking gun. What I do know is that he is responsible for this  agency that carried out the killing. He has done nothing to take  ownership of what has happened, and that is an affront not just to the  American people but to the world.   The administration, in its broadcast, in its referring to this issue,  has been way out of balance as it relates to what is important to us-- their buying arms from us but neglecting this other piece and not  demarching the leadership of Saudi Arabia in an important way. So what  I am doing today is voting to discharge this bill out of our committee.  There will be another opportunity next week to decide whether we will  proceed to it.   As I said to the administration again this morning, it is my hope  that it will figure out a way to bring American interests and American  values into balance so that it can cause the Saudi Arabian Government  to take appropriate ownership over what has happened in the killing of  this journalist. That, to me, would be the best solution. If not, we  will have another decision to make, and that will occur next week when  we will decide whether we want to proceed to that and then, after that,  proceed to deal with the issue of Saudi Arabia. There will be another  point in time at which we can decide whether we like the substance that  may be created in an amendment process in our going through this.   I support discharging this piece of legislation so that this body can  have a fulsome debate about our relationship with Saudi Arabia as to  what has happened with the journalist, the important issue of the war  in Yemen, and as to all of the things that we need to be doing as a  country to counter what Iran is doing in the region.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, out of respect for Senator Inhofe and a  personal issue he has to deal with, we would hope to be able to vote  early.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: November 27,       2018.        *As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             POLICY JUSTIFICATION   Qatar--Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and Related                      Equipment and Support for NASAMS         The Government of Qatar has requested to buy defense       articles and services from the U.S. Government in support of       a Direct Commercial Sale of the National Advanced Surface to       Air Missile System (NASAMS). The items Qatar requests include       the following: forty (40) AIM 120C-7 AMRAAM missiles, one (1)       spare AIM 120C-7 AMRAAM guidance section, one (1) spare AIM-      120C-7 control section, eight (8) AMRAAM Captive Air Training       Missile (CATM-120C), missile containers, classified software       for the AN/MPQ-64F1 Sentinel Radar, spare and repair parts,       cryptographic and communication security devices, precision       navigation equipment, other software, site surveys, weapons       system equipment and computer software support, publications       and technical documentation, common munitions and test       equipment, repair and return services and equipment,       personnel training and training equipment, integration       support and test equipment, and U.S. Government and       contractor, engineering, technical and logistics support       services, and other related elements of logistical and       program support. The estimated cost is $215 million.        This proposed sale supports the foreign policy and national       security objectives of the United States by helping improve       the security of a key partner which has been, and continues       to be, a significant host and member of coalition forces in       the Middle East.        This proposed sale improves Qatar's defense capability to       deter regional threats and strengthen its homeland defense.       The NASAMS capability would provide a full range of       protection from imminent hostile cruise missile, unmanned       aerial vehicle, rotary wing, and fixed wing threats. Qatar       will have no difficulty in absorbing this equipment.        The proposed sale will not alter the basic military balance       in the region.        The principal contractor and integrator will be Raytheon       Missiles Systems of Tucson, Arizona. There are no known       offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential       sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of additional U.S.  [[Page S7179]]       Government and contractor representatives to Qatar.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 18-43       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. AIM-120C Advance Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile       (AMRAAM) is a radar guided missile featuring digital       technology and micro-miniature solid-state electronics.       AMRAAM capabilities include look-down/shoot-down, multiple       launches against multiple targets, resistance to electronic       counter measures, and interception of high flying and low       flying and maneuvering targets. AIM-120 Captive Air Training       Missiles are non-functioning, inert missile rounds used for       armament load training, which also simulate the correct       weight and balance of live missiles during captive carry on       training sorties. Although designed as an air-to-air missile,       the AMRAAM can also be employed in a surface-launch mode when       integrated on systems such as National Advanced Surface-to-      Air System (NASAMS). The AIM-120C-7, as employed on NASAMS,       protects national assets from imminent hostile air threats.       The AMRAAM All Up Round is classified CONFIDENTIAL, major       components and subsystems range from UNCLASSIFIED to       CONFIDENTIAL, and technology data and other documentation are       classified up to SECRET.        2. The classified radar operational software utilized with       the exportable AN/MPQ-4F1 Sentinel Radar contains specific       Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM) capability, but it       does not contain Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR)/      classification capabilities. This software will be released       for export only in an executable format with no source code.       Without source code, the ability of a foreign company or       government to analyze the operating software, its processes,       and its algorithms is slowed. The highest classification of       this software is SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Qatar can provide       substantially the same degree of protection of this       technology as the U.S. Government. This proposed sale       furthers the U.S. foreign policy and national security       objectives outlined in the Policy Justification.        Moreover, the benefits to be derived from this sale, as       outlined in the Policy Justification, outweigh the potential       damage that could result if the sensitive technology were       revealed to unauthorized persons.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Qatar.                                   ____                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: November 27,       2018.        *As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             POLICY JUSTIFICATION                          Egypt--120MM Tank Rounds         This notification supersedes and replaces Transmittal No.       18-05 delivered to Congress on September 17, 2018. Although       the descriptions and quantities of all defense articles and       services are unchanged, the dollar values were under-reported       and are updated with this new transmittal.        The Government of Egypt has requested to buy forty-six       thousand (46,000) 120MM Target Practice--Tracer (M831A1) and       120MM Target Practice, Cone Stabilized, Discarding Sabot--      (M865) rounds and ten thousand (10,000) 120MM 4th-Generation       Kinetic Energy-Tungsten (KE-W) A4 Armor-Piercing Fin-      Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer (APFSDS-T) rounds.       Also included are four thousand five hundred (4,500) 120MM       Insensitive Munitions High Explosive with Tracer (IM HE-T)       tank rounds, field implementation, testing inspections,       spares and repair parts, support and test equipment, field       support publications and technical data, U.S. government and       contractor engineering and logistics support services,       personnel training and training equipment, quality assurance       team support services, preparation of ammunition for       shipment, ammunition delivery, component improvement program       and repair, other associated equipment and support, and other       related elements of logistical and program support. The       estimated cost is $201 million.        This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy       and national security of the United States by helping to       improve the security of a friendly country that continues to       be an important strategic partner in the Middle East.        The proposed sale will improve Egypt's capability to meet       current and future threats and provide greater security for       its critical infrastructure. Egypt will use the 120MM IM HE-T       cartridges to maintain a strategic munitions inventory for       its M1 Al tank fleet and in support of operations against       militants affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria       in the Sinai. They will use the target practice rounds to       train M1A1 crews in proper crew procedures in a training       environment using munitions that cost a fraction of tactical       rounds and have nearly zero explosive or penetrating       capability. Egypt has been producing this type of ammunition       under an existing coproduction agreement for approximately 15       years. Egypt intends to use the APFSDS-T rounds to replace       older model 120MM KE-W, KE-W Al, and KE-W A2 ammunition to       maintain a strategic munitions inventory for its M1A1 tank       fleet. Egypt will have no difficulty absorbing these       munitions into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of the munition and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor involved in this program is General       Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, St. Petersburg, FL.       There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection       with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will involve multiple       trips to Egypt involving up to six (6) U.S. Government and       contractor representatives over a period of up to 5 years.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                                   ____                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a strategic partner in the Middle East       region.        Egypt intends to expand its existing fleet of multi-mission       heavy attack helicopters to address U.S.-Egyptian interest in       countering terrorist activities emanating from the Sinai       Peninsula that undermine regional stability. This sale will       contribute to Egypt's military goal to update its capability       while further enhancing greater interoperability between       Egypt, the U.S., and other allies. Egypt will have no       difficulty absorbing these additional helicopters into its       inventory.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors involved in this program are the       Boeing Company, Meza, AZ, Lockheed Martin Corporation,       Orlando, FL, General Electric Company, Cincinnati, OH,       Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors, Owego, NY, and       Raytheon Corporation, Tucson, AZ. There are no known offset       agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require twenty       five (25) U.S. Government or contractor representatives to       travel to the Government of Egypt for a period of 12 weeks       for equipment checkout and training.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 17-43       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopter is an armed attack       rotary wing aircraft in the Army inventory. The airframe       itself does not contain sensitive technology; however, the       aircraft contains communication and target identification       equipment, navigational equipment, aircraft survivability       equipment, displays and sensors. The highest level of       classified material required to be released for training,       operation and maintenance is UNCLASSIFIED; however, the       highest level which could be revealed through reverse       engineering or testing items is SECRET. Components considered       to contain sensitive technology in the proposed case are as       follows:        a. AN/AVR-2B, Laser Detecting Set--The AN/AVR-2B is a       passive laser warning system that enhances crew situational       awareness by detecting, identifying and characterizing all       three types of laser threats 360 degrees in azimuth and +/-45       degrees in elevation relative to the aircraft. The sensor       units--each measuring approximately 8 inches long by 7 inches       wide by 3 inches high, and weighing approximately 2.4       pounds--are mounted externally to provide aircraft protection       in four quadrants. The externally mounted sensor units detect       laser illumination over the entire aircraft. In operation,       the laser warning system identifies the threat's direction       and prioritizes in order of lethality. The hardware is       classified CONFIDENTIAL; releasable technical manuals for       operation and maintenance are classified SECRET.        b. AN/AAR-57, Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) CMWS       provides superior detection of infrared missile threats for       rotary-wing, transport and tactical aircraft. It is the       detection component of a suite of countermeasures to increase       the survivability of current generation of combat, airlift       and special operations aircraft against the threat posed by       infrared guided missiles. Each platform includes: Electro-      optical Missile Sensors, and Electronic Control Unit (ECU)       Sequencer, and the Improved Countermeasures Dispenser (ICMD).       The ECU hardware is classified CONFIDENTIAL; releasable       technical manuals for operation and maintenance are       classified SECRET.        c. Honeywell Embedded Global Positioning Systems (GPS) with       Inertial Navigation System (INS) (EGI). GPS/INS utilizes GPS       satellite signals to correct or calibrate a solution from an       INS. Inertial navigation systems usually can provide an       accurate solution only for short duration. The INS       accelerometers produce an unknown bias signal that appears as       a genuine specific force. The EGI is UNCLASSIFIED.        d. Target Acquisition and Designation Sights, Pilot Night       Vision System (TADS/PNVS). The TADS/PNVS is the combined       sensor and targeting unit fitted to the Boeing AH-64 Apache       helicopter. Both systems are independent, but housed       together. TADS contain stabilized electro-optical sensors, a       laser rangefinder and laser target designator. The TADS       assembly can rotate +/-120 degrees in azimuth, +30/-80       degrees in elevation and can move independently of the PNVS.       TADS contains a tomographic camera and monochrome daylight       television camera. PNVS is a mounted above the TADS, and       contains an infrared camera slaved to the head movements of       the pilot. PNVS can rotate +/-90 degrees in azimuth and +20/-      45 degrees in elevation; with a high rate of movement (120       degrees per second) so as to match the head movement of the       pilot. Hardware for the TADS/PNVS is UNCLASSIFIED. The       technical manuals for authorized maintenance levels are       UNCLASSIFIED. Reverse engineering is not a major concern.        e. The AGM-114R HELLFIRE Missile is precision strike, Semi-      Active Laser (SAL) guided missile and is the principle air to       ground weapon for the AH-64 Apache. The SAL HELLFIRE missile       is guided by laser energy reflected off the target. It has       three warhead variants: a dual warhead, shape-charge, high       explosive anti-tank capability for armored targets, a blast       fragmentation warhead for urban patrol boat and other soft       targets and metal augmented charge warhead for urban       structures. AGM-114R allows selection of warhead effects       corresponding to a specific target type. Hardware for the       AGM-114R is UNCLASSIFED. The technical manuals for authorized       maintenance levels are UNCLASSIFIED.        f. The AN/APR-39D(V)2 Radar Warning Receiver is currently       in development with a projected IOC date of 4Q2017, and will       replace the AN/APR-39A(V)1/4 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)       that has been in production since the mid-1970's. The AN/APR-      39D(V)2 is an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) that fixes       documented deficiencies against legacy AN/APR-39 systems by       merging the AN/APR-39C(V)2 baseline with Northrop Grumman's       Digital Receiver Excited (DRE) technology and combines a 4-      Channel Crystal Video Receiver(CV R) and a 2 channel Digital       Receiver (DR). The result is the following capability       improvements: increased Probability of Detection       (Sensitivity); Corrects ID/Ambiguity Resolution; Improves DOA       Accuracy versus Circular Polarized (CP) Emitters; and       improves DOA Indications  [[Page S7181]]       versus CID Band Emitters. System will be classified at the       SECRET level.        g. The M36E9 Captive Air Training Missile (CATM) is a       HELLFIRE training missile (Non-NATO) that consists of a       functional guidance section coupled to an inert missile bus.       The missile has an operational semi-active laser seeker that       can search for and lock-on to laser designated targets for       pilot training, but it does not have a warhead or propulsion       section and cannot be launched.        2. A determination has been made that Egypt can provide       substantially the same degree of protection of this       technology as the U.S. Government. This proposed sale is       necessary in furtherance of U.S. foreign policy and national       security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification.       Moreover, the benefits to be derived from this sale, as       outlined in the Policy Justification, outweigh the potential       damage that could result if the sensitive technology were       revealed to unauthorized persons.        3. All defense articles and services listed on this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Egypt.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the Committee on Foreign Relations I  report favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in  the Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save  the expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these  nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of  Senators.
