 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Conster Davis and  to wish her a very happy 100th birthday.   Ms. Davis is a citizen of south Texas whose life has been  characterized by a servant-hearted desire to help others and to work  hard.   During World War II, she drove rivets into airplane wings, playing  her part, along with countless other American women, in the war effort.   Today, at 100 years old, she spends her time supporting the students  and staff at Galvan Elementary School in Corpus Christi, Texas, where  she is affectionately known as Granny Davis.   She mentors the pre-K students and helps teachers with clerical work.  She also served as a Senior Corps Foster Grandparent for 25 years,  mentoring young people and pouring into them during some of the most  formative years of their lives.   Ms. Davis loves caring for young people and shows it by investing  much of her time and energy into the children of Corpus Christi.   It is difficult to imagine the tremendous impact Ms. Conster Davis  has had in living a life of service that continues today to impact  generation after generation.   On behalf of the people of the 27th Congressional District of Texas,  I am proud to honor her life and service.                            ____________________
