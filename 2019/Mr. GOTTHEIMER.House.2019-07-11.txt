 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Smith, Ranking Member  Thornberry, and all the Armed Services Committee members for all their  hard work on this bill.   I rise in support of the en bloc package, which contains four  amendments I have introduced.   Mr. Chair, Iran has engaged in reckless conduct, destabilizing the  region, with their attacks on allied tankers near the Strait of Hormuz  and with the support of terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah  and Hamas. We must remain vigilant with Iran.   My amendment ensures that the Defense Department reports on threats  to freedom of navigation on all international waterways.   My second amendment directs the Defense and State Departments to send  recommendations to Congress to improve the Cooperative Threat Reduction  Program. This will help eliminate nuclear material and prevent  proliferation.   My third amendment prohibits funds and support from going to foreign  terrorist organizations, including Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian  Islamic Jihad, al-Shabaab, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,  by adding these to the prohibited list in section 1224 of this bill. We  must stop terrorism in its tracks.   Finally, brave Americans of every background have served in our Armed  Forces, including Jewish American veterans who fought Nazis in World  War II.   My fourth amendment requires the Defense Department to question  whether our Active Duty servicemembers have experienced anti-Semitism  while bravely serving our country.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for this bipartisan en bloc package of  amendments.
