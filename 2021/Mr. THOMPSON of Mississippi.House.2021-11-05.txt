 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Massachusetts for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule and the  underlying legislation.   President Biden has a bold vision for getting our country back on  track after a devastating pandemic and years of policies that ignored  the struggles of so many Americans.   What we are doing here today is about making government work for  working people.   The Committee on Homeland Security, which I lead, has used this  historic opportunity to make significant long-term investments in three  areas: cybersecurity; the protection of houses of worship and  nonprofits from domestic terrorism and other threats; and reducing the  Department of Homeland Security's environmental footprint. These are  three critical challenges confronting our Nation and my constituents in  Mississippi today.   Last week, we marked 3 years since the deadliest attack on a Jewish  community in United States history when a mass shooting took 11 lives  in a Pittsburgh synagogue.   Today, through the homeland security title of this act, we will be  able to give $100 million in new funding to help protect our houses of  worship.   This act also includes targeted funding to bolster the Nation's  cybersecurity posture in significant ways. With the $500 million  included there, we can do just that.   Finally, we include $900 million in strategic investment to help DHS  reduce its carbon footprint. Such investments have far-reaching and  direct impacts on our national security.   I thank Budget Committee Chairman   John Yarmuth and Speaker Pelosi  for their months of hard work and for prioritizing homeland security in  this transformational legislation.
