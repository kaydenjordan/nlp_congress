 Madam Speaker, the American people are facing persistent  pain in their wallets and pocketbooks, with inflation in August hitting  8.3 percent, higher than expectations.   But yesterday, hours after new inflation figures revealed that price  hikes are continuing to burden hardworking Americans, President Biden  held an event to celebrate the signing of the deceptively-named  Inflation Reduction Act into law, touting the radical legislation as a  victorious success.   The Inflation Expansion Act a success? Not quite. Not even close.   Grocery costs have surged nearly 14 percent, gas rose more than 33  percent, electricity costs have increased nearly  [[Page H7791]]  16 percent, rent almost 7 percent, and transportation has soared 11  percent.   Republicans warned that burning through billions of dollars in order  to expand the IRS by 87,000 new agents, advance Green New Deal  initiatives, and deliver crushing tax hikes would only plunge our  economy into deeper turmoil--worsening inflation and contributing to  our ballooning national debt.    Yet, Speaker Pelosi, Senate Leader Schumer, and President Biden  steamrolled ahead anyway--selfishly advancing their Big Government  Socialist agenda that costs the American people over 1 month's pay  every year. Yes, Americans are now losing a month's pay every year  because of Biden inflation.   Enough is enough. Americans simply cannot afford the cost of one- party Democrat rule in Washington any longer. We must prioritize  financial security and fiscal responsibility over runaway spending and  reckless monetary policies in order to provide American workers,  families, and small businesses, the economic relief they desperately  need.                                Border Crisis     Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the raging crisis  that continues to plague our southern border.   Since President Biden stepped foot into the Oval Office, his failed  policies and radical open border agenda have provoked an unprecedented  illegal alien invasion at our southern border.   While Vice President Kamala Harris, our so-called ``Border Czar,''  comically claims that the southern border is secure, the American  people know good and well that this is a blatant falsehood. But unlike  our delusional Border Czar, the numbers don't lie.   Nearly 5 million illegal aliens have crossed the southern border  since Biden and Harris took office. To make matters worse, 66  individuals on the Terrorist Screening Database have been stopped  trying to illegally enter our country--this is more than double the  last 5 years combined--double the last 5 years combined.   Furthermore, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has seized enough  fentanyl in this fiscal year alone to kill almost 2.4 billion people-- over seven times the U.S. population.   The southern border is, in fact, not secure, and the Biden  administration knows it. After all, chaotic open borders have always  been their plan. Unless the Biden administration abandons this sinister  scheme, communities across the country will only continue to be ravaged  by deadly drugs and border lawlessness.   It is simple: Americans deserve border security, not an  administration actively manufacturing mayhem, advocating for mass  amnesty, and emboldening dangerous cartels.   President Biden must immediately about-face on his open border  agenda, commit to securing our southern border, and finally put  American people first.                                 USDA Letter     Madam Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose the  Department of Agriculture's poultry line speed waiver rule.   Back in July, over 50 chicken plants that currently participate in  the U.S. Department of Agriculture's waiver program received a  notification from the Department stating that within 1 month these  plants must participate in a third-party study in order to retain their  line speed waivers.   In addition to granting a third-party group unlimited and unannounced  access to poultry plants, the study also requires these plants to  submit heaps of data and burdensome paperwork. Failure to participate  in this study results in chicken plants slowing production by 25  percent, creating supply chain mayhem in the industry, and undeniably  posing a serious threat to food availability.   The Biden administration's line speed waiver rule forces an ultimatum  on poultry plants, burdening both consumers and workers already  battling supply chain disruptions and hyperinflation, for the sake of a  vague, intrusive, and unnecessary third-party study on worker safety.   Since I represent and serve the ``Poultry Capital of the World,''  Gainesville, Georgia, I proudly led 34 of my colleagues in sending a  letter to USDA Secretary Vilsack expressing grave concerns about the  third-party study and urging the delay in the mandate.   Given the adverse effects this rule imposes on the industry and  poultry production, Secretary Vilsack must immediately provide  substantive answers to Congress about why this rule must be put in  place.   Madam Speaker, I am fully committed to conducting proper  congressional oversight into the USDA's line speed waiver so that we  can continue to run at full capacity.
