 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney for her good work  on this very issue, and I rise to condemn Postmaster General DeJoy's  assault on the U.S. Postal Service.    The organizational and operational changes he has been implementing  are a betrayal at this moment of the American people. They are turning  their backs on seniors and veterans in Pittsfield, North Adams,  Springfield, and Southbridge who rely upon the Postal Service for their  medications and other essential services.   The Postmaster General is dismantling a lifeline for people in every  community across the Commonwealth, but his actions particularly harm  those who live in some of the most rural areas in western  Massachusetts. These mail delays and disruptions will be harmful at any  time, but they are downright deadly during this pandemic. Families and  small businesses are desperately trying to stay safe and stay afloat as  the crisis rages on, and the Postal Service plays a critical role in  their survival.   Who else suffers due to the Postmaster General's actions? The  hardworking men and women who process and deliver our mail, essential  workers. He is compromising jobs for generations that have been a  pathway to the middle class, particularly in marginalized communities.   Our Nation's economy and the people's health rely upon the Postal  Service. So, too, does American democracy.   Millions will use this indispensable tool to cast their ballots this  year. They should not be discouraged. They should be encouraged by the  Postmaster General. The Postmaster General is directly attacking the  fundamental rights and well-being of all Americans.   I call upon him to step down now. His removal is urgently needed, as  are all the provisions in the Delivering for America Act.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and call on my  colleagues to do the same. A reminder: His support right now is  urgently needed to reverse what he has been doing and saying.
