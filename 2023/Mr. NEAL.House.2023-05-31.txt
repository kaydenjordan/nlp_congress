 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me point out that, as the chairman noted, he didn't  have the whole story, so we intend to spend the next hour filling in  the rest of the story.   We are here tonight because of a reckless position that was adopted  by the majority that was prepared to take this Nation to the precipice  of default. Thank goodness for Joe Biden's legislative skills, so we  will not go over the edge. We will preserve the full faith and credit  of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, just think of what was being proposed here. At risk was  the dollar as the international currency.   Do people have any idea what role treasuries play in terms of  international transactions? The American dollar drives the world's  economy, and they were prepared to take us over the edge with the  reckless spending plan that they have.   Thanks to Leader Jeffries and the measured tone that he took, we find  ourselves tonight with an agreement that we might not love--because it  is not about perfection. I stopped telling people that I was perfect 46  years ago when I ran for the Springfield City Council. After one  legislative session, I never professed to being perfect again.    There is give-and-take to negotiation, and it means precisely that  you give and you take. That is what we are acknowledging here this  evening.   That old sage of political thought got it right. Mick Jagger said:  ``You get what you need.''   Democrats can proudly say tonight that, with the help of Joe Biden,  we protected Social Security, protected Medicare, protected Medicaid,  and protected veterans benefits, all of which we have profoundly  embraced over these years.   How did we get here? This is about the CARES Act that saved the  American economy--22 million jobs gone, now 22 million jobs returned,  and 9\1/2\ million jobs going unanswered. This was a manufactured  crisis that brings us to this evening.   The President's experienced leadership in the face of divided  government in this body is one-half of one-third of the Federal  Government. We still have a ways to go.   Let's talk about why the bill ran up. It is on the CARES Act.  Republicans voted for more defense spending. Some Republicans voted for  the CHIPS Act, and some voted for the infrastructure bill.   Let me point out something, and I hope everybody is paying attention  to this: In December 2017, Republicans borrowed $2.3 trillion to  provide a tax cut to the wealthiest among us.   Mr. Speaker, do you know what the great irony of that is? Even the  wealthy wouldn't say they were asking for that tax cut. That is how we  got here.   Their default on America act, in an effort to balance the budget on  hardworking Americans' backs, tonight will be compromised. They  targeted food security and healthcare while ignoring tax loopholes.   Mr. Speaker, do you think around here we might someday close one tax  loophole?   The tax bill that we put out was well received everywhere, and it was  progrowth in nature.   Let me also point out something else by historical record this  evening. Republicans are always in favor, Mr. Speaker, of balancing the  budget when there is a Democratic President. That is the reality of it.  Let's not forget who put us in this situation.   In the last 25 years, Republicans have voted for $10 trillion worth  of tax cuts to the top 1 percent: 2001, $1.3 trillion; 2003, $1  trillion; and then their tax plan in December 2017, $2.3 trillion of  borrowed money.   They wanted to take the American economy hostage, and Joe Biden,  Leader Jeffries, and the Democratic Caucus pushed back to make sure  that the position that we have tonight, which we overwhelmingly intend  to support, is reasonable policy achieved because of the hard-nosed  negotiating of President Biden and Leader Jeffries.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, the previous gentleman left out infrastructure  [[Page H2695]]  spending, the CARES Act, defense spending, the CHIPS Act, and the PACT  Act, all of which had Republican support in terms of the expenditures.   Bill Clinton balanced the budget four straight times during his  Presidency, and the money was given away with big tax cuts in 2001 and  2003.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), who spent 6 hours in front of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson), my neighbor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), one of the most accomplished Speakers of the  House in the history of America.  [[Page H2696]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer), a champion of the Inflation Reduction Act and the tax  credits that were included.    Mr. Speaker, the distinguished majority leader failed to  mention that we raised the national debt three times during Donald  Trump's Presidency. He failed to point out that $8.7 trillion was added  to the national debt during Donald Trump's Presidency.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a productive member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis), a member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell), a very capable member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, there isn't anybody in this Chamber who  believes that Republicans will abide by a cap on defense spending in  the next year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene), a champion of the child tax credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), a very capable woman and member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee), whose voice and health have been returned.    I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Beyer), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, (Mr. Evans).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), another very capable member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta), a very capable member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the  Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), an alum of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr.   David Scott), the ranking member of the Committee on  Agriculture.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. Mrvan).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Speaker, I think that this has been an elevating conversation  about how we arrived here tonight. Our colleagues on the other side  voted for the infrastructure bill, voted for the CHIPS Act, voted for  the CARES Act, voted for the defense spending increases, and they voted  for a tax cut in 2017 that borrowed $2.3 trillion that was added to the  national debt.   Now, for those who might be paying attention tonight, the national  debt is the cumulative effect of deficits. These were annual deficits  that were run up.   Neither party is responsible for the pandemic. On March 11, 2020, we  were warned what was coming. Twenty million jobs evaporated. Tonight,  in some measure because of the leadership of Joe Biden, every one of  those jobs has been returned and 9\1/2\ million jobs go unanswered.   In this negotiation, which means you don't get everything you want,  there are some quality moments that we take great credit for. We  defended Social Security despite the fact that there were three  Republican Senators who proposed cuts to Social Security. That is the  reality. We defended Medicare. We defended Medicaid. We defended  veterans benefits. We are very proud of the fact that we wrote the  pandemic relief act.   There is a group here tonight--I have been here long enough to know  this--that was against this before they were against it. They were  against it years ago, never mind tonight--this moment of bringing the  Nation to default, what it would do to the American dollar as the  currency of choice for the world, what this would do in treasury  markets for liquidity purposes, what this would do to the hard-earned  401(k) plans of the American family, to take us to this moment, this  showdown that we had.   This argument tonight was never about perfection. All 435 Members of  this House would probably have written a different version of this  bill. In a divided government, that is not reality.   The last point I want to make is this: In the coming days, after this  righteous debate about balancing the budget, our Republican colleagues  are about to offer a massive tax cut. We need to be ready because of  the fiscal rectitude that they have offered on this floor tonight. The  corresponding responsibility of all of us is to point out what they  intend to do with another tax cut--2001, $1.3 trillion, and by the way,  with two wars and 2 million more veterans that we need to support.   The other reality is that back in 2003 was another trillion dollars  of tax cuts. The worst one of all was that tax cut in December 2017,  where they borrowed $2.3 trillion for a tax cut that went to the  wealthiest among us and had very meager economic growth.                                time  2100    This debate tonight was a good and spirited one because we also, I  think, have found a common purpose in passing this legislation.   Let's engage in this debate going forward. If we want the things that  we say they want, then we are going to have to pay for them. That  means, at some point, revisiting these tax cuts that have been put on  the table in an arbitrary fashion and, as I noted, with borrowed money.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
