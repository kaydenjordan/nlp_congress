 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this bipartisan amendment addresses the  needs of Native Americans living in urban areas by making victim  advocates available in State courts for urban Indians under the STOP  Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program for States.   In 2018, the State STOP grant program awarded 56 awards totaling over  $154 million to State programs to provide funding for victim services  to address sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and  stalking through State initiatives to enhance existing programs and  fill gaps in services.   Currently, the State STOP grant program is used to strengthen  partnerships between Tribal and non-Tribal stakeholders to improve  responses to Native American victims, but there is no requirement for  State grant activities to prioritize the hiring of in-court victim  advocates for urban Indians.   Frequently, the subgrantees of this program are community-based  organizations, which are chronically underfunded, short-staffed, and  not able to specifically address the needs of urban Indian victims.   This leaves urban Native victims without any resources, which are  severely needed within State courts and which could easily be remedied  by hiring in-court State victim advocates. This is especially true in  light of the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women, to break  the cycle of generational trauma and violence.   Due to devastating Federal policies, like forced relocation and  removal, 71 percent of the Native American population lives in urban  areas. Urban cities with high populations of Native Americans include  places like Phoenix; Seattle; Los Angeles; and in my district,  Albuquerque.   Recent reports by the Urban Indian Health Institute identified 506  cases of missing and murdered indigenous women across 71 urban cities.  My State of New Mexico ranked number one for the highest number of  missing and murdered indigenous women cases, which was 78.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the bipartisan cosponsors of this amendment,  Representatives Grijalva, Cole, Gallego, Moore, Young, Case, Soto,  Davids, and Torres, for their support. I ask my colleagues to help  these Native American women who are the victims of violence.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  [[Page H3055]]     Mr. Chairman, I offer this bipartisan amendment to  improve public safety in Indian Country through the Tribal Access  Program, or TAP, which is an existing information-sharing system for  Tribes in Indian Country.   The Tribal Access Program administered through the Department of  Justice is an effective method of sharing criminal conviction  information between Tribal, local, State, and Federal law enforcement  agencies.                                time  1845    TAP allows law enforcement officers in neighboring jurisdictions to  see each other's restraining orders, warrants, and exclusion orders  across jurisdictional boundaries to improve public safety.   Having this information is critical to keeping victims of domestic  violence safe from harm, but, unfortunately, the Department of Justice  has told many Tribes they don't qualify to participate. Although the  statute says that any Tribal government can access this data, the DOJ  rejects applications from Tribes that don't specifically have arrest  authority.   Under my amendment, a Tribal government with a designated public  safety agency, regardless of their ability to detain and arrest  perpetrators, will have access and the ability to enter information  into the TAP program.   I want to be clear that my amendment does not allow these designated  public safety departments or agencies to determine criminal  convictions. That is a determination made by courts through due  process. This amendment only allows information sharing and access to  TAP to better communicate between public safety departments on  reservations that are frequently limited in resources.   The stakes are too high to continue to deny Tribes that are already  struggling from resources to keep people safe in Indian Country access  to this important information.   For example, I heard from a Tribe that one of their members had a  preexisting restraining order against her abuser; however, when the  perpetrator entered the reservation, the Reservation Patrol--a Tribal  public safety agency without arrest authority--unknowingly allowed the  abuser to enter the reservation because they did not have access to  information about the existing restraining order.   The violation of the restraining order against the unsuspecting  victim could have been prevented if the Reservation Patrol had the  ability to access the criminal history of the abuser through TAP.   Denying Tribal public safety departments access to information that  can prevent crimes, particularly violence against women, is  unconscionable.   The chronic lack of public safety resources in Indian Country,  including inadequately staffed law enforcement agencies and lack of  cell phone and internet service for communication, already puts Tribes  behind in protecting their members.   If this were about any other community located off the reservation,  it is likely this amendment wouldn't be at issue today.   I thank the bipartisan cosponsors of this amendment--Representatives  Young, Cook, Grijalva, Cole, Gallego, Ruiz, Case, Soto, Davids, and  Torres--for their support and ask my colleagues to help give Tribal  public safety departments the information they need to protect Native  American women from violence.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
