 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5367, a bill  the Democrats claim will reduce inflation when, in reality, it will do  the exact opposite.   American families are struggling to keep the lights on at home. Far  too many people in this country are worrying about the costs associated  with putting food on their table and gas in their tanks. And yet, the  majority has decided now is the time to double down on their tax-and- spend policies with American taxpayers footing the bill.   It is also concerning that this bill promotes anti-American energy  policies. It will put aside $250 billion at the Department of Energy to  subsidize the rush to green energy. This is picking winners and losers  in the energy market and will scare away investments in baseload power  sources.   American small businesses need access to more reliable energy, not  less. If the grid becomes too reliant on intermittent green energy  sources, we will begin to see manufacturers shutter their operations.   Although it is hard to see how this bill could be salvaged, I did  offer an amendment to try to prevent this outcome. My amendment would  have required the Secretary of Energy to certify that the bill would  not negatively impact electric grid reliability before funding could be  used.   Considering the devastating consequences that would result for  American families and businesses, it makes perfect sense that the  government should do its due diligence in examining all possible  outcomes.   Unfortunately, the majority chose not to consider my amendment on the  House floor today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  legislation because it will increase taxes on American families,  institute price controls that will block innovation and medical cures,  promote irresponsible spending on Green New Deal carve-outs and provide  significant risks to the electric grid.
