 Mr. Speaker, Democrats are politicizing the Justice  Department and embarking on a witch hunt, this time to go after  parents.   Parents across the country are bravely taking a stand to protect  their children against overly restrictive COVID-19 mandates and  identity politics indoctrination. In response, the Biden administration  is weaponizing law enforcement agencies to intimidate them into  silence.   Some parents have crossed the line. Harassing and threatening school  officials is unacceptable.   But there is no evidence that parents pose a widespread threat to  school administrators. Yet, the National School Boards Association is  asking the Biden administration to treat these parents like domestic  terrorists.   Attorney General Merrick Garland's outrageous memo, giving credence  to these accusations, shows the Biden administration cares more about  appeasing special interests than Americans concerned about their  children.   This attack on the First Amendment cannot continue. Parents must be  allowed to stand up for their kids.                            ____________________
