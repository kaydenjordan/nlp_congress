 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to continue to highlight the  abhorrent record of President Biden's U.S. Supreme Court nominee,  Ketanji Brown Jackson, commonly known as KBJ.   In a posthearing written question and answer from members of the  Senate Judiciary Committee, KBJ refused to comment on whether she  believes an individual possesses natural rights.   This is unacceptable. The Declaration of Independence is crystal  clear. ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are  created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain  unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness.''   Yet, Ketanji Brown Jackson does not hold a position on whether  individuals possess natural rights. This is disqualifying, plain and  simple.   Any Senator, Republican or Democrat, that votes to confirm KBJ later  this week isn't just voting for a soft-on-crime, woke judge. They are  also voting for a judge who does not recognize the natural rights, or  civil rights which come from the natural rights, given to us by our  heavenly creator, dangerously ignoring the fundamental foundation of  our American values.                            ____________________
