 Mr. Chair, my friends on the other side of the aisle seem  unconcerned about the threat the COVID-19 virus poses to public health.  They have shown that consistently over the time of the pandemic.   They have dismissed the severity of the virus. The previous  Republican Party President dismissed it, too, and tried to claim that  you could just solve it with a light bulb going into your body  somewhere or drinking some type of Clorox.   They have dismissed the science behind masking and social distancing.  They have dismissed vaccinations. They have dismissed peer-reviewed  science. They have condemned Dr. Fauci, who is an American hero who  guided us through this pandemic that cost the lives of over 1 million  Americans dying of COVID over the last 3 years. The Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention says that there are over 500 Americans dying  each day from COVID.   I believe in science. I believe in specialists. I believe in doctors.  CDC is the specialist here.   My colleagues on the other side are very concerned about China, but  now they are not concerned about China--which has one of the biggest  COVID problems of any place in the globe--having visitors come to our  Nation without having been vaccinated.   This is a threat to the health of the American people directly from  China. They are concerned about China, but not now.   I would submit most of my colleagues on the other side are vaccinated  against COVID, vaccinated against polio, vaccinated against all types  of diseases, but all of a sudden, they don't want to give any authority  to the CDC to protect us from countries that don't have vaccination  requirements.   Science first. Dollars and sense, s-e-n-s-e. That is what we ought to  have.
