 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak out against white  supremacy. As a Christian, I live my life by the guidance and teachings  of Jesus Christ and by the many great lessons in the Bible.   Matthew 7:12 tells us: ``So whatever you wish that others would do to  you, do also to them.''   This is the golden rule, that we treat every person as we wish to be  treated. This is why I stand here today to say that there is no place  for white supremacy, anti-Semitism, racism, or bigotry of any kind in  Congress.
