 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize JerriAnne  Boggis of Milford and Valerie Cunningham of Portsmouth as February's  Granite Staters of the Month for their work to bring to light New  Hampshire's too often forgotten Black history and engage communities  across our State in conversations about New Hampshire's full past.   JerriAnne has said that it took 25 years after emigrating from  Jamaica to New Hampshire for her to discover that New Hampshire had a  Black history. JerriAnne was surprised to learn that the town she lived  in, Milford, was home to Harriet E. Wilson, one of the first African  Americans in North America to publish a novel. To commemorate Harriet's  incredible achievement, JerriAnne established a nonprofit organization  to erect a statue of Harriet, which also marked the first statue in New  Hampshire to honor a person of color.   Valerie grew up in Portsmouth, where her parents were leaders of the  local civil rights movement and encouraged their daughter to explore  New Hampshire's Black history. Valerie followed her parents'  encouragement and spent years documenting African and African-American  history in New Hampshire. Valerie would later go on to create a  physical embodiment of her decades of research by establishing the  Portsmouth Black Heritage Trail in 1995, with the intent of bringing  public awareness to Portsmouth's Black history.   Today, the Portsmouth Black Heritage Trail has expanded to become the  Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire. The foundation that Valerie  founded is now led by JerriAnne, the trail's executive director.  JerriAnne is working to expand the organization's mission to other  towns across New Hampshire with the hope of growing public awareness of  the Black history that exists in every region of the State.   The Black Heritage Trail plays an important role in engaging Granite  Staters about the complex topic of race in America. To help jumpstart  these necessary conversations, the organization hosts community  dialogues, called Tea Talks, focused on discussing the intersection of  race with different facets of American life, including health,  education, and the arts. It also hosts a variety of events throughout  the year, including the Black New England Conference, held last year at  Southern New Hampshire University.   The Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire brings a long overdue focus  on our State's Black history. African Americans in New Hampshire have  made profound contributions to our State, and thanks in part to the  work of JerriAnne and Valerie, these stories and achievements will be  remembered in history. It is a great honor to recognize the work of  these women and their dedication to creating a more informed,  inclusive, and just New Hampshire.                            ____________________
