 Mr. Speaker, the Republican party has historically  been, and I believe is still today, the voice for those who have no  voice. We value life and believe all people should be treated with  dignity.   I appreciate the gentleman from Texas for leading this discussion  tonight, for his compassion for people, and for his passion to serve  Texas and America.   Mr. Speaker, tonight, I not only rise to address the growing crisis  on our southern border, but to be a voice for the persecuted. In an  interview aired this morning, President Biden told migrants not to come  to the United States, but still refused to recognize the situation as a  crisis. Actions speak louder than words. It doesn't matter what you say  when it doesn't match what you do.   Such a directive is pointless, considering there are no policy  changes to de-motivate the migrant surge, the likes of which the United  States hasn't seen in 20 years. Our facilities and agencies are being  overwhelmed by the surge.   President Biden offered an open invitation for parents to send their  children across the border without fear of being turned away. The  result is catastrophic. While there have been migrant surges in the  past, there has never been such a prolific number of unaccompanied  minors.   These policies are a driving incentive for parents to give their  children to coyotes and traffickers who will abuse and use them,  causing lifelong trauma. Over 500 children are crossing the border  daily, including unaccompanied kids as young as 6 years old. These  children are threatened and coerced by cartels to carry drugs over the  border and exploited by sex traffickers.   One in three women--one in three women, Mr. Speaker, will be  assaulted as they attempt to make the journey.   I just witnessed my colleagues from across the aisle spending an hour  honoring women's history. What kind of history are the left's policies  writing for these women? Young women, young women as young as 13 years  old are being lured to Texas with the promise of a job in the service  industry, and instead, are being sexually abused and trafficked.                                time  2115    What we are seeing now is but a fraction of what we could see in the  coming months. This is the Biden administration's responsibility, and  President Biden owes the American people answers.   But President Biden is not alone. The majority party is neglecting  their oversight responsibilities and aiding and abetting these  dangerous actions.   I am calling on President Biden and congressional Democrats--who I  remind you are the majority in both Chambers--to take responsibility  for the border crisis and work to fix it and to take responsibility for  the trauma these children will endure on the journey across the border.   Customs and Border Protection has informed Congress that four people  on the FBI's terrorist watch list were apprehended at the border. If  four were caught, how many got through? What is their intent?   One day, Democrats are the arsonists, and the next week, the  firefighters. They have pulled this trick on every issue, including  energy, Medicare, and now our border. To bring partisan immigration  bills to the floor without even an opportunity to amend the bills is  bad governance anytime, but it is downright insensitive during this  crisis.   We are a nation of immigrants, and I support all legal immigration.  But  [[Page H1493]]  open border policies are a direct threat to our national security and  have created a humanitarian crisis. We should secure our borders and  work on bipartisan legislation to address immigration issues, but  Democrats refuse to even enforce existing laws.   Mr. Speaker, what good is a new immigration law when there is no  evidence that it will be enforced?
