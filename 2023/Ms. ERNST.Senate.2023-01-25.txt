 Thank you, Vice Chair Capito. Wow. It is great to have  another woman in leadership and leading these floor events now.    Madam President, I do want to thank my friend and  colleague Senator Capito of West Virginia for her leadership in  bringing Senate Republicans to the floor to talk about what is a very  important issue to all of our constituents--the safety and the security  of our great Nation.   Joe Biden created a crisis that has now turned into a complete  catastrophe--one a mere photo op at a cleaned-up site in Texas won't  fix. In just 2 years, under President Biden, over 4 million illegal  immigrants have crossed the southern border--151 who are on the terror  watch list. To top that off, we know of at least 1.2 million  individuals who evaded the authorities. Those are the individuals we  call the ``got-aways.''   This border catastrophe is so much more than a flood of illegal  immigrants hoping to jump the legal immigration line to get in the  door. An open border is an invitation for mischief. It is a drug lord's  dream.   In my home State of Iowa, drug overdoses among young people have  risen 120 percent in the last few years. According to the State's  Division of  [[Page S88]]  Criminal Investigation, there were four times the amount of fentanyl  pills disguised as prescription drugs in 2022 as compared to the  previous year.   We must act now to counter this deadly fentanyl epidemic. We, as  lawmakers, should make the distribution of fentanyl resulting in death  punishable by Federal felony murder charges. It is past time the  consequences for intentionally inflicting an overdose fits the crime.   The cartels producing and smuggling this deadly drug into the United  States are also funneling a significant number of illegal firearms and  weapons, leading to barbaric violence. Just last week in California, a  family of six, including a 10-month-old baby girl, was killed in a drug  cartel execution. Unfortunately, the suspects are still at large.   Folks, this death and devastation cannot continue. In the coming  weeks, I am looking forward to leading a bicameral delegation to the  California-Mexico border. There, we plan to hear directly from Customs  and Border Protection personnel about fentanyl and their ongoing drug  interdictions. We will tour the port in San Diego--the epicenter for  fentanyl trafficking into the United States--and get a firsthand look  at the dangerous and critical work our Border Patrol agents are doing  day in and day out.   I anticipate a common theme in all of our conversations: the need to  physically secure our border, something my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle used to support.   In 2007, then-Senator Joe Biden argued:         No great country can say it's secure without being able to       secure its borders.    In 2010, Senator Chuck Schumer supported border security and agreed  the border lacked ``the resources to fully combat the drug smugglers,  gun runners, human traffickers, money launderers, and organized  criminals that seek to do harm to innocent Americans along our  border.''   Amen, folks. I agree with both of them. But where is that same  attitude now, when the southern border has become immensely more  dangerous, more permeable, and more lethal?   At every single one of my townhalls, over the past 3 weeks, and in  dozens of interviews with Iowa media, I was asked about the crisis at  the southern border.   So, to those on the left who say this is just a Republican stunt, I  think you had better get out of the beltway and into Middle America,  hear directly from the people you are supposed to serve, and you will  quickly find out it is no stunt; it is reality.   Iowa families want solutions. They want safety, and they want to  curtail the ever-increasing access to deadly drugs for their children,  and they are not alone. The American people want a solution. In fact,  over a majority of Americans--73 percent, according to one Pew Research  poll--say they believe we need to increase security along the U.S.- Mexico border.   It is a great place to start, a place to find common ground.   In fact, there are left over border materials from the Trump  administration just lying out in the desert, materials that taxpayers  have paid for that are just collecting dust. And get this: The Federal  Government is actually paying--yes, they have hired contractors, and  they spend our tax dollars to do this--to watch over those materials  that are lying there in the desert.   Without a secure border, we cannot have a larger conversation about  reforming our immigration system.   So maybe, just maybe, a good place to start is for this  administration to allow States that want to complete the border barrier  to do so, instead of taking them to court.   Besides, doesn't Biden's Justice Department have enough on their  hands right now?   So I agree with the Senator from West Virginia that this is an issue  that needs to be addressed.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
