 Madam Speaker, rising gas prices and  skyrocketing inflation are having major impacts on small businesses. In  Hico, Texas, Mark Chapman of the Chapman Cattle Company said it best:  ``We see smaller revenue and return on our products when the prices of  gas increase, and it may be the death of small businesses, ranchers,  and farmers, as we know it.''   Chapman Cattle Company is one of the many small businesses that are  struggling to keep up with record-high gas prices due to President  Biden's anti-energy agenda.   Democrats continue to ignore Main Street's plea to get gas prices  down and inflation under control. Small businesses weathered tough  economic conditions throughout the pandemic only to be met with Biden's  Green New Deal agenda that threatens everybody in all communities  forever.   I will continue to fight for small businesses, work to get the  government out of our lives, and let the free market compete and do  great things.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
