 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Right  to Contraception Act.   Family planning is a private decision, and contraception should  always be legal, from prophylactics to Plan B.   The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs has opened Pandora's box. For  some Justices, judges, and State legislators, the next steps include  rolling back established rights and precedents, including the right to  contraception.   That is why the Right to Contraception Act is so important. This  legislation establishes a statutory right to obtain contraceptives and  for healthcare providers to provide them. It protects Americans from  State and local legislation that would deny people's access to  contraceptives.   From reproductive care to LGBTQ rights, and now to contraceptives,  Congress has a responsibility to stop State governments from rolling  back our rights. My granddaughters shouldn't have fewer rights than my  daughter had. Pass the Right to Contraception Act.
