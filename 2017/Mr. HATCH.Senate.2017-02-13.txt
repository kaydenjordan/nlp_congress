 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are currently in the midst of the  longest transitional leadership gap at the Department of Treasury in  our Nation's history. The Senate has never let this much time go  without a Treasury Secretary. In fact, the Senate has never left  Treasury without a confirmed Secretary in between administrations for  this long. Yet, despite the obvious need to fill this position, we have  had to deal with continual and pointless delays, courtesy of some of  our colleagues.   I will not begrudge any Senator for taking advantage of the  privileges offered to them under the rules of the Senate; however, I  think we have ample reason to question some of our colleagues' judgment  and priorities with regard to how we have dealt with the nomination of  Steven Mnuchin to the Office of Treasury Secretary.  [[Page S1102]]    Let's get the obvious points out of the way. Mr. Mnuchin has 30  years' experience working in a variety of capacities in the financial  sector. He has experience managing large and complicated private-sector  enterprises and in negotiating difficult compromises and making tough  decisions--and being accountable for those decisions. He has the  support of a number of key organizations and associations within the  finance industry, and experts across the ideological spectrum have  endorsed his nomination.   Long story short: Under any objective standard, Mr. Mnuchin has ample  experience, credentials, and qualifications for this important  position. Yet my colleagues have done all they can under the rules-- even to the point of casting aside some longstanding customs and  traditions of the Senate--in order to delay his confirmation.   I will not relive the entire chain of events that got this nomination  through the Finance Committee, bringing us to this point. For now, I  would urge my colleagues to look fairly at the record. In every case,  as the committee processed his nomination, Mr. Mnuchin responded to  questions and allegations with full and complete answers and  demonstrated no signs of acting or responding in bad faith toward the  committee or its members.   People are free, I suppose, to walk into the confirmation process  with an assumption of bad faith. But throughout my time in the Senate-- and keep in mind, I have been here a long time--that isn't usually how  we operate around here.   My colleagues on the other side have put forward a number of claims  and allegations about Mr. Mnuchin. They have essentially thrown  everything, including the kitchen sink, at this nominee in a desperate  attempt to block his confirmation. Well, so far, nothing has worked.  That is because none of the allegations my colleagues have raised can  withstand even a modest amount of scrutiny. But that hasn't stopped  some of them from trying.   I have found it particularly interesting to see my friends raise  concerns about matters that did not bother them in the least when it  came to voting for Democratic nominees for Treasury Secretary. Indeed,  with regard to Mr. Mnuchin, my Democratic colleagues have created a  wholly new set of standards from those that were applied to the most  recent previous Treasury Secretary. Many issues that seemed to be of  little or no concern to my colleagues and my friends on the other side  during the confirmation process for Secretary Jack Lew have been  considered disqualifying for Mr. Mnuchin. By the way, many of these  problems existed in the prior Treasury Secretary too. But we, in good  faith, brought him through and allowed him to go through without a lot  of fuss and bother.   Let me review just a few of the discrepancies that are claimed.   Mr. Mnuchin placed some investments offshore, in full conformity with  the law and not for the purpose of avoiding U.S. taxes. But my friends  have simply asserted that no one uses offshore financial vehicles  unless they are trying to avoid U.S. taxes, and, therefore, Mr.  Mnuchin's investments disqualify him to serve as Treasury Secretary.  Yet Secretary Lew, prior to his confirmation, actually made investments  in the famous Ugland House in the Cayman Islands, which President Obama  described as ``outrageous'' and ``the biggest tax scheme in the  world.'' My Democratic colleagues knew this, but did not care, and  happily confirmed Secretary Lew with hardly a mention of this matter.  We allowed him to go through, in the interest of civility and getting  along with our colleagues.   Democrats have argued that Mr. Mnuchin unduly profited from the  housing market collapse. Yet Secretary Lew, prior to his nomination,  ran ``proprietary trading'' groups at Citigroup, where they invested in  a hedge fund that bet heavily on the collapse of the housing market. My  Democratic colleagues knew this, but did not care, and happily  confirmed Secretary Lew without really ever acknowledging this part of  his record.   Democrats claim that Mr. Mnuchin unfairly foreclosed on homeowners,  despite evidence to the contrary. Yet Secretary Lew, prior to being  nominated, ran a Citigroup division that was, according to arbitration  panels at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and later the  SEC, ``defrauding investors.'' When asked about the toxic securities  sold by his Citigroup unit, Secretary Lew's answers varied between not  remembering any specific securities to claiming he somehow wasn't  involved in the investment decisions made at the Citigroup unit he  oversaw. My Democratic colleagues knew this, but they did not care, and  happily confirmed Secretary Lew without anything resembling full and  complete answers to these questions.   Despite ample evidence to the contrary, Democrats claim that Mr.  Mnuchin ran a ``robo-signing'' foreclosure machine. Yet Citigroup,  while Jack Lew was in senior management, sliced and diced mortgages and  was alleged to have ``robo-signed'' mortgage documents. Democrats knew  this, but they did not care, and happily confirmed Secretary Lew  without ever really asking him about these issues.   I can go on and on. There are many other issues that my colleagues  were willing to overlook, if not outright ignore, with regard to  Secretary Lew that have resulted in hyperbolic attacks on Mr. Mnuchin.   I wish to remind my colleagues that despite the numerous concerns  that I and others have had about Secretary Lew and the many significant  disagreements that I had with President Obama's agenda, I voted in  favor of Secretary Lew's confirmation. On this very floor, I stated the  following:         I have always believed that . . . [the] President--any       President, regardless of party--is owed a certain degree of       deference when choosing people to work in his administration.       Therefore, though I personally would have chosen a different       person for this position, I intend to vote in favor of Mr.       Lew's confirmation.    I wasn't alone. Many other Republicans also voted to confirm  Secretary Lew, despite serious reservations, in recognition that the  President had a right to appoint who he wanted to--as long as they were  not crooks and people of unsavory reputation. Well, Mr. Lew was not  either of those.   My, how times have changed. As is typically the case, when a group of  Senators is unable to make a believable case against a nominee, they  tend to just raise every possible issue and hope something gains  traction. When in the end nothing works, they cling to whatever  allegation came last and hope it is enough to change the outcome. That  is why, over the past couple of weeks or so, we have heard an awful lot  about ``robo-signing.''   Here is the basic rundown of what has happened on this issue: My  friends on the other side got an answer to a poorly and vaguely worded  question that was not the answer they wanted to receive. The answer  from Mr. Mnuchin, that OneWest Bank did not engage in ``robo-signing''  under his leadership, was truthful and defensible, but it did not  conform to the Democratic talking points drafted for this nominee.   Since that time, Senate Democrats have repeatedly referenced new  stories that purportedly prove that not only did Mr. Mnuchin run a bank  that engaged in the nefarious, yet not well-defined practice of ``robo- signing'' mortgage documents, he lied about it in his answers to the  committee. However, I would urge my colleagues on both sides to  actually look at the supposed evidence from those news articles.   Put simply, to say that my Democratic friends are trying to make a  mountain out of a molehill would be an insult to moles everywhere.  There is no molehill to be found here.   To make the case that Mr. Mnuchin was untruthful in his answers, the  articles rely on quotes mined from a single deposition of a OneWest  employee. Quoted out of context, the employee seems to have said that  she rapidly signed several hundred foreclosure-related documents a week  without fully verifying their accuracy. That is the supposed smoking  gun on the Mnuchin ``robo-signing'' question.   However, if you read the full deposition, the employee makes it  absolutely clear that she was not the employee responsible for  verifying the accuracy or validity of everything in the documents. She  was part of a process that included several steps and multiple  employees to verify the accuracy of different parts of the documents.  We don't even have to dig for this explanation. It is not a matter of  any interpretation. That explanation, in plain  [[Page S1103]]  English, is right there in the deposition my colleagues and the news  articles have been using as ``evidence'' that Mr. Mnuchin lied to the  Finance Committee.   Nothing--not a single thing--in the deposition quoted in those news  articles could be considered evidence of ``robo-signing'' on the part  of OneWest Bank.   While I can understand that my colleagues don't like seeing or  hearing anything that contradicts their preconceived notions,  particularly when it comes in the form of an answer to one of their  questions, that is no basis or justification to make wild and brazen  accusations that a nominee has been lying. And make no mistake, that is  precisely what they are doing with Mr. Mnuchin.   On a related note, it is really amazing to me that my friends on the  other side are now feigning outrage over alleged lack of responsiveness  to their questions after having gone through the last 8 years with  Treasury Secretaries who routinely ignored questions and requests for  briefings posed by myself and a number of my other Senate colleagues.  But I digress.   I certainly sympathize with the many people who suffered through the  foreclosure crisis and with Democrats in Congress who were, and  continue to be, frustrated that Treasury officials in the Obama  administration failed to construct effective homeowner relief programs,  despite having made numerous promises to do so.   However, given that frustration, it is odd to me that my colleagues  remain so opposed to Mr. Mnuchin's nomination when he was very much  engaged in the practice of making mortgage modifications work during  his time as the head of OneWest Bank. Moreover, Mr. Mnuchin worked  diligently with regulators and others to clean up the system under  which foreclosure documents were being processed. You don't have to  take my word for it; you can examine the numerous letters of support we  have received from a range of people and organizations, from community  groups to community bankers, which attest to Mr. Mnuchin's success in  turning a bank that was plagued by toxic loans and numerous processing  errors into a viable financial services firm that provides jobs and  support to communities.    Along the way, Mr. Mnuchin's companies significantly outperformed  rivals in the industry in terms of offering loan modifications to help  keep Americans facing foreclosure in their homes. Mr. Mnuchin has  acknowledged that his efforts were not without errors and that he  genuinely regrets any mistakes that were made. He has also made clear  that OneWest was committed to providing remediation in order to  compensate those who were affected.   It should also be noted that in the vast majority of independent  evaluations of OneWest's practices, the banks's error rates were  routinely below the average for the industry and often zero.   I think people should quit using false arguments against this man.  All of this was discussed out in the open during the Finance  Committee's hearing on the Mnuchin nomination. Nothing was hidden. No  one was misled.   Unfortunately, rather than focusing on the actual facts surrounding  OneWest's performance under the nominee's leadership, my friends on the  other side opted to try to smear Mr. Mnuchin. In essence, they have  tried to relitigate the foreclosure crisis, with Mr. Mnuchin's company  confusingly placed in the crosshairs. This is a company that, according  to a letter from Faith Schwartz, former executive director of the Hope  Now Alliance, ``was committed to avoiding foreclosures where  possible.''   As I said, with Mr. Mnuchin, my colleagues are applying a clear  double standard for confirming a Treasury Secretary. For Republican  Treasury Secretary nominees, any allegation, no matter how careless or  untrustworthy the source, is enough to inspire the Democrats' outrage  and trigger a seemingly endless bout of name-calling. For Democratic  nominees, on the other hand, even proven instances of questionable  actions and poor judgment on the part of the nominee fail to even make  a blip on their radar screens.   I have spent quite a bit of time in recent weeks decrying the antics  of my Democratic colleagues with regard to President Trump's Cabinet  nominations. Frankly, I am tired of talking about it. My colleagues  are, of course, free to do whatever they think will help them hobble  the new administration and score points with their political base, even  if it breaks from the longstanding customs and traditions of the Senate  and even if it puts our financial stability and the stability of our  relations with Finance Ministers of other countries at greater risk.  However, they should know that these tactics do absolutely nothing to  help American families seeking greater opportunities and economic  growth. They don't help us fix our broken Tax Code, reform our failing  health care system, and empower businesses and job creators to grow and  expand.   The bottom line is this: Mr. Mnuchin is clearly qualified to serve as  Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle made clear they  intend to vote no on the nomination, and that is their right. However,  while each Senator has a right to vote according to his or her own  judgment, Senators do a disservice to the country and the Senate as an  institution when they concoct stories and antics designed merely to  delay a vote for the sake of delay. Going forward, I hope my colleagues  will recognize the problematic precedence they are setting with regard  to these nominees and opt to change course.   I intend to vote in favor of confirming Mr. Mnuchin, and so should  everybody else in the U.S. Senate. I urge all of my colleagues to do  so.   When I first met Mr. Mnuchin, I hadn't met him before. I didn't even  know his name. I have to say I was really impressed.   I said to him: Why are you doing this? You are going to lose a lot of  money because you are going to have to sell your holdings and get rid  of them. Why are you doing this?   He looked at me, looked me square in the eyes, and he said: I am  doing it because I love my country, and I want to help. I want to help  turn it around.   I was pretty impressed with that. I have been pretty impressed with  Mr. Mnuchin ever since. I think we need a terribly smart guy who is  honest, who is decent, who has made a great success of his life, who  understands where money comes from and where it goes, who literally is  willing to sacrifice and lose some of his savings and money in order to  save this country and because he wants to work with our good President,  who every day is going through calumny and slanders like I have never  seen anybody go through before.   The slowdown in the Senate that is occurring here is unbelievably  stupid. Yes, I know they want his first 100 days to not be successful,  but gee-whiz, to do this kind of maneuvering and this kind of playing  around with the facts is beneath the dignity of my colleagues on the  other side.   If my side was doing this, I would be chewing them up. The fact is,  we didn't do this. The past two Treasury Secretaries--I personally said  ``We are going to support them'' even though we could have pulled this  kind of stuff on them, and the facts were true. Both of them were good  people. Both of them had made a couple of mistakes. Both of them made  mistakes in their filings. But they were good men, good people, and so  is Mr. Mnuchin.   Wouldn't it be wonderful if both sides would treat people with  respect and dignity? I have to admit, sometimes our side could do  better, but what we have been going through for the last almost 2  months now is pathetic. I think it is all done in the hope that they  can ruin the first 100 days of this President. Well, there are 200  days, and we are going to keep going.   They are not making any headway with the President where they could  make headway. He is someone who actually came from their side of the  floor--at least at one time when I knew him long ago. He is a person  with an open mind. He is a person who has supreme intelligence. He is a  person who is bringing with him some of the best people in this  country, not the least of whom is Mr. Mnuchin.   I think they ought to wake up and quit this slandering and even  libeling this really fine man who is willing to sacrifice much of his  personal fortune to serve in this government as the Treasury Secretary.  We are lucky that  [[Page S1104]]  people like this are willing to do it, to take all the guff and calumny  and slander and libel they have to go through. Thank goodness we have  people like Mr. Mnuchin who are willing to do this. I don't intend to  see him fail, so I hope we can all vote for him tonight and send a  message. I hope some of my colleagues on the other side will vote for  him. They should. They should, in good faith. Yes, they can play this  game of having a lot of votes against him, but some of them should vote  for him. The truly honest, the truly fair, and the truly good people--I  think all of them are good people on the other side and on this side,  but it is not showing up as well as I would like it to show up in these  confirmation fights.   In this particular one, there is a fellow who is willing to sacrifice  immensely to be able to help our country, who is known on Wall Street,  who is known as one of the bright lights up there, who has been  immensely successful, and he has had a wide variety of experiences in  the area of finance. We ought to be getting on our knees and thanking  him for being willing to go through this and being willing to serve his  country.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
