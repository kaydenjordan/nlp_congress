 Mr. Chairman, my thanks to Chairman Shuster and Ranking  Member DeFazio.   I rise today in support of this en bloc package that contains my  bipartisan amendment requiring the FAA to study the economic impact of  Temporary Flight Restrictions on local airports and to recommend ways  to mitigate the negative effects, potentially including creating  security procedures to allow limited use of certain airports during a  TFR.   This is about fairness for New Jersey pilots and small businesses.  The President and the First Family use Trump National Golf Course in  Bedminster, New Jersey, in the district I serve, as a weekend residence  during the late spring, the summer, and the early fall. During such  visits to Bedminster, a TFR is imposed in the area, shuttering Solberg  and Somerset airports, and grounding recreational and training flights.   The safety of the President and the First Family and the official  visitors to Bedminster is, of course, paramount, but TFRs can be very  challenging, and I want to find a compromise with the Federal Aviation  Administration and the Secret Service so that pilots can be vetted,  prescreened, and allowed to fly.   This is not a new idea. For some airports in Maryland, near  Washington, D.C., pilots are permitted limited operation after being  properly vetted. I seek the same status for constituents I serve in New  Jersey.   I thank the chairman for his interest and ask for further help in  crafting this policy with the FAA. I further hope to work with him on  establishing a temporary reimbursement program, as was done for the  Maryland airports in the early 2000s. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this  legislation.
