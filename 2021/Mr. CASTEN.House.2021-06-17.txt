 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Anita Ehlers, a  constituent member of the Barrington, Illinois, community I represent  and, more importantly, a friend.   I never knew Anita when she didn't have cancer. But for a long time,  I didn't know that she did. She just never let it define who she was.   I knew her as a wonderfully kind, hardworking woman who was committed  to making the world a better place.   Our Speaker often reminds us: ``We don't agonize. We organize.''  Every time she says it, I see Anita's face in my head.   I never saw her feel sorry for herself. Every time I was with her, it  seemed like all the thoughts in her head were on how to make the world  a little better for everybody else: her husband, Gregg; her daughters,  Julia and Lindsay; her friends and neighbors; me and all the folks she  was motivating.   As a women's marcher, a climate protector, an ally for the LBGT  community, a universal health coverage champion, a union member, a  teacher, and a lung cancer support advocate, she never agonized. She  organized.   The world, and our district, is a sadder place without her. But I  take inspiration because she always made our community a better place.   May we all find the strength to follow her example, to make the world  around us a little easier for everybody else, no matter the adversity  that we may personally face.                            ____________________
