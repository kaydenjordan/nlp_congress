 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3527.   When Congress acts to name a VA medical facility in law, the name  should stay with that facility even if it moves to another location in  the same area. That is common sense, and it is what this bill would  allow.   A lot of thought and hard work goes into honoring a veteran or other  individual by naming a VA facility after them. The person who is  honored this way often has a storied history that becomes important to  the veterans served by that facility. That should not be taken away,  and it should not be taken lightly.   I am grateful to Senator Tester for his work on this legislation. I  urge all of my colleagues to join in supporting this bill today, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1760, a bill to name the  VA community-based outpatient clinic in Oahu, Hawaii, after World War  II veteran and former Hawaiian Senator, Daniel Akaka.   Senator Akaka has a long and proud record of service in a uniform and  out. Following his time in the Army, he represented his fellow  Hawaiians in both the House and the Senate. During that time in the  Senate, he served as chairman of the Veterans Affairs' Committee, where  he also represented his fellow veterans.   Mr. Speaker, it is only fitting that the community-based outpatient  clinic in his hometown of Oahu be named in his honor. I am proud to  support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2514, a bill to rename the  Provo Veterans Center in Utah after Colonel Gail Halvorsen.   Colonel Halvorsen is a Salt Lake City native who joined the Army Air  Corps in 1942, in the midst of World War II. He served as a transport  pilot and participated in the Berlin Airlift.   It was in Berlin where he earned the nickname ``The Candy Bomber''  for handing out pieces of candy to local children and, later, dropping  candy from his aircraft while flying missions over the city.   Colonel Halvorsen retired from the military in 1974 after 31 years in  uniform. He spent his civilian life as an active volunteer in his  church and community. He passed away in February of this last year at  age 101.   Mr. Speaker, it is with the deepest respect for Colonel Halvorsen's  long life of service that we support the bill to allow the Provo Vet  Center to bear his name.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7500, the bill that would  authorize VA major medical facility construction projects in  Mississippi, New York, Texas, California, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Oregon,  and Missouri.   It is well known that the VA healthcare system has very serious  infrastructure issues. The average VA medical center is decades older  than the average private-sector hospital.   Authorizing these projects won't fix that, but it will help thousands  of veterans who live in those eight States to have better access to the  care that they have earned and deserve.   I appreciate Congressmen Allred and Ellzey for their work introducing  this important bill. It has my full support today. I encourage my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5754, the Patient Advocate  Tracker Act. This is an excellent piece of legislation that is the  brainchild of a veteran named Cameron Zbikowski.   Cameron worked on VA's patient advocate program as a student veteran  fellow for the VFW and Student Veterans of America. During his  fellowship, he recognized that veterans would be better served if they  could submit complaints to VA patient advocates online and track the  status of those complaints online as well.   Cameron was spot on, and this bill will require VA to make that  happen. This will make patient advocates more accessible to veterans  than ever before, and it will increase the transparency and  accountability of the VA patient advocacy program so that we can make  sure that it is working as it should for veterans across the country.   I know Cameron is watching today, and from one veteran to another, I  thank him for his great work.   This bill is sponsored by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  McClain). I thank her for her hard work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I am a proud supporter of this bill today, and I hope  that all of my colleagues will join me in supporting it. I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6604, as amended, the  Veterans Eligible to Transfer School Credit Act. This bill, authored by  my friend from Florida (Mr. Buchanan), would help student veterans  continue to use their GI Bill benefits if their school closes in the  middle of a semester.   Under current law, when a school closes, an eligible student can have  their GI Bill benefits restored for the time they spent attending the  shuttered school. This bill would streamline that process for these  students to use their restored benefits at a new school. This will help  student veterans quickly transfer to a new school and complete their  degree using their GI Bill benefits.   H.R. 6604, as amended, also includes the text of Congressman Murphy's  bill, H.R. 6458. This bill eliminates the existing requirement for the  servicemember to set a specific date for when any transferred Post-9/11  GI Bill benefits would expire.                                time  1600    Thus, this bill would prevent those who are entitled to these  benefits from accidentally inputting the wrong date.   These wrong dates have led to dependents being barred from taking  advantage of their education benefits. For example, there have been  instances where a servicemember has put in their child's 18th birthday  by accident which then prevents the child from using the benefit. If  the servicemember is alive, they can easily change this date in the  system. However, if the servicemember has passed away before they make  this change, then it is irreversible and the child can't use their GI  Bill benefit.   I thank the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, or TAPS, for  bringing this transfer issue and solution to us. I also thank both  Congressman Buchanan and Congressman Murphy for their hard work on  these bills. I encourage all my colleagues to support H.R. 6604, as  amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2687, which would  provide the VA inspector general with limited subpoena power. In some  investigations, VA employees who may have important information have  left the Department. At that point, the inspector general has no  authority to compel their  [[Page H5000]]  testimony, which can leave investigations weak or incomplete. This bill  would give the inspector general the authority to subpoena those former  employees.   However, this authority is not without checks and balances. The bill  would require the IG to notify the Attorney General before using the  subpoena. The Attorney General may object and prevent the IG from  issuing the subpoena if doing so would interfere with an ongoing  investigation.   This authority would sunset in May of 2025 and would require Congress  to then evaluate the need for this authority and if it should be  continued. This is a good bill to expand oversight of the VA, and it  has my full support.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7375, a bill that  would streamline the payment of GI Bill benefits.   Specifically, the bill would require that, within 90 days of  enactment, VA update the electronic fund transfer system for education  benefits. Without this change, an overseas school is required to  maintain a U.S.-based bank account so that VA can electronically  transfer payments for VA beneficiaries who attend their institution.  This requirement has kept some schools from participating in the GI  Bill. This leads to fewer educational choices for our veterans.   I am pleased that this bill would address this issue and expand  opportunities for veterans to use their hard-earned education benefits.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 7375,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6376, as amended, the  Student Veteran Work Study Modernization Act.   This bill will make changes to the VA work-study program to allow  student veterans who are using the GI bill part-time to take advantage  of the work-study benefit. The work-study benefit provides veterans  with the opportunity to be paid for helping other veterans on campus or  VA facilities.   This is a win-win for the school and the veteran, as the school does  not have to pay the veteran for their work, and the veteran receives a  paycheck and great work experience.   I am pleased that my amendment at the markup of this bill was  accepted and that the bill is now fully offset.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 6376, as amended,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 7153, the  Department of Veterans Affairs Principles of Benefits Automation Act.   The VA is embracing automation more than ever before. The early  results are promising. When used properly, automation can improve  claims processing for veterans. However, I am concerned that the VA has  already started multiple automation projects without a clear plan or  measurable goals. There is no consistent guidance from the VA on when,  why, or how automation should be used.   H.R. 7153 will establish the sense of Congress that the VA should  increase automation in benefits processing, according to certain  principles. Automation should increase the speed, accuracy, and  consistency of claims processing. Automation should also enhance  employee productivity. Automation should always protect veterans'  privacy and preserve their rights to due process.   However, automation should not necessarily eliminate or reduce the  VBA workforce. Employees should always make the final decision about  approving claims and granting benefits. Let me be clear: The sense of  Congress is that automation should enhance and support VBA employees,  not replace them. I think these guiding principles will improve the  claims process for veterans and beneficiaries.   Finally, my bill will require VA to submit a plan to Congress to  modernize its benefits IT system over the next 5 years. This plan is  crucial.   The expansion of benefits for toxic-exposed veterans will put an  incredible strain on these IT systems. We need to be ready.   Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
