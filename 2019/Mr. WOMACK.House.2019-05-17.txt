 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of Arkansas' most  successful football coaches, Tommy Tice of Huntsville, Arkansas, who  retires this month after 42 years in coaching and athletic  administration.   Coach Tice coached more football games as a head coach than anyone in  Arkansas history: 454 games. He had a combined record of 288 wins, 160  losses, and 6 ties, an overall winning percentage of 63 percent.   He was selected head coach of the Arkansas All-Star football game six  times. He had a State championship, 13 conference titles, and 19  playoff appearances.   An Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame inductee in 2016, Coach Tice has been  a teacher and mentor to dozens of coaches throughout the State of  Arkansas.   He is one of my best friends, and I can't think of anyone more  impactful on student-athletes than Coach Tommy Tice. I congratulate him  on a remarkable career, and I wish him well in his retirement.                            ____________________
