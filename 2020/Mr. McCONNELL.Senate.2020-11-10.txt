 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, the President informed us  that Secretary Mark Esper's tenure leading the Department of Defense  has concluded.   When the Senate considered Secretary Esper's nomination, I said you  could hardly invent better qualifications to run the Pentagon than his  resume. From West Point and the 101st Airborne to his time as Secretary  of the Army, this leader had stepped up when his country needed him.  The Secretary brought integrity, expertise, and steady leadership to  the Pentagon's top job.   I am grateful for his work to keep our country safe, modernize our  military, and implement the Trump administration's new national defense  strategy to address the challenges of our time. A decorated combat  veteran himself, he won the respect of the men and women of our Armed  Forces.   The country is grateful for his career of service.   During this time of transition, I am confident in the professionalism  of the men and women of the Department of Defense, not to mention our  uniformed services. We are lucky to have such capable and duty-focused  men and women on the watch, defending the Constitution, deterring our  adversaries, and protecting the peace.   I expect to speak with Acting Secretary Miller soon to discuss the  serious threats facing our country, whether from foreign terrorists or  great powers like China and Russia that may  [[Page S6628]]  seek to exploit the period of uncertainty. All of this highlights the  need for continued sober and steady leadership at the Department.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on an entirely different matter, as  we continue to complete the process of our own election here at home,  there is also news on the continued growth of democracy half a world  away.   My colleagues know that I have had a special interest in the  democratic aspirations of the people of Burma for decades, dating back  to my days leading the Appropriations Subcommittee for State and  Foreign Operations.   Burma held elections on Sunday, which we hope will represent another  step toward a more democratic and prosperous future. For too long, the  people of Burma were denied democracy by a brutal military junta. To  this day, its influence remains a significant impediment to progress.  And as with many new democracies, the elections faced many challenges,  ranging from continued conflict to the coronavirus pandemic.   But when the votes are counted and Burma's next government is seated,  more hard work will await. The government will need to continue  advancing Burma's democratic development. Its sovereignty must be  defended against the corrupting foreign influence of the People's  Republic of China. The nation needs true national reconciliation among  Burma's various ethnic groups and further economic reforms to benefit  all of its people.   Further progress will take real compromise and real sacrifice from  parties and interests within Burma, and it will need continued support  from the international community, particularly the United States.   I have known Daw Suu for many years and know she remains committed to  democracy. So I hope and expect that if she and her party are the  victors, her government will seek much needed constitutional, economic,  and security sector reforms to further limit the corrosive influence of  the military and the crony networks over so much of the life in Burma.   We are talking about a nation that still reserves 25 percent of the  seats in the Parliament for the military itself. It would be an  understatement to call that an obstacle toward an ongoing democratic  transition.   Further progress toward democracy and prosperity in Burma will  require the inclusion of Burma's ethnic minorities and making  compromises with them. It will require national reconciliation to end  the disparate civil conflicts that rage across that country. And it  will require accountability for atrocities that have been committed by  the military--and not just in Rakhine State.   If Burma's Government meaningfully pursues these kinds of efforts, I  expect the United States and like-minded countries will continue to  stand by them. The free nations of the world have much to gain from  Burma's democratization, and we have much to lose if it slides back  into authoritarianism or further into the grasp and orbit of China.   So, as Americans, our political contests here at home can feel  intense. We think our elections are charged and contentious. But when  you look at democracies that are just getting off the ground around the  world, you remember how blessed we are to live in a republic that has  for centuries inspired the forces of democracy and freedom all around  the world.   We get to live in a country where our institutions of self-government  have held up for more than 230 years, where the rule of law and our  Constitution are paramount.   May we never take it for granted, and may we continue to support  those around the world who seek to emulate our example.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 863.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session to be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 8276, which was  received from the House.  [[Page S6655]]     I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 8247, which was  received from the House.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m. on  Thursday, November 12; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Cannon nomination; further, that  notwithstanding rule XXII, Wednesday, November 11 count as the  intervening day for the cloture motion filed during today's session;  further, that notwithstanding rule XXII, if cloture is invoked, the  Senate vote on confirmation of the Cannon nomination at 1:45 p.m. on  Thursday; finally, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:23 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, November 12, 2020, at 11 a.m.                            ____________________
