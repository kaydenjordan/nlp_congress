 Mr. Speaker, as chair of the Congressional Youth  Mentoring Caucus, I rise to recognize National Mentoring Month to  celebrate the impact of youth mentoring and ask caring adults across  the country to consider becoming mentors as our youth face the  overwhelming challenges of our time.   One-third of young people in the United States don't have a  meaningful connection with a responsible adult outside their homes, but  such connections can have a powerful, positive impact on their economic  mobility, mental health, violence prevention, and identity development.   I have been a youth mentor since college, and it is incredibly  rewarding. I have been honored to participate in and celebrate the  personal and professional growth of scores of young people.   This week, we welcome mentors from across the country to Capitol  Hill, including visitors from the Philadelphia region who work with  MENTOR and Big Brothers and Big Sisters, and we heard about the work  they do to support young people in our communities every day.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all adults to consider how they can serve their  communities and the next generation by becoming mentors through sports,  career exploration, school, or faith-based programs.                            ____________________
