 Madam Speaker, on this day in 1903, near Kitty Hawk,  North Carolina, Orville and Wilbur Wright made the first successful  aircraft flight in history.   In the years leading up to their first flight, they built and tested  air gliders in their bicycle shop in their hometown of Dayton, Ohio.  After making hundreds of successful flights in their glider, they  designed a 12-horsepower engine to fit into the frame.   In the fall of 1903, the Wright brothers transported these pieces  down to Kitty Hawk, assembled it, and made their first attempt at  powered flight. Unfortunately, the engine stalled during takeoff and  the engine was damaged. After making a few repairs, on December 17,  Orville ran the aircraft down a track and into the air, flying 120 feet  for 12 seconds.   Madam Speaker, of course, in the 117 years since, we have seen  amazing leaps in aircraft ability and technology. Forty-four years  after, Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, and now we have people  landing on the Moon and satellite equipment going beyond the stretches  of our solar system.   The Wright brothers' story is one of our most well-told tales of  success in American modern innovation. Their drive and spirit is  something that can inspire us all.                            ____________________
