 Madam Speaker, Stephanie Timoteo, a resident of  Bridgeton in South Jersey, turned 100 years old on August 25.   Stephanie has always been an incredibly active person in her  community. She values faith, family, and heritage as the most important  aspects of her life.   She was born into a family of Polish immigrants, and in her  midtwenties, she became a seamstress and she made uniforms for soldiers  during World War II.   After the war, Stephanie spent most of her time with her children,  but she continued to work at home as a seamstress and a dressmaker.   Over the years, Stephanie has given her time as a den mother, a Girl  Scout leader, a Christ Child volunteer, a coordinator for the Polish  American Club, and many, many, many other roles. They are actually  countless.   Now she loves to crochet, read, and spend time with her seven  grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.   Happy birthday to Stephanie. We are incredibly lucky to have her. May  God bless her. South Jersey is proud of her; New Jersey is proud of  her; and America is proud of her.                            ____________________
