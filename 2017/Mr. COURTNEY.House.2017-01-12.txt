 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Peterson and Mr. Conaway,  with whom I did serve on the Agriculture Committee with for a number of  years, and I recall well some of the discussion and debate as Chairman  Gensler appeared before the committee on article 7 of the Dodd-Frank  Act.   Although, I didn't author that position, former-Senator Dodd is a  constituent of mine. So I guess that is close enough to the work that  was done creating this section.   Again, let's be very clear about what this amendment does. It is not  about clarifying anything. It is about stripping from the law article 7  of Dodd-Frank, which was a congressional mandate to establish position  limits for speculative trading.   Again, this was not done in a vacuum. It was done because there has  been an explosion of speculative trading that is taking place in  commodities markets. We had testimony in the Congress back in 2010 that  it had grown from 22 percent to 67 percent speculation on Wall Street.  Goldman Sachs--when, again, we were dealing with close to $4 a gallon  for gas--had a report which said that 27 percent of that price was due  to speculation. So, Congress appropriately instructed CFTC to come back  with a regulatory plan to limit speculative positions in a reasonable  way.   Again, no one quarrels with the fact that end users, whether it is  farms, ranchers, airlines, or businesses of all sorts, should be able  to exercise options in market swaps.                                time  1345    In those instances, these are firms and businesses which actually  take physical possession and control of the commodity. Again, what  Goldman Sachs and other analysts had demonstrated is that what has been  a burgeoning trend is that firms were beginning to take dominant  position in markets that, again, were not even close or remotely  involved in the actual production, processing, or use of the  commodities that were in question.   So again, CFTC has begun an arduous, painful process of trying to  craft a rule. In fact, just a few weeks ago, on December 5, the CFTC  voted unanimously to again move that process along and come up with a  draft of a balanced, reasonable rule, so it is not a dead-end  situation.   As has been reported, what they basically were looking at was a  fundamental or a basic limit of roughly about 25 percent of a commodity  could not be controlled by one firm. The end users that I spoke to, as  this rule has been making its way, actually think that the CFTC is  being too generous in terms of allowing an individual firm to control  up to 25 percent of a market. I think a lot of Americans would  understand that that kind of position really would provide for an  opportunity to manipulate market prices.   In fact, there are some end users who think the rule should be very  simple, that you have to take actual physical possession of the  commodity in order to be able to hedge a position or engage in a future  option. Again, the CFTC did not go to that radical extreme. Again, they  tried to listen to the thousands of comments--Chairman Gensler,  Chairman Massad--to try to fashion a rule that allowed a healthy market  but did not allow situations which were occurring during high gas and  oil prices.   In Connecticut, we had home heating oil suppliers who were describing  situations where the price of the heating oil by the time the truck  left the garage and came back was going up 10, 15 cents just during  that short period of time for no reason at all. There wasn't like a  refinery explosion or some incident that was happening overseas. It  was, again, the movement on Wall Street of people who were profiting  not from use of the commodity but, in fact, just from the movement on  the price. That is really what CFTC has been hard at work doing.   This amendment will basically shut that down. It is not a  clarification. It basically takes away what was Congress' instruction  to CFTC.   Again, I respectfully oppose this amendment. I think we should allow  the Commission, which is going to have a Republican Chairman in a few  weeks, to continue to work on this issue and to provide protection for  the true end users, the people who actually use the commodities, as  well as consumers. Whether it is those who get their home heating oil  tank full, their gas tank full, whether it is farmers and ranchers who  are dealing with things like feed costs, we should have a healthy  system of making sure that individuals or firms cannot have a dominant  position in terms of controlling commodities.   This is not an arcane, esoteric issue for Americans. This affects  bread-and-butter issues in terms of how much they pay for essential  goods and commodities for them and their families. I would strongly  urge the Members to not accept this amendment. I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will be postponed.                     Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Duffy    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in  part B of House Report 115-3.
