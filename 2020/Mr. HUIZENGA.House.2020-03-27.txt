 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of  west Michigan, for the individuals and families who have seen their  world turned upside down by COVID-19.   Our neighbors, friends, and family members are losing their income.  Small businesses are closing their doors. Manufacturers, big and small,  are shuttering their facilities. All this is happening not because of  bad business decisions or personal choices but because of a virus.   The CARES Act will deliver critical relief to west Michigan  residents, small businesses, and our medical professionals. This  package will help tens of thousands of constituents in my district stay  employed.   While I don't agree with every proposal included in this bill, the  vast majority of it will work directly to provide relief to the people  who need it most. Communities across the Nation expect this body to act  today.   Finally, I want to say thank you to the first responders, nurses, and  doctors who are serving our communities on the front lines. Thank you  to the farmers, the food processors, the truck drivers, and those  stocking the shelves to make sure goods are available in this time of  need.   We are all in this together, Mr. Speaker. God bless America. Let's  pass this bill.
