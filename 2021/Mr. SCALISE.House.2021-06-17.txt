 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  House majority whip the schedule for next week.   Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to yield to my friend from South  Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip of the House.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina  for walking us through those. Of course, I would first like to, as we  note that the majority leader is not here, wish Mr. Hoyer a speedy  recovery. I got to speak with him yesterday, and he is doing better and  appreciates the prayers and thoughts from our colleagues.   And I told him: You don't have to rush back. You want to make sure  you get better before you come back.   And I know from experience to take the time and get better. And I  offered, by the way, use of my physical therapist, and maybe he and I  will do some joint physical therapy when he returns. But he was in good  spirits and is looking forward to coming back. I know the gentleman  from South Carolina shares that as well.   MR. CLYBURN. Absolutely.    I am sure the gentleman from Maryland is watching right  now as he is recovering, but I said, we are used to sparring and having  some fun conversations back and forth through the Select Subcommittee  on the Coronavirus, but we also look forward to seeing him back in the  middle of this fray soon, too.   If I may, I did want to ask. There were a couple of bills that deal  with the origin of the coronavirus, and I know we have been having  those conversations about trying to get a deeper investigation into the  origin of the coronavirus. But the Senate had passed over a few weeks  ago a bill, S. 1867, that came out of the Senate unanimously back in  May, which requires the Director of National Intelligence to declassify  information that relates to the origin of COVID-19.   I am not sure if this is a bill that you all were looking at bringing  up, but we wanted to just ask if we could have S. 1867 brought to the  House floor. It was a bill that passed unanimously out of the Senate,  which does indicate that there was strong interest on both sides to get  that information declassified so we can get more information about the  origin of COVID for all of our Members to be able to see, not just  those Members that have access to that information.    I am not sure, again, if the gentleman was looking at that, but if  that is something you all could look at, I think it would be well  received by both sides, and then would help us quickly get that  information available for all to see.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    There is an old adage: ``Why put off tomorrow what you  can do today?''   There is unanimous support for S. 1867 to not wait until August. And,  in fact, it was May when Senators--all Republicans and all Democrat  Senators--recognized that this is something we should do and we should  do now, and this would get more information out to the public, as well  as to our Members.   I would also ask if the majority would look at H. Res. 90, which is a  resolution that supports the international investigation into the  origin of COVID-19.   There are many countries. We have heard a lot of European countries  have expressed interest in having an international commission to look  into this. I don't know why the United States would be reluctant to be  a part of that investigation.   But, again, in light of all of the new information that has come out,  some emails recently since our committee has met, show more and more  that there is a high likelihood that COVID-19 started in the Wuhan lab.  Whether it was intentional or not, there is strong evidence pointing to  the fact that it likely started there.   We have not had a single hearing, not any of the standing committees,  and here we have a committee that, by its name, the Select Subcommittee  on the Coronavirus was established for the purpose of investigating  COVID-19, all elements of it, not just what is happening here in  America.   We just recognized over 600,000 deaths from COVID-19 on the steps of  the Capitol just a few days ago. So, clearly, it has hit our country  hard, but it has hit the whole world hard. Millions of people have  died. And now there is real evidence that has come out, including from  some of our own scientists here in America, that they may have been  aware over a year ago that COVID-19 originated in the lab as opposed to  what the original projections were that it was a bat-to-human  transmission. Now there is a lot of evidence pointing to the opposite  of that.   In fact, many of us were calling for that investigation over a year  ago, and some were called conspiracy theorists, yet now the hard  scientific data shows that it may have been, in fact, started in that  lab.   Why are we not having those hearings now in our committee, other  committees, again, not months from now?   But if China knew of this, there may not be scientists that we can  get access to, but we have American scientists who were in  communication with those scientists. Whether it is directly or  indirectly, there may have been taxpayer funds that were involved in  that. We should be trying to find that out now. And China may be trying  to cover some of that up.   The quicker we can get those hearings and those investigations, the  more we can find out while it is still possible to find it out. I think  it would help a lot of us to understand what really happened, what went  wrong.   Because if it was started in that lab, this would be a disaster  dramatically greater than Chernobyl in terms of devastation to the  world, loss of human life. We should all want to be finding  [[Page H2912]]  out. There were a lot of investigations into Chernobyl. This is  dramatically worse than Chernobyl. And if it was self-made, that is  something we should be investigating now. I am not sure why there is a  reluctance to do it.   But I would ask the gentleman, if I could just reiterate, I know we  sent a letter--over 200 of our colleagues signed on--asking that we  investigate it, all the committees of jurisdiction, including ours.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, we will continue to press for that  investigation.   And, you know, I am from New Orleans, and I know what it is like to  have cooks in the kitchen, but I also know how important it is to have  a lot of eyes looking at the same thing. And the more eyes looking into  something where there is mystery, where there is uncertainty, where  there is speculation, I think the more people looking at this, the  better.   Again, our committee is uniquely set up. There are other committees  that are set up to look at different aspects of it. We should all be  looking at it because the more questions we ask--it seems like right  now more questions are raised. We need to get answers to those  questions, and we get those answers by having that oversight hearing.  We don't want some kind of Soviet-style coverup. We want to be looking  at those questions and having people brought in.   There are American scientists, some people who work for this United  States Government, who could help us answer those questions, and they  haven't been brought forward. We can compel them to come forward,  especially in light of these emails that have come out recently, which  show that some of those scientists were aware over a year ago that it  may have started in the lab.                                time  1145    That was not shared with us in previous hearings. I think a lot of  our Members on both sides would like to find that information out as  much as we can. And the more we are asking questions, the more I think  we will get answers that everybody in the country and around the world  wants to know. So, we will continue to press for that.   I also want to ask about the appropriations process. I understand the  Committee on Appropriations is starting to do some work to start  bringing up the bills in committee so that we can, hopefully, have an  appropriations process move forward. We would be strongly encouraging a  bipartisan appropriations process but also an open appropriations  process.   So, as we look to the floor schedule, we are hearing that maybe in  July some of these bills would come to the floor. As the gentleman  knows, when we bring appropriations bills to the floor, whether it is a  fully open process or even a modified process, you typically have well  over 100 amendments that come to the floor on these appropriations  bills.   Does the gentleman anticipate that we would start, around July,  seeing some of those bills come to the floor? And will we have that  ability on the floor to have those kinds of amendments brought forward  in a process that we have seen in the past?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and we look forward  to that robust process through both committee and, ultimately, on the  floor.   The last point, I wanted to ask about deals with infrastructure. We  are seeing a lot of different groups both in the House and Senate that  are working on various infrastructure plans. I know we had Members on  our side, Ranking Member Graves and others, who rolled out a plan  recently that covers traditional infrastructure, which would be roads  and bridges--even broadband, waterways--paid for along the way, not  with tax increases but with responsible budgeting.   I wanted to ask because we are hearing different reports on what may  or may not come to the House floor. Budget reconciliation, possibly,  and tax increases, unfortunately, are still being floated out there,  which is different from what we are hearing right now with the  bipartisan Senate plan.   Can the gentleman shed light on what is anticipated on the floor,  whether it would be a budget reconciliation bill in the weeks or months  ahead or maybe a bipartisan plan, which we would surely encourage,  laying out some ideas of infrastructure that would be bipartisan that  we would support?   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman could answer that, I would be happy to  yield.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Hopefully, we can  have that debate and work together to achieve that vision for the  future as we are dealing with the problems of today and our  infrastructure needs for today, but also do it in a fiscally  responsible way. I think that is what the two sides, especially in the  Senate, are looking at.   I still haven't gotten an indication, specifically, as it deals with  some kind of reconciliation bill that may or may not come to the floor.  Hopefully, it is not some attempt to raise taxes and do things that  would undermine our economy, our competitiveness, and our ability to  create more opportunities for people to achieve the American Dream by  entering into the workforce and ultimately moving their way up and  having their own opportunities as well, which would be undermined with  higher taxes.   If that part of the equation gets brought in, clearly, that changes  the dynamic. But, hopefully, we stick to the traditional infrastructure  needs that you and I would both agree need to be met. Hopefully, we can  find a path to get there together. That is what we will be working  toward in the week ahead.   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman has nothing else, I am prepared to  yield back.    Hopefully, we can keep that difference in mind.   I appreciate the gentleman filling in, and we will see the gentleman  from Maryland back soon enough and maybe even moving a little faster  than before. I am not going to challenge him to a race because he would  defeat me in that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from South Carolina, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                            ____________________
