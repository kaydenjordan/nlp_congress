 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Federal  investment into brain research.   Congress' commitment to fund basic brain-related research and  scientific discovery is critical to developing our capabilities to  treat over 1,000 diseases and disorders that directly or indirectly  affect 100 million Americans every year. Estimates put the economic  burden of these diseases at over $760 billion a year. Addiction,  traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's, and other afflictions can only be  overcome through increasing our understanding of how the brain works.   Basic science is the foundation upon which all health advances are  built. Federal agencies, such as the NIH, NSF, and DOD, are essential  in advancement of brain research, as well as for so many scientific  endeavors. Congress enacted the 21st Century Cures Act that provided  support for a wide range of biomedical research efforts.   I call upon my colleagues to stand with me in support of brain  research into the new Congress. I also beseech my Republican colleagues  to withdraw this terrible bill and work across the aisle to find a  healthcare plan that will serve all Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, since the ACA was enacted, California's  uninsured rate has dropped by 54 percent. Over 263,000 people have  gained coverage in the three counties in my district. But now my  Republican colleagues want us to pass a replacement bill that will  strip away health care for 24 million Americans.   TrumpCare guts the Medicare program and creates a new, pre-broken  system that rations health care for more than 76 million Americans. In  my district alone, more than 64,000 people will lose coverage because  of the provisions of the Republican replacement bill. It will take  money away from our hospitals and eliminate 4,000 jobs in San Joaquin  County alone. Working and middle class families will be forced to pay  more for less. This will increase healthcare costs and decrease the  quality of coverage available. Americans deserve access to quality  healthcare coverage and health care that they can afford.   I ask my Republican colleagues to withdraw this terrible bill and  work across the aisle, for once, to improve the ACA that benefits all  Americans. I strongly oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''
