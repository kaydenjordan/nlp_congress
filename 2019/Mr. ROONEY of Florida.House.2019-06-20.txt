 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague from the east  coast of Florida, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, for her courageous  leadership on this issue and join and echo what the Governor said as we  continue to work together to fight the scourge of offshore drilling.   Offshore drilling anywhere near Florida represents an existential  threat to our tourist and recreation economy that we cannot risk  taking.   We also have the important military bases all along the Gulf Coast  that the Governor referred to that are equally important that use the  Gulf as offshore testing grounds. This is the only place in the world  where our United States Navy and Air Force can conduct these tests.   I want to thank Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz for her leadership  and to urge adoption of this amendment and protect Florida. Twenty-one  million people are being protected by Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz.
