 Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, Frank Cagle, my close  friend and a good Libertarian conservative, passed away after a battle  with cancer.   Frank was a brave American who served with the 82nd Airborne during  the Vietnam war. Following his service, he attended college and worked  for newspapers across the South.   In 1982, Frank came to east Tennessee to work at the Knoxville News  Sentinel as a copy editor. His passion was reporting on State and local  politics. Frank put his commentary into action, serving as deputy to  Knoxville Mayor, Victor Ashe, and working as campaign manager on  Congressman Van Hilleary's 2002 bid for Governor.   He later returned to journalism, writing columns and analyzing policy  for Knox TN Today, WATE, and back at the Knoxville News Sentinel. Frank  [[Page H1505]]  focused his career on delivering unbiased political reporting, and his  contributions will leave a long-lasting impression on all of us in east  Tennessee.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to celebrate Frank's life and recognize his  dedication to our community on the House floor.   Rest in peace, my good friend.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a report from the  Associated Press detailing the detention of AP reporter Thein Zaw by  Burmese authorities.                        [From the AP, Mar. 12, 2021]              Myanmar Court Extends Detention of AP Journalist         Yangon, Myanmar (AP).--A court in Myanmar extended on       Friday the pretrial detention of an Associated Press       journalist who was arrested while covering demonstrations       against a coup. He is facing a charge that could send him to       prison for three years.        Thein Zaw, 32, was one of nine media workers taken into       custody during a protest on Feb. 27 in Yangon, the country's       largest city, and has been held without bail. His next       hearing at the Kamayut Township court will be on March 24.        Friday's hearing, which Thein Zaw attended via       videoconference, came at the end of his initial remand       period.        Thein Zaw and at least six other members of the media have       been charged with violating a public order law, according to       his lawyer, Tin Zar Oo, and the independent Assistance       Association for Political Prisoners. Separate hearings were       held Friday for the other detained journalists.        Tin Zar Oo and one of Thein Zaw's brothers were allowed       into the courtroom to take part in the 10-minute       videoconference. Tin Zar Oo said she was able to submit       documents giving her power of attorney for the case, but only       at the next hearing might be allowed to submit a bail       application.        A representative of the U.S. Embassy was also present, said       Aryani Manring, a spokeswoman for the mission.        Thein Zaw had not been seen by his lawyer or any of his       family members since his arrest. Tin Zar Oo said visits at       lnsein Prison, where her client is being held, are not       allowed because of coronavirus concerns, so his family has       been dropping off food and supplies for him at the gate.        Tin Zar Oo said that her client looked healthy during       Friday's hearing, but he suffers from asthma at night. She       said Thein Zaw's brother noted that he had lost weight.        Thein Zaw was arrested as he was photographing police, some       of them armed, charging down a street at anti-coup       protesters. A video shows that although he stepped to the       side of the street to get out of their way, several police       rushed over and surrounded him. One put him in a chokehold as       he was handcuffed and then taken away.        According to the Assistance Association for Political       Prisoners, 38 journalists have been detained since the       military ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on       Feb. 1. Nineteen are still incarcerated.        The group says it has verified the detentions of more than       2,000 people as well as 69 deaths.        On Friday, local media in Shan State in eastern Myanmar       reported that a freelance journalist from Poland had been       beaten and arrested by security forces.        The online Kanbawza Tai News said a foreign photojournalist       was arrested Thursday while taking pictures of a protest in       the city of Taunggyi. A photo provided to the news site shows       a man trapped against a wall with one arm raised as he is       surrounded by about 10 soldiers.        Germany's dpa news agency said the man, Robert Bociaga, 30,       has been working for the news service, and it has not been       able to contact him.        ``We are deeply shocked by the arrest and apparent       mistreatment of Robert Bociaga,'' said the agency's editor-      in-chief, Sven Goesmann. ``This is an intolerable and       unacceptable attack on the freedom of the press and, even in       this brutal form, is unfortunately not an isolated case.''        The Polish Foreign Ministry confirmed the arrest of a       Polish journalist and said it was trying to contact the       detained man and obtain information about his health and       legal situation.        Earlier this week, Myanmar authorities canceled the       licenses of five local outlets that had extensively covered       the protests. Mizzima, Democratic Voice of Burma, Khit Thit       Media, Myanmar Now and 7Day News have continued operating       despite being barred from broadcasting or publishing on any       media platform.        The Associated Press and many press freedom organizations       have called for the release of Thein Zaw and the other       detained journalists.        The U.S. government, in addition to criticizing the coup       and the violence of Myanmar's security forces, has condemned       the crackdown on the press in the Southeast Asian nation.        ``We are deeply concerned about the increasing attacks on       the freedom of expression, including for members of the       press. We call for the release of journalists and for all       others who have been unjustly detained,'' U.S. State       Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters in       Washington on Thursday.        Even during Suu Kyi's time in office, journalists were       often sued for their reporting.        In the highest-profile case, two journalists working for       the Reuters news agency were arrested in 2017 while working       on a story about military violence directed at Myanmar's       Rohingya minority. They were accused of illegally possessing       official documents and sentenced to seven years behind bars       before being freed in 2019 in a mass presidential pardon.    Mr. Zaw has been jailed for covering the violence  leveled against anti-coup demonstrators in Burma.   Thanks to Mr. Zaw and other journalists on the ground, we know what  is going on in Burma is pure evil. The autocratic strongmen leading  this coup are using deadly force to crack down on all dissenting  speech. Burmese authorities, under the direction of these military  thugs, are actively murdering demonstrators, arresting thousands, and  imprisoning international reporters covering the situation.   Senseless violence, military rule, and imprisoning political  opponents all fly directly in the face of the democratic values we  cherish as Americans.   Today, this Chamber has the opportunity to condemn the hostile  takeover of the Burmese Government, defend the demonstrators looking  for peace, and stand up for democracy in Burma.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support both H.  Res. 134 and H.R. 1112.
