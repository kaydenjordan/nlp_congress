 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  5377, the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act.   The SALT deduction has protected Virginia taxpayers from double  taxation for over 100 years, but that changed when Donald Trump and  congressional Republicans imposed an unprecedented $10,000 tax cap  punishing taxpayers in districts like mine.   In 2017 my district had the highest average SALT deduction in  Virginia at almost $18,000 and the greatest number of households  claiming SALT at 213,500--more than half of my district.   The SALT cap is unfair and punitive, hurting Virginians and over 11  million Americans. Hardworking taxpayers deserve better.   Today we have an opportunity to do better, to restore this tax relief  and put money back in the pockets of 150,000 households in my district  and many, many more across the country.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, when the American people sent us to  Congress, they sent us here with policies they wished us to act upon--a  wish list, if you will. And now, in the holiday season, let's reflect  on what we have delivered for the American people from that wish list.   Federal workers will receive a 3.1 percent pay increase and, for the  first time ever, 12 weeks of paid parental leave--two important  priorities that I have fought for since I was sworn into office.   Just last week, we passed sweeping legislation that would help lower  the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs.   We also voted for universal background checks, equal pay for equal  work, a living wage for hardworking Americans, equal protections for  LGBTQ Americans, action on climate change, protection for Dreamers and  TPS recipients, reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, and  hundreds of other bipartisan bills.  [[Page H12287]]    But, Mr. Speaker, the House can't fulfill its wish list all on our  own. We need the Senate to vote on the bills that we passed in this  Chamber. And just like the Grinch whose heart grew three sizes just in  time to save Christmas, Senator McConnell can still deliver on the  American family's holiday wish list.                            ____________________
