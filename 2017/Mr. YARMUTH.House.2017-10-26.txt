 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill we are debating today is not a real effort at  responsible budgeting. It is a means to an end: a single-minded plan to  make it easier to enact tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations,  regardless of the consequences for everyone else.   If approved by the House today, an irresponsible $1.5 trillion tax  bill will come to the floor in a matter of weeks. It is being rushed  because Republicans don't want the American people to know what is in  it. They don't want you to find out that it overwhelmingly benefits the  wealthy while increasing taxes on millions of middle class families.   Rushing through legislation that impacts nearly every American family  and business is reckless, and voting on a bill that rewrites our  Nation's Tax Code a week or two after it is introduced without any real  input from the people who will be impacted is negligent. But that is  what you do when you can't defend your own policy.   And there are a lot of unjustifiable provisions in this budget. On  top of massive tax cuts for the rich, it cuts vital national  investments, threatening our economic progress and our national  security. It cuts more than $4 trillion in mandatory spending,  including nearly $2 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid alone.   The enormity of these cuts and the severity of the consequences for  American families cannot be overstated. But more cuts will be coming  once the Republican tax cuts blow an enormous hole in the budget. We  will see a tax on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, nutrition  assistance--on important benefits that help American families get  ahead.   I know my Republican colleagues desperately want to believe that the  tax cuts in their budget will pay for themselves and usher in a new era  of economic growth--or at least they want the American people to  believe that. But the record is clear, this approach has failed time  and time again.   And now, even though the evidence and experts have concluded that  these tax cuts will not create an economic boom but will, instead, lead  to a higher concentration of wealth among the rich while dramatically  increasing deficits and debt, my Republican colleagues are trying to do  it again.   Everything we do in Congress should be about making the lives of  American families better and more secure. We owe them a budget that  invests in their future, a Tax Code that is fair, and a full and honest  debate on both. This budget and the tax cuts that will follow are a  failure on all fronts.   I, therefore, urge my Republican colleagues to abandon this dangerous  budget and start addressing the needs and priorities of the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene), a distinguished Member of  the House Budget Committee and Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a distinguished member of  the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind the prior speaker, my friend from  California, that Arthur Laffer was also the architect of the Kansas  plan, which was disastrous for that State. So citing him as a source, I  would be a little bit careful.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee and the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the assistant Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Carbajal), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jeffries), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ half minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the ranking member of the Ways  and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. Welch), a distinguished member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time we have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As we wind down our arguments here, once again, we have had a very  fascinating discussion and, once again, we seem to disagree on  virtually everything.   For instance, I have heard from the other side many times over the  last few days and today that we really can't say what the impact is,  the claims that we are making about whether this bill will help the  rich or help the middle class or help lower income individuals, because  we don't have the details. Well, that is absolutely correct; we don't  have the details.   But then, if we don't have the details, how can the other side talk  about the huge benefits that this proposal, this tax proposal that is  yet unwritten, will provide for the middle class? And how can they deny  that it will benefit the wealthy disproportionately?   We know from the outline that was released by the other side in  recent weeks that they intend to eliminate the estate tax. The estate  tax only benefits wealthy Americans, people with estates over $11  million for a couple.   They want to eliminate the alternative minimum tax. We know the  alternative minimum tax only affects wealthy individuals. There was one  estimate that the one year of President Trump's tax return that we  have, that in that year alone, the alternative minimum tax, if it were  repealed, would have saved him $30 million. So we know that affects  very wealthy people.                                time  1015    We know that if you reduce the top rate from 39.6 percent to 35  percent, that benefits very high-income people. So we do have enough  information to draw some pretty definite conclusions about the impact  that the released outline, at least, will have on wealthy Americans,  and we can draw some of the same conclusions about how it will hurt  middle class Americans.   If, in fact, the Republican tax bill repeals the deduction for State  and local taxes. In my State, there will be half a million people who  will lose an average of $9,900 of deductions every year. So we  absolutely know the impact that the proposal, as we know it now, will  have, and I think it is fair--given that there will be no hearings on  this bill--it is fair to raise the alarms about what the potential for  this bill is.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I now have the distinct honor of yielding 1  minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic  leader.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just like to say that, for anyone  watching this debate or watching any of our discussions out there in  the country, I know it often appears that we don't get along, that we  hate each other, and that we are at each other's throat, but nothing  could be further from the truth.   It has been such an honor to work with Chairman Black as a member of  the Budget Committee and all the Members. We do all respect each other  and get along. We just have some very serious disagreements about  policy. That is fair. That is what this country is about.   Once again, since I may not get to do it again as Chairman Black  pursues another office and probably won't appear with me on the same  program anymore, I just want to wish her the best and say what a joy it  has been to work with her.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
