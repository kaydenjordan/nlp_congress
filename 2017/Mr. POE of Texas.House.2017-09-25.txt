 Madam Speaker, undaunted by the massive 50 inches  of hammering rains and devastation of Hurricane Harvey, Texans quickly  volunteered to help other water-soaked neighbors.   Bay City High School Secretary Linda Leissner was manning the city's  emergency operations call center when she realized the city needed  school buses and drivers to help in the rescue because of Harvey's  quickly rising floodwaters, so she called the coaches. The coaches  quickly manned the high school's buses, and in the torrential rain they  began rescuing and evacuating residents of the town, including some of  their very own students.   One of the coaches, Nathan Janak, put it best: ``It was just people  helping people. It was one of the greatest displays of human kindness I  have ever seen.''   Madam Speaker, stories like this make us Texas Proud and give us the  determination to recover from one of the worst natural disasters in  U.S. history. Harvey will not defeat us. As we say, ``Don't mess with  Texas.''   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
