 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, one century ago, our country was in the midst of the  worst pandemic in history. It claimed the lives of almost 700,000  Americans and killed more than 50 million people worldwide.   Mr. Speaker, we listened to testimony; we discussed aspects of this  legislation before us today; and it is critical that we remember the  significance of the centennial anniversary of the 1918 influenza  pandemic as we consider this legislation today.   The creation of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response  under the original legislation of 2006 has helped us to make monumental  strides in preparedness, coordination, and response. Close  collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and  Drug Administration and our State, local, and territorial public health  partners has been vital in making this progress.   Much like politics, much of public health is local and executed on  the ground by our hospitals, our health departments, and our emergency  responders, who are our front lines in addressing infectious diseases,  disasters, and threats.   We must evaluate the domestic biological surveillance systems, such  as BioWatch. This bill will help bring those programs up to date so  they are operating with the most efficient capabilities and  technologies. We must also look for innovative ways to continue to  advance our medical countermeasures and ensure that Americans can  access the medications that will provide critical protection in the  future.   As we consider the problem of antimicrobial resistance in this  country, we must discuss new methods to curb this growing problem.   It is important to note that this reauthorization bill is being heard  on the floor of the House prior to the expiration of the fiscal year,  at which time the current authorization expires. The House, once again,  has done its work in this regard, and we do urge our counterparts in  the Senate to do their work as well.   This reauthorization includes an important provision: The MISSION  ZERO Act. The MISSION ZERO Act seeks to connect American patients with  battle-tested trauma care through the craft of military trauma care  providers. The bill provides grants to allow military trauma care  providers and teams to offer care in our Nation's leading trauma  centers and systems.   The need for top-notch trauma care extends across our Nation, far  away from the battlefield. I first introduced this bipartisan bill with  my fellow Texan, Representative Gene Green, following a police shooting  in Dallas 2 years ago.   Over 2 years ago, five police officers were killed and nine more were  injured in a shooting in downtown Dallas. In the immediate aftermath of  the attack, area hospitals sprung into action and activated their  disaster plans. The staff at Parkland Hospital, Baylor University  Hospital, and other medical professionals provided excellent emergency  care to victims of the attack.   Frontline facilities and responders in Dallas experienced this  firsthand in 2014 when a patient presented with Ebola to a Dallas-Ft.  Worth emergency department.   We must remember that infectious diseases are a mere plane ride away,  and we must continue to ensure that we are prepared and ready to  respond to emerging infectious diseases worldwide.   This Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act is  critical to protecting the lives of Americans and providing the  necessary tools and infrastructure when disaster strikes.   I want to thank Representative Susan Brooks and Anna Eshoo for their  work on this legislation before us today. Mr. Speaker, I strongly  support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2553) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  prohibit health plans and pharmacy benefit managers from restricting  pharmacies from informing individuals regarding the prices for certain  drugs and biologicals.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2553         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Know the Lowest Price Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON LIMITING CERTAIN INFORMATION ON DRUG                     PRICES.         (a) In General.--Section 1860D-4 of the Social Security Act       (42 U.S.C. 1395w-104) is amended by adding at the end the       following new subsection:        ``(m) Prohibition on Limiting Certain Information on Drug       Prices.--A PDP sponsor and a Medicare Advantage organization       shall ensure that each prescription drug plan or MA-PD plan       offered by the sponsor or organization does not restrict a       pharmacy that dispenses a prescription drug or biological       from informing, nor penalize such pharmacy for informing, an       enrollee in such plan of any differential between the       negotiated price of, or copayment or coinsurance for, the       drug or biological to the enrollee under the plan and a lower       price the individual would pay for the drug or biological if       the enrollee obtained the drug without using any health       insurance coverage.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall apply to plan years beginning on or after January 1,       2020.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2553, the Know the Lowest  Price Act of 2018. This bill would prohibit health plans and pharmacy  benefit managers under Medicare or Medicare Advantage from restricting  pharmacies from informing individuals about prices for certain drugs  and biologics at the pharmacy counter, a practice commonly referred to  as a gag clause.   These clauses prohibit pharmacists from informing patients that  paying in cash will result in lower out-of-pocket costs than the  insurer's cost-sharing arrangement unless the patient directly asks.  This is a policy that the Energy and Commerce Committee has pursued in  H.R. 6733, the Know the Cost Act of 2018. We held a legislative hearing  and a markup in the Health Subcommittee before ultimately passing the  bill out of the full committee.   Once again, I want to commend Representative Buddy Carter for  championing this policy. His bill would have banned gag clauses in  group and commercial health insurance plans, as well as for  prescription drug plan sponsors for Medicare part D, or Medicare  Advantage plans.   As an original cosponsor of H.R. 6733, I believe these bills banning  gag clauses are essential in both lowering drug costs for individuals  and freeing pharmacists to do what many consider to be the right thing.   I am surprised Congress has not acted sooner to ban health insurance  plans from using gag clauses. I am glad to see these bills on the House  floor today. This will allow pharmacists to  [[Page H8800]]  look out for their patients' pocketbooks and help them get their  medications at the lowest possible price.   This bipartisan policy has been a shared priority for many Members on  the Energy and Commerce Committee. Our Senate counterparts had a shared  interest in this sound and reasonable policy, and recently advanced it  out of their Chamber.   The issue of gag clauses was further brought up to the forefront by  the Trump administration's drug pricing blueprint which was released  this May. The President proposed eliminating gag clauses as a solution  in his plan to address rising drug prices.                                time  1630    I, too, believe that allowing pharmacists to disclose the cost-saving  potential of paying out-of-pocket to patients at the point of sale is  an important piece of the drug pricing puzzle. While gag clauses are  already prohibited in Medicare through regulation, it makes sense that  we protect our seniors by putting this language in statute and sending  S. 2553 to the President's desk.   This legislation should serve as an example of how the House and the  Senate can work together to accomplish a goal to swiftly pass and send  to the President for his signature.   There have been news stories across the country from the New York  Times--two investigations in my market--and CBS 11 in the Dallas-Fort  Worth area about how consumers can save money at the pharmacy counter  by getting around gag clauses and directly asking their pharmacist: Is  this cheaper for me to pay cash and not use my insurance?   Kelly Selby, a community pharmacist and pharmacy owner in north  Texas, has told me about the problems that gag clauses cause at his own  pharmacy. He says that a gag clause has a chilling effect as a pharmacy  owner and a pharmacist, and that the pharmacy benefit managers will  call you after you break a gag clause and threaten you with canceling  their contract. Even if pharmacists have what is in the best interest  to their customers at heart, Mr. Selby told me that, overnight, he  could lose 40 percent of his business, taken away by the power of  pharmacy benefit managers.   It is unfair for pharmacists across our country like Kelly to have to  choose between hiding useful cost information from their patients and  losing their other contacts.   Eliminating gag clauses is an integral part of driving down  healthcare costs and prescription drug prices, an issue that hits home  with each and every one of our constituents. It may not solve the  entire drug pricing dilemma, but it is an essential piece. When this  bill becomes law, it will make a real difference in the lives of  patients across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I support S. 2553, and I urge fellow Members to support  this legislation. Let's send it to the President's desk for his  signature.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).  [[Page H8801]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this important legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
