 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   You know, I find myself in a situation here where I am both excited  and I am sad. I am finally getting the opportunity to address something  that was one of my major initiatives coming to Congress, and that is to  do something about prescription drug pricing.   As the ranking member noted, I am the one, for over 30 years, who was  at the front counter telling patients how much their medication was  going to be.   I am the one who watched a mother in tears because she couldn't  afford her child's medication.   I am the one who watched a senior citizen try to decide between  buying medication and buying groceries.   Yet, never did it enter into my mind that this was a Republican or a  Democrat thing. No. It never was, and it should not be now. This is  about Americans and about Americans trying to get medications.   Now, I will tell you, in my career, in my pharmacy career, I have  witnessed nothing short of miracles in the way of new drugs.   I can remember a time when, if you were diagnosed with hepatitis C,  you were going to die. That is all there was to it. Now, think about  it. We can actually cure it with a pill. How phenomenal is that? That  is what research and development has done for us.   Now, do pharmaceutical manufacturers need to do a better job with  their pricing? Yes, they do. But I am here to tell you where the real  problem lies. I have been saying it ever since I have been here for 5  years, and that is in the middleman, in the fee PBMs, the pharmacy  benefit managers, the ones who hide behind the curtain and are causing  this, that bring no value whatsoever to the system. Yet H.R. 3 is going  to do away with research and development.  [[Page H10105]]    And, yes, you have heard it. Even if it is 8, even if it is 15, even  if it is 100, even if it is 1, that is one too many that doesn't come  to market. What if it is the one for Alzheimer's?    Madam Chair, this is too important. This  should not be partisan.   Thank goodness we have H.R. 19, a bipartisan bill. Everything that is  in H.R. 19 is bipartisan--everything. And it brings down the cost of  medication without stymieing innovation, without ruining research and  development.   Madam Chair, I encourage Members to support H.R. 19.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, I am thankful to have this  opportunity tonight.   Obviously, the subject matter that we have been discussing here,  prescription drug prices, is something that is very important to all  Americans, and I am very happy that we are finally getting around to  this.   Madam Speaker, as a practicing pharmacist for most of my career, I  take the issue of drug pricing very personally. In fact, it is one of  the primary reasons that I wanted to come to Congress, to do something  about it.   I had the honor and privilege of practicing pharmacy for over 30  years. I was the one at the front counter who had to tell the patient  how much the medication was.   I was the one who witnessed the mother in tears because she couldn't  afford the medication for her child.   I was the one who witnessed the senior citizens trying to make  decisions  [[Page H10118]]  between whether they were going to buy their medications or buy their  groceries.   I was the one on the other side of the counter. I committed myself to  do something about that once I became a Member of Congress, and I am  glad to see that we are finally doing that.   I want to preface my remarks by saying this: I truly believe that  those on the other side of the aisle and we on this side of the aisle  want the same thing. I truly believe that. I truly believe that we all  want to lower prescription drug prices, and I truly believe that we can  do just that. I truly believe that we need to do just that.   However, there are some differences here. Those experiences that I  had on the other side of the counter have driven me to work hard on  bipartisan solutions to lower drug costs for patients since coming to  Congress, but particularly during this last year. However, it seems  that every time I get my hopes up that we will work together to pass  meaningful policies to help the American people afford their  medications, the Democrats have put politics over progress.   In the spring, I was proud to work with my friend Congressman  Schrader, in a bipartisan way, on the BLOCKING Act to increase generic  competition in the marketplace. Again, both of us wanted the same  thing. We worked on this together, in a bipartisan fashion.   But what happened? Speaker Pelosi paired our bipartisan drug pricing  bill up on the floor with political poison pills. Politics over  progress.   This summer, I worked with Congresswoman Schakowsky to strike a deal  to pass a comprehensive drug transparency bill, the METRIC Act.  Unanimously, it passed out of committee. Republicans and Democrats  voted for it.   But what happened? Different versions of these policies we had struck  a bipartisan agreement on were added to the Speaker's bill before us  today. Politics over progress.   This fall, Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans were close to  striking a bipartisan deal with our friends across the aisle to cap  out-of-pocket spending for seniors on Medicare.   What happened? Our Democratic colleagues walked away from those  bipartisan negotiations to double down on a partisan bill that we know  is dead on arrival in the Senate. Politics over progress.   This holiday season, Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans  introduced a bill, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, to make  one last, earnest effort to pass good, bipartisan drug spending  policies that could be signed into law this year and immediately help  patients--immediate help for patients.   My hope is that we can come together because, as I said before, we  all want the same thing. We all need the same thing. My hope is that we  can come together and support the Walden amendment and pass the  bipartisan Lower Costs, More Cures Act instead of this deeply partisan  H.R. 3.   My hope is that my Democratic colleagues stop putting politics over  progress and join us to pass bipartisan drug pricing reforms that  actually can be signed into law and will help patients.   Madam Speaker, we have a number of people here today who want to  speak on this. I know that I am going to have some personal stories  that I want to share, and I think some of my colleagues are going to  have some personal stories as well, real-life situations, real people,  real problems, real diseases. This is what we are talking about here.    There is no reason in the world that this should be a partisan issue.  Never, in my over 30 years of practicing pharmacy, did I ever go to the  counter and say: Okay, are you a Republican or are you a Democrat? No,  never did that happen, and it should not happen. And it should not  happen in the Halls of Congress, either. There is no excuse, no reason,  that should ever happen.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie),  a gentleman on the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  especially for making the point that is true: We can have both. We can  lower drug costs; we can continue with innovation; and we do not have  to stymie innovation. We can achieve what both sides want to achieve  without stymieing innovation and without cutting out research and  development.   Madam Speaker, I want to bring up another situation in which modern  medicine has played a role. I will give you an example of where  research and development has resulted in miracle cures.   Duchenne muscular dystrophy is another terrible disease that  predominantly impacts males and is a result of a genetic mutation that  inhibits the body from producing the chemical needed to make your  muscles work.   As with the other diseases that we are going to mention tonight, it  has a significant impact on those who are affected. But, fortunately,  we have a drug to treat it.   Exondys is a drug developed to treat a particular group of people  suffering from Duchenne, and it was the first treatment of its kind  approved by the FDA. That means that these people for whom this was  developed would be able to have their bodies develop the protein  necessary to stimulate muscle development and activity. In other words,  it can help to improve the daily  [[Page H10119]]  lives of these people with that particular type of muscular dystrophy.   Once again, I can't stress how much of an impact these incredible  cures that I have witnessed during my lifetime have. During my  professional practice, I have seen nothing short of miracles of people  being able to get their lives back and being able to extend their lives  and live a healthy life.   This therapy that we are talking about right here, Exondys, is not  available in any other country if you needed it. You have to come to  the United States, Madam Speaker. That is the only place that it is  available. It is not available in these other countries.   The gentleman from Kentucky just mentioned about all these  medications that aren't available in other countries. This is an  example of one that we are talking about right here. Our focus has to  continue to be on the cutting edge of drug development.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs.  Rodgers), who is my good friend and a valuable member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee. Representative Rodgers brings an outstanding  portfolio of experience, and we appreciate her very much.    Madam Speaker, I guarantee you that every  person who has the honor and privilege of serving in this august body  has a story just like that and knows someone or has a family member who  has been impacted by a disease and whose quality of life has been  improved by the fact that we have had medications available--everyone  in this Chamber, everyone who has the honor and privilege of serving in  this Chamber.   Again, as I have said all along, we all want the same thing. We all  need the same thing. As Representative Guthrie said earlier, we can  have the same thing without stopping innovation and without stopping  research and development.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks),  who is another invaluable member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.  Representative Brooks is a gentlewoman who brings, again, an  outstanding portfolio of experience, and we appreciate her very much.    Madam Speaker, just one important point to the  gentlewoman, really quick: You are right, whether you believe the CBO  who says that H.R. 3 will result in 8 to 15 drugs not coming to market,  or whether you believe the Council of Economic Advisers, who says over  100 drugs won't come to market, even if it is just one drug, that is  one too many. And I thank the gentlewoman.   Madam Speaker, I recognize one of the members of our Doctors Caucus.  We are very blessed in this Congress to have a number of fine  physicians. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas, (Mr.  Marshall).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce),  another valued member of our Doctors Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the  invaluable experience that he brings to Congress. That is another  example of one of the fine physicians that we have in Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Schweikert).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  excellent points, very well-expressed.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith),  another valuable member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, just very quickly. Pharmacy  benefit managers are a big part of the problem. What we have to have in  the drug supply chain is transparency, and that is what we don't have  now. PBMs bring no value whatsoever to the system. They don't do  research and development. All they do is take from the system, so it is  a big problem.    Madam Speaker, that is true, and I thank the  gentleman for bringing that up. And I thank him for his expert witness  testimony about the constitutionality of H.R. 3, because we both know  that it is not.   Madam Speaker, we are very limited for time here right now, and with  your permission, I want to end with this story:   Madam Speaker, again, we are talking about real people. We are  talking about people like Richard Lutz. Richard Lutz was a store  manager who could be regularly found refereeing youth football,  basketball, and baseball games around my hometown of Savannah, Georgia.  [[Page H10122]]    Richard started having memory problems at 62 years of age. He was  prescribed Aricept to slow down the effects of Alzheimer's, but before  too long, he needed to have someone with him at all times. His wife,  Barbara, worked as a nurse, but they couldn't afford for her to stop  working, too. So Barbara and her four kids did as much as they could to  rotate as caregivers, and they eventually hired another nurse to help  out as well.   Eventually, Richard's memory deteriorated to the point where he lost  his ability to converse. For the last 11 months of his life, he could  only respond to his family members with, I love you, too.   After a 7-year fight with Alzheimer's, Richard Lutz passed away at  the age of 69. Today, Barbara hears from neighbors and friends when  they find out someone they know and love gets diagnosed. They reach out  to her and they ask: What do I do? What do I do?   Barbara told me: All I can tell them is pray for a cure. Pray for a  cure.   Madam Speaker, we want the same thing. We need the same thing. We can  achieve the same thing. And we can do it without giving up hope for a  cure for Alzheimer's or all the other diseases that are out there.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 10 o'clock p.m.), under its  previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow, Thursday, December  12, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
