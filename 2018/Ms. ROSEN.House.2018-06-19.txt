 Mr. Speaker, the images we are seeing of children crying  alone, calling out for their mothers and fathers, is absolutely heart- wrenching.   Right now, innocent children are being detained at our border, and  they are going through unthinkable and life-altering trauma as a result  of the Trump administration's cruel decision to separate migrant  families.   Let me be crystal clear: There is no law requiring border agents to  separate migrant children from their parents, yet this administration  has chosen to implement this horrendous policy and deliberately ignore  public outcry by refusing to put an end to this madness. They are  playing political games instead of doing what is right and true to our  American values.   This heartless and inhumane behavior should not have to require  action from Congress to be changed. But with the President pledging to  continue his heartless policy, we are compelled to act. That is why I  am helping introduce legislation that puts an end to this despicable  policy and keeps families together, which I urge all of my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to support.                            ____________________
