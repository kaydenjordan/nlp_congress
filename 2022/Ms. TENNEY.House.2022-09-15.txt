 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Patricia Zajac of  Utica, New York, who passed away earlier this year.   Patricia was born on February 1, 1947, and spent her entire life in  Utica except for a brief period when she attended Golden West Community  College in California. Upon her return to Utica, she worked as a  nurse's aide at Faxton Hospital in Utica.   Affectionately known as the Mayor of Frances Street, Patricia was  notably active in the Utica community. She was a graduate of the Utica  Police Department's very first citizen's police academy, was a strong  supporter of block associations, and was also active in local politics  and projects that advocated for the betterment of her West Utica  neighborhood. Patricia was also an active parishioner of Holy Trinity  Church and a vital volunteer with the American Red Cross.   Patricia was also known for her efforts to care for homeless animals  and pets and her strong support of our Nation's veterans. She was  extremely proud of her daughter Mary's service in the United States Air  Force.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Patricia so much for her lifetime of  compassionate service to our wonderful community. Her memory will live  on forever. I extend my sincerest condolences to friends, neighbors,  and, of course, her loving family, whom she left behind.                            ____________________
