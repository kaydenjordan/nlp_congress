 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, we are paying a  high price for the President's demand for more than $5 billion to fund  his wall.   The shutdown not only hurts those directly affected, it has begun to  spread to the broader economy.   The shutdown slows economic growth, weakens business confidence,  softens consumer spending, and depresses lending.   JPMorgan Chase estimates the economic costs to be $1.5 billion per  week during the shutdown.   Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, says that if the shutdown  lasts into February, economic growth could be reduced by $8.7 billion.   President Trump's own Council of Economic Advisers projects that  economic growth will slow every week that the shutdown continues.   In addition, the rating agency Fitch has warned that a prolonged  shutdown could lead to a downgrade of U.S. debt. This will raise  borrowing costs for companies and consumers across the country.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce states that the shutdown is harming the  American people, the business community, and the economy.   Mr. President, you are playing a very dangerous game, and we all will  pay the price.                            ____________________
