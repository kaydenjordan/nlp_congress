 Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the ongoing conflict  taking place in the Tigray region of Ethiopia.   For over 10 months, the Tigray People's Liberation Front and the  Ethiopian National Defense Force have clashed in and around Tigray. The  TPLF and the Ethiopian government must come to a true ceasefire  agreement and move toward peace.   The people of Ethiopia are suffering in the most horrific ways  imaginable; starvation, murder, rape as a weapon of war, and other  crimes against humanity. They are losing their lives, homes, and  security.   Now is not the time to bicker about where the fault lies, with both  parties blaming each other for varied and heinous acts. Innocent  civilians are suffering as a result of this brutal conflict. Both the  TPLF and the Ethiopian government must put the good of the people  first.   It is time that we address the needs of the suffering Ethiopian  people by prioritizing refugee visas, and aid that actually reaches  displaced people. We must support peace in the region.                            ____________________
