 Mr. Speaker, the Third Congressional District of  Illinois is home to a historic Puerto Rican community directly linked  to the legacy, present, and future of Puerto Rico.   The lack of food sovereignty in Puerto Rico is a policy choice that  threatens lives and livelihoods.   When I visited Puerto Rico last year, I was shocked to learn that  food insecurity was a major motivation for the second biggest Puerto  Rican migration since the 1950s.   Mr. Speaker, 85 percent of their food is imported, and Puerto Rico is  subjected to much higher grocery prices. When Hurricane Maria hit, food  imports couldn't come in. Many of my Puerto Rican constituents came to  Chicago because of Hurricane Maria and because of food insecurity.   This body has the responsibility to act now on supporting food  sovereignty in Puerto Rico. We can start today by using every  legislative tool at our disposal through the upcoming farm bill.                            ____________________
