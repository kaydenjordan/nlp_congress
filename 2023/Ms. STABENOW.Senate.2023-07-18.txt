 Mr. President, first, I just want to indicate also that  there is a lot to think about here when we are looking at artificial  intelligence. There are a lot of very serious questions we have to  figure out.   I am really pleased that we are seeing this bipartisan initiative in  the Senate, with Senator Schumer, our majority leader, coming forward,  but also with other colleagues who are really helping us go through  briefings and are really looking at all of the questions, because it is  really serious in terms of the questions. It is something we have to  deal with as this is not going away. Certainly, there is a lot we have  to figure out in all of this.
