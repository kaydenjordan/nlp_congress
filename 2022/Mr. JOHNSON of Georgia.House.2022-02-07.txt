 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for  allowing me to speak, and I want to commend my colleague,  Representative Cheri Bustos, for introducing this very important  legislation.   It is a travesty of justice for a woman to be subjected to sexual  harassment and even sexual assault on the job. Oftentimes, it takes  place in a job setting where there is a culture of sexual harassment  and sexual assault.   And when these women find after they have been assaulted that they  are barred from going to court because somehow they have been  hoodwinked into a forced arbitration agreement with their employer,  they are surprised because at that point they have been assaulted for a  second time because when they go into arbitration you often find that  the deck is stacked against the victim in favor of the perpetrator.   This legislation gets at that problem by making those kinds of  agreements unenforceable. I fully support this legislation. I would ask  all of my colleagues to support it. It is good, commonsense  legislation.   Justice is all that is asked for.
