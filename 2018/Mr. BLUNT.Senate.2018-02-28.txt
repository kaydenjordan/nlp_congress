 Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking about  your fellow North Carolinian, Billy Graham. It is very appropriate that  you are in the Chair as I do this--and some of my colleagues are going  to follow--as we honor the life and legacy of Billy Graham.   He was sometimes called America's Preacher, and sometimes called  America's Pastor, but he went to Heaven last week. And what a 99 years  he had while he was here.   He lies in honor today. You and I were over there earlier today in  the Rotunda of the Capitol. Only three private citizens prior to today  have been granted that honor: civil rights champion Rosa Parks in 2005  and two U.S. Capitol police officers who died in the line of duty in  1998, Officer Jacob Chestnut, Jr., and Detective John Gibson.   Somebody observed this morning while we were in the Rotunda of the  Capitol that he is surrounded there by friends he made during his life.  President Eisenhower, President Ford, President Reagan, Dr. Martin  Luther King all are memorialized with statues and a bust in the  Capitol. So Billy Graham is right at home today with people he made  friends with during his life, gave advice to during his life, but never  really saw as uniquely his ministry. His ministry was for people  everywhere.   I might mention that President Truman--and I stand right here behind  one of the desks he used when he was a Senator from Missouri. He was  the first President that Billy Graham met with, in 1950. President  Truman, like lots of us midwesterners, closely held with his faith.  When Billy Graham, at the end of their meeting, said ``Can we pray?''  President Truman said ``I guess it wouldn't hurt anything.'' That was  the first opportunity Billy Graham had to pray with the many Presidents  he prayed with and, I am sure, prayed for after that.   Billy Graham's mom and dad were dairy farmers like mine. He was born  in Charlotte, NC. President Trump said this morning that there was a  prayer meeting in 1934 on the Graham farm. Billy Graham's father made  the place available to have a prayer meeting. The focus of that prayer  group of leaders from the Charlotte, NC, area was to pray that God  would send a leader who would take the Gospel around the world.  Probably nobody at that prayer group had any sense how close they were  to somebody who was just about to begin the process to do that.   That was the year Billy Graham became a Christian. From that point  on, he would say: ``My one purpose in life is to help people find a  personal relationship with God, which, I believe, comes through knowing  Christ.'' That is the end of a quote on his view. For so many times and  in so many different ways, that was a simple statement that defined his  life.   Five years after that, in 1939, he was ordained and became a pastor.  He was pastoring at a church in Illinois while he went to college at  Wheaton College. His Wheaton College education was important, but I am  sure he would say that the best thing that happened there was that he  met his wife, Ruth Bell. They were married for 64 years. It was a  partnership. As one person went all over the world, the other person  raised their five children and took care of things at home and on rare  occasions was able to go with him. Her mom and dad were missionaries.  This was clearly a committed life that she understood.   All five of their children were in the Rotunda of the Capitol today  and in their own way, in each case, have pursued the work their parents  thought was so important.   Reverend Graham didn't just preach the Gospel from inside the four  walls of the church; in fact, I think it was a rare occasion when he  preached in a church as opposed to the places that he preached all over  the world.   In 1949, he spoke to 350,000 people over 8 weeks in Los Angeles. He  began to call those efforts crusades, and eventually over 200 million  people would hear the message from him directly, in person. Millions  more would hear the message from television, print, and movies.   By the way, I read recently that Billy Graham--a young, handsome  guy--was offered a movie contract not too long after that 1949 Los  Angeles crusade. He said that was not his job and that he wouldn't do  it for $1 million a day. His work was clearly understood by him.   He shared Christianity with more people directly than any other  person in the history of the world.   He led his first crusade in St. Louis, MO, in our State, in 1953. He  returned in 1973 for another St. Louis crusade and to celebrate his  55th birthday. The Post-Dispatch reported that the revival's opening  night had 20,000 people, and 4,000 people were in the choir most of the  nights at that revival in St. Louis.   He made several trips to Kansas City. In 1967, the Heart of America  crusade in Kansas City drew 364,000 people. The then-mayor of Kansas  City, Ilus Davis, made Reverend Graham an honorary citizen and gave him  a key to the city. He returned to Kansas City, MO, many times doing  that work.   In 1959, he came to my hometown of Springfield, MO. I was pleased to  read just recently that he said that the Ozarks reminded him of his  native North Carolina.   In 1982, he spoke to a crowd at Evangel University--and this was  inside--of 2,200 people.   For seven decades, Billy Graham brought the Gospel to nearly 215  million people. Despite his widespread recognition, he was always known  for his humility. Whether speaking with a person on the street or the  President, his main purpose was for them to share his sense of the  importance of knowing his Lord, Jesus Christ. He had a message of  grace, not justice; that God could forgive anything, God would forgive  anything; and that nobody gets to Heaven based on their works, they get  to Heaven based on their understanding of the grace of God.   He defended civil rights for African Americans. He insisted from the  early 1950s on--actually, from the beginning of his crusades--that they  would be integrated. He was a friend of Dr. Martin Luther King's. In  1957, he invited Dr. King to speak at one of his revival meetings. He  later bailed Dr. King out of jail. Dr. King said: ``Had it not been for  the ministry of my good friend Dr. Billy Graham, my work in the civil  rights movement would not have been as successful as it has been.''   Reverend Graham spoke about critical issues. His faith inspired him  to build bridges for decades. He was included in the Gallup  organization's 10 most admired men in the world 61 times--more than  anyone else in the history of that poll. He led a remarkable, faith- filled life. He touched many lives.   I ask unanimous consent that the February 23 Wall Street Journal  article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 23, 2018]                      How Billy Graham Changed My Life                            (By George W. Bush)         Billy Graham was, with C.S. Lewis, one of the 20th       century's most influential figures in evangelicalism. I never       had the honor of meeting Lewis, but I did know Billy, who       died last week at 99. He changed my life.        I first met him on my grandmother's porch in Kennebunkport,       Maine, in 1985. In her 80s, she was frail but sharp. They sat       together and Billy held her hand while talking about the       Bible. Later she described it as one of the most peaceful       days of her life.        Soon after, I had my own personal encounter with Billy. As       I wrote in ``Decision Points,'' he asked me to go for a walk       with him around Walker's Point. I was captivated by him. He       had a powerful presence, full of kindness and grace, and a       keen mind. He asked about my life in Texas. I talked to him       about Laura and our little girls.        Then I mentioned something I'd been thinking about for a       while--that reading the Bible might help make me a better       person. He told me about one of the Bible's most fundamental       lessons: One should strive to be better, but we're all       sinners who earn God's love not through our good deeds, but       through His grace. It was a profound concept, one I did not       fully grasp that day. But Billy had planted a seed. His       thoughtful explanation made the soil less hard, the brambles       less thick.        Shortly after we got back to Texas, a package from Billy       arrived. It was a copy of the  [[Page S1265]]       Living Bible. He had inscribed it and included a reference to       Philippians 1:6: ``And I am certain that God, who began the       good work within you, will continue his work until it is       finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns.''        God's work within me began in earnest with Billy's       outreach. His care and his teachings were the real beginning       of my faith walk--and the start of the end of my drinking. I       couldn't have given up alcohol on my own. But in 1986, at 40,       I finally found the strength to quit. That strength came from       love I had felt from my earliest days and from faith I didn't       fully discover until my later years.        I was also fortunate to witness Billy's remarkable capacity       to minister to everyone he met. When I was governor of Texas,       I sat behind Billy at one of his crusades in San Antonio. His       powerful message of God's love moved people to tears and       motivated hundreds to come forward to commit themselves to       Christ. I remember thinking about all the crusades Billy had       led over the years around the world, and his capacity to open       up hearts to Jesus. This good man was truly a shepherd of the       Lord.        Perhaps his most meaningful service came on Sept. 14, 2001.       After the 9/11 attacks, I asked Billy to lead the ecumenical       service at Washington National Cathedral. It was no easy       task. America was on bended knee--frightened, angry,       uncertain. As only Billy Graham could, he helped us feel       God's arms wrapped around our mourning country.        ``We come together today,'' he began, ``to affirm our       conviction that God cares for us, whatever our ethnic,       religious or political background may be. The Bible says that       he is `the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our       troubles.' '' God comforted a nation that day through a very       special servant.        In a difficult moment, Billy reminded me--and us all--where       we can find strength. And he helped us start to heal by       offering three lessons: the mystery and reality of evil, our       need for each other, and hope for the present and future.       ``As a Christian,'' Graham said at the 9/11 service, ``I have       hope, not just for this life, but for heaven and the life to       come.''        A final story: One night while dad was away on a trip       during his presidency, mother and I had dinner at the White       House. Eventually we got to talking about religion and who       gets to go to heaven. I made the point that the New Testament       says clearly that to get to heaven, one must believe in       Christ. Mother asked about the devout who don't believe in       Jesus but do God's work by serving others. She then took       advantage of one of the benefits of being first lady. She       picked up the phone and asked the White House operator to       call Reverend Graham.        It wasn't long before his reassuring Southern voice was on       the line. He told us, as I recall, ``Barbara and George, I       believe what is written in the New Testament. But don't play       God. He decides who goes to heaven, not you.'' Any doctrinal       certitude gave way to a calm trust that God had this figured       out better than I did.        Those of us who were blessed to know Billy Graham benefited       from his deep convictions and personal example, his wisdom       and humility, his grace and purity of heart. We knew that his       life was a gift from the Almighty. And I rejoice that he is       now in the company of God, whom he loved so much and served       so well.     In that article, George W. Bush talked about the impact  Billy Graham had on his life. My favorite line from that article talked  about when George W. Bush's father was President, and his father was  gone, and he and his mother Barbara were having dinner at the White  House. They began to argue a little bit about what it took to get to  Heaven. So Mrs. Bush just decided, well, we will call Billy Graham and  ask him what it takes to get to Heaven. If anybody would know, Billy  Graham would know. According to President Bush, here is what Billy  Graham said to them:         Barbara and George, I believe what is written in the New       Testament. But don't play God. He decides who goes to heaven,       not you.    We spend a lot of time arguing about lots of things, but a grace- filled life, a life built on the fundamental principles of the Gospel,  is a life that we have benefited from and we uniquely recognize today.  I am glad to be here with my colleagues on the floor as we talk about  this great life and the impact it had.
