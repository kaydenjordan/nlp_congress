 Mr. Chair, I thank Ms. Foxx for yielding me time.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 3.   While we can all agree that Americans pay too much for healthcare and  that the rising cost of prescription medicine needs to be addressed,  H.R. 3 is not the bill to accomplish those goals.   Traveling across Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, I have  met with patients and medical professionals who have told me that the  best way to address rising prescription drug costs include patient  reforms that will include patent reform to get generics to market  faster, price transparency so consumers know the actual cost of the  medication they are purchasing, and incentivizing innovation to help  find new cures.   Contrary to these goals, H.R. 3 would turn a blind eye to good  bipartisan work done on this issue throughout 2019 that can provide  real savings for our seniors and our families.   H.R. 3 would lead to more government control over a private industry,  putting this country on the road to socialized medicine. And H.R. 3  would lead to fewer cures, with some estimates saying up to 100 fewer  cures would be found as a result of this legislation.   Mr. Chair, we have a bipartisan plan that has the support of doctors  and patients alike. H.R. 19 would provide for more cures, create price  transparency, and get generics to market faster.   These are bipartisan solutions backed by doctors and pharmacists in  Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, in the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania, and across our country.   While Americans struggle to pay for the high cost of prescription  drugs, we have real legislation that can help solve this real problem.  We should not be wasting our time debating something that harms  Americans by providing fewer cures and will never become law.   Mr. Chair, again, I urge my colleagues to oppose this socialist  fantasy in H.R. 3 and encourage us to work on the real bipartisan  solutions in H.R. 19.
