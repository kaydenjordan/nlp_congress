 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Jim  Byrum's term of service as president of the Michigan Agri-Business  Association, as well as his contributions to Michigan's agriculture  industry as a whole.   Jim was born and raised in Onondaga, MI, the fourth generation of his  family to live on the family farm. He maintained his passion for  agriculture by spending his career advocating for individuals in the  industry and the industry itself, first as the executive director of  the Michigan Bean Commission, then as the State executive director of  the Michigan Farm Service Agency, and finally as the president of the  Michigan Agri-Business Association.   Founded in 1903, the Michigan Agri-Business Association supports  Michigan agriculture through State and national education, promotion,  and advocacy. During his 24 years as president, Mr. Byrum has guided  the association and its members through expansive changes in  environmental awareness, agricultural genetics, and economic factors.  With his past experience and in  [[Page S1039]]  his role as head of the Michigan Agri-Business Association, Mr. Byrum  solidified his reputation as a well-respected leader in agricultural  policy and, through the association, represented and championed the  needs of the over 500 member organizations from every agricultural  sector in Michigan. He expertly communicated with lawmakers and  stakeholders to ensure that Michigan remained a leader in agriculture,  the State's second largest industry.   It is my honor to congratulate my friend Jim Byrum for his decades of  service to Michiganders, especially in his outgoing role as president  of the Michigan Agri-Business Association. As the association reflects  on the end of Mr. Byrum's term as President, I ask my colleagues to  join me in congratulating him for his tireless dedication to Michigan's  hard-working agricultural workers and all of us who depend on the goods  and services they provide.                            ____________________
