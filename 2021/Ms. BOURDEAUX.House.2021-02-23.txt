 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as we celebrate Public  Schools Week, to talk about the urgent need to protect our teachers,  educational support staff, all of their families, and the community at  large in our schools.   While the national debate has centered around schools that are  closed, in many States, such as Georgia, school districts with high  COVID transmission rates are back to in-person teaching, but often  without basic safety standards in place, such as requiring students to  wear masks on school property.   Teachers and staff in Georgia do not enjoy the protection of strong  teacher unions, and the State has exempted schools from liability  around COVID. A teacher recognized for excellence in Forsyth County, in  my district, chose to quit her job.   She wrote me, saying: Fortunately, my family earns enough money for  me not to return to teach, but there are some others who don't have  this blessing and are forced into dangerous circumstances. They can't  speak up. They know their employment would be on the line if they did.  So unless others like me speak up and out, this mess will continue.   Mr. Speaker, I join this teacher in speaking out. We owe our  educators the courtesy of basic public health protection. We owe them  prioritization in receiving the vaccine.                            ____________________
