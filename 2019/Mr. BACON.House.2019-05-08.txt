 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an organization  that works with children who have had their lives forever impacted by  terrorism or traumatic loss.   Whether it was a child who lost someone in 9/11 or a child who lost a  parent serving in the military, Tuesday's Children has served over  20,000 children since 2001 through trauma and grief support, youth  mentoring, mental health services, youth leadership development, and so  much more.   Today is its annual Take Our Children to Work Day, a program that  offers the opportunity for youth to see, up close and personal, what it  is like to serve in Congress.   Spending the day with me today are Spencer Hawn and Christopher  Goodwin. They will be joining me at meetings and seeing what it is like  behind the scenes of Capitol Hill.   The work done by Tuesday's Children and other organizations in  support of the children of our fallen is critical. As a Nation, we  mourn the loss of lives lost to terrorists or traumatic events, but  sometimes we forget the children of those who were tragically lost.   I salute Tuesday's Children and its mission to give back to our  wonderful youth.                            ____________________
