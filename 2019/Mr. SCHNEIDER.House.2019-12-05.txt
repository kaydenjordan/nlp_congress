 Madam Speaker, climate change is an immediate and  existential threat to our national security, economy, and the future we  leave to our children.   This is a global problem that requires urgent international  solutions, but the Trump administration is dangerously squandering this  crucial moment. Quite simply, we are running out of time.   By formally beginning withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement,  the President is ceding American leadership on climate and actively  undermining critical efforts to curb emissions and transition to a  clean energy economy.   As signatory countries around the world meet this week for a  conference in Madrid, I am introducing a resolution, joined by more  than 100 of my House colleagues as original cosponsors, condemning the  administration's actions. This resolution sends a strong message that  the House opposes the President's reckless, irresponsible decision to  abandon the climate agreement, and we stand ready to fulfill the  commitments that our Nation made under the Paris Agreement to address  the climate threat.   I urge my colleagues to join me in this clear call for global action  and critically needed U.S. leadership.                            ____________________
