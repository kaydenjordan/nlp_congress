 Mr. President, I do want to thank Senator Carper and  Senator Capito for managing this bill.   I say to the Senators, I very much appreciate what you guys have done  up to this point and what you are going to do over the next 3 or 4  days.   Mr. President, I rise today for the same reason that--several months  ago, I worked with four other Democrats and five Republicans to try to  get something done to address the infrastructure of this country. Why?  Because infrastructure is important.   Let me take you back 60 years. Sixty years ago, it was 13\1/2\ miles  to the closest patch of pavement from my farm. Then, I was about 4 or 5  years old. I remember riding with my dad in a 1954 GMC 300 truck on  that dirt road hauling wheat to town as he weaved around piles of  gravel that were in the middle of that road.   And I asked my father: Why are those piles of gravel there?   He said: They are working to pave this road.   I said: What does that mean--being a 4-year-old.   He said: Well, remember the stretch of road, the 150 or 200 yards  that we drive on to get to the elevator right before the elevator?   And I said: Yes.   This road is going to be all like that.   And I thought, wow.   And it was. It got paved. It got paved for the first 8 miles out of  town, and that was pretty neat.   We were 5\1/2\ miles from pavement then, which was a great  improvement.   Some 10 years later, a little more than 10 years later, that final 4  miles  [[Page S5538]]  was paved so that we could access that highway.   So why is that important? That is important because not only did it  reduce our costs on the farm in things like tires and pins and bushings  and ball joints, but it made our farm more profitable. Because of the  investments that my grandfather and my father's generation made, not  only did it help them at the time, but it helps me to this day.   That was my first introduction to infrastructure, and that is why,  several months ago, I realized that after 15 years in this body and  people from both sides of the aisle talking about infrastructure, that  it was well past time to get something done on infrastructure because I  knew it was economically important; I knew it would create jobs; and I  knew it would help sustain communities all across this country.   So what is in this legislation? Why is this legislation so important?  Well, let me tell you. It is about the economy. It is about creating  jobs. It is about making sure that we can compete in this worldwide  economy that we live in, how we can maintain our position as the  world's premier economy in this world.   So how does it do it? Well, it starts by repairing and modernizing  our roads and bridges, our airports, our transit systems. That is  critically important for an economy.   In my particular case, I live a long ways away from our customer  base. So when I jump in the truck and I go to town and I use that piece  of pavement that was put down 50 years ago, that is important. When I  cross that bridge that crosses the Marias River, when I haul grain to  Fort Benton or Great Falls--without that bridge, I couldn't access my  markets. Without those highways, I cannot access my markets. So it is  critically important we keep our aging bridges and roads and airports  up to snuff.   And then, this also makes an incredibly important investment in our  aging water systems. Where I come from, they call it dryland  agriculture. This year, it is a little dryer than we want because we  are in the middle of a drought. But the truth is, even if you are  looking for drinking water or irrigation water or any water, it is hard  to come by.   As our Native American friends have told us many, many times, water  is life. And so infrastructure to get water to the point where we can  utilize it is critically important. This bill is a major investment in  water infrastructure.   And I would say one other thing. Whether you live in the West or  whether you live in the East, our water systems in this country are  worn out because we haven't done what our parents and grandparents have  done. We have allowed them to decay without investing in this  infrastructure, which is what we are doing today with this package.   Then we talk about broadband, which, if we can get this bill across  the line, I believe it will fix the broadband accessibility issues in  this country.   We came through the pandemic, and we saw how important broadband was  for distance learning, for telehealth, for opportunities for businesses  to expand their customer base. This bill will help expand high-speed  internet throughout this country, both urban and rural.   I will tell you, there is a lot of work that needs to be done in my  home State of Montana when it comes to broadband.   Then there is the grid. If we are going to move forward with electric  vehicles--and they are coming--then we have to have an electrical grid  that will support those electric vehicles. Without improvements to the  electrical grid, we will be behind the eight ball all the time when it  comes to, for example, the electric pickup that Ford is putting out.   I will say, in my lifetime, I will probably have an electric tractor  on the farm because this technology is moving so quickly that it is  real.   This package does much more than that. I just wanted to touch on  those few things. But it is done without increasing your taxes, which  is really important because, right now, as we see our economy moving  forward, we need to keep it going in that direction.   Ultimately, as I said before, this bill comes down to the economy; it  comes down to creating jobs and putting America to work; and it is  about our national security. It allows us to be able to compete with  China in a way that we are losing right now.   I have heard people come to the floor and say: Do you know what?  Infrastructure is good, but we don't need it. We don't need it right  now.   Well, all I have to say is, if you believe that, take the keys to the  car out of your pocket--known as our economy--and give them to China,  because you are giving this economy away, and you are going to make  China the leading economic power in this world.   Then there is the issue of bipartisanship that has been talked about  a lot today already. The truth is this bill has made some news because  Democrats and Republicans actually worked together. They actually  compromised. Nobody got everything they want, but everybody won.   And as I have told many media outlets, this shouldn't be news, but in  this day and age, it is. Hopefully, this will set an example so that we  can have much more bipartisan legislation going forward.   And, in that regard, I want to thank my colleagues for their  dedication to this effort over the last several months, the G-10-- Senators Portman, Sinema, Collins, Warner, Romney, Manchin, Cassidy,  Shaheen, Murkowski--all of you folks who sat with me in the same room,  and we battled it out. Sometimes, the conversation has been fun.  Sometimes, it has not been so much fun. But the truth is every one of  these folks wanted to get to yes, and in the end we did get to yes.   I want to thank Senator Schumer. I want to thank him for his  patience, not something that he is known for. But he has been  incredibly patient as this bill has been debated and changed and moved  forward, particularly over the last week, although I will say that he  pushed the envelope and made sure we were tending to business even  before that, because I think Senator Schumer also wants to see this  bill come to fruition.   I also need to thank the administration, the folks who represent  President Biden in his negotiations. And I am going to name names:  Louisa Terrell, Brian Deese, Steve Ricchetti. These folks were  incredible resources, and they were incredibly helpful, and this bill  would not have happened without their input.   I also want to thank all the staff members, both in the personal  offices and the committees, from both sides of the aisle, who gave up  their weekends and worked late into the night over and over and over  again. I have said this before. I will say it again. The staff does the  work; the Senators take the credit for it. The fact is that our staffs  really rolled up their sleeves and really performed in a way that every  American would be proud.   Look, over the next 3 or 4 days, we have the opportunity to prove  that the U.S. Senate can do big things and still function. The process  we have been through hasn't been pretty. I don't think it is supposed  to be pretty. But it has been worth the while.   I would say the world is watching, both our allies and our  adversaries. Our allies want us to succeed. Our adversaries want us to  fail. I would say to everybody in this body, on both sides of the  aisle--and we did get a 67-vote majority to move forward with this  bill: Let's show them that America can function again. Let's get this  bill passed. Let's get it over to the House. Let's get it to the  President's desk for his signature.   With that, I yield, Mr. President.    Madam President, thanks for the recognition. I want to  start by thanking Senator John Thune on this amendment. He and I  cosponsored this together.   There is incredible investment in broadband infrastructure in this  bill. For obvious reasons, the pandemic has taught us that we need to  have better broadband service if we are going to be able to have  distance learning, if we are going to have telehealth, and if we are  going to have businesses have it and give them the opportunities to be  able to expand their customer base.   Well, the challenge out there is workforce, and what this bill will  do is it will help us better understand how many folks are actually  going to need to be hired to train on this enormous endeavor. It will  not only help with workforce, but it will also help to make sure  working conditions are safe and the folks are fairly compensated for a  hard day's work.   Look, the broadband provisions in this bill are landmark and will  create good-paying jobs not only during the building of the  infrastructure but also well on for decades and decades past. We need  to make sure every community is included and nobody is left behind.  This amendment will help us achieve those goals. I would encourage my  colleagues to support it.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the words  of John Thune: Listen to Thune, vote yes.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2162
