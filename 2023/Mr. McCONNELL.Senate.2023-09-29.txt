 Mr. President, you know how we always refer to each  other as ``my friend'' from whatever State it is. Honestly, frequently,  that is not true.   But Elaine and I were actual friends of Dick and Dianne. Elaine  served on a corporate board with Dick for a number of years. When they  were in town together, we would frequently have dinner together.   Elaine and I got married shortly after the 1992 election, and I  remembered that Dianne gave us a small depiction of the Capitol. I  looked at it this morning because it is still on the wall and  remembered our dear colleague as a truly remarkable individual.   As the majority leader has pointed out, she was an incredibly  effective person at every line, at level, and she was at all of those  levels on the way to the Senate.   Those of us who were fortunate to call Dianne our colleague can say  we served alongside the longest serving female Senator in American  history.   Dianne was a trailblazer in her beloved home State of California, and  our entire Nation is better for her dogged advocacy and diligent  service.   Over the past three decades, the senior Senator from California was  also the steady hand leading sensitive and consequential work as head  of the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee. Her name  became synonymous with advocacy for women and with issues from water  infrastructure to counterdrug efforts.   Of course, as the first woman to lead her hometown board of  supervisors and then govern as mayor, she was making history and making  a difference long before she came to the Senate.   And as much as this institution and the American people will remember  Dianne's devoted public service, as I indicated earlier, Elaine and I  will also remember and cherish the friendship of 30 years we were  fortunate to share with Dianne and Dick.   So, today, I know the entire Senate family is gathering around  Senator Feinstein's loyal staff. Our thoughts and prayers are with  Dianne's daughter Katherine, her granddaughter Eileen, the entire  Feinstein family, and with all who mourn our dear colleague and friend.    Madam President, Congress has until tomorrow night to  pass a straight-forward short-term funding extension and avoid a  government shutdown.   All this week, and every time we have found ourselves in this  situation before, I have offered my colleagues the same warning:  Shutting down the government doesn't help anybody politically; it  doesn't make any meaningful progress on policy; and it heaps  unnecessary hardships on the American people as well as the brave men  and women who keep us safe.   Right now, I am encouraged that many of my colleagues who share our  concerns are working hard on amendments to strengthen the pending  legislation and avert the disastrous effects of a shutdown.   Congress has an opportunity right now to pay our servicemembers,  border security personnel, and other essential workers; to keep  important government functions running; and to keep the lights on so  the important discussions we are having right now about dealing with  Democrats' border crisis, delivering disaster relief, supporting  Ukraine, and reining in reckless spending can continue. And I would  urge our colleagues to take that opportunity.                           University of Louisville    Madam President, now, on an entirely different matter, today, I join  my alma mater, the University of Louisville, in celebrating the  inauguration of its new president, Dr. Kim Schatzel.   As many alum will tell you, UofL is a special place. For me, it was  the first place in Kentucky where I felt completely at home. And it is  somewhere I continue to find fulfillment in my personal and public  life.   As a young man, it is where I met the first professor who challenged  me to think for myself, where I tested my talents in my first art  class, and where I was lucky enough to take part in UofL's  congressional internship program. And that turned out a lot better than  my artistic pursuits.   These days, UofL continues to be an important part of my life,  whether I am tailgating football games with friends, advocating on  behalf of the university in Washington, or observing the success of the  McConnell Center scholars.   As President Schatzel steps into her new role, I hope she will find  the immense opportunity and access afforded to myself and every UofL  student, staff, faculty, and alum who walks this campus.   Throughout its 225-year history, UofL has hosted a long list of  visionary leaders who shaped its success, and today I am proud to  welcome President Schatzel to though those ranks. Her wealth of  experience in both academics and business make her a valuable addition  to the UofL family.   Before joining the University of Louisville, she led a successful  career in corporate America. In just two decades, she rose from foreman  on a Ford Pinto assembly line to heading up a multinational  manufacturing enterprise.   She would eventually pivot to an equally impressive career in  academia, taking her marketing genius to higher education. As President  of Towson University, she bolstered graduation rates and broke records  in capital investment on campus.   These are high priorities for our university as well, and I look  forward to partnering with her to bring similar success to the UofL and  broader communities.   The city of Louisville, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the entire  Nation rely on the University of Louisville for its research and  innovations in medicine, engineering, agriculture, the arts, and so  much more.   Leading a major metropolitan university like UofL is a big job, but I  think I speak for the entire Louisville community when I say: President  Schatzel, keep up the great work. From one Cardinal to another, I wish  her the best of luck and congratulations this momentous day.
