 Madam Speaker, I find no pleasure coming  to the floor today to consider impeachment. I ran for Congress to  represent my community and to serve the country I love.   As a combat veteran and having served 8 years on the Intelligence  Committee, I understand the threat that foreign actors can play in our  elections. Every elected official must dedicate themselves to  protecting our democracy. No one should invite a foreign country  to interfere with our most sacred act of voting.    It was abuse of power by the President to ask a foreign nation to  interfere in our election to benefit his personal and political  interests and to condition bipartisan, congressionally approved aid on  that interference.   Unchecked, these actions could lead us down a path that will unravel  the fabric of our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I am saddened we are here today, but in the interest  of defending our Nation, I will vote for the Articles of Impeachment.
