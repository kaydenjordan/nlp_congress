 Mr. Chair, how soon do we forget?   The bill before us today is an affront to the American people. This  bill is fatally flawed. It would set America up for more severe  financial crises in the future. It is plain and simply the wrong  choice.   Let me give you one example. Under the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act, many  banks would be free from regulatory oversight if they merely maintain a  10 percent leverage ratio.   Let's break that down for the American people. If this bill was law  in 2008, one-third of the banks that eventually failed would be free  from regulatory oversight altogether. To be clear, 125 banks that  failed during the crisis would meet the bill's low requirement for  regulatory relief, not according to me, but to an independent  clearinghouse analysis.   You don't have to be a financier to realize that this proposal is  dangerous and an insult to American families who lost nearly  everything. I am talking about those families in rural and urban  America who saw their household net worth drop $10 million, the largest  loss of wealth in the history of the United States of America.
