 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  5376, the Inflation Reduction Act. For years, Americans have faced  rising costs at grocery stores, pharmacies, and in recent months, at  the gas pump. Today, we will send this legislation to the President's  desk to be signed into law so we can provide necessary relief to  hardworking people across the country.   The Inflation Reduction Act takes historic steps to reduce the  deficit and fight inflation, invest in domestic energy production and  manufacturing, and tackle the climate crisis by reducing carbon  emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030. The bill will also lower  prescription drug and health care costs by finally allowing Medicare to  negotiate prescription drug prices and extending the expanded  Affordable Care Act program for three years.   Notably, this legislation makes sure that the biggest corporations  and billionaires pay taxes. It establishes a 15 percent corporate  minimum tax and invests in Internal Revenue Service tax enforcement to  ensure that the biggest corporations, the ultra-wealthy, and rich tax  cheats pay their fair share. Large corporations have been using  inflation as an excuse to abuse their market power, jacking up prices  for American consumers at the grocery store, the pharmacy, and at the  gas pump. This law puts taxpayer dollars back into the pockets of  working families.   My vote today comes with a promise to my constituents in Connecticut  and to the American people--I will continue the fight for common sense,  proven solutions like the Child Tax Credit in the days and weeks to  come. As I have said before, as American families face rising costs,  the expanded Child Tax Credit is one of our best tools to help them  face these challenges. We still have so much work to do to address the  problems being faced today by working families.   Today is an important step forward, and I am proud to cast my vote in  support of this critical legislation.
