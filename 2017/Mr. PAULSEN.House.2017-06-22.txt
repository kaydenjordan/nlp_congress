 Mr. Speaker, according to recent VA analysis, an average  of 20 veterans commit suicide per day. Additionally, 20 percent of  those who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD or major  depression.   Addressing the mental health of our veterans needs to be a top  priority, which is why I am cosponsoring the Puppies Assisting Wounded  Servicemembers Act, or the PAWS Act. It is an additional way to provide  better treatment for our soldiers who are struggling with various forms  of mental health following their service and deployment.   This initiative allows the VA to create a 5-year program to give  organizations grants to pair veterans suffering with PTSD with service  dogs to increase their recovery. Studies show that service dogs  contribute considerably to one's emotional and psychological well- being.   Mr. Speaker, the PAWS Act will help with the recovery of our veterans  who have paid a great price in serving our country. It is imperative  that our veterans' mental health remains a high priority and that they  have access to as many options as possible.                            ____________________
