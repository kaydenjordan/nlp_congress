 Madam Speaker, the hypersexualized left is not satisfied  with its month of sexual pride. Instead, they are going after our  children, and it is coming to a neighborhood near you.   From drag shows in schools, to gender-affirming care, to hiding  sexual orientation and gender identity from parents, the sex-obsessed  left knows no bounds; which is why I am introducing two bills to  protect children and to affirm God's creation.   First, I am introducing the Keep Our Kids Safe Act of 2023, which  will prohibit use of Federal education funding for drag performances or  instruction by drag queens in elementary or secondary schools.   Can you believe that in this time that I am having to introduce  legislation to protect children from men in dresses?   The second bill I am introducing is the There Are Two Sexes Act of  2023, which prohibits Federal funds from being used to create any  Federal form that has anything other than male or female. America  should not be funding the radical left's agenda to sexualize children  in schools.                            ____________________
