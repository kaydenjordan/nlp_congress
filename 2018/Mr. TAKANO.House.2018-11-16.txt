 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Henry W.  Coil, Jr., a Riverside native and a champion of education in the arts.   Henry has left an indelible legacy as a visionary and as a  philanthropist who loved and supported his community. Through his  generous and highly successful construction work, he helped build and  restore schools and infrastructure throughout the Inland Empire in  southern California.   I knew Henry through his love for Riverside Community College, which  he attended before moving on to UC Berkeley. At RCC, we worked to  establish a new school for the arts, and it was Henry's philanthropy  that helped turn this vision into a reality.   For most of his life, Henry was a successful businessman, but his  dedication to his community set him apart. He served briefly on the  Riverside City Council, and he was a devoted supporter of the Boy  Scouts. In fact, he even went on to earn the Boy Scouts' Distinguished  Eagle Scout Award, recognizing 50 years of his continued service to the  Boy Scouts.  [[Page H9542]]    Above all, what made Henry special was his character. He stood up to  bigotry and prejudice. I recall him saying to me how misguided he  thought it was that a local politician was running a homophobic  campaign. This was a bold position to take at the time, but this  statement has stuck with me, throughout my life and career, as a mark  of his character.   While Henry may no longer be with us, the positive change he created  will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
