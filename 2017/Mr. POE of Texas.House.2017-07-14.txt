 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Thornberry for yielding  time.   Mr. Chair, Pakistan has been supporting all kinds of terrorist groups  for years, including those with American blood on their hands. But  instead of penalizing Pakistan, the government has been rewarding them  with hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid. Some of that money  goes to support terrorists.   Previously, we placed conditions on military aid to Pakistan, but  these conditions are only focused on Pakistan cracking down on one  terrorist group, the Haqqani Network. Meanwhile, Pakistan is aiding and  abetting a long list of terrorists in the region, including the Taliban  in Afghanistan.                                time  1000    My amendment No. 100 places a new condition on any aid to Pakistan.  The condition requires the administration to certify that Pakistan is  not providing military, financial, or logistical support to any  terrorists operating in Pakistan or Afghanistan.   This forces Pakistan to make a long overdue choice: either go after  terrorists or lose millions of dollars of American aid.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, the United States is finally holding  China accountable for its longstanding human trafficking abuses.   In the State Department's 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report, China  was downgraded to the worst level: tier 3.   This means that, in the past year, the Chinese have done little to  nothing to end human trafficking, which is nothing more than modern-day  slavery in this communist nation.   China's crimes include state-sponsored forced labor, sex trafficking,  and trafficking of children, men, and women from other countries.   This puts China alongside some of the world's worst offenders of  human rights: Russia, Syria, and Iran.   It illegally detains and tortures its own people, as well as U.S.  citizens that are there. It also restricts the fundamental human right  to free speech and freedom of religion.   China is allowing labor and sex trafficking to flourish in its  borders. Now the entire world knows what has been taking place behind  their great wall of brutality: abuse.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
