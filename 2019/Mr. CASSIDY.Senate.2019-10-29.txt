 Madam President was presiding before and I heard several  speeches by my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle speaking  about the 1332 waiver process that the Trump administration is using to  lower insurance premiums, and the kind of common refrain is: This is a  terrible thing. We are eroding protections in the Affordable Care Act,  and we should preserve the Affordable Care Act as it is. This is so  ironic because the people who want to get rid of Obamacare right now  are running for President on the Democratic side of the ticket.   If you ask Bernie Sanders if he wants to get replace Obamacare, he  raises his hand. If you ask Elizabeth Warren if she wants to replace  Obamacare and force people to give up their employer-provided  insurance, she raises her hand.   Now, why do the Presidential candidates--Democratic Presidential  candidates sit there and say: Hey, let's get rid of Obamacare? And when  the administration does something to lower premiums, my Democratic  colleagues stand up and decry this kind of assault upon whatever value  they are speaking to.   What I think is the Democratic candidates running for President are  so aware that healthcare costs under Obama have skyrocketed. Let me see  if I can find my figures here, but it's quite remarkable.   Let's just speak a little bit about what has happened. Since 2013,  the deductible for someone with single coverage has increased by 53  percent. And despite deductibles going up, say, $10,000, premiums have  increased 20 percent. So the patient's out-of-pocket exposure is  increasing both in the deductible and with their premium. For a family  of four in Louisiana--we looked on healthcare.gov just walking here-- $25,000 for the policy with an over $10,000 deductible.   Now, this is not affordable. So clearly there is a concern about  affordability. That is what the Trump administration has been trying to  address. And frankly, that is what Bernie  [[Page S6237]]  Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wish to have Americans sacrifice their  employer-sponsored insurance to address.   But my Democratic Senate colleagues don't want to do this. They would  rather have all the protections of Obamacare, even if you cannot afford  the policy. And truly, that is what we are doing now. And now, we get  to speaking about the waivers that the Trump administration is giving,  somehow they are saying these are terrible things.   Let me point out that, in the seven States with 1332 waivers granted  under the Trump administration, health insurance premiums have  decreased by 7.5 percent. Some States have had a double-digit  reduction. Maryland, for example--and I will come back to Maryland--has  had a 30-percent reduction in their health insurance premiums under the  1332 waiver given by the Trump administration. North Dakota had a 20- percent reduction.   And what about if you didn't get a waiver? In my State, which didn't  apply for a waiver, premiums are expected to rise 10 percent this  coming year--10 percent. So the family of four paying $25,000 a year  with a $10,000 deductible will pay $27,500 next year, with a $12,500  deductible, meaning they will be out almost $40,000--$40,000 for their  health insurance.   I suspect there is a lot of families in my State that wouldn't have  minded if we applied for a waiver if we could just lower premiums,  instead of seeing out-of-pocket expense continue to rise.   Now, there is a little bit of an irony here. Maryland has a  legislature dominated by Democrats, and they actually got a 1332  waiver. So my Democratic colleagues who are speaking about how terrible  these waivers are, they should look back to States which Democrats  control who are applying for these waivers.   I am told that Montana has a waiver, Montana with a Democratic  Governor who is running for President on the Democratic side of the  ticket. Apparently, that person felt it was something that he would  sign into law and otherwise approve because it would be beneficial to  the people in the State.   I don't know why, in the Senate, my Democratic Senate colleagues want  Americans to pay more for insurance. Why do they insist on continuing  to advocate for policies which make healthcare, health insurance, so  unaffordable?   This is personal for me. Besides being an American wanting all to  have coverage, for 25 years, I worked in a hospital for the working  poor, for the uninsured, trying to bring healthcare to those who could  not otherwise afford it. It has been my life mission, if you will, as a  physician, to try and get healthcare to those who cannot have it.   And so when folks want to give them this great policy, but you can't  afford it, but don't worry, it is a great policy if you can afford it,  I have to smile. Like the Greek myth Tantalus--where we get the word  ``tantalize'' from--where the prize is always just beyond the reach,  just beyond the reach, always there to tempt, but you can never have.   So you have a family making $120,000 a year having to pay $25,000 for  insurance, with a $10,000 deductible. They are sacrificing so many  things. It is tantalizing, but we are sure this is a better state of  affairs.   Now, what the administration has done, they have given States  flexibility to craft affordable options for families that do not have  subsidies. It respects the fact that some States are different than  other States. Imagine that.   Alaska is different than Rhode Island--Alaska, if you laid it across  a map of the lower 48, would stretch from Georgia to California, but  has fewer people than Rhode Island, and Rhode Island, which is a  postage stamp compared to Alaska. Those States are different, so allow  them to have different healthcare systems.   By the way, when we do this, we are assured by the administration  that they continue to enforce protections for those with preexisting  conditions and all other things that we as Americans, that we as  Republicans, that I as a physician who have spent my life caring for  the uninsured, value--so that, if healthcare is not affordable, it is  not available. And what we have seen by the folks on the left who are  concerned about healthcare costs is a doubling down on government  control.   They want to go for Medicare for All. They want to take away your  employer-sponsored insurance. But at least they acknowledge that cost  is a problem. What my Senate colleagues are not doing, the ones who are  speaking today, is acknowledging that cost is a problem, and you can  have the greatest plan in the world and, if it is unaffordable, then  that greatness is ironic. It is on a piece of paper, but it is not real  in someone's life.   What we have seen is that States, when they come to the Federal  Government requesting permission to put in a program which is specific  to the circumstances in their State, they are not only covering the  citizens in their State, continuing to have protections for those with  preexisting conditions, but they are also lowering premiums by as much  as 30 percent. And that is a good thing, and I have no clue why my  Democratic colleagues do not want to see premiums lowered by 30  percent.   Madam President, thank you, and I yield the floor.
