 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1. I  have always found it interesting that elections are the one thing my  colleagues on the other side don't want to strictly regulate.   You see, Madam Speaker, there is this mythology amongst Democrats  that commonsense rules in an election are synonymous with voter  suppression. They make it sound as if you have to go through an  obstacle course to go vote. This isn't true. It is nonsense, and  everybody knows it.   The truth is that four out of five Americans support voter ID laws,  and countless Americans have expressed concern because they received  mail-in ballots for other people addressed to their homes. They want  this fixed, and they don't want the problem to get worse. But this bill  makes elections less trustworthy, not more.   Trust is everything. When people can see the faults in the process,  whether it is ballots at the wrong house or careless verification  processes, they believe people are cheating. You can't just dismiss  that, Madam Speaker. We have to fix it. But instead this bill makes  permanent the problematic election practices that cause distrust.   For example, Madam Speaker, ballot harvesting creates serious chain  of custody issues, and universal mail-in voting without safeguards  creates the kind of chaos where your ballot ends up in someone else's  hands, as does forcing States to disregard their own voter ID laws and  use sworn statements instead of an ID.   The integrity of our elections must be self-evident, wherein the mere  possibility of fraud is improbable because the process itself is  airtight and secure. Many States today do not meet that standard. We  should be working together to make elections more secure, not less. If  that is indeed our mutual goal, and I pray that it is, then I implore  my colleagues to work with us.
