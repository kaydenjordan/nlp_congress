 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained due  to a personal family matter, and I regret missing the vote on the HALT  Fentanyl Act today. I would have proudly voted in favor of this  legislation, and I remain committed to fighting the fentanyl epidemic.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 237.                             Personal Explanation
