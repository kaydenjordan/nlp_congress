 Mr. Speaker, in recent years, some Americans  suspect that politics has infected our courts, particularly the United  States Supreme Court. This troubling trend threatens our democracy when  the independence of our judiciary is questioned.   Last week, I introduced a bill that requires the Judicial Conference  of the United States to create a code of ethical conduct for the U.S.  Supreme Court.   Unlike Federal judges, Supreme Court Justices are exempt from the  code of conduct. The Supreme Court Ethics Act changes that.   Supreme Court Justices should not be exempt from adhering to the  standards other Federal judges must follow.  [[Page H1560]]  Passage of this necessary ethical reform would restore the public's  confidence and perception that the judiciary is independent, impartial,  and apolitical; and it would protect public confidence in the rule of  law, the inviolability of the judiciary and the incomparable and unique  role it plays in the delicate system of checks and balances that  sustains our democracy.                            ____________________
