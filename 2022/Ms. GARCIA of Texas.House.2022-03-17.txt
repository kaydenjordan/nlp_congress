 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  President Biden for the progress our Nation has made this past year. In  early 2021, the President took office during a global crisis and was  determined to get America back on track. He knew we needed a comeback.  He knew we needed to focus on building a better America.   So what did President Biden do? He invested in the American people,  and he invested big. The boom was beginning.   In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan was signed into law. In  total, a historic $1.9 trillion were put to work for the American  people during the severe public health and economic crisis caused by  COVID.  [[Page H3781]]    Since then, the American Rescue Plan has been helping us recover. We  are now enjoying one of the strongest periods of economic growth in  history, and we are building a better America.   If we look at the progress we have made over the past year, Madam  Speaker, we can see how successful the American Rescue Plan truly has  been.   The plan powered historic jobs recovery and produced the largest  calendar increase in jobs on record. The unemployment rate dropped at a  record pace, but we have also seen the biggest drop in long-term  unemployment ever recorded in a 12-month span. Nearly 2.5 million  people broke out of the cycle of long-term unemployment. Madam Speaker,  this is huge.   As the Representative of a majority Latino district, I was especially  proud to learn there were record drops in Latino and African-American  unemployment rates. African-American unemployment fell by more than 30  percent. Latino unemployment fell from nearly 9 percent to 4.4 percent,  the fastest drop ever recorded.   These are hardworking Americans going back to work, putting food on  the table, and earning good paychecks. This is building a better  America.   We have seen that when Americans have job opportunities, great things  happen, and they do. That is why we also saw the lowest number of home  foreclosures ever recorded. We also witnessed a record low number of  credit card delinquencies.   The American Rescue Plan isn't only helping working adults. The  American Rescue Plan's historic child tax credit benefits nearly 40  million families with 65 million children.   Madam Speaker, in my own home State, the child tax credit directly  benefits nearly 7 million children, many in our area of Houston. Madam  Speaker, that is a whole lot of children. Most families in Texas will  receive several thousand extra dollars because of the increased 2021  child tax credit.   Because of these historic tax credits, child poverty rates have been  slashed dramatically. In only 1 year, unemployment is at a record low,  job opportunities are on the rise, and child poverty rates have been  reduced. We are building a better America for all.   I am so proud we have a strong leader in the White House who is  leading America to full recovery. President Biden got it right, Madam  Speaker. He understood that betting on the American people is always a  good idea. With the right resources, America will win. We will all win.  It is just that simple. Together, we really are building a better  America.                            ____________________
