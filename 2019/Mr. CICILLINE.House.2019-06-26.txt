 Mr. Speaker, last week the Department of Justice tried  to argue in Federal Court that the United States Government did not  have to provide detained children with soap, toothbrushes, or even  beds. The department refused to answer whether or not the children's  ability to go to sleep was a requirement of providing safe and sanitary  conditions.   This is another despicable example of this administration's harmful  policies that are meant to do nothing more than strike fear in the  hearts of those who come to our border.   They continue to try to hide this from the American people. They told  Congress that there was no family separation policy. That was a lie.  Now, they are trying to explain away the inhumane treatment of the very  children they have chosen to separate from their families. I have been  to the border. I have seen the cages and the foil blankets. I have  talked to the children and the parents they have been separated from.  This is a crisis.   Yesterday, thankfully, the House passed $4.5 billion in emergency  funds to strengthen health and safety requirements for migrants of all  ages, to protect parents from unnecessary separation or prolonged  detention, and to help address the root causes that are forcing people  to flee their own countries.   America is the greatest country in the world. There is no reason that  children should be in cages or people should be dying in the custody of  our government.   Mitch McConnell needs to do his job, pass this bill, and send it to  the President's desk to be signed into law immediately.                            ____________________
