 Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the chair and the  ranking member for working with me to include a proposal in this bill  that I developed with Congresswoman Black, Congressman Thompson, and  Congressman Meehan modernizing Medicare and harnessing the promise of  telehealth to improve care for patients nationwide.   Allowing patients with end-stage renal disease to receive dialysis at  home can dramatically improve their health outcomes and quality of  life. This is something I have heard consistently from providers in my  home State of Washington, like the Northwest Kidney Centers, who do  incredible work to help patients receive dialysis at home when it is  medically appropriate.   Advances in telehealth hold great potential to extend this treatment  option to more Americans, particularly in rural communities, but there  are still too many barriers to the use of cutting-edge technologies in  Medicare.  [[Page H6238]]  There is a great need to update our laws to reflect these innovations  and reimburse telehealth appropriately; otherwise, we won't just be  denying access to healthcare today, we could be preventing the next  frontier of innovations from even getting off the ground.   Without the long-term visibility of Medicare coverage, startups and  entrepreneurs might never get the funding they need to develop new  technologies and bring them to market. It is essential that we unlock  the full potential of telehealth. By doing so, we can improve patient  care, promote health, defeat heartbreaking diseases, and save lives.  That is why I am so glad we are taking this step today.   Thank you again to the committee for working with me on this  important bill, and I hope it is the first of many victories as we work  together to expand telehealth.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
