 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of condemning the horrors of  socialism. The biggest crimes in humanity have happened under socialist  regimes. It has taken more than 100 million lives. Margaret Thatcher  said it best, and I will paraphrase it: Eventually you run out of  people to take money from. That is the only way socialism works.   President Trump said we would never be a socialist country in his  State of the Union Address, and I was shocked that over half of this  body, Mr. Speaker, refused to stand and applaud that. I think it tells  where we are as a country. Too many people have fought and died for  this country.   If you have ever come to my Knoxville office, there is a 48-star flag  that is on the wall. It is a flag that was draped over my uncle's  casket. He was too old to go fight, Mr. Speaker. He went and enlisted  anyway.   They sent him back home to Cheatham County. He went back and enlisted  again, and they let him go. He died shortly after the D-day invasion as  a sergeant.   Too old to go to fight, but he went anyway. He fought for the  American Dream. He fought for what we have in this country, and every  dadgum day we want to throw it away.   The fact that we are even having this conversation sickens me, Mr.  Speaker. I say that with all sincerity.
