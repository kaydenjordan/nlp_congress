 Mr. Speaker, parents can't go back to earning until  their children can go back to learning. The topic of reopening schools  has been top of mind in recent weeks. We also need safe care for our  young ones though, because their parents need to work, too.   Childcare is essential, for parents and children. Many childcare  providers have closed during this pandemic, some for safety, some for  financial reasons.   But childcare isn't just about parents' jobs. High quality early  childhood education is the single best way to close the opportunity gap  and give disadvantaged children a strong start. Every dollar invested  in early childhood education pays back $7 down the road, and that is a  phenomenal investment.   The Child Care Is Essential Act provides financial assistance so  providers can reopen safely.   By passing this bill, we support children, working families, and  childcare providers; all worthy of our investment.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in Washington State, we are blessed with an abundance of  rivers and lakes that support fish and wildlife. Right now, projects  like modifying tide gates and restoring or reconnecting floodplains and  wetlands are not getting the priority they need to protect these  important ecosystems.   I am so pleased that the bill I introduced with Congressman Rick  Larsen was included in WRDA. By prioritizing rivers with the greatest  chance of recovery, we have the best shot at protecting these waterways  and achieving the largest return on our investments.   Healthy rivers mean clean water for fish, wildlife, and communities,  and healthy salmon runs help us meet our treaty rights obligations,  ensure thriving local economies and recreational opportunities, and  protect our endangered salmon and orca populations.
