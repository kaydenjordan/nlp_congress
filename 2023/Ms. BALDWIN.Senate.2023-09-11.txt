 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the career and  achievements of John McKenzie, owner of the McKenzie Apartment Company.  Throughout his career, John has fused together his work in home  construction with his passion for community service to establish the  next generation of leaders in the housing industry.   Born and raised in Madison, WI, John got his start in business  working with his father in real estate. After graduating from UW- Madison as a business major in 1971, he began his career in real estate  development around the country, working from Cincinnati to San  Francisco. In 1989, he returned to Madison where he had a significant  impact on the region's real estate development and revitalization.  During this period, he cofounded his family business, the McKenzie  Apartment Company.   John is somebody who takes deep pride in his work, creating both  homes and opportunities to improve the lives of others. With this  mission, John began working with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Dane  County. He recognized that, by working with the Boys and Girls Club, he  could have a remarkable and lasting impact on the community by  introducing skilled trades to the young people in the program. Having  been a Madison Area Builders Association--MABA--member for 30 years,  John connected the Boys and Girls Club with the MABA, and a lasting  partnership has resulted.   In collaboration with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Dane County and the  Madison Area Builders Association, John raised the significant funds  needed to build and sustain a facility that provides space for youth  ranging from elementary school to high school to participate in  introductory trade activities. This year, the McKenzie Regional  Workforce Center opened to train and connect a new generation of young  people of diverse backgrounds to the skilled trades. A first-of-its- kind project for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and a National  Association of Home Builders--NAHB--affiliated local home builders  association, the center will serve as a national template, preparing  young people in Dane County for quality, family-sustaining jobs at a  time when the skilled trades are facing a labor shortage. Due to John's  innovative idea, a national movement was sparked to partner local Boys  and Girls Clubs with the construction industry around the Nation.  John's impact will be felt nationwide through 10 local partnerships  that began in 2023 and another 20 beginning in 2024.   With John's persistence, leadership and dedication to his community,  he has impacted so many lives in our State. I am so pleased to join  others in recognizing his success and accomplishments. I wish him and  his family all the best and applaud his continued efforts in the  skilled trades.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to recognize the International  Crane Foundation's 50th anniversary. I am delighted to recognize this  global conservation organization with Wisconsin origins.   While the efforts of the International Crane Foundation now reach  across the world, its story began in 1971 at Cornell University. This  was where two ornithology students, Ron Sauey and George Archibald,  bonded over their shared appreciation for cranes. They imagined an  organization that could combine their work on captive breeding,  research, restoration, and education to protect the 15 different crane  species on Earth. In 1973, Sauey and Archibald's vision became a  reality when the International Crane Foundation was founded out of the  Sauey family farm in Baraboo, WI.   Over the last 50 years, the foundation has used dynamic methods and  community-oriented approaches to conserve cranes and the ecosystems,  watersheds, and flyways they depend on. The foundation fosters the  international cooperation of crane protection by providing knowledge,  leadership, and inspiration to people in the communities where cranes  live, engaging them to resolve threats to these birds and the  landscapes they call home.   Today the International Crane Foundation has grown to a staff of more  than 125 people, with a network of hundreds of specialists in over 50  countries on the five continents where cranes live. The organization  moved from the humble Sauey farm where it was born, to a nearly 300- acre headquarters in Baraboo, complete with live crane exhibits, guided  tours, a research library, and 4 miles of nature trails. While the  reach of the foundation has greatly extended over the past 50 years,  their mission remains the same: to protect and restore wild crane  populations and the landscapes they depend on.   On the 50th anniversary of this remarkable organization, I am proud  to recognize the International Crane Foundation and look forward to its  continued success and conservation efforts.                            ____________________
