 Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk  about our Nation's economy.   We have come to the end of another calendar year. The American people  are asking themselves a simple question: Are we better off now, today,  than we were 1 year ago?   For most Americans, the answer is no. In fact, a new survey from the  New York Federal Reserve says just that. Most of the people surveyed  say they are worse off now than they were 1 year ago.   Most also said, very concerning, that they expect to be worse off a  year from now than they are today, and it is easy to see why. Shelves  are empty, we have the worst labor shortage ever recorded, and prices  are rising at the fastest rate in 40 years.   Joe Biden is breaking records, but not the good kind. Joe Biden is  about to enter his second year in office with record-high inflation and  record-low approval.    Since Joe Biden took office, prices have gone up much faster than  wages. As a result, the typical American family can purchase less today  than they could a year ago. People have had to change the way they  drive, they shop, and they eat.   By one estimate, families are paying $175 more every month because of  inflation since Joe Biden took office. This works out to be $2,000 a  year--a bite out of the paychecks of the American people equivalent to  a loss of $2,000.   Now, some estimates are even higher. Harvard Professor Jason Furman  was a  [[Page S9186]]  top adviser to President Obama. His estimate is that it is double that  number. He said there have been $4,000 more in expenses for the  American families this year than there was last year.   Of course, the biggest increase that we see is in energy. Gas prices  are up. They are up by more than a dollar a gallon. Now, this is just  in the 10 months since Joe Biden took office. It costs $20 to $30 more  to fill the tank. Today, they are at a 7-year high.   Natural gas prices are also at a 7-year high, while half the families  in America heat their homes with natural gas. One in five American  families has already been cutting expenses in other places to pay for  their energy bill for the year.   Last month was the biggest jump in energy prices, amazingly, in an  entire decade, and winter is almost here. Some people may have to  choose between whether they can afford to eat or whether they can  afford to heat their homes.   It is hard to believe that in just 10 full months in the White House,  Joe Biden could have taken inflation to this very high level.   The supply chain crisis, the worker shortage, the inflation crisis  are all the direct results of the policies of the Biden administration  and the Democrats in Washington.   Why are the shelves empty? Well, because we don't have enough  workers. More than 11 million jobs today are unfilled. We have broken  new records for unfilled jobs in 5 of the first 10 months that Joe  Biden has been in office. And no matter where you go, there are ``help  wanted'' signs in the windows.   This is no coincidence. In March, President Biden extended a bonus  payment to people who stayed home from work. Millions of people made  more money by not going to work than they would by going to work. Well,  in September, that bonus payment ran out.   Then Joe Biden announced a nationwide vaccine mandate on the American  people. This mandate took a sledge hammer to our Nation's workforce.  The President must have known that people would lose their jobs. It  seems he didn't care because he imposed the mandate anyway.   These are people who worked every day during the pandemic, showing up  no matter the weather, no matter the situation. They showed up to do  the job to help the people in their communities and in their States and  in this country.   Now, under Joe Biden, people are losing their jobs, shelves are  empty, prices continue to rise.   In March, Democrats made things worse by putting $2 trillion on the  Nation's credit card. That bill sent inflation into overdrive.   The San Francisco Federal Reserve says the Democrats' spending  increased inflation.   Democrats made lavish promises about their last spending bill. They  said the bill would create millions of jobs. Nancy Pelosi said 4  million jobs. Joe Biden upped the ante and said 7 million new jobs.   How did the predictions turn out? Not so well for the predictions of  Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden. Joe Biden was off by the full 7 million  jobs.   The most recent jobs report shows we created fewer jobs than were  predicted even without the Democrats' spending bill. Those 7 million  jobs Joe promised are nowhere to be found.   Last month, we created less than half the number of jobs the experts  predicted.   Now Democrats want to do the same thing all over again. They want  another multitrillion-dollar spending spree. This spending spree would  cause the largest tax increase in half a century, trillions more in  debt, and even higher prices.   Speaking of rising prices, the price of this spending bill keeps  going up. For months, Democrats claimed that they wouldn't add to the  debt. Then they said the total bill would cost less than $2 trillion.   Last Friday, we found out the real price tag. The Congressional  Budget Office took all the accounting gimmicks, the budgets tricks-- took it all out of the bill--and they told us that the real cost of the  bill is nearly triple the price that the Democrats said.   The real pricetag is close to $5 trillion. It would be the largest  spending bill in history. The Democrats' spending spree would add $3  trillion to the national debt.   And, just yesterday, the Democrats voted--every Democrat voted--to  raise the debt ceiling in the United States by $2.5 trillion. Every  Republican voted against it.   If you think about how much money this is, it is almost the size of  the entire economy of the United Kingdom.   You know, all of this spending would bring the Democrats' total to $5  trillion in new debt in just 10 months.   And what does all of this spending get you?   Well, the most expensive thing in the bill is something that some  refer to as the Green New Deal, which is billions of dollars in new  taxes on America's natural gas production. It includes an army of  climate activists paid to protest American energy projects.   The second most expensive part of the bill is the blue State  billionaire bailout. It is a tax break for people in high-tax States. I  look at it as specifically California, Illinois, New York, and New  Jersey. The vast majority of Americans would get no tax break at all.  Almost all of that benefit would go to the wealthy.   Don't take my word for it. Here is what the Democrat chairman of the  Budget Committee, the junior Senator from Vermont, had to say about it.   He said:         The last thing we should be doing is giving more tax breaks       to the very rich. It sends a terrible, terrible message.    But that is what the Democrats in the House under Nancy Pelosi passed  and sent to the Senate for consideration and passage.   The junior Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the Budget  Committee, also said: ``The hypocrisy is too strong.''   Well, the chairman is absolutely right. Even by the standards of  Democrats in Washington, this hypocrisy is too strong.   If Democrats pass this bill, it will mean tax cuts for billionaires  and tax audits for working families. It will mean higher taxes, more  debt, higher prices, the highest inflation in 40 years, and it will go  even higher.   When the American people ask themselves, ``Are we better off today  than we were a year ago?'' we know what the answer is going to be: a  resounding no. If Democrats pass this bill, it will be no for years and  years to come.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
