Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for votes on March 17, 2021,  so I could return to Hawaii to tend to a family matter.   On March 17, had I been present, I would have voted yea on cloture  motion: Xavier Becerra, of California, to be Secretary of Health and  Human Services, Rollcall vote 124.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of  Katherine Tai to serve as the next United States Trade Representative.  When confirmed, Ms. Tai will be the first woman of color and first  Asian American to lead the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.   Katherine Tai's story is America's story. Her parents came to the  United  [[Page S1610]]  States as graduate students and remained here to make a better life for  themselves and their family, her father as a researcher at the Walter  Reed National Military Medical Center and her mother as a scientist for  the National Institutes of Health.   Given her parents' background, Katherine is no stranger to public  service, and through her parents' hard work and dedication to make a  better life for their daughter, she was able to attend Yale University  and Harvard Law, became a talented trade lawyer, and was nominated by  President Biden to lead the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. I  have a deep appreciation for the Tais, their work ethic and their  commitment to family. Representation matters, and Ms. Tai will be a  representative for the United States in more ways than one.   Ms. Tai is a highly-qualified nominee with the experience to lead the  U.S. trade policy at a critical time for our country, specifically as  we continue to recover from the damage wrought by the coronavirus  pandemic and rebuild our relationships with our allies abroad. She is a  person who can help mend relationships and restore alliances.   Supporters have described her as a knowledgeable, tenacious trade  expert who will work with a cross-section of advocates and stakeholders  with the goal of bettering the lives of the American people and  strengthening our economy at all levels. They have described her  willingness to build coalitions across party lines, highlighting her  broad support from both Democrats and Republicans, and from the labor,  business, and environmental communities. They have referred to her time  as a trade lawyer at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, where  she worked to enforce trade agreements with China to hold that country  accountable before the World Trade Organization. They have highlighted  her time as a lawyer with the House Ways and Means Committee, where she  built partnerships and crafted agreements that received broad  bipartisan approval. These included the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade  Agreement, which passed the Senate by an 89-10 vote and the House by a  385-41 vote. Ms. Tai played a key role in crafting the agreement, which  speaks to her skills and experience.   Perhaps more importantly, however, Ms. Tai will prioritize trade  policies that promote workers, families, the environment, and local  communities. I met with Ms. Tai just after President Biden nominated  her, and during our conversation, it was clear she understands that  trade policies have real world implications for everyday people. She  knows that if trade deals are not working for people, then they need to  change. People need to come first as we develop trade deals. At a time  when people are still working to recover from the coronavirus, Ms. Tai  is the Trade Representative we need for the United States.   A family emergency has prevented me from being here for today's vote,  but if I were present, I would have voted to confirm Katherine Tai as  U.S. Trade Representative.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support her nomination.                            ____________________
