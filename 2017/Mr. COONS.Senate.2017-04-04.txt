 Mr. President, today is a day when many Senators are  speaking about Judge Gorsuch and about the Supreme Court. As I think  many know, in the last week, in the Judiciary Committee hearings and in  other settings, I have announced that I will vote against Judge Gorsuch  on the final vote tomorrow. I believe I have made my reasons for my  opposition clear. I have thoroughly reviewed and considered Judge  Gorsuch's record and where he fits within American jurisprudence, and I  have no second thoughts about my decision.   As I look around at what has just happened on this Senate floor, I am  sick with regret. So I rise now to speak in defense of the Senate.   The Senate has been hailed by many, including our nominee to the  Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch, as the world's greatest deliberative  body. Yet today I think one more blow has been struck at that title and  reality.   The late Senator Robert Byrd, who served in this Chamber for 51  years, would famously remind new Senators that ``in war and in peace,  [the Senate] has been the sure refuge and protector of the rights of  the states and of a political minority.''   Of course, although Senator Byrd was the longest serving Senator, as  a Delawarean, I grew up in the tradition of Senator Joe Biden, a 36- year veteran of this body who left its ranks only to ascend to the Vice  Presidency and spend 8 more years as its Presiding Officer.   Since I have had the honor of assuming Senator Biden's former seat, I  have committed to following his example of working across the aisle,  through Republican and Democratic administrations, with whoever is  willing to roll up their sleeves and get to work for the American  people. I know my colleagues share in this foundational commitment to  serve our constituents and country.   As I look around at what just happened on this floor, with too little  discussion of its lasting consequences and too little visible concern  or even emotion, I must ask the question: Where are we headed?   You can't see it, but around this Chamber are white marble statues,  busts of former Presiding Officers, of former Vice Presidents of the  United States. They are in the halls outside this Chamber. They are at  the upper level of this Chamber, in the Galleries. All the former Vice  Presidents are memorialized in white marble busts.   Former Vice President Adlai Stevenson, the grandfather of the  Illinois Governor who ran for President in the middle of the 20th  century--former Vice President Adlai Stevenson, when he delivered his  farewell address to the Senate on his last day in office as the  Presiding Officer of the Senate in 1897, said:         It must not be forgotten that the rules governing this body       are founded deep in human experience; that they are the       result of centuries of tireless effort . . . to conserve, to       render stable and secure, the rights and liberties which have       been achieved by conflict.        By its rules, the Senate wisely fixes the limits to its own       power. Of those who clamor against the Senate and its mode of       procedure, it may be truly said, ``They know not what they       do.''        In this Chamber alone are preserved, without restraint, two       essentials of wise legislation and of good government--the       right of amendment and of debate.    It was exactly that right, those rules that were assaulted today, but  they have been under assault for a long time.   In recent days, I have reached out to my Republican and Democratic  colleagues, trying to see if there was some way we could reach a  reliable consensus agreement to safeguard these institutional values  and avoid the events of today and tomorrow.   I told my colleagues that I was not ready to end debate on Judge  Gorsuch's nomination until we could chart a course for the Senate to  move forward on a bipartisan basis when considering future Supreme  Court nominations.   I think for us to get to any constructive conversation about moving  this Senate forward requires owning the role that all of us--each of us  has played over our time here, whether a few years or decades, in  bringing us to this point.   I, for one, will say I have come over time to regret joining my  Democratic colleagues in changing the rules for lower court nominations  and confirmations in 2013. Of course, I could give an entire speech on  the obstruction that led us to that point. I could document the  Republican and Democratic deeds and misdeeds of the last Congress and  the Congress before that and the decade before that.   As my more seasoned and senior colleagues demonstrated in the  Judiciary Committee deliberations, those who have served here longest  know best the record of grievance of Congresses in decades past.   I anticipate that many of my colleagues will come to regret the  decisions and actions taken today in this Congress and in Congresses  ahead. Instead of focusing on that shared regret, I want to work  together not to continue to tear down the traditions and rules of the  Senate but to find ways to strengthen and fortify and sustain them.   I worked to try to find a solution to get past this moment on the  brink. I wanted to ensure our next Supreme Court nominee would be the  product of bipartisan consultation and consensus, as was safeguarded  for years by the potential of the 60-vote margin. I wanted certainty  that the voice of the minority would still be heard when the next  vacancies arise. Among many, this effort to forge consensus was met  with hopelessness or even hostility.   Back home, thousands of constituents called my office, urging a vote  against Gorsuch and urging I support the filibuster. Some even urged me  to stop talking about any sort of deal. In fact, back home in Delaware,  some national groups ran ads against me when there was even a rumor of  a hint that there might be conversations about avoiding this outcome.   There were even Senators on both sides of the aisle who told me that  an agreement was impossible. They said any agreement is based on trust,  and we simply do not trust each other anymore.   Given the events of the last years, the disrespect and mistreatment  of Merrick Garland, the course of the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch, I  can understand how there is a raw wound right now in this Chamber,  where each side feels the other has mistreated a good and honorable and  capable nominee for the Supreme Court.   Let me say my last point again. Senators on both sides told me we  could not find a durable compromise because we do not trust each other  anymore. If we cannot trust each other anymore, then are there any big  problems facing this country which we can address and solve?   This morning, I gave an address at the Brookings Institution about  the  [[Page S2394]]  threat Russia poses to our democracy, to our allies, to our national  security, and to the endurance of our Republic. If that threat is not  something that deserves determined, bipartisan effort, I don't know  what is.   There are many threats to our future I could lay out today, but let  me simply emphasize that in the absence of trust, this body cannot play  its intended constitutional role, and without trust, we will not  rebuild what is necessary to sustain this body.   Everyone likes to point the finger at the other side as the source of  this distrust. The reality is, there is abundant blame to go around.   Folks like to remember the good old days when Justice Scalia was  confirmed by this body 98 to 0, when Justice Ginsburg was confirmed 96  to 3, but if we look at our five most recent nominees to the Supreme  Court who got votes, you can see a clear trend: Nine Senators, all  Republican, voted against Justice Breyer. Then 22 Senators voted  against Justice Roberts. Then 42 Senators, mostly Democrats, voted  against Justice Alito. For President Obama's nominees, Justices  Sotomayor and Kagan, more than 30 Republican Senators opposed each one.  Only nine Republican Senators voted for Sotomayor, and only five  Republicans voted for Justice Kagan. We have been on this trajectory-- both parties--for some time.    Then, of course, we have Chief Judge Merrick Garland, the first  Supreme Court nominee in American history to be denied a hearing and a  vote, and we have Judge Gorsuch, the first to be the object of a  partisan filibuster on this floor.   We did not get here overnight. We have become increasingly polarized.  How can we work together to repair this lack of trust so we can face  the very real challenges that face our Nation?   My own attempts of recent days--although I was blessed to be joined  by Senators of good will and good faith and great skill in both  parties--were ultimately not successful. I wish I had engaged sooner  and more forcefully. I wish I had been clearer with my colleagues how  determined I was to seek a result, but this doesn't mean I am  disappointed that I tried, and it also doesn't mean I am going to stop.  I am not going to stop trying to fix the damage that has been done,  trying to find a better pathway forward.   I ask my colleagues: If you know what you have done today, then what  will we do tomorrow? How could we avoid the further deepening,  corrosive partisanship in this body? What past mistakes can each of us  own up to? What steps can we take to mend these old wounds? What more  can we do to move forward together?   We sometimes talk about the dysfunction of this body as if it is  external to us, as if we bear no accountability for it, but at the end  of the day, here we are: 100 men and women sent to represent 50 States  of this Republic and 325 million people. In many ways, we have all let  them down today.   I can tell you what I am going to do tomorrow. I commit to working  with anyone who wants to join me to try to strengthen and save the  rules and traditions of this body and its effectiveness as an  absolutely essential part of the constitutional order for which so many  have fought and died. It is what all of our predecessors would have  wanted.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.
