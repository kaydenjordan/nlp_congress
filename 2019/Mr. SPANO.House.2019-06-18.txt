 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the city of Temple  Terrace and Mayor Mel Jurado for officially declaring the city a  trafficking-free zone. As part of the effort, the city of Temple  Terrace has pledged to take important steps to crack down on buyers in  the sex trade, which will reduce the demand for sex workers and  decrease the number of victims trafficked, specifically.   Temple Terrace is implementing a zero-tolerance policy where city  employees will be automatically terminated if they are caught  soliciting prostitutes. The Temple Terrace Police Department has also  been encouraged to increase enforcement against buyers of sex work by  conducting more stings.   And, finally, city staffers are required to take mandatory training  on how to spot signs of trafficking and how to help potential victims.   This is a monumental step forward for our community, and I am honored  to join the city of Temple Terrace and Mayor Mel Jurado in the fight  against human trafficking.                            ____________________
