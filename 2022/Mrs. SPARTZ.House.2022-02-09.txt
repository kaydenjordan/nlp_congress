 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kaptur and  Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick for their bipartisan leadership.   I know that this Special Order is about the situation in Ukraine, but  the situation in Ukraine goes beyond Ukraine. It is a threat to the  stability of the world order, the largest threat since World War II,  and a threat to any democracy.   I would also like to remind us that millions of our predecessors died  for freedom, peace, and democracy. I would like to read some excerpts  from the recent joint statement of the Russian Federation and the  Peoples Republic of China dated February 4, 2022.   ``Today, the world is going through momentous changes, and humanity  is entering a new era of . . . profound transformation. It sees . . .  transformation of the global governance architecture and world order .  . . a trend has emerged towards redistribution of power in the world.  The sides note that Russia and China as world powers . . . have  longstanding traditions of democracy which rely on thousand-years of  experience. They stand ready to work together with all the interested  partners to promote genuine democracy.''   I know that President Putin is not going to listen to me, and I am  not sure to anyone else, but I hope he still has to listen to the  Russian people at least a little bit. I am not naive on his personal  ambitions although I would still offer him an olive branch if he really  cares about his people in his country. Therefore, I am going to direct  my message to over 3 million Russian Americans. I am talking to you as  a Congresswoman representing the great State of Indiana, who grew up  under Communists in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. I was born  in a country that doesn't exist anymore, and for good reason, as many  of you, too.   I know that many of you have relatives in Russia and dual  citizenship. I know that Putin has powerful anti-American propaganda on  his TV. I was somewhat surprised over its extant. It's worse than  during the Soviet Union times.                                time  1530    I want you to let the Russian people know that neither the United  States nor the West are a threat to Russia's national security.   I would argue that Russia has a much bigger threat coming from the  east. There is a very aggressive economic expansion of China in the Far  East and Siberia.   I would also like to make it very clear that the American people do  not want another war in Europe.   I also want to remind you of the human cost of any war. If Russia  starts a war in Ukraine, which looks more and more likely, a lot of  young people will have to die from both sides. No one will benefit from  it. Maybe the Chinese Communist Party, but not the Russian people.   I just do not believe that the Russian people would want to go in  history as a puppet to the imperialistic ambitions of China and would  want to promote a so-called genuine democracy of the Chinese Communist  Party.   The ball is in your court, President Putin and Russian people. I hope  you will be on the right side of history.   I also would like to share a message with my fellow Americans: Do not  get distracted, and do not get reluctant. A threat to our freedoms from  outside and within is real. Protect and cherish our freedoms so our  children do not have to fight to get them back.
