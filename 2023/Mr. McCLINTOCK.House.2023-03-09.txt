 Madam Speaker, I thank the Ways and Means Committee  [[Page H1212]]  for taking up my bill, H.R. 187, the Default Prevention Act, today.   Similar bills I introduced passed this House in 2013 and 2015, and I  am gratified the committee would take it up in this session. The bill  simply provides that even if there is a fiscal impasse in our  deliberations over the debt limit, the debt of the United States will  always be paid in full and on time.   Frankly, that is already the law. Our revenues vastly exceed our debt  service costs. As every family knows, if you are living off your credit  cards, you better make the minimum payment first. The law and the  Constitution require it.   The organic act that established the Treasury Department in 1789 is  clear on this point: `` . . . it shall be the duty of the Secretary of  the Treasury to digest and prepare plans for the improvement and  management of the revenue, and for the support of public credit. . .  .''   I repeat: The management of the revenue and the support of public  credit.   The Constitution is also crystal clear. The 14th Amendment commands  that the public debt is not to be questioned. The GAO spelled it out so  there would be no doubt when they answered the Senate Finance Committee  in 1985, ``The Treasury is free to liquidate obligations in any order  it finds will best serve the interests of the United States.''   Yet, over the years, various Presidents have threatened to default on  the debt as a way to roil markets and pressure lawmakers to bend to  their will. This President, sadly, is no different.   Even while the Obama Treasury Department was denying it had the  ability to prioritize payments to pay the debt first, we later  discovered it was making preparations to do exactly that. We also  discovered documents that revealed that Federal Reserve officials were  appalled that the administration would ever suggest defaulting because  such statements ran a severe risk of panicking credit markets. We are  hearing those same statements today from some Democrats in this  Congress and in this administration.   The Default Prevention Act simply takes this threat off the table.  Amendments being offered by the committee also require priority be  given to Social Security, Medicare, and defense to assure no President  can threaten to hold seniors or servicemembers or veterans hostage, as  well.   Nor is this unusual. Most State constitutions provide that first call  on any revenues is to maintain and protect their sovereign credit.  Indeed, several years ago, in testimony to the Senate, Federal Reserve  Chairman Ben Bernanke praised these State provisions for maintaining  confidence in State-issued bonds.   This is not to endorse a prolonged impasse over the debt limit.  Postponing prompt payment of other bills is not a good thing, but the  full faith and credit of our country is fundamental to paying all of  those other bills, and that is why we should prevent any President from  threatening to default on that credit.   The most preposterous claim we hear is that this prioritizes paying  China before other obligations. The fact is, most debt is held by  Americans, including most likely your pension fund. China holds about  3.2 percent of our bonds.   The debt limit is there for a reason. If your family is living beyond  its means and needs to seek an increase in its credit limit, it had  better sit down around the kitchen table and have a very serious  discussion over the circumstances that have gotten it into this  predicament and what steps it needs to take to get out. That is why we  have a debt limit, to have exactly that discussion as a nation.   That is why it is so disturbing when the President says he is not  even willing to discuss the subject. Well, considering the fact that he  has added $3.7 trillion to the national debt in just 25 months in  office, that is irresponsible.   Not discuss it? Why in the world does he think we have this building  with the dome on top at the very center of our Capital City?   It was built exclusively to have these discussions, to talk out our  differences, and to reach a wise and satisfactory conclusion for our  public policy questions.   Not discuss the biggest fiscal threat our Nation has ever faced?   He can't be serious.   However, serious or not, no President should have the ability to  threaten to default on our debt, to destroy the full faith and credit  of the government, or to take hostage our seniors, our veterans, and  our other servicemembers. This bill prevents him from ever threatening  to do so again, and it needs to be enacted.                            ____________________
