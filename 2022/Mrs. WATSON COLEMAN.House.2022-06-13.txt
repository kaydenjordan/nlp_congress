 Madam Speaker, I thank the leader of our Special  Order hour, the magnificent, exquisite, and always on point the  Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee for her work on H.R. 40 and reminding us  every day that within that word ``reparations'' is repair and our  opportunity to study how we can repair the pain and the injustice that  was accorded to our community.   I need to recognize my leader, Joyce Beatty, because under her  leadership she has amplified our voice is our power. And on whatever  level we decide that we must speak and we must act, Joyce Beatty has  reminded us that our voice is our power because the Congressional Black  Caucus believes in exercising that power on behalf of communities that  have been underrepresented for so very long, whether it is  environmental justice, social justice, criminal justice reform,  housing, or just whether or not the whole system needs to be examined  as it impacted us.   I thank the chair of our caucus, who took us through a journey that  reminded me, as I was sitting there, of the good work that we have been  able to do. I tell you that I feel like I am standing here in a very  sacred space, and I want to speak in the spirit that flows through us  that was left by Shirley Chisholm, Barbara Jordan, John Lewis, Elijah  Cummings, and Alcee Hastings, and so many more that have gone before us  and have opened the doors and pushed through the doors so that we might  be here this evening to address you.   So, yes, slavery--supposedly freedom from it--came to us in 1865, and  today we commemorate and we celebrate this end of slavery and all the  progress that we have made over the last 157 years.                                time  2015    We must also acknowledge, as Chairman Hakeem Jeffries reminded us,  the long road ahead toward what would be full equality for Black  Americans. Let Juneteenth be not just a celebration or a commemoration,  but a rallying cry as we recommit ourselves to the centuries-long  struggle for civil rights.   Through historic measures like the American Rescue Plan, the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and executive orders on policing and  advancing racial equity, the Biden administration, along with this  Congress, has taken important steps to address the unique needs of  Black communities across the country. The time is now to keep that  momentum going.   Our current moment presents an opportunity to dismantle systemic  injustices by bringing Black people from the margins to the mainstream  of American society. We as a society must stop treating Black people as  an afterthought. That means we must take direct action to end the  racial discrimination that, contrary to what our colleagues across the  aisle might like us to believe, still exists today.   It means ensuring that Black people, especially Black women, are in  the rooms where decisions are made. It means passing legislation like  the CROWN Act, which would put an end to the insidious discrimination  against Black people because of their hair.  [[Page H5475]]    In the fight for a more perfect Union, we can, we should, and we must  think bigger and bolder. Through policies like those that are outlined  in the Black Women Best economic framework--which include everything  from guaranteed basic income to sweeping criminal justice reform--we  can bring the Black community from peril to prosperity. When we do  that, we bring everybody else along with us. Only then will all  Americans have the freedom to thrive.   Today, we celebrate this turning point in our Nation's history.  Today, we look back on the milestones we have achieved since then.  Today, we continue fighting for that more inclusive, that more  equitable, that fairer society that really represents the best that  America can be.
