 Mr. President, today I am going to talk about the  growing crisis on our southern border and how we need urgent action to  address the degrading situation there, but before I begin, I want to  say a quick word about the reconciliation bill we passed last week.   The massive $1.9 trillion bill was not COVID-19 relief; it was  liberal relief. Everybody and everyone needs to understand what this  was. It was not a rescue plan. It was a heist of taxpayers' money. We  don't have $1.9 trillion to be spending. When we have to borrow this  much money, we are digging our country deeper into debt. And with this  massive spending bill, we are borrowing against our grandkids' future  and are going to owe more and more countries like China.   To keep up, the money supply will have to increase at such a rapid  rate, it could potentially spark inflation. That means we could see the  value of Americans' hard-earned dollars plummet.   To further underscore that point, that means your money doesn't go as  far. For the items you buy, it is very expensive. All of this bogs down  our economy and hinders future growth.   What is more, this entire sham of a process was partisan. It was not  about helping Americans, businesses, and communities recover from the  pandemic. That much is clear because only 9 percent of the bill is  going to COVID and health-related pressures and less than 1 percent is  going to vaccines. The remaining 90 percent went to progressive wish  list items for bailouts for poorly run States.   Instead of ramming through non-COVID-related spending, Democrats  should have worked together with Republicans as a team to pass a  bipartisan bill that actually makes lives better as we recover from  this pandemic.   We share a goal of helping the American people, but the bill that was  ultimately put forward failed to do just that. It is a shame. This is  not how our country should be run.                            ____________________
