 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two  Houston-area leaders, Pastor David Smith and his wife, Lady Linda  Smith.   Many strong community leaders go unnoticed. They serve silently every  day and draw very little attention to themselves, quietly doing their  work. Yet through their service, they enrich and improve the lives of  everyone around them.   Pastor Smith and Lady Smith are both quiet, everyday heroes who put  smiles on faces across the district and particularly in the Eastex/ Jensen Freeway community. Through their faith-based work, they spread  positivity and hope to countless Houstonians.   They are also very active in community activities and are the lead  organizers of the Houston area's annual Jensen Jubilee Fall Festival.  Pastor Smith is more like the mayor of the Eastex/Jensen Freeway area.   Pastor Smith and Lady Linda Smith embody the Houston spirit of  service, compassion, and volunteerism. I am proud they are my  constituents, and I thank them for their selfless community service.                            ____________________
