 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak up for keeping  Americans safe at work. On April 28, Workers Memorial Day, we remember  all those workers who lost their lives or became disabled on the job.   In 2021, one worker died every 101 minutes from an occupational  injury.   Congress must take steps so all Americans can go to work without  needlessly endangering themselves. Fifty-two years ago, we took a leap  forward when the Occupational Safety and Health Act went into effect.   The labor movement fought tirelessly to make it happen, but their  work continues today, and so must ours. We need OSHA to expand  protections to all industries and all workplace hazards.   One person who doesn't return home from work is one too many. I join  my friends in labor in fighting for every single worker to have a safe  job.                            ____________________
