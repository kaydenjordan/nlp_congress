 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of floriculturist  and philanthropist, Andy Matsui, who recently passed away at the age of  85.  [[Page H7276]]    After being born and raised in a family of farmers in Japan, Andy got  an educational visa to go to California and study agriculture. He liked  it so much that he bought some land and established a nursery in the  Salinas Valley, in my district.   Andy produced orchids and pioneered the sale of potted orchids in  stores. Today, the Matsui Nursery has one of the greatest selections of  orchids in the entire world.   But Andy didn't just grow flowers; he grew the future for many. Andy  said that education is the only way to change things in this world.  That is why he and his wife established the Matsui Foundation to  provide scholarships to countless students. Andy believed in our home  by encouraging those students to not just study, but to stay and give  back to the central coast of California.   Our prayers are with his family. May Andy Matsui rest in peace with  the satisfaction that he left us with magnificent beauty from his  orchids and magnanimous bounty for our community.                            ____________________
