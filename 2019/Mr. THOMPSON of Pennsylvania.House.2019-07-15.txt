 Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, I had  the privilege of returning to Blairsville, Pennsylvania, and the  National Center for Defense Manufacturing and Machining site in my  district.   Founded in 2003, NCDMM is committed to driving innovation throughout  the defense manufacturing industry. They are helping revitalize our  Nation's manufacturing industry by implementing solutions, cutting  commercial and defense customer costs, increasing productivity,  improving quality, decreasing lead times, and reducing waste. NCDMM  works to leverage the expertise of their team to deliver innovative  manufacturing solutions that produce real results.   My recent visit highlighted their efforts to create a 2-year  curriculum, partnering with local institutions to train veterans for  additive manufacturing placement following their service. This project  addresses two critical issues: opportunities for veterans and strategic  workforce shortages.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership and the work of the  dedicated staff at the NCDMM site. I wish them all the best as they  continue to bring innovation and efficiency to our Nation's  manufacturing industries.                            ____________________
