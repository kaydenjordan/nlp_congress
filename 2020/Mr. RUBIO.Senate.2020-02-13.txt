 Madam President, this amendment is a statement of three  facts: No. 1, that we are not engaged at this moment in hostilities  with Iran--we are not at war with Iran; No. 2, that the actions that  were taken against Soleimani were, frankly, lesser in scope, nature,  and duration than what the previous administration did and the way they  behaved in their exercise of war powers, also a statement of fact; and  No. 3, that the maximum pressure of strategy against Iran has reduced  Iran's resources that they can use to sponsor terrorism and proxy  groups, also a statement of fact. Whether you agree with maximum  pressure or not, it is a fact that this year, and last year, Iran has  billions of dollars less than they otherwise would have, had it not  been for the maximum pressure campaign.   Those three things are statements of fact, and I think if we are  going to have a resolution like this, it should accurately describe the  situation, and that is why I urge your support and a negative vote  against any effort to table.
