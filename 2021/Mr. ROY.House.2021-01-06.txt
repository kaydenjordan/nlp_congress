 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the objection.    Madam Speaker, today, the people's House was attacked, which  is an attack on the Republic itself. There is no excuse for it. A women  died. And people need to go to jail. And the President should never  have spun up certain Americans to believe something that simply cannot  be.   I applaud House leadership of both parties for bringing us back to do  our job, which is to count the electors and no more.   The problem we face, though, is even bigger. We are deeply divided.  We are divided about even life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  The words which used to bind us together now, at times, tear us apart  because we disagree about what they even mean.   My constituents at home in Texas are genuinely upset. I say to my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we have a constant barrage  of those who wish to remake America into a socialist welfare State,  efforts to attack our institutions, tear down statues, erase our  history, defund our police. We have seen the debasing of our language.  We teach our children that America is evil. We destroy our sovereignty,  empower cartels. We attack our Second Amendment. We destroy small  businesses through lockdowns. We divide ourselves by race. We can't  even agree that there is man and woman. We extinguish the unborn before  they even have a chance to see daylight.    But at the heart of our path forward lies the essence of our  Republic, its cornerstone. That we are a union of States bound together  for common defense and economic strength, and more  [[Page H89]]  so bound together through federalism in which we may live together  peacefully as citizens in this vast land agreeing to disagree, free to  live according to our own beliefs and according to the dictates of our  conscience.   Now, many of my colleagues were poised this afternoon to vote to  insert Congress into the constitutionally prescribed decisionmaking of  the States by rejecting the sole official electors sent to us by each  of the States of the Union. I hope they will reconsider.   I can tell you that I was not going to, and I will not be voting to  reject the electors. And that vote may well sign my political death  warrant, but so be it. I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of  the United States, and I will not bend its words into contortions for  personal political expediency.   Number one, rejecting the electors certified to Congress by sovereign  States violates the 12th Amendment and the entirety of the Constitution  it amends, notwithstanding claims that you must read certain sections  first. It is clear, it is black and white, we count. It is ministerial.  And our only job is to count the electors before us. We have only one  slate of electors per State sent to us under color of law, and no more.   Number two, to the extent you believe we do have constitutional  authority to reject, we are arguing using incomplete and often  misleading data points to prove it. I am not afforded time to go point  by point, but there are more misleading claims than legitimate ones.                                time  2145    Three, rejecting the electors ignores the Founder's specific  admonition that Congress not choose the President, as articulated in  Federalist No. 68.   Four, indeed, the Founders drafted the inclusion of a phrase  specifically putting Congress into the manner of the election process  then specifically rejected it.   Five, if more than a trivial bloc of this body votes to reject a  sovereign State's electors, it will irrevocably empower Congress to  take over the selection of Presidential electors, and doing so will  almost certainly guarantee future Houses will vote to reject the  electors of Texas or any of our States for whatever reason.   Six, voting to reject the electors is not remotely consistent with  our vote on Sunday, a vote I forced to highlight the very hypocrisy: to  accept the outcome of the election of ourselves through elections  conducted under the same rules, by procedures put in place by the same  executive branch officials, impacted by rulings from the same judges,  State and Federal. To do so is entirely inexplicable on its face.   Seven, the argument for rejection most given by my colleagues is  based on the allegations of systemic election abuse by executive or  judicial branch officials interfering with the ``legislatures thereof''  in Article II.   Many States made poor policy decisions. Whether these poor policy  decisions violate State laws is a contested matter and a matter for the  States to resolve for themselves.   More, five of the six legislatures are controlled by Republicans. Not  one body has sent separate electors. Not one body has sent us even a  letter by a majority of its whole body. The only body, the Pennsylvania  Senate, who managed to come up with a majority of Republicans to  complain only did so yesterday in an eleventh-hour face-saving  political statement. Not one GOP statewide official has formally called  on us to change. Not one law enforcement organization, State or  Federal, has presented a case of malfeasance.   History will judge this moment.   Let us not turn the last firewall for liberty we have remaining on  its head in a fit of populist rage for political expediency when there  is plenty of looking into the mirror for Republicans to do for  destroying our election systems with expansion of mail-in ballots.   I may well get attacked for this, but I will not abandon my oath to  the Constitution. And I will make clear that I am standing up in  defense of that Constitution to protect our federalist order and the  electoral college, which empowers the very States we represent to stand  athwart the long arm of this Federal Government by its very design.
