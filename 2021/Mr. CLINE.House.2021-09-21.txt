 Madam Speaker, almost exactly 8 months ago Joe Biden  kicked off his presidency by signing an executive order that weakened  our border security and promised a pathway to citizenship for millions  of illegal immigrants. These actions and his reversal of the previous  administration's policies have directly led to the worst illegal  immigration crisis the United States has faced in decades.   Since the President took office, at least 1.2 million illegal aliens  have crossed our border and the numbers are getting worse.   His response? Continuing to double down on the current failed policy.   Just last month, nearly 209,000 illegal aliens were encountered  crossing the border, which is a 317 percent increase from August 2020.  On top of this, August marks the sixth straight month of illegal  crossings, over 170,000 migrants.   The latest saga, more than 12,000 migrants living in makeshift  encampments under a bridge in Del Rio, Texas. This humanitarian,  economic, and  [[Page H4564]]  health crisis must be addressed, and unfortunately, President Biden and  his appointed border czar, Vice President Harris, have been missing in  action.   For the sake of all involved, more must be done.                            ____________________
