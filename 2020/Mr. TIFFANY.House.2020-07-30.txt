 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Stauber-Tiffany- Cox amendment, and I thank the gentleman for the time.   This amendment comes after many years of experiencing well-documented  U.S. Navy maintenance backlogs and deficiencies in much-needed naval  upgrades. These backlogs and deficiencies seriously inhibit our force- in-readiness and operational capabilities.   Our military needs to be the readiest it can be in order to meet the  challenges of the future, and this amendment will help them do that.   Shipyards across the country are ready, willing, and able to support  the maintenance and upgrade requirements needed by our naval assets,  including one in Superior in my congressional district. These non- homeport shipyards can support vital surge capacity, addressing  maintenance needs that cannot be addressed in a timely fashion at  homeports. This change will also support good, family-wage jobs across  the country.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.
