 Madam Speaker, with Memorial Day on my  mind, I rise today to call on House Republicans to stop playing  dangerous political games, manufacturing a crisis that has driven the  American economy to the brink of default.   To our veterans and for our veterans, a default would have severe  consequences. It would mean wounded warriors losing out on physical  therapy sessions that could get them back on their feet, for Purple  Heart recipients missing a disability check that they use to make ends  meet, for a student veteran coming up short on paying tuition.   Our servicemen and women have stood up for us, and now it is time for  us to stand up for them. Defaulting on our debt would be a dereliction  of our duty. The dangerous game playing must stop.                            ____________________
