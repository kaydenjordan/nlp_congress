 Madam Speaker, I rise today to mark 47 years since the  Roe v. Wade decision and to affirm my commitment to defending the  unborn.   The discovery last year of thousands of fetal remains in the garbage  of Ulrich Klopfer, Indiana's most prolific abortionist, was a tragic  reminder of the terrible cost of abortion.   After this shocking event, I introduced the Dignity for Aborted  Children Act, which would require the dignified burial or cremation of  aborted fetal remains, with a strong reporting requirement to hold  abortion providers accountable.   I also signed a discharge petition to bring the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act to the House floor for a vote. This  commonsense bill would ensure a child born alive after a failed  abortion attempt would receive the same kind of medical care any other  child would.   Madam Speaker, as we mark 47 years since Roe v. Wade, we have a lot  of work to do to stop a radical agenda and stand up for the sanctity of  life. Congress can start by passing these two pro-life bills without  delay.                            ____________________
