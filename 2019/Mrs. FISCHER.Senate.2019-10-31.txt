 Mr. President, I first met Kay Hagan at a People  magazine photoshoot for the Senate's ``Leading Ladies'' after I was  elected in 2012. I appreciated how warm and welcoming she was towards  me. I have fond memories of working with Kay on the Senate Armed  Services Committee, and we forged a partnership through our leadership  roles on the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee.   My deepest sympathies are with her family during this difficult time.                            ____________________
