 Mr. President, before Senator King leaves the floor, let  me just say, as one who ran the legal services for the elderly program  in Oregon, that the Senator makes all of us in legal services proud  tonight. Senator King has really put a face on what is at stake here in  the way he has focused on the opioid scourge that is hammering areas  from coast to coast. Rural health care--without rural health care, we  can't have rural life. It is just that simple. Certainly when we get to  the closing here in perhaps an hour and a half or so, we are going to  get to the bottom line, as the Senator did. I think these changes take  America back to the day where health care was for the healthy and  wealthy.   So I thank the Senator for his passion and his commitment to his  citizens, but also to the people of this country. Anybody in legal  services tonight will be very proud, as I am, because what it is all  about is standing up for people, and the Senator has said it very well.   Mr. President, we will be having our closing remarks here in perhaps  an hour and a half or thereabouts. We have several Members of the  Senate who are on their way for their remarks, and several Members of  the Senate have discussed various elements of the serious and  unanswered ethics questions surrounding Congressman Price's nomination.  It is my view that these are issues that have set off loud ethical  alarm bells.   I want to take a little bit more time to lay out the full story here.   The stock trades Congressman Price made while working on health care  policy do, in fact, raise serious ethical and legal questions. None of  Congressman Price's stock trades raise more questions than the hundreds  of thousands of shares he bought in the obscure Australian biotech  company known as Innate. His stock in this company is by far his  largest of holdings, both in terms of the hundreds of thousands of  shares he owns and the value of those shares, and that exceeds a  quarter of a million dollars.   Congressman Price told the Finance Committee that he did not get a  special deal. He told the Health, Education, Labor Committee that he  did not get a special deal. But the fact is, Congressman Price paid  bargain-basement prices for Innate stock in a private sale last August.  The private stock sale was limited to a small group of well-connected  American investors.   Congressman Price's participation has been described as a  ``sweetheart deal'' by Kaiser Health News and a ``privileged,  discounted offer'' by the Wall Street Journal.   As I said during his nomination hearing, Congressman Price's  participation in the private stock sale showed bad judgment at best. At  worst, it raised serious questions about whether he violated the STOCK  Act or other security laws. I will take a minute to read section 3 of  the STOCK Act. It says: ``Members of Congress . . . may not use  nonpublic information derived from such person's position . . . or  gained from the performance of such person's official responsibilities  as a means for making a private profit.''   It is well known that Congressman Price learned about Innate from a  House colleague, Congressman Chris Collins of New York. Collins is not  just a casual reader of the Australian business pages; he is actually a  member of the company's board and its largest shareholder.   This raises additional questions: Did Congressman Price have access  to nonpublic information about Innate or its private stock because of  his position as a Member of Congress? Did he get special access to the  discounted private sale because of his position? Does he stand to  profit because of the information or access he may have received?  [[Page S1056]]  Finally, did Congressman Price tell the Finance Committee the truth  about how he learned about the private stock sales and the ability of  typical investors to participate?   Congressman Price would have us believe that he decided to make these  investments based on his own research into the company. That is what he  told the Finance Committee.   Let me quote from the Wall Street Journal's article published January  30:         Mr. Price wasn't in line to buy shares in the last private       placement because he hadn't previously participated in       private fundraising rounds. . . . Mr. Price first invested in       the company a year ago, buying shares through the open market       on the Australian exchange. He learned about the company from       Mr. Collins, who holds a 17 percent stake in it. Mr. Collins       said Mr. Price is ``one of my friends'' and that he sits       ``next to him'' on the House floor. . . . Mr. Price got it on       the discounted sale after Mr. Collins filled him in on the       company's drug trial, according to Mr. Collins.    The fact is, you don't just get in on a private stock offering by  accident. As the Wall Street Journal explained, Congressman Price  didn't originally even meet the criteria for participating in the 2016  private offering because he hadn't participated in any previous  offerings. Yet he was able to buy over 400,000 shares of stock with  Congressman Collins' help.   My view and the view of my Democratic colleagues is that Congressman  Price failed to come clean with the Senate Finance Committee on the  details of the special discounted deal. He has assured the committee he  followed the law, but straightforward questions have been met with  dodging, weaving, and obfuscation. Details of his purchase continue to  emerge, and the public's understanding of his involvement continues to  evolve.   Meanwhile, as scrutiny of the deal continues to mount, Innate's top  executives are defending Congressman Price at the behest of his  colleague Congressman Collins, who sits on the company's board of  directors.   After the Wall Street Journal story was published, the company and  Congressman Price went into spin control. The public knows this only  because Congressman Collins made a mistake that everybody who uses  email for work has seen made at least once: He mistakenly hit ``reply  all'' when responding to an email from the company's CEO, Simon  Wilkinson. Instead of a private note to Mr. Wilkinson, the note wound  up going to a CNN reporter covering the story.   In the email, Congressman Collins, the company's top shareholder,  said the Wall Street Journal was ``yellow journalism,'' and he thanked  Innate's chief executive, Mr. Wilkinson, for defending Congressman  Price and the company. According to CNN, Congressman Collins  acknowledged the email to be authentic.   The Finance Committee's own experience with Innate only adds to the  sense that there is a coverup as Republicans seek to race Congressman  Price across the confirmation finish line.   The day after the Wall Street Journal story ran, I wrote my own  letter to Innate's CEO, Mr. Wilkinson. I asked the company to respond  to the article and the inconsistencies in Mr. Price's explanations and  for documentation of details of the private stock sales. The company  refused to answer my letter.   This looks to me like a coverup, and it ought to shake this body's  confidence in Congressman Price's nomination. This situation, in my  view, demands that further questions be asked and answered. Instead of  taking time to explore these issues, Republicans took the unprecedented  step of suspending the Finance Committee's rules to rush this  nomination to the floor before any more questions could be asked, let  alone answered.   In years past, as with the nominations of Senator Daschle, Secretary  Geithner, and Ambassador Kirk, the Finance Committee left no stone  unturned in the vetting process. Not this time. The majority party, in  my view, is on its way to an ethical double standard to cut off the  vetting process. That leaves me with a question for Congressman Price  and my Republican colleagues in the Senate: What is there to hide?   Mr. President, before I continue, I ask unanimous consent to have  printed in the Record the letter that I sent to Simon Wilkinson, chief  executive of Innate, on January 31, 2017.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                               United States Senate,                                            Committee on Finance,                                   Washington, DC, January 31, 2017.      Mr. Simon Wilkinson,      Chief Executive Officer,      Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited,      Sydney, Australia.        Dear Mr. Wilkinson: As part of the U.S. Senate's       constitutional duty to confirm presidential appointments, I       have been reviewing the record of U.S. Representative Thomas       Edmunds Price, who has been nominated to be the Secretary of       the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.        To that end, I am writing to you seeking prompt assistance       in providing information and documents related to Congressman       Price's investment in Innate. Please provide the requested       information and documents:        1. The New York Times reported that ``Mr. Wilkinson and       Michael Quinn, Innate's chairman, said they had never heard       of many of the company's more prominent investors, and said       they first learned that Mr. Price had invested in the company       from an article in The Wall Street Journal [published online       December 22, 2016], which first reported his investment.''        In written response to questions from the Committee,       Congressman Price said ``I communicated with Representative       Collins, who is a director of Innate. As noted above, I       learned about Innate through a general conversation with him       in the fall of 2014. I also communicated with Simon Wilkinson       of Innate regarding my interest in participating in the 2016       private placement of company stock.'' In addition, the Wall       Street Journal reported that ``Mr. Collins said he told Mr.       Price of the additional private placement. He said Mr. Price       asked if he could participate in it. `Could you have someone       send me the documents?' Mr. Collins recalled Mr. Price asking       him.''        a. Please identify any meeting or communication between       you, the company, its officers, employees, directors,       consultants or affiliated personnel, and Congressman Price.       In so doing, please include the person or persons involved in       such communication or meeting, the date, method, location of       the communication, and the subject of the communication.        b. Please provide any e-mail or other written       communications between you, the company, its officers,       employees, directors, consultants or other affiliated       personnel, and Congressman Price. In addition, please provide       any documents transmitted by Innate to Congressman Price, and       any document Congressman Price transmitted to the company.        2. Regarding the August 2016 private stock placements       reference in the company's Notice of Annual General Meeting       and Explanatory (``Notice'') on July 25, 2016:        a. Please describe how Innate found and solicited potential       buyers for the private stock sale in August 2016. In so       doing, please provide all dates that solicitations or other       communications regarding the stock sale was sent to       investors. Please also note any differences between how U.S.       and non-U.S. investors were solicited. Please provide the       number of U.S. investors at the time of the solicitation, the       number of U.S. investors who were solicited, the number who       agreed to participate, and the number who were considered       accredited, ``friends and family,'' or met some other       classification or category. Please provide any and all       solicitation materials, offering documents, or other       information related to the sale that were sent to       participants in the placement.        b. Please describe the criteria by which the company       determined who could participate in the sale both within the       U.S. and outside the U.S. Please provide supporting       documentation regarding the company's criteria for       participants in the sale, if the not contained in the       offering documents described in Question 2(a).        c. It has been reported that these private offerings were       made available--in the U.S.--only to shareholders who had       previously participated in private stock placements. Is it       correct that shareholders had to have previously participated       in Innate's private stock placements?        i. Please provide any documents that describe eligibility       for the August 2016 private placements, if not already       provided in response to Questions 2(a) or 2(b).        ii. Did Congressman Price participate in any private stock       placements prior to the August 2016 private placement?        d. Based on interviews with you and Congressman Collins,       the Wall Street Journal reported that Congressman Price       qualified for the August 2016 private placements in the U.S.       as one of six ``friends and family'' solicited for the sale.        i. Was Congressman Price one the ``friends and family''       participants described by the Wall Street Journal?        ii. What were the requirements for ``friends and family''       participation?        iii. Please provide any and all offering documents that       were provided to this class of participants for the August       2016 sale. Please provide any and all documents that show the       company's eligibility criteria for determining this class of       participant in the August 2016 sale. Please provide any and       all documents that describe eligibility for this class of       participant in the August 2016 private placements.        e. Did the names of individual participants or criteria for       participation in the August  [[Page S1057]]       2016 sale come before Innate's officers or its board of       directors for consideration, including Congressman Price? If       so, please describe what actions or consideration officers or       directors took. Please provide any supporting documentation       of the selection decisions.        f. Did the company use an investment banker or other agent       for the August 2016 private placements? If so, please provide       the name of the bank or agent and its employees who were       involved in the sale.        g. What role did Congressman Collins--a director and       Innate's largest stockholder--play in the U.S. 2016 private       placements?        Please provide the requested information and documents via       email on a rolling basis as they become available. Please       contact my staff at +1 (202) 224-4515. Thank you to your       prompt attention to this matter and your timely response.            Sincerely,                                                         Ron Wyden,                                                    Ranking Member.     I would also refer my colleagues to the following news  articles: ``Trump's HHS Nominee Got A Sweetheart Deal from A Foreign  Biotech Firm,'' a story published by Kaiser Health News on January 13,  2017; ``Representative Tom Price Got Privileged, Discounted Offer on  Biomedical Stock, Company Says,'' a story published by the Wall Street  Journal on January 30, 2017; and ``In accidental `reply all' to  reporter, Collins thanks CEO for defending HHS nominee,'' a story  published by CNN on January 31, 2017.   Mr. President, I wish to now discuss what is known about the facts  and timing of Congressman Price's investment in Innate. This is a  timeline that is based on public documents, press reports, and  information the nominee provided the Finance Committee.   If you have never heard of Innate until the last few weeks, you would  be forgiven. The New York Times described it as a ``tiny pharmaceutical  company from Australia that has no approved drugs and no backing from  flashy venture capital firms.'' Innate has fewer than a dozen full-time  employees. The company's stock was first listed on the Australian Stock  Exchange in 2013, and until recently its market capitalization was well  below $100 million. Innate has never generated revenue from drug sales.  It has repeatedly teetered on the brink of running out of cash. It has  just 2,500 shareholders. By way of comparison, a major American  pharmaceutical company could have hundreds of thousands of  shareholders.   Innate is planning to submit an investigational drug application to  the Food and Drug Administration, and its ultimate goal is to one day  sell itself to a large pharmaceutical manufacturer, which would take  its early-stage experimental therapy to market.   What I am describing is, this company is the poster child for obscure  companies. It is so small and so obscure, it doesn't even have a  Wikipedia page. So the question is, How did Congressman Price come to  learn about this company, and how did he decide to make it the single  largest investment in his sprawling portfolio of health care stocks?  The answer is, the Congressman learned about Innate in 2014 during a  conversation with his colleague, Congressman Collins of New York. As I  indicated, Congressman Collins sits on Innate's board of directors.  Congressman Collins is also the company's largest shareholder, holding  38 million shares. Congressman Collins' adult children, his chief of  staff, and many of his political backers are also heavily invested in  the company. I am going to touch on those issues in a few minutes.   According to disclosures with the House Ethics Committee, Congressman  Price bought some 61,000 shares of Innate stock in 3 separate purchases  during January of 2015. At the time, the stock was trading at roughly  10 cents a share. Congressman Price testified to the Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee that he directed his broker to make the  January 2015 purchases.   Fast-forward to August 2016. Congressman Price bought another 400,000  shares of Innate as part of a private stock sale for U.S. investors.  When the private sale took place, Innate's shares were trading on the  Australian Stock Exchange for the equivalent of 31 American cents.  Participants in the private sale got the shares at a deep discount.   In written testimony to the Finance Committee, Congressman Price said  he paid 84,000 American dollars to buy the 400,000 shares. He bought  250,000 of those shares for 18 American cents per share in one private  stock placement. He bought another 150,000 shares for 26 American cents  each in a second private stock placement. Congressman Price's House  Ethics Committee disclosures showed that he acquired the stock on  August 31. On that day, Innate's stock was trading for the U.S.  equivalent of 31 cents a share on the Australian Stock Exchange. In my  book, that is a special deal.   The bottom line is that Congressman Price bought these shares for  $40,000 less than an average investor would have paid to buy the same  amount of stock off the open market. That is nearly 33 percent off the  price on the Australian Stock Exchange at the time. Since that time,  Innate's stock has more than doubled. These facts are not in dispute.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  Congressman Price's written testimony in response to my questions for  the record as part of his nomination hearings.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                          Questions for the Record   ``the honorable thomas e. price nomination hearing for hhs secretary''                       hearing date: january 24, 2017           questions for the record from ranking member ron wyden                    Innate Immunotherapeutics purchases         5. The nominee owns 461,238 shares of Innate       Immunotherapeutics Ltd. (``Innate''), a small Australian       biopharmaceutical firm developing a multiple sclerosis       therapy. The nominee acquired the stock in four separate       purchases on January 8, 9 and 23 of 2015 (``2015 tranche''),       and in a pair of private stock placements on August 31, 2016       (``2016 tranche''). Regarding Innate:        a. Question: Please describe how and when the nominee first       learned about Innate.        Answer: I previously answered this question for the SFC. I       learned about Innate during the course of a conversation in       the fall of 2014 with Representative Chris Collins regarding       their respective personal backgrounds. I cannot recall the       specific date of that conversation. During that exchange,       Representative Collins told me that he sat on a number of       public company boards including Innate, which was developing       a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS),        b. Question: Did the nominee or his staff ever meet or       otherwise communicate with current or former employees,       directors, consultants or other officials affiliated with       Innate. If so, please describe the communication, including       who it involved, the date, subject, place and form (e.g. in       person, by phone of communication.        Answer: I previously answered this question for the SFC.        I communicated with Representative Collins, who is a       director of Innate. As noted above, I learned about Innate       through a general conversation with him in the fall of 2014.       I also communicated with Simon Wilkinson of Innate regarding       my interest in participating in the 2016 private placement of       company stock. According to Innate's website, Mr. Wilkinson       is currently the Managing Director and CEO of Innate.        My Congressional staff has not met or otherwise       communicated with current or former employees, directors,       consultants or other officials affiliated with Innate.        c. Question: Please describe any communication between the       nominee and Congressman Collins regarding Innate       Immunotherapy, including the date, subject, place and form.        Answer: I previously answered this question for the SFC.        I had a conversation with Representative Collins in the       fall of 2014 that brought Innate, as a company, to my       attention. The nature of that conversation did not, however,       influence my decision to invest in the company in either 2015       or 2016.        I believe I had subsequent general communications with       Representative Collins regarding Innate. I do not have a       specific recollection of when those conversations occurred or       their substance. Any such communications did not impact my       investment decisions, however, because my purchases of Innate       stock were based solely on my own research.        d. Question: The nominee bought 400,316 shares in the 2016       tranche in a private stock sale that included two placements       at two prices. Please provide the number of shares bought in       each placement, and the price at which the shares were       bought.        Answer: I previously answered this question for the SFC. I       purchased 250,000 shares of Innate in Private Placement 1 at       US$0.18/share--the same price offered all participants in       this private placement. I purchased 150,613 shares of Innate       in Private Placement  [[Page S1058]]       2 at US$0.26/share--the same price offered all participants       in this private placement.     I also refer my colleagues to the following news articles  and documents: ``Australian Drug Maker has Low Profile but Powerful  Backers in Washington,'' printed in the New York Times on January 13 of  this year; ``Aussie shareholding puts heat on President's Ally,''  published in the Australian on February 6 of this year; the 2016 Annual  Report to Shareholders of Innate; a periodic transaction report that  Congressman Price filed with the House Ethics Committee on September  12, 2016; a list of the 20 largest investors in Innate dated January  17, 2017; and a stock price history of Innate.   I wish to turn to the issue of misleading testimony. What remains  unresolved are major inconsistencies between Congressman Price's  testimony to the Finance Committee, statements by Congressman Collins,  and statements by Innate's CEO Simon Wilkinson published last week in  the Wall Street Journal.   Simply put, Innate's chief executive and Congressman Collins, the  company's top shareholder, provided one version of events to one of the  world's most respected newspapers. Congressman Price provided a  different version of events to the Finance Committee and the Health  committee. These inconsistencies are among the reasons that Democrats  boycotted last week's Finance Committee markup. The Senate has an  obligation to know the truth about these transactions in order to  protect the integrity of this body and its constitutional duty to  consider executive branch nominees.   Now, with respect to exclusivity of the sale, Congressman Price told  the Finance Committee that the August sale was available to all Innate  shareholders, which contradicts what Innate's management told the Wall  Street Journal. Congressman Price was definitive in his response to my  question during the hearing.   Reading back the transcript, I said: ``Well, you purchased stock in  an Australian company through private offerings at discounts not  available to the public.''   Here is Congressman Price's response: ``Well, if I may, those--they  were available to every single individual that was an investor at the  time.''   That is not what Innate executives told the Wall Street Journal. Here  is an extended passage from the Wall Street Journal:         Rep. Tom Price got a privileged offer to buy a biomedical       stock at a discount, the company's officials said, contrary       to his congressional testimony this month. . . .        The cabinet nominee is one of fewer than 20 U.S. investors       who were invited last year to buy discounted shares of the       company--an opportunity that, for Mr. Price, arose from an       invitation from a company director and fellow Congressman. .       . .        At Mr. Collins' invitation, Mr. Price in June ordered       shares discounted in the private placement at 18 cents       apiece, and then more in July at 26 cents a share, Mr.       Collins said in an interview. Those orders went through in       August, after board approval. Mr. Price invested between       $50,000 and $100,000 according to his disclosure form. . . .        Mr. Wilkinson said investors who had bought in a previous       private placement were called to ``make friends and family       aware of the opportunity. . . . We are always looking to       increase our shareholder base. But those new parties have to       meet the definition of sophisticated financial investor.''       Only six U.S. investors, including Mr. Price, fell into the       friends-and-family category, Mr. Collins said. About 10 more       U.S. investors were offered discounted shares by the company       because they previously had been invited to partake in       private placement offerings.    In other words, Congressman Price not only got a deal that wasn't  publicly available, he was in a special group of six investors in a  special category called ``friends-and-family,'' whereas other American  investors got in on the private deal because they previously  participated in the company's private placements. Congressman Price  bypassed that requirement. He got in as what could only be called a  special guest--a ``friends-and-family'' guest of his House colleague,  Congressman Collins.   As I mentioned earlier, when I asked the company how Congressman  Price was able to get this special status, the company refused to  provide an explanation. The Wall Street Journal also reported a key  distinction between U.S. investors and the company's shareholders in  Australia and New Zealand. The paper reported:         The discounted stock offered in Innate Immuno, as the       company is known, was made to all shareholders in Australia       and New Zealand--but not in the United States, according to       Mr. Collins and confirmed in a separate interview with Innate       Immuno CEO Simon Wilkinson.    The Wall Street Journal's account is supported by company documents,  specifically a ``Rights Issue Booklet'' that Innate published on June  10, 2016. The booklet noted that the shareholders would buy one new  share for every nine shares they already own. The booklet noted that  the shareholders would have ``the option to pay for their new shares in  either Australian dollars or New Zealand dollars.'' The booklet goes on  to describe the private stock sale in which Congressman Price  participated. I will read briefly from the book:         In conjunction with this rights issue, Innate announced       that it also completed a private placement at an issue price       of U.S. 18 cents, raising U.S. $1.8 million.    The booklet states clearly that the private placement was announced  on the June 10, 2016, the same day Innate announced the rights issue  for investors in Australia and in New Zealand.   Our staff has reviewed all of the company's publicly available  documents and found no similar advertisements for the private placement  to American investors. So this paper trail pokes more holes in  Congressman Price's argument that the private stock sale was open to  all the company investors.   First off, the company didn't announce the existence of the private  sale until after it already had been completed. So unless an investor  was on the company's short list of go-to people, they were just  excluded.   Second, the company's documents clearly show that Congressman Price  and other participants in the private stock sale were able to buy far  more discounted shares than the company's typical investors. Innate  documents showed that the company restricted the number of shares the  typical investor could buy in the rights issue to just one new share  for every nine they already owned. No such limit appears to have been  imposed on Congressman Price and the other American participants in the  private stock sale. In fact, Congressman Price owned just over 60,000  shares at the time of the sale. His participation in the private stock  sales allowed Congressman Price to buy 400,000 more shares. If  Congressman Price had been held to the same rules as everyday  investors, he would have been restricted to buying less than 7,000  shares.   The bottom line to me is what Congressman Price said was untrue. The  deal Congressman Price got was not open to every other shareholder. And  again, when I sent a letter last week to the Innate CEO, asking him to  explain all of this, he declined. He told my staff that as an  Australian firm, the company had no obligation to cooperate.   So to recap, Congressman Price told the Finance Committee and the  Health Committee that the stock sales he participated in were open to  all shareholders. That is not true. The private sale does not appear to  have been widely marketed to American investors and was certainly not  advertised in the company's public documents. The private sale  reportedly included less than 20 American investors. Congressman Price  was part of an even smaller subgroup known as friends and family,  invited by other investors--in this case, by his House colleague,  Congressman Collins. How many people were eligible to be in the friends  and family group? Just six.   That brings me to the next issue, which is, How did Congressman Price  learn about the special sale in the first place? Congressman Price told  the Finance Committee his conversations with Congressman Collins had no  influence on his investment decisions.   I am going to again quote from his written response to questions for  the record asking Congressman Price to describe the communications with  Congressman Collins regarding Innate. Congressman Price said:         I had a conversation with Representative Collins in the       fall of 2014 that brought Innate as a company to my       attention. The nature of the conversation did not, however,       influence my decision to invest in the company in either 2015       or 2016. I believe I had subsequent general communications       with Representative Collins regarding Innate. I do not have a       specific recollection of when those conversations occurred or       their substance. Any such communications did not impact my       investment decisions, however, because my  [[Page S1059]]       purchases of Innate were based solely on my own research.    I am going to quote again from the Wall Street Journal:         Mr. Price got in on the discounted sale after Mr. Collins       filled him in on the company's drug trial, according to Mr.       Collins. Mr. Collins said he told Mr. Price of the additional       private placement. He said Mr. Price asked if he could       participate in it. ``Could you have someone send me the       documents,'' Mr. Collins recalled Mr. Price asking him.       Congressman Price wants us to believe that Congressman       Collins had no influence on the decision to buy Innate stock.       But Congressman Price would not have known about the company       in the first place if he hadn't talked to Congressman       Collins, and he wouldn't have known about the private       placements without hearing about them from Congressman       Collins.    Congressman Price characterizes his conversation with Congressman  Collins in 2015 and 2016 as being general in nature. But again,  according to the Wall Street Journal, Congressman Collins, one, told  Congressman Price about the upcoming drug trial; two, alerted him to  the private stock sale; and three, arranged to ensure that he could  participate. To me, this seems like more than ``subsequent general  communications with Congressman Collins regarding Innate'' as  Congressman Price put it in his written response to the committee.   With respect to reporting to the committee and the Office of  Government Ethics, I would just say that I think I described issues-- ethical issues--that are serious enough on their own. However, it took  no small amount of effort to unravel Congressman Price's holdings in  the company because he failed to fully disclose them to Federal ethics  officials, the American people, and the Finance Committee. I don't  believe this issue would have ever come to light if it were not for the  work of the committee's minority investigations team.   On February 7, 2 days ago, Congressman Price sent a letter to the  independent Federal ethics officials at the Office of Government Ethics  that amended his original public ethics disclosure. This letter  confirmed the suspicions of Finance Committee Democrats that  Congressman Price's original ethics disclosure to the public  understated the value of his Innate stock holding by roughly a quarter  of a million dollars. Put another way, his stake in Innate was more  than five times the figure initially reported to the American people.   Congressman Price's original disclosure reported that he owned less  than $50,000 in Innate stock. At the time the disclosure was filed, by  my calculation, his shares had a value of more than $250,000. Today his  stake is valued at more than $300,000. Quite simply, it appears the  shares he bought in the private stock sale in 2016 were excluded  entirely from the Congressman's financial disclosure to the Office of  Government Ethics. And because it is the Office of Government Ethics  disclosure that is posted on a public Web site so the public can see  the investment ties and investments the President's nominees hold, the  American people, too, were kept in the dark about how much stock  Congressman Price held in this company.   In addition, the Congressman was also less than forthcoming in his  disclosure of the value of Innate holdings to the Finance Committee. In  his response to the committee questionnaire, Congressman Price valued  Innate stock he bought in the private sale between $50,000 to $100,000.  However, that amount was based on the $84,000 discounted price the  Congressman paid to buy his stocks in the August private stock sale. It  was not based on the actual value of the stock on the Australian stock  exchange--the true value of his holdings.   By December, when he made his disclosure to the Finance Committee,  the stock price had nearly tripled and the shares he bought in those  private sales were worth nearly $230,000. In other words, he told the  committee that his private purchases were less than half the value they  really were.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following items be  printed in the Record: a memo from Finance Committee Staff to the  Finance Committee, dated January 23 of this year, and a letter from  Congressman Price to the Office of Government Ethics dated February 7,  2017, amending his public ethics disclosure.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  Memorandum for Finance Committee Members       From: Senate Finance Committee Staff      Date: January 23, 2017      Re: Nomination of Dr. Thomas E. Price         This memo describes the Senate Finance Committee staff       review of the 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax returns, and other       documentation of Dr. Thomas E. Price in connection with his       nomination to be the Secretary of the Department of Health       and Human Services (HHS).                                  Background         Finance Committee staff conducted a review of Dr. Price's       Senate Finance Committee (Committee) Questionnaire, tax       returns for 2013, 2014, and 2015, and financial disclosure       statements. As part of this review, a due diligence meeting       was held with the nominee and his legal representation on       January 16, 2017. His accountant participated via telephone.       In addition to the due diligence meeting, staff submitted       multiple rounds of written questions to the nominee.        At the conclusion of this process, three issues have been       identified that have been deemed appropriate to bring to the       attention of Committee Members.    Senate Finance Committee Questionnaire--Ethics Investigation and Late                       Property Tax Payments Omitted         All nominees referred to the Committee are required to       submit the Senate Finance Committee Statement of Information       Requested of Nominee (``Questionnaire'').        Part D. Legal and Other Matters, Question 1, asks nominees:       ``Have you ever been the subject of a complaint or been       investigated, disciplined, or otherwise cited for a breach of       ethics for unprofessional conduct before any court,       administrative agency, professional association, disciplinary       committee, or other professional group?''        In his response, submitted December 21, 2017, Dr. Price       responded, ``No.'' However, in 2010, the Office of       Congressional Ethics (OCE), an independent office of the       House of Representatives, conducted an investigation into Dr.       Price's 2009 fundraising activities. OCE voted 4-0-1 to refer       the case to the House Ethics Committee, which, after       conducting a second investigation, ultimately found no       wrongdoing in 2011.        In written questions submitted to Dr. Price on January 6,       2017, Committee staff requested an explanation for the       omission of the ethics investigation. Dr. Price stated it was       an inadvertent omission and that the majority of activities       investigated related to his authorized campaign committee,       rather than him personally. The information pertaining to       this investigation has been and continues to be available on       the webpage of the House Ethics Committee.        Part F. Financial Data, Question 10, asks nominees: ``Have       you paid all Federal, State, local, and other taxes when due       for each of the past 10 years?'' Dr. Price responded,       ``Yes.'' However, upon examining Washington, D.C. and       Nashville, Tennessee real estate tax records, Committee staff       determined late tax payments had been made in relation to       rental properties owned by Dr. Price, totaling $1,583.45 for       late payments made over the past seven years.        In written questions submitted to Dr. Price on January 6,       2017, Committee staff requested an explanation for the       omission of the late tax payments. Dr. Price stated that,       regarding the DC property, he believed that ``late fees and       penalties derived from not receiving timely property tax       notices.'' Regarding the Tennessee property, the nominee       noted that ``notices regarding property taxes for this rental       property . . . were either not being received or being       wrongly mailed to the tenant at the property and not reaching       the nominee and his spouse.''      Depreciation of Land Value and Miscellaneous Employment Deductions         Committee staff received 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax returns       from Dr. Price on December 21, 2016. In addition to the       written questions submitted on December 28, 2016 and January       6, 2017, Committee staff spoke with Dr. Price's accountant on       January 9, 2017. Following the due diligence meeting with Dr.       Price, Committee staff then submitted an additional round of       written questions to the nominee on January 16, 2017.      Improper Inclusion of Land Value in Depreciation Calculations        Taxpayers who own rental property are generally allowed to       deduct depreciation expenses associated with the wear and       tear of those buildings. Taxpayers are not, however, allowed       to include the value of land in the depreciable amount.        Dr. Price owns rental condominiums in Washington, D.C. and       Nashville, Tennessee, and claimed depreciation expenses       associated with those properties for years 2013, 2014, and       2015. It appears these values included depreciation for the       value of the land. According to property tax records, the       land value of Washington, D.C. condominium was listed as       $95,640, and the land value of his Nashville condominium was       listed as $30,000.        Under current tax rules, these values are not allowable for       depreciation expenses. Committee staff asked for       clarification on this issue in the due diligence meeting with       Dr. Price and sent written follow-up questions on January 16,       2017.        In his response to the Committee, received on January 23,       2017, Dr. Price's accountant  [[Page S1060]]       stated he had taken the position that the land had a fair       market value of zero. However, given the lack of another       valuation besides the property tax assessments, Dr. Price has       committed to address the discrepancy by filing a Form 3115 to       adjust the depreciation and account for the improper       deductions on his 2016 tax returns, though adjustments may be       spread out over four years.      Absence of Documentation of Employment Deductions        In 2013, 2014, and 2015, Dr. Price claimed miscellaneous       employment deductions, totaling $19,034. Dr. Price, and his       wife, also a medical doctor, both list their occupations as       ``PHYSICIAN'' on the second page of their Form 1040s. Neither       Dr. Price nor his wife actively works as a physician, though       Dr. Price has noted he has maintained his medical license.       Committee staff requested substantiation and further       explanation of the deductions in written questions submitted       December 28, 2016.        Committee staff spoke with Dr. Price's accountant on this       matter on January 9, 2017, and again during the due diligence       meeting on January 16, 2017. In those discussions, Dr.       Price's accountant noted that Dr. Price and his wife,       Elizabeth, would compile a variety of expenses, including       vehicle expenses, and discuss with the accountant what       portion of those expenses would be appropriate to deduct as       employment expenses, frequently settling on an amount equal       to roughly 60 percent. Though the Prices no longer actively       work as physicians, their accountant believed that the       deductions were appropriate, and were reflective of expenses       incurred by Mrs. Price. After the January 16, 2017, due       diligence meeting, staff suggested that in the absence of       full documentation of the deductions, that the returns be       amended.        In a response, received January 23, 2017, Dr. Price's       accountant noted that proper documentation could not be       located. Dr. Price's 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax returns will be       amended to remove the $19,034 of deductions. Since Dr. Price       was subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in each of       those years, the changes will not result in any change to tax       liability.                                 Asset Values         In separate financial disclosure filings to the House of       Representatives, to the Committee, and to the public through       the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) Form 278, the nominee       reported ownership of stock in an Australian pharmaceutical       company--Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd. The nominee purchased       these shares in two tranches: one in 2015 valued at $10,000       at the time of purchase, but was valued at between $15,000       and $50,000 on December 20, 2016, the date of filing. A       second tranche was purchased in August 2016 of 400,613       shares, through a private placement offering, and was listed       on the Committee questionnaire as being valued between       $50,000 to $100,000, which was based upon the purchase price.       An analysis done by multiplying the number of shares by the       market price on December 20, 2016 demonstrates a value higher       than that reported by the nominee. The nominee noted that the       amounts reported to the Committee were a good faith       valuation. The nominee agreed to recalculate the value of the       shares based on the market value at the time the Committee       Questionnaire was completed. The revised value of the second       tranche was between $100,000 and $250,000 when filed.        The nominee and Committee staff also agreed that the       tranche of shares acquired in August 2016 was not accounted       for on the OGE Form 278, and the nominee told staff that       income attributable to his holding in the company reported on       OGE Form 278 was incorrect. The nominee noted that it is       unclear how information related to his holding in this stock       was misstated on the published form. The nominee agreed to       contact OGE to correct the form.                                   ____                                                       February 7, 2017.      Ms. Elizabeth J. Fischmann,      Associate General Counsel for Ethics, Designated Agency           Ethics Official,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ms. Fischmann: The purposes of this letter are to       amend the financial disclosure report that I signed on       December 15, 2016, and to supplement the ethics agreement       that I signed on January 11, 2017.                        a--financial disclosure report         To correct inadvertent errors in my December 15, 2016,       financial disclosure report, the items identified below are       amended, as follows:                                                                           Part I --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          #            Organization Name        City/State         Organization Type       Position Held               From                    To -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2                   Chattahoochee         Atlanta, Georgia....

By this letter, I am confirming that I used       current value with regard to those assets. This letter makes       no changes to the value categories disclosed in that       financial disclosure report other than those indicated above.             b--Supplement to January 11, 2017, Ethics Agreement         The new item listed above (Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd./      $100,001-$250,000) is covered by the commitment I made in my       January 11, 2017, ethics agreement to divest all interests in       Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd. within 90 days of       confirmation. In addition, the following commitments       supplement my ethics agreement dated January 11, 2017.        In February 2017, I resigned from my position as Managing       and General Partner of Chattahoochee Associates and       transferred my ownership interest to my spouse. I will not       participate personally and substantially in any particular       matter that to my knowledge has a direct and predictable       effect on the financial interests of Chattahoochee       Associates, unless I first obtain a written waiver, pursuant       to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208(b)(1).        If I have a managed account or otherwise use the services       of an investment professional during my appointment, I will       ensure that the account manager or investment professional       obtains my prior approval on a case-by-case basis for the       purchase of any assets other than cash, cash equivalents,       investment funds that qualify for the exemption at 5 C.F.R.       Sec. 2640.201(a), obligations of the United States, or       municipal bonds.        I understand that as an appointee I will be required to       sign the Ethics Pledge (Exec. Order no. 13770) and that I       will be bound by the requirements and restrictions therein in       addition to the commitments I made in the ethics agreement I       signed on January 11, 2017.        I have been advised that this supplement to my ethics       agreement will be posted publicly, consistent with 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 552, on the website of the U.S. Office of Government       Ethics with ethics agreements of other Presidential nominees       who file public financial disclosure reports. I understand       that this letter will also be released as an attachment to my       public financial disclosure report.            Sincerely,                                              Thomas E. Price, M.D.     I also refer my colleagues to the following documents: an  announcement by Innate on June 10, 2016, entitled ``Private Placements  and  [[Page S1061]]  Rights Issue to Raise Additional Working Capital,'' and the Public  Financial Disclosure Report signed by Congressman Price on December 15,  2016, that was filed with the Office of Government Ethics.   I want to take a minute to return to the Innate company itself. I  noted earlier that the company has put on a full court press to defend  Congressman Price in recent weeks, as details of his special deal have  come to light.   I am going to describe why that might be. Innate's executives have  sought to portray the company as being a small firm from Down Under  that has been inadvertently caught in political crossfire on the other  side of the world. But the fact is that Innate has longstanding  connections to Congressman Collins and his inner circle, a circle that  includes Congressman Price. As the Australian City Newspaper wrote this  week, ``Mr. Collins, his children and his `intimate political allies'  and donors controlled at least 27.25 percent'' of Innate's voting  shares.   Then there is the baffling assertion mailed by Mr. Wilkinson, the  CEO, that he only recently learned of Congressman Price's existence  through news articles. This is a stretch to believe and flies in the  face of Congressman Price's own testimony.   On January 13, the New York Times reported:         Mr. Wilkinson and Michael Quinn, Innate's chairman, said       they had never heard of many of the company's more prominent       investors, and said they first learned that Mr. Price had       invested in the company from an article in the Wall Street       Journal, which first reported his investment.    On February 5, Mr. Wilkinson, the CEO of Innate, told the Buffalo  News, ``I think the first time I heard that a gentleman named Tom Price  had invested was after the U.S. media started reporting it.''   But Congressman Price was quite clear that he had communicated with  Wilkinson. In written testimony, responding to questions for the  record, he said: I also communicated with Simon Wilkinson of Innate  regarding my interest in participating in the 2016 private placement of  company stock. According to Innate's Web site, Mr. Wilkinson is  currently the managing director and CEO of the company.   Congressman Price's name was also listed twice in the documents of  the company, which reported the private stock sale participants to the  Australian stock exchange last summer. Congressman Price also appeared  to have bought nearly 5 percent of the discounted shares made available  in the private stock sale. Given all that, it seems difficult to  believe Mr. Wilkinson's story that he had no idea who Congressman Price  was.   Finally, The Australian, the Sydney paper I just mentioned, reported  on Monday that Innate and Congressman Collins are facing questions  about possible violations of Australia corporation law with regard to  his holdings in the company. So why does this matter? It matters  because a nominee to be a Cabinet Secretary, Congressman Price, was  brought into this web of questionable stock transactions and  obfuscations about just how special the special deal he really got was  by a company insider, his friend, Congressman Collins.   As I get ready to close, I refer my colleagues to the following  articles and documents: ``Congressman Collins under fire for  `suspicious' stock trades,'' published in the Buffalo News on January  17 of this year; ``Collins shared biotech stock news with big Buffalo  names,'' again from the Buffalo News on January 19; ``Collins'  controversial stock venture could be boom or bust,'' from the Buffalo  News on February 5 of this year; the Notice of Innate's 2016 Annual  Meeting and Explanatory Statement filed on July 29 of 2016; documents  filed by Innate on September 12, 2016, and September 26, 2016,  reporting results of the 2016 private stock placement.   As we close, I want to return to section 3 of the STOCK Act. It says:         Members of Congress . . . may not use nonpublic information       derived from such person's position . . . or gained from the       performance of such person's official responsibilities as a       means for making a private profit.    So did Congressman Price have access to nonpublic information about  Innate or its private stock sale because of his position as a Member of  Congress? I believe the answer is yes.   Did he get special access to the discounted private sale because of  his position? I believe the answer is yes.   Does he stand to profit because of the information or access he may  have received? I believe the answer is yes.   Finally, did Congressman Price tell the Finance Committee and the  HELP Committee the truth about how he learned about the private stock  sale and the ability of average investors to participate? Congressman  Price told the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee that the  special stock deal he got in on was open to everyone.   According to the Wall Street Journal and company documents, that is  not true. The deal he got was clearly different than what was offered  to everyday investors. According to the Journal, his previous purchase  of Innate stock did not qualify him to participate in the private  placement without being a specially invited friends and family guest.  This arrangement allowed Congressman Price to buy more shares than  other investors were allowed to buy.   Congressman Price told the Finance Committee that his conversations  with Congressman Collins, again, a director of the company, its largest  shareholder, had no influence on his investment decisions. According to  the Journal, this is not true. The Journal report made clear that  Congressman Collins told him about the upcoming drug trial, alerted him  to the private stock sale, and arranged to ensure he could participate.   Now the majority party has shut down the vetting process, allowing  Congressman Price's nomination to reach the floor before all the facts  have come into view. I believe the Senate can do better. It needs to do  better. The American people are owed better.   I thank my colleagues, particularly Senator Reed, for his patience  and his courtesy.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The Senator from Rhode Island.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the debate on Congressman Price's  nomination, in my view, is a referendum on the future of health care in  America.   On this side of the aisle, we think it is worth spending 30 hours  talking about a subject this important to our people. My view is that  this is about whether the United States is going to go back to the dark  days when health care worked only for the healthy and the wealthy.   Based on the public record, Medicare is a program Congressman Price  does not believe in, and it offers a guarantee of services he doesn't  believe seniors should have.   On the Affordable Care Act, he is the architect of repeal and run. He  wrote the bill himself. He proposed weakening protections for Americans  with preexisting conditions. He would shred the health care safety  net--Medicaid--for the least fortunate among us. He would take away  health care choices for women, particularly the opportunity to go to  the physician that they trust.   As we wrap up and get ready to vote, think about the common thread  among these proposals: They take away coverage from our people, make  health care coverage more expensive for millions of people, or both.  That is what Congressman Price stands for when it comes to health care.  Every Senator who casts a vote for Congressman Price has to stand by  that agenda.   Beyond what this means for the future of American health care policy,  there is the lingering spectre, as I have discussed tonight in detail,  of serious legal and ethical issues. Congressman Price got special  access to a special deal on stock in an Australian biomedical company.  He claimed multiple times before Senate committees that the deal he got  on discounted company stock was open to all shareholders. All the  evidence--all the evidence--says that this is untrue.   First, he had to go through the back door to get access to the  discounted price. He got a special friends-and-family invite from his  colleague in the House, Congressman Chris Collins, the company's top  shareholder and a member of its board.   Second, rules that apply to other investors didn't apply to  Congressman Price. Other shareholders were bound by a limit. They were  able to buy one discounted share for every nine they already owned.  That would have allowed Congressman Price to buy just 7,000 discounted  shares. He bought 400,000 discounted shares. In my view, he can't get  around that. That is the definition of a special stock deal.   The Congressman introduced legislation that would have lowered the  tax bills of three major pharmaceutical companies in which he owns  stock. He invested $15,000 in a medical equipment company and then  introduced legislation to increase the amount Medicare pays for that  type of equipment. Parts of his bill went on to become law. He bought  thousands of dollars' worth of stock in a company called Zimmer Biomet  less than a week before introducing legislation that had the potential  to drive up the value of those shares. Now he has argued that he didn't  purchase the stocks; his broker did. But at the very least, he would  have known about those deals within days of the purchase when he filed  the periodic transaction reports in the House. Under his brokerage  agreement, he could have quickly resold the stock, but he did not.  Furthermore, he didn't consult with the Ethics Committee regarding any  of the trades I have spoken about as directed by the House Ethics  Manual.   As I wrap up, I want to put a human face on why so many Senators on  this side of the aisle have come to the Senate floor to speak so  passionately about their grave concerns with this nomination. Nothing  sums up our concerns more clearly than a line from an op-ed Congressman  Price wrote in 2009 that discusses Medicare. His quote speaks volumes  about his perspective on this program.   It is a lifeline. I first became acquainted with it back in the days  when I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers, ran the legal aid  program for older people. I saw then that seniors were walking on an  economic tightrope, balancing their food bill against their fuel bill,  their fuel bill against the rent bill. They saw Medicare as one of the  great achievements in American policymaking.   Here is what the Congressman wrote--his words, not mine: ``Nothing  has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than  the federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.''  When I read that, I was reflecting on my Gray Panther days, and I think  a lot of other Senators go back working with community organizations.  We just heard a wonderful presentation from Senator King, who was also  a legal services advocate.   Before Medicare, before this program that Congressman Price thinks is  such a negative intrusion into medicine, a lot of older people were  warehoused in poor farms. I am absolutely certain that Congressman  Price doesn't want to go back to those days, but when he speaks about  the involvement of Medicare in American health care as though a plague  has descended on the land, we just have to question his commitment to a  program that has become a lifeline to millions of older people.   The fact is, Medicare has always been a promise. That is what we said  back in the early days with the senior citizens. Medicare was a  promise. It was a promise of guaranteed benefits. Again, based on the  public record, Medicare is a program Congressman Price doesn't believe  in, and it offers a guarantee of services he doesn't think seniors  ought to have.    He has said he wants to voucherize the program within the first 6 to  8 months of the administration. What we are talking about when you want  to do that is you are breaking the promise of Medicare. You are  breaking the promise of guaranteed benefits, and you are going to sort  of hand people a piece of paper and say here is your voucher, I  [[Page S1066]]  hope it works for you. If your medical expenses are greater than your  vouchers, that is the way it goes, tough luck.   The price budget cut Medicare by nearly $1 million. By the way, that  is exactly the opposite of the Trump pledge, not to cut Medicare that  the American people heard on the campaign trail. There is a big gap  between what President Trump said about Medicare and the bills and  legislative efforts of Congressman Price in the other body--big gap.  That is why it sure looks to me like the promise of Medicare is one  that Congressman Price would break.   By the way, we all ought to understand that if confirmed, Congressman  Price would be the captain of the Trump health care team. What he says  matters, and what he offered--legislatively, his positions and his  votes. He voted again and again to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   It really matters what his past record is. If past is prologue, it is  certainly relevant. It really matters. He was the architect of what  amounted to repeal and run. He wrote legislation creating loopholes in  the protection for those with preexisting conditions, and the big  beneficiary there was clearly the major insurance companies.   Women would find it much harder to make the health care choices they  want and see the doctors they trust if the price proposals were lost.  Medicaid pays 65 percent of the nursing home bill in America. And on  this side of the aisle, we are going to fight Congressman Price's block  grant proposals that are going to put seniors at risk.   I am going to close with this. I always hope I am wrong when I raise  the prospects of real threats to the welfare of the American people  because the reason public service was important to me was because of  those first days with the Gray Panthers. I never thought I would have  that kind of wonderful opportunity; that I would have had this  opportunity for public service. For me and so many on this side of the  aisle--I see my colleagues who have been active in their communities-- this has always been about the welfare of the American people. That is  what it is about--all those faces we see when we are home, having  community meetings and getting out with our people.   The public record in this case indicates that as Secretary of Health  and Human Services, Congressman Price would, in fact, be an  extraordinary threat to seniors on Medicare, vulnerable older people  who need Medicaid for access to nursing homes, millions of kids for  whom Medicaid is the key to a healthy future, and women across the  country who have a right to see the doctors they trust.   I am going to oppose this nomination. I urge my colleagues to join me  in opposition.   Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to address Congressman  Price's stock purchases. At best, this is behavior that cuts ethical  corners. At worst it is dangerously close to outright insider trading.  Congressman Price has a lot of questionable trading activity. He  introduced legislation that would lower the tax bills of three major  pharmaceutical companies he owned significant amounts of stock in. He  invested $15,000 dollars in a medical equipment company then introduced  legislation to increase the amount Medicare pays for that type of  equipment. Parts of his bill went on to become law.   But let's look at one investment in particular, Congressman Price's  investment in Zimmer Biomet. Zimmer is a medical device company that  specializes in joint replacements, including knee, hip, shoulder, and  foot and ankle replacements.   Hip and knee replacements are high cost procedures, and they are two  of the most common procedures performed on Medicare patients. According  to CMS, more than 400,000 hip and knee replacement procedures were  performed in 2014, costing more than $7 billion for the  hospitalizations alone. Despite the high frequency of these surgeries,  costs vary widely across geographic areas, and complications like  infections or implant failures after surgery can be three times higher  at some facilities.   In November 2015, in an attempt to incentivize higher quality  procedures for Medicare recipients and control the cost of these  replacements, CMS finalized a new pricing model slated to be  implemented in April 2016. This new pricing model was a cost-bundling  payment model; instead of Medicare paying for each individual service,  Medicare reimburses hospitals with a single lump-sum payment, allowing  hospitals to coordinate overall care for the patient.   These changes were designed to incentivize improved care for  patients, lowering costs and improving quality. However, according to  independent analysts, medical device companies, especially those who  specialize in orthopedic implants, could face ``material headwinds''  from the new pricing model since hospitals facing reimbursement  pressures are likely to pass some of that burden onto those device  companies.   In September 2015, Congressman Price led an effort to send a letter  from members of the House of Representatives to CMS challenging many of  the features of the CMS proposal. A copy of the letter, dated September  21, 2015, is available on the Congressman's website.   This is where Zimmer Biomet comes in. Zimmer is a medical device  manufactrurer with significant exposure to the new pricing model.  According to analysts, over 60 percent of Zimmer's revenues come from  hip and knee devices, and the CMS guidelines had the potential to  significantly affect the company's profits.   On March 17, 2016, a few weeks before the CMS model was set to go  into effect, Congressman Price bought thousands of dollars worth of  Zimmer Biomet stock through his brokerage account. On March 23, 2016,  less than a week later, Congressman Price introduced H.R. 4848, the  ``HIP Act,'' which would have delayed the implementation of CMS  regulations for Medicare coverage of joint replacements.   Let's pause right here. In 2016, Congressman Price had a financial  stake in one of the companies that stood to benefit most from the  legislation he was promoting. Those basic facts are not in dispute.  Congressman Price introduced legislation that had the potential to add  to his personal fortune.   Now, various arguments have been made, by Congressman Price and  others, to defend this activity. First is the argument that there  wasn't much money at stake, just a few thousand dollars. But the truth  is a few thousand dollars is a lot of money to a lot of Americans. An  unexpected medical bill that size could have a serious effect on many  Americans and the person in charge of our health care system should  take that amount of money just as seriously.   Second, there is the argument that he didn't purchase the stock; his  stockbroker purchased it. I am going to return to that issue in more  detail in a moment, but one thing is clear. That is the fact that  Congressman Price knew this stock had been purchased in his name, in  his account, within a matter of days.   On April 15, 2016, Congressman Price filed what is called a Periodic  Transaction Report which Members of Congress are required to do within  30 days of reportable stock purchase. Not only did Congressman Price  file a report that he had purchased Zimmer Biomet along with dozens of  other stocks, he initialed the entry for Zimmer Biomet in order to  correct a mistake on the document; a correction making it clear that  the Zimmer Biomet transaction was a stock purchase.   There is also the question of whether this activity violated House  Ethics rules. Congressman Price also said, in answer to written  questions, that ``no conflict existed and no consultation was  necessary.'' He also said, ``Throughout my time as a Member of the  [House], I have abided by and adhered to all ethics and conflict of  interest rules applicable to me.''   He gave the same answer regarding three other bills that appear to  conflict with investments he held: H.R. 4185, the Protecting Access  through Competitive-pricing Transition Act of 2015, the PACT Act; H.R.  5400, a bill pertaining to tax rates in Puerto Rico, which would have  likely impacted drug manufacturers he owned Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers  Squibb, and Amgen; H.R. 5210, the Patient Access to Durable Medical  Equipment (PADME) Act of 2016.   Let's go through that in some detail.   It is true that the House Ethics rules, like the Senate Ethics rules,  allow a  [[Page S1067]]  member to cast a vote on a matter relating to a company in which he or  she owns stock. However, that standard only applies to casting votes.  If you do more, and become an active advocate of a bill that could  benefit a company that you own stock in, a different standard applies.   On page 237 of the House Ethics Manual, it says that before  undertaking active advocacy of legislation that will benefit a company  in which a member owns stock, such as before introducing a bill, ``the  Member should first contact the [Ethics] Committee for guidance.''   The Ethics Manual is crystal clear. If you go beyond voting, and you  are actively pushing a bill that would benefit a company in which you  own stock, you should consult with the Ethics Committee.   Congressman Price did not consult with the Ethics Committee regarding  any of these trades.   In a written question, I asked Congressman Price about this. I asked  whether, in light of the House Ethics Manual's recommendation, he had  consulted with the Ethics Committee regarding his purchase of Zimmer  Biomet and other stocks. He did not answer the question. Instead, he  resorted to the same talking point--that the Zimmer Biomet stock was  purchased by his broker and that there was not need to consult because  there was no conflict.   By my reading, this interpretation is flat wrong. Under the House  Manual, he should have consulted with the Ethics Committee.   To be clear, the Ethics Committee might have concluded that it was a  relatively small purchase, and that Congressman Price's advocacy was  consistent with his longstanding position, and therefore that it was  fine for him to go ahead and purchase the stock and then introduce the  bill. On the other hand, the Ethics Committee might have reached a very  different conclusion. It might have advised him to refrain from  purchasing the stock.   The public will never know, because he didn't ask. Despite the clear  guidance in the House Ethics Manual, he didn't even ask. And now the  majority party is carrying his nomination toward the finish line.   Apart from conforming with House Ethics rules, there is also the  question of whether Congressman Price's activity violated insider  trading laws. Lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have a duty of  public trust. The STOCK Act, which Congressman Price and I both voted  for in 2012, and longstanding SEC rules denote that Members of Congress  have a fiduciary duty to the American people. What that means is that  we will use the public power we've been granted to benefit the  interests of all Americans. The SEC's Rule 10b5, in particular,  prohibits the purchase or sale of stock on the basis of material  nonpublic information.   As a threshold matter, Congressman Price claims that insider trading  laws don't apply to him because the Zimmer Biomet stock was purchased  by his broker without his knowledge. But as I've discussed at length,  this argument is a red herring because Congressman Price did have  knowledge of these trades. He submitted signed records of the trades  shortly after they were made. Furthermore, the laws related to insider  trading give clear guidance on how to trade through a broker without  violating insider trading laws. And just as with the House Ethics  rules, when faced with clear guidance on how to manage conflicts of  interest, Congressman Price chose not to follow it.   Whether those stocks were purchased directly or through a broker is  not, by itself, a defense to insider trading. According to SEC rules,  Congressman Price and his broker needed to agree to a ``written plan  for trading securities'' that does not ``permit the person to exercise  subsequent influence over when, how, or whether to effect purchases or  sales of securities.'' So, if Congressman Price had, in writing, given  his broker complete control over his portfolio we wouldn't be  discussing this issue today. But he did not do so.   Congressman Price returned to the ``my broker did it'' defense for  weeks before finally providing the Finance Committee with an excerpt of  his brokerage agreement.   Here's what it says:         In the Portfolio Management (``PM'') program, a Financial       Advisor(s) who meets the program certification requirements       manages your assets on a discretionary basis. In other words,       your Financial Advisor, and not you, has the discretion to       decide what securities to buy and sell in your account. This       discretion is subject to the parameters described below and       your ability to direct a sale of any security for tax or       other reasons.    In the course of our investigation, committee staff spoke with  experts, and they confirmed what seems obvious from the plain language  of the text. This agreement does not hand over complete control of  Congressman Price's portfolio to his broker. His agreement with his  broker simply does not shield him from insider trading laws, no matter  how many times he tries to say it does.   This isn't a question of whether Congressman Price followed the  technical letter of the law, he didn't follow it in spirit either.  Congressman Price could direct his broker to make trades when he wanted  to, and he did. Case in point, when Congressman Price wanted to act on  a stock tip from Congressman Collins, he called up his broker and had  her buy shares of an Australian biomedical firm called Innate  Immunotherapeutics.   Another question raised by Congressman Price's conflicts of interest  is whether they go beyond a violation of the public's trust and  constitute an outright violation of insider trading laws. That question  cannot be answered today. We have seen that time and time again that  Congressman Price purchased stocks then turned around and promoted  legislation that would help those companies, and his investments in  them. What is not clear is whether the introduction of this legislation  meets the legal standards of being ``material'' and ``nonpublic.''  Neither case history, nor the legislative history of the STOCK Act  provide clear guidance on when pending legislation is material and  nonpublic.   The bottom line is that Congressman Price's activities are in  uncharted waters. That is why the public and members of this body ought  to be outraged that the majority party has cut off the vetting process  and rushed this nomination toward completion.   In my view, because of how this nomination was handled, the Senate  Finance Committee has set a double standard. If you look to the recent  past at the nominations of Senator Tom Daschle, Secretary Tim Geithner  and Ambassador Ron Kirk at the outset of the Obama administration, the  vetting process was extremely thorough and bipartisan. The committee  turned over every stone, peered around every corner and followed every  lead to its conclusion. Now, when a glaring issue comes up that  undeniably deserves investigation, the party in power has shut down the  vetting process. The Finance Committee and the Senate ought to do  better.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
