 Madam Speaker, I thank Kat for holding this very  Special Order tonight.   I rise today to honor our police officers and to condemn those who  shamefully unleash defund the police rhetoric into our communities.  Next to me are the images of nearly 90 police officers who were killed  in the line of duty just last year.                                time  2130    There are so many lives lost that I had to make three separate  posters. These courageous men and women lost their lives by being shot,  assaulted, stabbed, or hit by cars.   Sadly, America has seen a 115 percent increase in ambush attacks on  our police officers. There is no doubt in my mind that liberal hatred  and vitriol against law enforcement played a role in the uptick of the  attacks on our officers. It is clear: Rhetoric has consequences.   The faces on these pages are fathers and mothers, loved ones. One of  them was a fellow Missourian. Last year, Police Officer Blaize Madrid- Evans of Independence, Missouri, lost his life while responding to a  call when a criminal opened fire and killed him. Blaize was only 22  years old, and he was engaged to be married. He had his whole life  ahead of him. This is tragic. This is unacceptable. Things must change.   Our law enforcement officers deserve our respect, support, and  thanks. Nothing else.
