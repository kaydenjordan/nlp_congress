 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 20 minutes as in morning business; further, that at the  conclusion of my remarks, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Markey,  be recognized; that we have permission to engage in a colloquy; and  that at the conclusion of Senator Markey's remarks, Senator Shaheen of  New Hampshire be recognized.    Mr. President, a persistent argument of my climate  talks is how corrupt climate denial is. The premise of that argument is  that the fossil fuel industry denial apparatus is wrong about climate  change and knows it is wrong. That is my case. The fossil fuel industry  denial apparatus knows it is wrong about climate change.   Well, it is a beautiful world, and every once in a while, along comes  something that proves my case. Last week, on the afternoon of Black  Friday, the Trump administration released its National Climate  Assessment by 13 Federal agencies describing the monumental damage the  United States is facing from climate change. In more than 1,000 pages,  the report contradicted nearly every fake assertion Trump and his  fossil fuel flunky Cabinet have made about climate change.   Trump's pro-polluter policies are predicated on the lies and nonsense  of this fossil fuel industry denial apparatus, and this report is  devastating to those policies and to those lies.   So how did the fossil fuel apparatus respond? What did they do to  rebut the National Climate Assessment? They did nothing. They did  nothing. There was all that big talk from Scott Pruitt about how they  were going to ``red team'' climate science. Well here comes the climate  science. Where is your red team? Nothing. Instead of engaging with this  devastating report by the U.S. Government's leading scientists, they  tried to bury it, timing its release for a day of the year when it  would be least likely to get public attention.   Consider for a moment the environment in which they backed down from  this challenge--no red team, no nothing. They just whimpered and ran  away and tried to bury the report on Black Friday. At a time when their  industry populates the Trump administration, at a time when the  President is in their pocket, at a time when both Houses of Congress  are under fossil fuel industry control, their phony climate denial  front groups wield more influence than ever. This should have been  their moment.   The tell here is that even in this environment, the fossil fuel  industry and its bevy of stooges in the Trump administration got this  report and did nothing. Why? Why nothing? There is only one answer.  Because they know they are wrong. They know the real science is right.  They know their science denial campaign is phony, so they backed down.  They folded like a cardboard suitcase in a rainstorm.   That, my friends, is an admission. It is an admission by inaction. It  is an admission that even the fossil fuel industry knows the climate  science is irrefutable.   Interestingly, ``irrefutable'' is just what President Trump and his  family said about climate science in this full-page advertisement they  signed in the New York Times in 2009, saying that science of climate  was ``irrefutable'' and that there will be ``catastrophic and  irreversible'' consequences of climate change.   The new National Climate Assessment plus the recent Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change report are both very clear. The irrefutable  science that these two reports disclose couldn't be more clear: Damage  from climate change is already occurring; there is no credible natural  explanation for it; human activity is the dominant cause; future damage  from further warming will be worse than we previously thought;  economies will suffer; and we are almost out of time to prevent the  worst consequences of climate change.   The Bank of England report on this--they are the biggest financial  regulator in the UK, and they said: The financial risks are far- reaching in their breadth and magnitude, have uncertain and extended  time horizons, are foreseeable, but these risk factors will be  minimized if there is an orderly transition to a carbon economy, but  the window for an orderly transition is finite and closing. We are  almost out of time.   These two reports are tough stuff. As the Trump administration  summary states, the ``Earth's climate is now changing faster than at  any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result  of human activities. The impacts of global climate change are already  being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the  future,'' which makes sense, since in the history of human  civilization, the Earth has never seen atmospheric CO2  concentrations like we have today.   Many scientists have said warming of around 3 degrees centigrade is  now likely. What does that mean? Heating the planet well beyond 2  degrees centigrade would create a ``totally different world,'' says  Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University. He  says:         It would be indescribable, it would turn the world upside       down in terms of its climate. There would be nothing like it       in the history of civilization.    Here is what the Trump climate assessment chronicles: From our Ocean  State, we are concerned about sea levels, ocean acidification, and  warming. We note sea levels are rising, as oceans warm and upland ice  melts. If fossil fuels are not constrained, the reports says, ``many  coastal communities will be transformed by the latter part of this  century.'' For my coastal State, that is a pretty ominous warning.  Along coasts, fisheries, tourism, human health, even public safety are  being ``transformed, degraded or lost due in part to climate change  impacts,  [[Page S7171]]  particularly sea level rise and higher numbers of extreme weather  events.''   You get the sea level coming up, and that extreme weather event-- which is stronger to begin with now--has a lot more ocean to throw at  our shores.   Out West, ``more frequent and larger wildfires, combined with  increasing development at the wildland-urban interface portend  increasing risks to property and human life,'' the report says. By the  way, from 2000 to 2016, wildfires have burned at least 3.7 million  acres of the United States in every single year except for 3. From 2000  to 2016, more than 3.7 million acres burned in all years but 3.  California still smolders as I speak.   More than 100 million people in the United States live with poor air  quality, and climate change will ``worsen existing air pollution  levels.'' Increased wildfire smoke heightens respiratory and  cardiovascular problems. With higher temperatures from global warming,  asthma and hay fever rise.   Groundwater supplies have declined over the last century, and the  decrease is accelerating. ``Significant changes in water quantity and  quality are evident across the country,'' the report finds.   Midwest farmers take a big hit: warmer, wetter, and more humid  conditions from climate change; greater incidence of crop disease and  more pests; worsened conditions for stored grain. During the growing  season, the Midwest will see temperatures climb more than any other  region of the United States, the report says. Crop yields will suffer-- a warning that is echoed by grain giants like Cargill.   To sum it all up, the report says climate change will ``disrupt many  areas of life,'' hurting the U.S. economy, affecting trade,  exacerbating overseas conflicts for our military. Costs will be high:  ``With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses  in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of  dollars by the end of the century--more than the current gross domestic  product of many U.S. States.''   Danger warnings already flash in some economic sectors. Freddie Mac  has warned of a coastal property value crash, saying: ``The economic  losses and social disruption may happen gradually, but they are likely  to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and  Great Recession.'' From a coastal State, that is an ominous warning.   The insurance industry agrees. Trade publication Risk and Insurance  has warned: ``Continually rising seas will damage coastal residential  and commercial property values to the point that property owners will  flee those markets in droves, thus precipitating a mortgage value  collapse that could equal or exceed the mortgage crisis that rocked the  global economy in 2008.'' By the way, the leading edge of this may  already be upon us as coastal property values are beginning to lag  inland property values, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.   Separate from the coastal property values threat is another warning  about a carbon bubble in fossil fuel markets. Fossil fuel reserves, now  claimed as assets, that are not developable in a 2-degrees-Centigrade  world become what they call stranded assets. A recent economic  publication estimated that collapse of the ``carbon bubble'' would wipe  out ``around 82 percent of global coal reserves, 49 percent of global  gas reserves, and 33 percent of global oil reserves.'' A separate  economic review warns that $12 trillion of fossil fuel industry  financial value ``could vanish off their balance sheets globally in the  form of stranded assets.'' Twelve trillion dollars is over 15 percent  of global GDP, which is why the Bank of England--which I quoted earlier  as a financial regulator--is warning of this carbon asset bubble as a  systemic economic risk. That may be the blandest set of words in the  English language that convey the worst threat. If you were to graph  ``blandness of language'' and ``seriousness of threat,'' you would  probably come up with systemic economic risk. It basically means  economic meltdown. Well, that is what we are looking at.   This level of collapse could cascade beyond the fossil fuel  companies. It is not just a question of their shareholders getting  wiped out. It is such a crash that it cascades out into the global  economy--a crash like that, unfortunately, hits the United States  particularly hard because lower cost producers can hold on and unload  fossil fuel reserves into the collapsing market at fire sale prices.  When they do, the economists warn, ``regions with higher marginal  costs''--like the United States--``lose almost their entire oil and gas  industry.''   The solution is to decarbonize, to invest in more renewables, to  broaden our energy portfolio away from this asset collapse risk. One  paper concludes that ``the United States is worse off if it continues  to promote fossil fuel production and consumption.'' Another paper  concludes--this is the good news:         If climate policies are implemented early on and in a       stable and credible framework, market participants are able       to smoothly anticipate the effects. In this case there would       not be any large shock in asset prices and there would be no       systemic risk.    So how do we get to eliminating this hazard of no systemic risk? How  do we get to no systemic risk? We do what works for us anyway: move to  renewables. As this graph shows, we have to make a big move to avoid  this hazard. A carbon price--which is the remedy the fossil fuel  industry pretends to support, while sending its political forces out to  oppose exactly the laws it pretends to support--would allow this big  move to happen, all while generating revenues that could be cycled back  to States and citizens and help the hardest hit areas of transition.   The smart move we need to take to make this happen does not have to  be painful. We avoid a lot of pain if we make the move, but that  doesn't mean the move itself has to be painful. Nobel Prize winner  Joseph Stiglitz says it is a win economically. He has testified:         Retrofitting the global economy for climate change would       help to restore aggregate demand and growth. Climate       policies, if well designed and implemented, are consistent       with growth, development, and poverty reduction. The       transition to a low-carbon economy is potentially a powerful,       attractive, and sustainable growth story, marked by higher       resilience, more innovation, more livable cities, robust       agriculture, and stronger ecosystems.    We could do it the hard way--do nothing; get hit with those dire  economic consequences because the status quo is not safe.   Fortune magazine summed up the Trump administration's climate report  quite beautifully, so I will quote them at some length: ``The report  catalogs the observed damage and accelerating financial losses  projected from a climate now unmoored from a 12,000-year period of  relative stability.''   What a phrase that is. The Earth's climate, which we inhabit, is  unmoored from a 12,000-year period of relative stability.   It goes on:         The result is that much of what humans have built, and many       of the things they are building now, are unsuited to the       world as it exists. And as time goes on, the added cost of       living in that world could total hundreds of billions of       dollars--annually.    Which way we now go depends on the Congress of the United States--on  whether Congress can put the interests of our people ahead of the  interests of the fossil fuel industry.   The record is not good. I will concede that. Since the Citizens  United decision, the politics of climate change have turned into a tale  of industry capture and control. So far, despite the fossil fuel  industry's obvious conflict of interest, could there be a more obvious  conflict of interest, indeed? Despite their provable pattern of  deception and despite clear warnings from, well, virtually everywhere  now, the Republican Party has proven itself incapable of telling the  fossil fuel industry: No, we tried our best for you. We held in for you  as long as we could, and we did everything we could think of, but we  are not going to wreck our economy, our climate, our oceans, our  country for you.   So it doesn't look good, but the climate report does say we still  have time if we act fast.   I ask unanimous consent that an article by Max Boot, titled, ``I was  wrong on climate change. Why can't other conservatives admit it, too?''  be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   It concludes: Why haven't other Conservatives owned up to this  danger?         They are captives, first and foremost, of the fossil fuel       industry. . . . It is a tragedy for the entire planet that       the United States' governing party is impervious to science       and reason.    I will close with a reference to ``The Gathering Storm,'' which is  Winston  [[Page S7172]]  Churchill's legendary book about a previous failure to heed warnings.  Churchill quoted a poem of a train bound for destruction, rushing  through the night, with the engineer asleep at the controls as disaster  looms:         Who is in charge of the clattering train?        The axles creak, and the couplings strain.        . . . the pace is hot, and the points are near,        [but] Sleep hath deadened the driver's ear;        And signals flash through the night in vain.        Death is in charge of the clattering train!    I contend that we are now that sleeping driver, that the signals are  flashing at us, so far, in vain, and that it is decidedly time to wake  up.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         [From The Washington Post]  I Was Wrong on Climate Change. Why Can't Other Conservatives Admit It,                                    Too?                               (By Max Boot)         I admit it. I used to be a climate-change skeptic. I was       one of those conservatives who thought that the science was       inconclusive, that fears of global warming were as overblown       as fears of a new ice age in the 1970s, that climate change       was natural and cyclical, and that there was no need to incur       any economic costs to deal with this speculative threat. I no       longer think any of that, because the scientific consensus is       so clear and convincing.        The Fourth National Climate Assessment, released Friday by       the U.S. government, puts it starkly: ``Observations       collected around the world provide significant, clear, and       compelling evidence that global average temperature is much       higher, and is rising more rapidly, than anything modern       civilization has experienced, with widespread and growing       impacts.'' The report notes that ``annual average       temperatures have increased by 1.8  deg.F across the       contiguous United States since the beginning of the 20th       century'' and that ``annual median sea level along the U.S.       coast . . . has increased by about 9 inches since the early       20th century as oceans have warmed and land ice has melted.''        The report attributes these changes to man-made greenhouse       gases and warns: ``High temperature extremes, heavy       precipitation events, high tide flooding events along the       U.S. coastline, ocean acidification and warming, and forest       fires in the western United States and Alaska are all       projected to continue to increase, while land and sea ice       cover, snowpack, and surface soil moisture are expected to       continue to decline in the coming decades.''        The U.S. government warnings echo the United Nations'       Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In October, it       released a report that represented the work of 91 scientists       from 60 countries. It describes, in the words of the New York       Times, ``a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires,       and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040.''        The wildfires are already here. The Camp Fire blaze this       month is the most destructive in California history, charring       153,000 acres, destroying nearly 19,000 structures, and       killing at least 85 people. The second-most destructive fire       in California history was the one last year in Napa and       Sonoma counties.        The Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies notes       that climate change has contributed to these conflagrations       by shortening the rainy season, drying out vegetation and       whipping up Santa Ana winds. Massive hurricanes are       increasing along with wildfires--and they too are influenced       by climate change.        It is time to sound the planetary alarm. This is likely to       be the fourth-hottest year on record. The record-holder is       2016, followed by 2015 and 2017. A climate change website       notes that ``the five warmest years in the global record have       all come in the 2010s'' and ``the 10 warmest years on record       have all come since 1998.''        Imagine if these figures reflected a rise in terrorism--or       illegal immigration. Republicans would be freaking out. Yet       they are oddly blase about this climate code red. President       Trump, whose minions buried the climate-change report on the       day after Thanksgiving, told Axios: ``Is there climate       change? Yeah. Will it go back like this, I mean will it       change back? Probably.'' And, amid a recent cold snap, he       tweeted: ``Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL       RECORDS--Whatever happened to Global Warming?''        By this point, no one should be surprised that the       president can't tell the difference between short-term       weather fluctuations and long-term climate trends. At least       he didn't repeat his crazy suggestion that climate change is       a Chinese hoax. Yet his denialism is echoed by other       Republicans who should know better. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa)       told CNN on Sunday: ``Our climate always changes and we see       those ebb and flows through time. . . . We need to always       consider the impact to American industry and jobs.''        We do need to consider the impact on U.S. jobs--but that's       an argument for action rather than, as Ernst suggests,       inaction. The National Climate Assessment warns that global       warming could cause a 10 percent decline in gross domestic       product and that the ``potential for losses in some sectors       could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the       end of this century.'' Iowa and other farm states will be       particularly hard hit as crops wilt and livestock die.        Compared with the crushing costs of climate change, the       action needed to curb greenhouse-gas emissions is modest and       manageable--if we act now. Jerry Taylor, president of the       libertarian Niskanen Center, estimates that a carbon tax       would increase average electricity rates from 17 cents to 18       cents per kilowatt-hour. The average household, he writes,       would see spending on energy rise ``only about $35 per       month.'' That's not nothing--but it's better than allowing       climate change to continue unabated.        I've owned up to the danger. Why haven't other       conservatives? They are captives, first and foremost, of the       fossil fuel industry, which outspent green groups 10 to 1 in       lobbying on climate change from 2000 to 2016. But they are       also captives of their own rigid ideology. It is a tragedy       for the entire planet that the United States' governing party       is impervious to science and reason.     I note that my distinguished colleague from  Massachusetts has arrived. We have an order in place in which the  Senator from Massachusetts is to be recognized at the conclusion of my  remarks and that the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mrs.  Shaheen, is to be recognized at the conclusion of Senator Markey's  remarks.   With that, I yield the floor to the coauthor of the Waxman-Markey  legislation, the person who had done the most successful work to try to  solve this climate problem at a time when the situation was slightly  less desperate.
