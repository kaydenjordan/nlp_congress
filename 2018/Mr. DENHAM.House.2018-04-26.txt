 Mr. Speaker, I sadly rise today with fellow colleagues  because we lost a friend way too soon.   Rick Antle was an ag visionary, community leader, family man, and to  Sonia and I, a mentor and a friend. His passion and dedication made him  not only a leader in California's Salinas Valley, but in the entire ag  industry nationwide.   At the age of 26, he became the president and CEO of Tanimura &  Antle, one of the largest ag companies in the entire country. He would  grow this to become the largest leafy greens and vegetable producer in  the region. He set it up as an ESOP, making it an employee-owned  business. This is now a four-generation legacy that farms over 35,000  acres, distributing to North America, Europe, and Asia.   Rick worked right alongside his sons, Brian and Jeffrey. He  constantly pushed different innovations, even ideas that were against  conventional practice, things that were sometimes mocked or said that  they would never work, but are now the important innovations that lead  the rest of the industry.   Rick emphasized the importance of support and investing in employees,  whom he always saw as the backbone  [[Page H3579]]  of his company. His company's 800-person Spreckels Crossing housing  complex has since become a blueprint for other farmworker housing  projects across the country.   On a personal note, I would just say that Sonia and Tonya--Sonia and  Tonya, as they were known to most in the industry--worked side by side.  Rick and I worked side by side as well.                                time  1015    Not only was Tonya a mentor to Sonia, Rick was a mentor to me. I  learned a lot about business. I learned a lot about friendship. I saw  the pride in his generational family. He is going to be missed by many  here in Washington, D.C.; in the Salinas Valley; around the country;  and certainly as a family man. Brian and Jeffrey, I know that they are  going through tremendous pain, as are Anthony and Natalie. He thought  the world of his family and certainly thought the world of his  employees.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa)  for any remarks he may have.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Speaker, let me just, in closing, say my wife and I  extend our condolences and prayers for Rick's loving wife, his mother,  their children and grandchildren. On behalf of all who knew him and  benefited from his tireless efforts, we thank them for graciously  giving us some of their time to spend with Rick and the many things  that we all learned from him. Mr. Speaker, I will just say special  prayers and condolences.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act builds on  important emergency management reforms that the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee produced in the Sandy Recovery Improvement  Act.   Representing a neighboring district to the California wildfires last  year, I have seen firsthand how these reforms streamline disaster  assistance to survivors. California was able to utilize those reforms  like alternative procedures for debris removal, updated individual  assistance, declaration factors, changes to the Hazard Mitigation Grant  Program, and many others.   But there is still work to be done, and Congress recognized that by  passing legislation that I authored in the SMART Rebuilding Act, to  provide Federal cost share incentives to States. These measures  encourage mitigation by establishing a National Public Infrastructure  Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund, and allow implementation of design codes  as an eligible cost for FEMA's Public Assistance Program.   I want to clarify that the nationally recognizable design codes in  this legislation are intended to include State and local participation  and recognize the unique threats that our diverse country faces.   Another area which can be improved in California is the issue of  inverse condemnation. This is a dangerous precedent which is  threatening the ability of public and private utilities to survive in  California. Every dollar invested in mitigation results in $4 in cost  savings.   I support H.R. 4 and urge its passage.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer the bipartisan Denham-Costa  amendment which eliminates duplication of environmental reviews.   The MAP-21 highway bill created the NEPA assignment program in 2012,  which allows States to assume responsibility for environmental review,  consultation, and compliance of NEPA for Federal aid highway projects  and other transportation projects. The program removes an entire layer  of Federal bureaucracy from the NEPA process, allowing States and  counties to operate more efficiently.   NEPA assignment has been a success, saving time and cost of  infrastructure projects across six States: California, Texas, Florida,  Ohio, Utah, and Alaska. Two more States, Arizona and Nebraska, are in  the process of applying, and all 50 States are eligible to participate.   The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee built on the success  of the NEPA assignment program in the 2015 FAST Act by establishing the  NEPA reciprocity program. The NEPA reciprocity program allows States  with environmental laws that are at least as stringent as NEPA to make  the approval of reviews under State laws and regulations and in  replacement of NEPA. This allows States to remove parallel and  redundant NEPA requirements from their own environmental process, which  will get projects built faster and at a lower cost. In other words,  this not only allows one environmental review, but stops us from doing  two.   As reasonable and promising as this program is, the judicial review  period or window that litigants can challenge a record of decisions is  nearly five times longer than for Federal aid highway projects that are  subject to NEPA. The judicial review period for the reciprocity program  is 2 years, substantially increasing the risk of litigation and  dissuading States from pursuing the program.   This amendment harmonizes the statute of limitation for the program  with other Federal highway projects to 150 days. Instead of delaying 2  years for lawsuits, we do it in 150 days, the same as all other Federal  highway projects.   This commonsense change would render the program workable as  originally intended in the FAST Act. This program would allow States  impacted by the 2017 major disasters to rebuild devastated communities  faster and at a lower cost, saving taxpayer dollars.   Many wildfire-impacted counties in California have recognized the  potential benefits of NEPA reciprocity for their recovery efforts and  are pushing the State to participate. This amendment would allow  California and other impacted States with major disasters, like Texas  and Florida, to apply and rebuild in short order.   In September 2017, the Department of Transportation issued the notice  of proposed rulemaking, and the comment period closed in November. DOT  should issue the rule to establish the program soon, and this  modification must be in place for the program to be workable at that  time.   There has been a lot of discussion about environmental review and  permitting reform being included in the infrastructure package, and for  good reason: projects take too long and they cost way too much money.  We have an opportunity to ensure streamlining programs that are already  law are working correctly by passing this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, real quickly, let me just explain what the  [[Page H3674]]  F4A Denham amendment does. This clarifies the intent of the 1994 FAA  bill; thus, how it got its name, the F4A.   It created one Federal regulatory standard for meal and rest breaks  or hours of service for interstate freight and passenger motor  carriers. This was originally in the FAA bill of 1994. It also included  piece rate.   Now, we have passed this issue several times from the House over to  the Senate--a very good bipartisan bill--but while we have had great  bipartisanship in the past, to get greater bipartisanship, and to work  with labor, we actually took out the piece rate issue.   Now, this bill only deals with meal and rest--the same as that piece  of it that was in 1994 where Congress, where this body actually  reported out saying: ``State economic regulation of motor carrier  operations causes significant inefficiencies, increased costs,  reduction of competition, inhibition of innovation and technology, and  curtails the expansion of markets.''   This is about interstate commerce, making sure that you can drive a  truck transporting goods from one State to another without having  challenges going from a patchwork of States across the entire country.   We want these professional drivers to be safe, meaning if you get  tired, take a break. What we don't want to do is say, at 2 hours, you  need to pull over immediately--on the bridge, on the highway, wherever  you are at, creating an unsafe condition.   Stop at the rest stop. Stop at the truck stop. Stop when it is  convenient, when it is safe, and when you are tired.   We want to give these professional drivers flexibility in interstate  commerce. That was in 1994. That was the law of the land until the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reconvened and changed some of  these motor carrier laws. The amendment and the Federal Standard only  apply to interstate. What you do in your own State is up to your State.   But interstate, going across State lines, which the Constitution  enumerated to the Federal Government in Article I, section 8, clause 3  of the Commerce Clause. Interstate hours of service regulations would  continue to be regulated by the States. But this has already been  proven by the U.S. Department of Transportation who wrote the rule that  this is the safest way for interstate commerce.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me just say, Mr. DeFazio has said this  is very broad. It is very, very succinct. Title 49, section 31502 is  the law. The regulation is 40 CFR 395.   This is very, very tight compared to 1994, when the Democrats had  control of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. Mr. DeFazio,  thankfully, supported it back then as a very broad measure dealing with  all of these different issues. Now we are just dealing with meal and  rest breaks only.   Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar) on this very bipartisan measure.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
