 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to President  Donald Trump and Ambassador Nikki Haley--South Carolina's former  Governor--for the announcement that the United States will recognize  Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel and relocate the American  Embassy to the holy city which protects all religions.   As President Trump said at the White House: ``This long overdue  recognition of reality is in the best interests of both the United  States and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians.''   America's bond with Israel is unique, and its strength is the  foundation for peace through stability for all of the Middle East  providing for prosperity for all countries.   The President's announcement strengthens that alliance, and I  appreciate his honoring another of his campaign commitments. Friends of  Israel know they have a true friend in the White House, which was  heartfelt when I met last month with Sheldon and Miriam Adelson at the  Washington Convention Center.   President Trump's team is leading boldly. The President is clear:  peace is never beyond the grasp of those willing to reach for it.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism, just as America had  resolved December the 7th, 1941.                            ____________________
