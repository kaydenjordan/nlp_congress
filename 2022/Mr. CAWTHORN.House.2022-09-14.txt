 Madam Speaker, what do you call a group of unelected,  unethical, power-hungry bureaucrats making policy decisions? In many  countries, we would call them an oligarchy. In the United States,  though, we call them the Federal Reserve, which is funny because the  Federal Reserve has no reserves, and they are absolutely not part of  the Federal Government.   For decades now, the Federal Reserve has diluted the purchasing power  of the U.S. dollar, decimated private industry, and divvied up the  hard-won earnings of U.S. citizens amongst corrupt power brokers in  Washington and Wall Street.   Let me be clear: Inflation is, at its root, a monetary fraud, and the  Federal Reserve is the biggest counterfeiting operation in American  history. This isn't a debate. At this point in our history, it is  really no longer even a discussion.   Decade after decade, the Federal Reserve has repeated the same cycle  of corruption and destroyed our economy in the process. The Federal  Reserve buys bonds from the government, printing dollars to finance  these purchases. Then they deceive us into accepting this newly printed  and inflated paper as currency by making its new dollars look like real  currency. This is the very essence of counterfeiting.   The Great Depression of the 1930s, the great inflation of the 1970s,  the 2008 recession, and now the 2022 recession were caused in full, or  in part, by the greatest currency fraud operation ever attempted, aided  and abetted by this hallowed institution, and built on the broken backs  and fractured families of millions of American citizens.   Madam Speaker, former President Garfield was right when he said  whoever controls the volume of currency and money in any country is  absolute master of all industry and commerce.   To the American people, I say that your master is not decided at the  ballot box. It is not decided in public debate or open dialogue. You  didn't vote for the person who controls your life. They would never let  you.   Your master is the machine of Federal finance that, in the name of  quantitative easing, stripped your right to property ownership away  from you, turned your existence into a groveling attempt just to get  by, and sucked every last drop of autonomy from the shriveled husk of  what used to be a vibrant and prosperous Nation.    You didn't vote for the Chair of the Federal Reserve. You didn't vote  for 9 percent inflation. But you can absolutely vote for people who are  willing to destroy it and give the power back to the people.    Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this institution can be  synthesized into one word--``represent.'' But can we, as a hallowed and  time-honored body truly sit here in the sacred Chamber and say with  straight faces that we are fulfilling this calling?   Our woes as a Nation beset us upon every side, and this body has  through inaction or, frankly, malicious action, made many crises worse.  At the beginning of this Congress our border was in shambles. Can we  honestly say the situation has improved even slightly?   At the start of 2021 our economy was teetering. Today the smog and  dust of collapse have yet to settle. Today we are weaker domestically,  and frighteningly vulnerable internationally. China rises, Russia  marches, the Middle East implodes, and this body sits on its hands and  names post offices.   Hear this: America cannot be saved through legislation. Men and women  of virtue and value must rise to alter the very culture of our Nation.  Christ, not Congress, will be what saves this country.                            ____________________
