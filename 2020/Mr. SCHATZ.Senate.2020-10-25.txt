 Mr. President, I am going to give some remarks in 4 or 5  minutes. I just wanted to encourage the staffers, especially the  stenographers, to feel comfortable to keep their distance from U.S.  Senators who are delivering remarks. There is no reason, if we have  microphones on, to be anywhere near us. So I would just encourage them  to keep their distance, especially since most Members are delivering  remarks without masks on.   So if there is something the staff could do to just encourage them to  keep their distance, we do want them to be safe.   I will be giving remarks in a few minutes.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S6518]]     Mr. President, before I talk about the Supreme Court, I  want to express my condolences to the families and the loved ones who  have experienced the human toll of the coronavirus pandemic.
