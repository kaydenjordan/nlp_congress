 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, our national forests are among our greatest natural  resources. Unfortunately, these forests are under constant threat from  invasive species and disease. You do not have to search far to find a  forest battling invasive pests, disease, or invasive vegetation.   The Healthy Forest Restoration Act was created as a way to help  respond to these persistent threats. My amendment before the House  would simply add invasive vegetation to the Healthy Forest Restoration  Act for the purposes of the designated treatment areas.   Invasive vegetation chokes out our native trees by competing for  moisture, sunlight, nutrients, and space. Species like kudzu climb our  trees and infrastructure and threaten the health and safety of the  areas where it uncontrollably spreads.   When native trees are threatened, it is not just the ecosystem that  is damaged. Local economies and sportsmen and those that use our land  for other forms of recreation all suffer from degraded forestland.   Adding this designation increases the effectiveness of the Healthy  Forest Restoration Act by taking a more encompassing view of the  threats facing our forestland.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
