 Mr. Speaker, ``All is well!'' ``So far, so good!''   This is the latest sequel in Trump's government-by-tweets, that  couldn't be further from reality. Hopefully, we pray that no American  lives were lost last night. But every American is less safe today than  before Trump's assassination of a major foreign leader. He has taken us  to the brink of war, and, hopefully, he will use the opportunity of a  restrained counterattack not to escalate further but to seek an off- ramp to deescalate the crisis that could endanger the world.   Attack begetting attack, and hate begetting hate--in that direction  lies the abyss. The only justification that he can offer for ignoring  President Ronald Reagan's Executive Order against assassination of  foreign leaders is that of an imminent attack, that we need to get them  before they get us. He has failed to offer any such evidence of an  imminent attack to justify this rash assassination that previous  administrations, Republican and Democrat, and the Israelis who had the  capacity to do this, recognized posed more danger than good.   ``Overreliance on our packing the biggest gun and having the fastest  draw as in some old John Wayne western movie does not truly make us  safer. This is not a formula for the safety of our families. It is a  formula for international anarchy. A quick draw may eliminate the  occasional villain, but it comes at the cost of destabilizing the  world, disrupting the hope of international law and order, and,  ultimately, it will make even Austin a very unsafe place in which to  live.''   Those were the precise words I used in challenging the horrendous  Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq, and they apply even more today to the war  with Iran, a country that is about four times  [[Page H19]]  the size and three times the population of prewar Iraq and has far more  capacity to do harm to us and our allies.   Trump has no plan and no strategy in the Middle East. Ending one  general's life is not an endgame. Like the invasion of Iraq, already  the biggest winner from Trump's misguided non-policy is the country  that he opposes the most, Iran, whose allies now in Iraq have asked all  of our troops to leave and who have called them occupiers; Iran, whose  presence has caused the removal of all civilian employees and foreign  service officers of the United States from Iraq.   Now, with the assassination, Trump has united those who were once  opposing the regime in Iran. In Iran, there are incredible protests,  and in Iraq there are protests against Iranian influence. So after  abandoning our Kurdish allies and surrendering that part of the Middle  East to our adversaries, Trump has now managed to unite the many people  who were favorable to the United States and who were questioning the  very malicious presence of Iran.   I believe that Congress must act and this House must act to assert  its constitutional authority to rein in this out-of-control President.  Last July, we attempted to do just that. I voted with a strong majority  in this House to adopt the Khanna amendment to basically say that we  would deny all funds for his attacking Iran without his coming first to  this Congress to justify it; and I supported a second amendment that  was adopted by our colleague, Representative Lee, which made it clear  that there is no authorization for use of military force that exists on  the books today that justifies any offensive action against Iran.   This House should use the full strength of our authority to restrict  President Trump from rushing into another war that will be so costly to  us in blood and treasure. It is a war that American families do not  want.   As one very concerned father movingly wrote to me this week: ``[If]  my son is to be deployed to protect and serve our country, please do  your best to be sure it is for the right reasons. He is proud to  [serve] and will do his duty to the best of his ability without  question. His Mother and I could not be prouder. Please don't let it be  about some ill-conceived political distraction from an egomaniacal  madman.''   Let us come together to build a better path forward. Let us give  peace a chance.                            ____________________
