 Mr. President, as a ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize The  Hitching Post and Old Country Store of Aurora, KY, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   For generations, Land Between the Lakes has been one of the premier  travel destinations in Western Kentucky. The gorgeous strip of land  nestled between lakes Barkley and Kentucky contains breathtaking nature  scenes, a plethora of outdoor activities, and numerous local businesses  that visitors travel from far and wide to enjoy. A local favorite among  those many businesses is The Hitching Post and Old Country Store.  Located on 4 and a half acre property on the western side of Kentucky  Lake, The Hitching Post and Old Country Store first opened their doors  to customers in 1941. The structures themselves are over 200 years old,  but starting with the Perryman family in 1941, three families of  stewards have maintained these stores in all their historic glory.  Today, the stores are owned by Su Festen and her husband Tom Trenkle,  who ventured south from Illinois to buy the property in 2008. In the  years since, Su will tell you that she has grown a Southern heart,  which is more than evident in the warm hospitality she shows to all who  dawn her doors.   Though The Hitching Post and the Old Country Store needed some  notable maintenance when it came into Tom and Su's hands, they both  decided to maintain the old-fashioned nature to the interior of the  stores. Su was inspired to perpetuate the historic feeling of the of  the property on her first day on the job as one of the very first  patrons to come in was a fourth-generation customer with an abundance  of love for these two stores. From then on, Su and her husband ensured  that The Hitching Post and Old Country Store would be a place where  everyone from out of town travelers to generational customers and  locals could come to reminisce, remember, and enjoy the simpler things  that only a small-town small business could provide.   When travelers traverse the beautiful land between lakes Barkley and  Kentucky, they are confronted with the abounding beauty of the  landscape surrounding them. Given this gorgeous scenery, it would be  easy to overlook the charming shops around them. This is not the case  for patrons of The Hitching Post and its neighboring Old Country Store.  Customers are struck by the old-fashioned interior which harkens back  to memories from a simpler time. From the stacks of local fruit  preserves and canned country favorites, to spiced apple cider,  customers are reminded of a time when local produce was the all that  was available before the days of instant gratification fostered by  online shopping and rapid delivery.   Not only are the two stores brimming over with charm, the two provide  a wide variety of products to satisfy every traveler. If you are  looking for something sweet to snack on for the trip home, you will  find a delightful selection of homemade fudge and crates filled to the  brim with saltwater taffy and old-fashioned candy. However, there is  one offering that sticks out above all the others. As soon as you enter  the Old Country Store, your eyes are immediately drawn to the towering  wall of old-fashioned glass bottled sodas that line the back wall of  the store. With over 200 different flavors offered, ranging from  classic root beers to seasonal soda recipes, it is nearly impossible to  choose what unique sodas to try, which is one of the many reasons why  customers often return to The Hitching Post and Old Country Store year  after year. To brighten up the weekends of their customers, Su and Tom  created their weekly All-American Soda Showdown. From May to September,  the most indecisive or adventurous customer can come in Sunday  afternoons to sample both new and old flavors of soda the Old Country  Store has to offer.   However, both The Hitching Post and Old Country Stores have more than  just sweet treats for the car ride home. Customers can also find a  collection of retro toys and trinkets that introduce new generations to  the beloved pastimes of their parents and grandparents. Family of some  of the previous owners of the stores were avid collectors of unique  items and oddities. Customers are encouraged to peruse their treasure  trove of antiques and vintage novelties great for giving as gifts or  keeping for home decor. One notable item on display is a moonshine  still designed by Casey Jones, a famous Prohibition-era moonshiner  whose brew was enjoyed by notable mob-boss Al Capone. Even upon exiting  the stores visitors will encounter an array of impressive chainsaw  carvings of forest creatures and mythical characters hand-crafted by  talented local artisans.   There is something about family vacations that is uniquely American.  The places that families travel for both relaxation and recreation hold  a special place in the hearts of those who visit them. All across the  country are areas like Land Between the Lakes whose beauty is enjoyed  by generations of families who bring their children and grandchildren  to relish in the wonder they themselves appreciated as children. Part  of this landscape are small businesses like The Hitching Post and Old  Country Store that bravely confront the onward march of time. Though  their original customers have aged over the 81 years that they have  been open, the stores themselves remain ageless, as they look just like  they did since that first year of operation in 1941. For decades, these  stores have been serving local Kentuckians and travelers alike, and it  is clear that they will be cherished for generations to come.  Congratulations to Tom Trenkle and Su Festen, along with the entire  team at The Hitching Post and Old Country Store. I look forward to  seeing your continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
