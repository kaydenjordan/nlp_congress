 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss  the full Agriculture Committee hearing that we held on March 16, the  focus of which was the 2018 farm bill and the role of climate change.   Recently, The New York Times wrote a series of stories and produced  several videos denigrating rural Americans for providing the country  with the safest, most abundant, and most affordable food supply in the  history of the world.   Let's set the record straight. U.S. agriculture accounts for less  than 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and that is according to  the Environmental Protection Agency. Over the last 70  [[Page H4198]]  years, U.S. agriculture has tripled food and fiber production while  usage of land, energy, fertilizer and other inputs has remained steady.   Early in the first session of this Congress, several of my Republican  colleagues and I introduced a slate of climate-friendly and farmer- focused bills. These bills are driven by commonsense solutions to  benefit our environment and our farm industry.   Our farmers, ranchers, foresters, and producers are the original  climate champions. While there is more to be done, we must prevent  efforts to fundamentally upend our commodity, conservation, and crop  insurance programs to appease Washington think tanks. We must also  reject complicating our programs and making climate the focus of every  title of the upcoming farm bill reauthorization.   Madam Speaker, under the umbrella of natural land solutions, which  includes farmers that grow crops, livestock, and our foresters, the  research has shown that at this moment, based on the technology they  use, they are responsible for sequestering 6.1 gigatons of carbon  annually, greenhouse gas emissions.   To put that into perspective, that takes care of all the greenhouse  gas emissions that are emitted on those lands, plus sequestering an  additional 10.1 percent. So truly, the American farmer, rancher, and  forester are the climate change champions anywhere in the world because  of our science, technology, and innovation.   We must ensure agriculture production remains viable in rural America  to keep production from increasing in areas of the world with lower  environmental standards, worse labor conditions, and fewer food safety  considerations. And that is why a robust safety net is critical to  keeping farms and production here in the United States while lowering  overall global greenhouse gas emissions.   Madam Speaker, our country and our farmers face enormous and  immediate challenges including higher food prices, record inflation,  and input costs, attacks on our energy independence, crop-protection  tools, and dependable labor.   Now, these are the issues I hear about as I travel my district and  the country. These are the issues we should be addressing.   I hope at the end of the day we recognize that our voluntary, locally  led, incentive-based conservation system is working as intended, and  that we must not undermine its continued success in supporting the  environment and producers.   American agriculture is science. American agriculture is technology.  And American agriculture is innovation. The demands of a 21st century  farm economy, and economically viable climate solutions, depend on  tools and policies that continue to unleash and increase the United  States agriculture productivity.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate National Library Week and National Library Outreach Day. This  week is dedicated to promoting the importance of our local libraries.   Our libraries serve as a place to connect. Some use the library as a  place to connect to the internet. Others may use it as a place to  connect with new ideas or classes. Most importantly, our libraries  connect our communities.   Today's focus, National Library Outreach Day, otherwise known as  National Bookmobile Day, highlights the important outreach activities  conducted by our local libraries.   Bookmobiles and other outreach events hosted by our libraries connect  individuals who otherwise might not be able to access a local library.  From events at elementary schools to senior living centers, these  services are essential to our community.   Madam Speaker, I encourage you all to make a visit to your local  library this week and thank the librarians for the work that they do.                            ____________________
