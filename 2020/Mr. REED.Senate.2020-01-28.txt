 Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a pioneer in the  field of military medicine, retired Army COL Dr. Robert J.T. Joy.  Colonel Joy was founding professor of military medicine and commandant  of the School of Medicine at the Uniformed Services University, USU.  Most recently, he served as professor emeritus of USU's Section of  Military Medical History. He passed away last year at the age of 90.   Born in Rhode Island and raised between Narragansett, RI, and St.  Petersburg, FL, he studied pre-med and pre-law at the University of  Rhode Island, before attending Yale University Medical School on a  Reserve medical officers training scholarship.   From there, his service to his country began. After assignments  stateside, Dr. Joy volunteered to lead the Walter Reed Army Institute  of Research, WRAIR, team to Vietnam, where he received his first--of  four--Legion of Merit medals and his team received a Meritorious Unit  Citation for their field research. After becoming Deputy Director and  then Director of WRAIR, many thought he had found his dream job.   However, after a meeting with Dr. Jay Sanford, the first dean of USU,  in 1976, Colonel Joy received a transfer to take the position of  professor of military medicine and commandant of the School of Medicine  at the newly created USU. While there, he was instrumental in the  creation of the field of military medical history, and his teachings,  lectures, and leadership were integral to the development of today's  ``joint'' concept of military medicine.   Dr. Joy retired from Active Duty in 1981 and was awarded the  Distinguished Service Medal for his Army career. He continued to teach  as a civilian professor until 2005, and his legacy lives on through his  students--the physicians and surgical teams that continue to provide  world-class care for our wounded, ill, and injured service members.   I would like to close with a quote about Dr. Joy from retired Army BG  Robert Doughty, professor and chair of history at the United States  Military Academy at West Point: ``His contribution has influenced, and  will continue to influence, students, historians, and soldiers for  decades to come.''   I salute Dr. Joy and extend my condolences to his family.                            ____________________
