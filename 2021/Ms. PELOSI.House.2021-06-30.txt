 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his bringing this important legislation to the floor. I thank our  distinguished majority leader for his clarity in presenting the case  for this legislation and all of our colleagues who have come to the  floor on the Democratic side in the search of truth, justice, and  security for our country.   Madam Speaker, I particularly thank Mr. McGovern because on the night  of this insurrection, I was in the chair, the security came and pulled  me out. He took the chair. He risked his life to take the chair as the  assaulters of our Capitol were out to get me with a bullet in the head  or to hang the Vice  [[Page H3334]]  President of the United States, assault the lives of Members of  Congress, traumatize our staff, and disrespect the workers in the  Capitol.   It was not an ordinary tourist day in the Capitol as the Republicans  have characterized. Republicans have characterized it as a normal day  in the Congress, when we have pictures of those very same people  pushing furniture against the door to keep the intruders out.   We are under the dome of the Capitol, a dome that was built by  Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War when people said to him: No, we  need the steel, the this and the that to fight the war.   He said: No, we need to show our determination.   Madam Speaker, 1 year into the devastation of the Civil War,  President Abraham Lincoln sent a message to Congress imploring Members  to join as one to save the Union.   He said: ``Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this  Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of  ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one  or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us  down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.''   Madam Speaker, today we go on record. We too have a responsibility,  as was described by President Lincoln. We too cannot escape history. We  have a duty to the Constitution and to the American people to find the  truth of January 6 and to ensure that such an assault on our Democracy  can never happen again.   Rather than being frivolous with the facts, we are going to be  prayerful and patriotic and honor the concerns of the American people  by seeking and finding the truth to protect our country from any future  or similar assault.   As has been said many times, that day, January 6, was one of the  darkest days of our history. For the Members, the police officers, the  staff, the press, and the support workers who were there, the memory of  that day remains seared in our memory: the sounds of glass shattering,  officers fighting, rioters chanting, the smell of teargas and the taste  of smoke in the air and the sight of people fleeing the Capitol or  barricading doors as Republicans and Democrats did that night, and the  sense of terror, hundreds of people fearing for their lives.    In the aftermath, over 140 members of law enforcement were physically  and seriously harmed, five people died, and staff, workers, press, and  Members were and still remain traumatized by the experience.   The sheer scale of the violence of that day is shocking. But what is  just as shocking is remembering why this violence occurred: to block  the certification of an election and the peaceful transfer of power  that is the cornerstone of our Democracy. It was a date actually  required by the Constitution. It was not just another tourist day in  the Capitol.   Congress returned to the Capitol that same night to accomplish our  constitutional duty--that same night. Thanks to the workers, the  maintenance people here, the Capitol Police, and the rest, we were able  to return and send a message to the world that this Congress would  honor its constitutional duties regardless of the assault that was made  on it.   This was important, and it was bipartisan in the decision. Mr. Hoyer  and Mr. McConnell agreed that we would come back.   Where others were saying: Go to an undisclosed location; we said: No,  we are going to the Capitol.   Congress returned to the Capitol, as I said, to honor that  responsibility. We showed the insurrectionists, the country, and the  world that we would not be diverted from our duty. We could do that  because of the courage of the Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police,  and other law enforcement, some of whom are with us today.                                time  1500    I especially want to recognize Gladys Sicknick, the mother of Brian,  who gave his life; and Sandra Garza, his friend and partner.   But it is clear that January 6 was not simply an attack on the  Capitol building. It was an attack on our democracy. Every Member here  knows that January 6 was an attempt to subvert our democracy.   But many across the aisle refuse to admit the truth. They refused to  admit the truth when they voted against certifying President Biden's  election that night. They refused to admit the truth when they voted  against the creating of a bipartisan commission to investigate the  attack. They refused to admit the truth when they called that day a  ``normal tourist visit.''   And, today, when many will vote against establishing a select  committee to investigate that day, they will, again, refuse to admit  the truth. But they did that; 100 percent of them voted ``no'' against  putting resources to ensure the security of our Capitol Police and the  security of this building. 175 Republicans voted ``no'' when it came  time for the commission, 35 ``yeses'' on the Republican side.   I am heartbroken that we don't have the bipartisan commission. We  yielded on every point.   Numbers, as Mr. Hoyer said, the numbers, the process for subpoenas,  the timing, and further yielded on the Senate side on timing again, as  well as clarification on staffing, that was never in doubt, but they  wanted further clarification.   They thought--the Republican Senators thought that they could win the  day over there. They thought they could. And they thought they had the  votes, until the Minority Leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, asked  them to do him a personal favor and vote against the commission.   Too many of them chose to do Mitch McConnell a personal favor rather  than to perform their patriotic duty. And, hence, despite the fact that  seven Republican Members either voted or said they would vote for the  commission, it was defeated.   They said: Give us another week; give us another week; give us  another week; give us another week.   Now it is almost--well, it is 4\1/2\ weeks, and we must go forward.   It does not appear at this time that we can have a bipartisan  commission, outside commission. Hopefully, that could still happen.  But, in the meantime, we will have a select committee.   This is not unlike what happened in 2001, at the time of the 9/11  Commission. 9/11 happened exactly then, 9/11/2001. It took more than 1  year to get the commission. It was signed into law by the President on  November 27, 2002.   In the meantime, there was a Congressional investigation, which was  useful to the commission when they finally were formed. So perhaps we  can still hope for that, but we cannot wait for it.   To do that, we believe that Congress must, in the spirit of  bipartisanship and patriotism, establish this commission. And it will  be conducted with dignity, with patriotism, with respect for the  American people so that they can know the truth.   It is a funny thing about Mitch saying he wanted them to do him a  personal favor. Oh, my goodness.   We had a commission on this side of the Capitol. Bennie Thompson, our  distinguished chair of the Homeland Security Committee, working with  the ranking member of the committee, Mr. Katko, put together a  bipartisan commission. Only 35 Republicans voted for it, even though we  responded to every one of their concerns, except, as Mr. Hoyer said,  scope. Scope. They just did not want to go to the truth, sadly.   That is why there will be--and, today, we are establishing--a select  committee on the January 6 insurrection. It will investigate and report  upon the facts and causes of the attack. It will report on conclusions  and recommendations for preventing any future assault. And it will find  the truth, which, clearly, the Republicans fear; but, hopefully, not  across the country.   This committee is about our security, ensuring that a future attack  does not happen. It is about patriotism and democracy, ensuring that  Congress can continue to serve the American people.   Mr. Hoyer rightfully pointed out that, as the other side likes to  say, oh, the Senate did a bipartisan--they were very limited in what  they were allowed to do. They were only allowed to investigate the  security of the building, not the cause of it, not the fact that it was  an insurrection incited by the executive branch. None of that was  allowed.   So don't use that as an excuse not to have a fuller investigation of  the underlying causes of what happened, the underlying causes of white  supremacists and anti-Semites; one man with a  [[Page H3335]]  Camp Auschwitz shirt on: Six million are not enough.   You would think they would reject that. Not just a normal day of  tourism in the Capitol.   In that message to the Congress that I quoted in the beginning from  President Lincoln, it concluded by clearly declaring: ``We shall nobly  save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of Earth. The way is plain,  peaceful, generous, just--a way which, if followed, the world will  forever applaud, and God must forever bless.''   He also said: ``We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do  know how to save it. We . . . hold the power, and bear the  responsibility.''   Today, we, too, hold the power and bear the responsibility. Let all  Members do what is right and vote for this legislation. We will be  judged by future generations as to how we value our democracy. Let's be  on the right side not only of history, but the right side of the  future.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye.''    Madam Speaker, it is with great official pride and  personal pride, but some sadness, that I rise to honor the dedicated  service of two departing members of the Speaker's staff: my deputy  chief of staff, Diane Dewhirst; and my senior policy advisor, Patti  Ross.   Diane Dewhirst is a pillar of the Speaker's office and of our caucus.  Indeed, there are few Members who do not know Diane, and even fewer who  are unfamiliar with her skills and her contributions.   Diane has dedicated decades to Democratic politics, ever since, as a  college student, she borrowed her father's red Buick Skylark to drive  across Illinois to campaign for the legendary Congressman Abner Mikva.   And she has remained in the political arena ever since; working in  the DNC and DSCC; holding positions in the Clinton administration in  not one, but six agencies; serving in Senator George Mitchell's office;  and then serving as a key member of my office when I was leader and now  Speaker.   Her interest in politics sprang from her commitment to the values of  our country and her patriotic spirit. She has a trusted voice, bringing  extensive experience, sound judgment, and remarkable institutional  knowledge to our legislative work.   I know that she takes great pride in our work for women and families,  particularly in what is my proudest official moment as Speaker: The  passage of the Affordable Care Act, which has delivered quality  healthcare to millions of Americans.   Diane has made a difference in this institution that transcends the  political, the policy, and the legislative realm. Over her 15 years in  my office, she has been an outstanding mentor and role model to many,  particularly young women. She has dedicated her service to this truth,  as I always say: ``When women succeed, America succeeds.''   Diane's love of the arts is well known. She has represented my office  in our work with leading cultural institutions, including the  Smithsonian, the Kennedy Center, the Library of Congress, the National  Archives, and the National Gallery of Art. Given her passion and  experience in this arena, it is fitting that she is leaving Capitol  Hill for the National Endowment for the Arts.   Inscribed in the marble facade of the Kennedy Center are President  John F. Kennedy's powerful words: ``The life of the arts, far from  being an interruption, a distraction, in the life of the nation, is  very close to the center of a nation's purpose . . . and is a test of  the quality of a nation's civilization.''   At the NEA, Diane's passion for the ``life of the arts'' will serve  this Nation's purpose well.   On behalf of the House of Representatives, I thank Diane. I wish her  and her  [[Page H3337]]  husband, Bob; and her children, JoAnna, Billy, and Rob, much happiness  as she begins this next phase.   Thank you very much, Diane.   I thank the Biden administration for taking my staff.   Also departing this week is our senior policy advisor, Patti Ross.  Patti is, simply, the gold standard of public service. Indeed,  President Biden chose an expert of domestic policymaking in appointing  Patti Ross to serve as Assistant Secretary for the Office of  Congressional and Legislative Affairs at the Department of Veterans  Affairs.   Patti has served in my office for over a decade, where she has been  an invaluable asset to all of us; our caucus; indeed, the entire  Congress.   Her portfolio spans a major portion of domestic policy: agriculture,  nutrition, education and labor, veterans, military families, and  caregivers.   Patti has earned the respect of Members and staff on both sides of  the aisle for all her legislative acumen and accomplishments, but  particularly for her ironclad commitment to our veterans. Coming from a  long line of veterans in her family, this dedication is in her DNA.   As Speaker, I have seen her commitment firsthand, including her work  leading the VSO roundtables, which ensure that those who have donned  the uniform have a seat at the decisionmaking table.   Indeed, one of the many strengths that Patti brings is her experience  as a consensus finder and a coalition builder; a leader with the  courage and the character to fight to ensure that Congress and veterans  have a voice at the VA.   The unanimous confirmation of Patti Ross last week was, therefore, a  joyous victory for America's veterans and their families and  caregivers.   When I spoke at Patti's confirmation hearing, I relayed an anecdote  from a congressional delegation visit that she helped plan. This was to  France for the 75th anniversary of the Allied D-day landings in  Normandy and to Belgium and Luxembourg for the anniversary of the  Battle of the Bulge.   During that visit, we were honored, as we often have been on those  visits, to meet with World War II veterans, including one man in his  nineties, whose message to us all was simply: ``Pray for peace.''   As I said at her hearing, ``It is with great confidence that I can  say that Patti Ross, if confirmed, will be a powerful force for peace  for our veterans, their families, and caregivers.''   On behalf of the Congress, I congratulate Patti on her well-deserved  recognition. Congratulations also to her family and partner, Tim.   I thank both Diane and Patti for their consequential service and wish  them much success in their new capacity in the Biden administration.                     Amendment Offered by Mr. DeSaulnier     Mr. Speaker, in November, the American people elected  leaders committed to not only recovering from the pandemic and economic  crisis, but to Building Back Better.   Americans know that now is the time to act boldly with a once-in-a- century investment to rebuild our nation's infrastructure.   With the INVEST in America Act, Democrats are honoring the faith  placed in us, as we seize this historic opportunity to Build Back  Better.   Thank you to Chair Peter DeFazio, who has been masterful in putting  together this strong, jobs-creating package to rebuild America. Thanks  also to Chair Frank Pallone, and to members of both committees for  ensuring that the priorities of all our communities are represented in  this legislation.                            INVEST IN AMERICA ACT    This package was developed with the benefit of regular order, after  dozens of hours of hearings and mark-ups, and hundreds of amendments  debated.   And--proudly--as a result, it is transformative. It contains the  goals of the President's American Jobs Plan, as it puts America on a  path to create millions of good-paying jobs, ensure we can out-compete  any other country and power economic growth for decades.                             NEED FOR INVESTMENT    And it is desperately needed: America ranks 13th in infrastructure  quality, with the American Society of Civil Engineer awarding us a ``C- '' grade.   We face a maintenance backlog of over $1 trillion in transportation  alone--imposing serious costs on businesses and workers, who bear the  burden of congestion, delays and missed opportunity.   As I often say, the most expensive maintenance is no maintenance.                               COMPETITIVENESS    The INVEST in America Act will not only rebuild our infrastructure;  it will rebuild our middle class--connecting workers with good-paying  union jobs with benefits and helping working families recover from the  pandemic and economic crisis.   It puts equity front and center. Its benefits target underserved  communities: communities of color, rural communities and places with  persistent poverty.   And it will take us into the future: advancing a zero-emissions  future by expanding transportation alternatives, targeting pollution  reduction, using greener materials and investing in resilient  infrastructure.                              EV INFRASTRUCTURE    We are particularly proud of the investments that this legislation  makes in electric vehicle charging infrastructure.   This spring, before Easter, Chair DeFazio held a bipartisan hearing  on electrification in which CEOs from companies such as FedEx  testified. And they all, including Fred Smith of FedEx, said, ``We're  going electric.''   Electric vehicles are the future, and America cannot be left behind.                                   DETAILS    The American people across parties support these initiatives, which  include:   $343 billion investment in roads, bridges and safety: a more than 50  percent increase, focused on fixing existing infrastructure, including  with $32 billion to ensure bridges in communities of all sizes are  safer, more reliable and more resilient.   $109 billion for transit: a record investment to increase routes,  reduce the maintenance backlog, expand service for rural communities  and low-income riders and invest in zero-emission vehicles.   $95 billion for passenger and freight rail: tripling Amtrak funding  for better service, reduced congestion and improved rail safety. We are  particularly proud of the funding secured for the development of high- speed rail--which is the future.   Over $50 billion for wastewater infrastructure: improving services  for vulnerable communities and prioritizing energy efficiency and  resilience.   $117 billion for drinking water infrastructure, including to replace  the 10 million lead service lines in use nationwide, including at an  estimated 400,000 schools and child care facilities. As many here. I  have traveled to Flint, Michigan over time and seen the dire need for  improved drinking water infrastructure in this and so any other  communities.                      NEXT STEPS: JOBS & FAMILIES PLANS    The American people want and expect us to pass this legislation.   Once we do so, the House will work with the Senate to ensure that the  strong and bipartisan provisions of our legislation are included in the  final package. And we will work with them to secure robust investments  in parents, workers and young people through the American Families  Plan.   Our responsibility--and our pledge--is to pass and enact an  infrastructure package and reconciliation bill that truly meet the  needs of Americans.   The initiatives of President Biden's American Jobs and American  Families Plans enjoy the strong support of the American people,  including Republicans. Democrats are committed to making them law--so  we can Build Back Better, with prosperity, opportunity and justice for  all.
