 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate the prodigious  24-year public service career of supervisor Janet Wolf, and a good  friend, in Santa Barbara County of my district.   A southern California native, Janet Wolf earned her bachelor of arts  degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara, my alma mater  as well. She then went on to the University of California, Los Angeles,  to earn her master's degree and teaching credential.   In 1983, Janet began working in the field of vocational  rehabilitation. In 1987, she opened her own business, with offices both  in Santa Barbara and Santa Maria, California. She continued her work  and leadership in that field for over 20 years.   Janet Wolf began her service as an elected official in 1993, when she  was first elected to the Goleta School Board, where she served three  terms, equaling 12 years. She went on to be elected to the Santa  Barbara County Board of Supervisors, where she also served three terms.   During her tenure, her accomplishments were numerous, including  initiating the Eastern Goleta Valley Planning Advisory Committee,  steering completion of the Eastern Goleta Valley Community Plan,  expanding library funding, and advocating for the construction of a  state-of-the-art emergency operations center.    Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join my former colleagues in Santa  Barbara County in celebrating the exemplary 24-year career of my former  colleague, supervisor Janet Wolf, in her public service. Her leadership  and commitment to her constituents has been both exceptional and  unprecedented. I congratulate and wish Janet and her family the best in  her well-deserved retirement and all future endeavors.                            ____________________
