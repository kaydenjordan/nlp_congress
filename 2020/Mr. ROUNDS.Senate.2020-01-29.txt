 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senator Murkowski.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Senator.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Rounds and Murkowski ask counsel for the  President:         Describe in further detail your contention that all       subpoenas issued prior to the passage of H. Res. 660 are an       exercise of invalid subpoena authority by the House       committees.    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice.   Thank you, Senators, for that question.   As I explained the other day, this contention is based on a principle  that has been laid out in several Supreme Court cases explaining that  the Constitution assigns powers to each House of the legislative  branch: to the House of Representatives or to the Senate. And in  particular, the language of the Constitution is clear in article I that  the sole power of impeachment is assigned to the House--as to the House  of Representatives as a body. It is not assigned to any committee, to a  subcommittee, or to any particular Member of the House.   And in cases such as Rumely v. The United States and the United  States v. Watkins, the Court has been called--there are disputes about  subpoenas. They are not specifically in the impeachment context, but  they establish the general rule, a principle, that whenever a committee  of either body of Congress issues a subpoena to someone and that person  resists the subpoena, the courts will examine what was the authority of  that committee or subcommittee to issue that subpoena.   It has to be traced back to some authorizing rule or resolution from  the House of Representatives itself, for example, in a House  subcommittee. And the courts will examine--the Supreme Court has made  clear that that is the charter of the committee's authority. It gets  its authority solely from an action by the House itself. That requires  [[Page S657]]  a vote of the House, either to establish the committee by resolution or  to establish by rule the standing authority of that committee. And if  the committee cannot trace its authority to a rule or a resolution from  the House, then its subpoena is invalid.   The Supreme Court made clear in those cases those subpoenas are null  and void because they are ultra vires; they are beyond the power of the  committee to issue. They can't be enforced. Our point here is very  simple. There is no standing rule in the House that provides the  committees that were issuing subpoenas here, under the leadership of  Manager Schiff, the authority to use the impeachment power to issue  subpoenas. Rule 10 of the House defines the legislative jurisdiction of  committees. It doesn't mention the word ``impeachment'' even once. So  no committee under rule 10 was given the authority to issue subpoenas  for impeachment purposes.   This has always been the case in every Presidential impeachment in  the history of the Nation. There has always been a resolution from the  House, first, to authorize a committee to use the power of impeachment  before it intended to issue compulsory process. So in this case, there  was no resolution from the House. The authority, the sole power of  impeachment, remained with the House of Representatives itself. And  Speaker Pelosi, by herself, did not have authority merely by talking to  a group of reporters on September 24, to give the powers of the House  to any particular committee to start issuing subpoenas. So the  subpoenas that were issued were invalid when they were issued.   And then 5 weeks later, on October 31, when the House finally adopted  H. Res. 660, that authorized from that point--purported to authorize  from that point the issuance of subpoenas. Nothing in that resolution  addressed the subpoenas that had already been issued. It didn't even  attempt or purport to say the ones that have already been issued, we  are going to try to retroactively give authority to that. It is a  separate question about whether that could have been done legally. They  didn't even attempt to do it.   This is all explained in the opinion from the Office of Legal  Counsel, which is in our trial memorandum attached as appendix C. It is  a very detailed and thorough opinion; it is 37 pages of legal  reasoning, but it explains all of this, the basic principle that  applies, generally, and the history that it has always been done this  way. There has always, in every Presidential impeachment, been an  authorizing resolution from the House. And the fact that there was none  here--so there was no authority for those subpoenas--that means that 23  subpoenas that were issued were invalid.   And this was explained, as I pointed out the other day, in letters  from the administration to the committees--a letter from the White  House, from OMB, I think the State Department--and in very specific  terms, they set out this rationale. That is the basis on which those  subpoenas were invalid, and they were properly resisted by the  administration.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Pennsylvania.
