 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and work of Champaign Police Officer Chris Oberheim.   Our communities in Illinois and across the Nation continue to mourn  the loss of this fallen hero.   Officer Oberheim was called home to be with the Lord on May 19, 2021.  Officer Oberheim was on duty when he was shot and killed while  attempting to protect a mother and her children.   Officer Oberheim put his life on the line and made the ultimate  sacrifice. As Champaign Police Chief Anthony Cobb stated, the debt of  gratitude we owe Officer Oberheim and his family goes beyond written  and spoken word.   Throughout his career, Officer Oberheim put the people of his  community first, and he was a true credit to the badge he wore,  receiving two medals of valor for courageous acts of selfless bravery,  as well as countless letters of accommodation.   Officer Oberheim's life and service will not and should not be  forgotten. My prayers are with his wife, Amber, as well as his four  daughters, Hannah, Avery, Addison, and Aubrey.   I had the great honor of speaking with Amber Oberheim, a devoted wife  and a strong woman of faith. She told me that her husband had a  servant's heart. His life revolved around his family and protecting  others.   Chris was a son, brother, coach, friend, and leader, but his family  was his first priority.   To honor her husband, Amber Oberheim wants to create change. She  started a foundation, Peacemaker Project 703, to support brothers and  sisters in blue. Amber's goal is to promote the support of our law  enforcement officers and their families and to shine a light on their  service and sacrifice.   These are dangerous times. Please love and appreciate our officers.  May God bless the Oberheim family.                            ____________________
