 Madam Speaker, I would like to, today,  recognize the historic feat from a team of boys aged 11 to 13 in my  district.   The Roberto Clemente Little League of Humboldt Park in Chicago made  history on Monday, July 15, by becoming Illinois champions and  advancing to the regionals. They are the first Little League team from  Humboldt Park to ever qualify and represent the city and the State of  Illinois. It is exciting to know that these kids have a real chance of  making it to the Little League World Series.   As a father, grandfather, and an avid baseball fan, their achievement  makes me extremely proud. They are showing us the power of sports and  community, and I would like to congratulate them, their coaches, and  their families, for their determination.   The Roberto Clemente Little League of Humboldt Park is bringing a lot  of joy and pride to the Fourth Congressional District and the State of  Illinois, and they are just getting started.   Go Roberto Clemente Little Leaguers.                            ____________________
