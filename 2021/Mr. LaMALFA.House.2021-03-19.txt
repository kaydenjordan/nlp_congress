 Madam Speaker, last year Portland, Oregon, cut $16  million from their police budget. This has led to a twenty-fold  increase, unfortunately, in deadly shootings. Mayor Wheeler has been  forced to reverse course now and ask for more funding for police.   Similar to this, the Biden administration is having to reverse course  due to the crisis on the border. Now, many are getting hung up on using  the word ``crisis,'' so FEMA is now involved, and they deal with  disasters, hence, the Biden border disaster.   Less than 2 months in, the border is worse than it has been in two  decades. And now, Biden has been forced to reverse course and ask  Mexico to help control the flow of migrants once again, after  previously dismantling the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy.   Also, on his first day in the Biden administration, they issued a  proclamation to halt all border construction, despite Congress funding  it and demanding that it be built. Now, just yesterday, the  administration has said it was moving forward with border wall  construction. Good.   As they are learning in Portland, Seattle, and Minneapolis, the Biden  administration is learning law and order is also required on our border  or you get a disaster.                            ____________________
