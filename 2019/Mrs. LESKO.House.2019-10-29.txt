 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Shalala for yielding  me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, energy and mining are critical drivers of the American  economy and quality of life. These industries create thousands of well- paying jobs.   The United States cannot reach or sustain our potential without  developing our natural resources. But, today, we are debating three  bills that put American energy, American quality of life, and American  national security at risk.   It seems just yesterday that I was here at this very same podium  speaking much of these same words. In fact, it was just last month. At  that time, I spoke out against bills banning offshore drilling.   Now this majority wants to pass sweeping bans on even more domestic  natural resources. This time they want to ban American energy from  Colorado, New Mexico, and my home State of Arizona.   As I said last month, they want to ban it all; and American families,  including Arizona families, will pay the price.                                time  1230    H.R. 823 withdraws areas in Colorado from mineral development. This  bill particularly impacts its Third Congressional District, represented  by Congressman Scott Tipton. Sixty-five percent of the lands affected  by this bill are in his district, yet, this bill does not have his  support, nor the support of any of the Republican members of the  Colorado delegation.   Similarly, H.R. 2181 withdraws Federal lands in New Mexico from  resource development. It also terminates all non-producing oil and gas  leases on those lands.   Finally, H.R. 1373, I believe, is a misleadingly-titled land grab  that deals with land far outside the Grand Canyon. I believe it is  deeply misguided.   Arizona currently produces $6.6 billion in nonfuel minerals, which  makes it the second largest State in the production of minerals in the  United States. Yet, this bill would permanently lock up about 1 million  acres of public lands in Arizona, hampering the economic potential of  my State.   The area impacted by this bill also contains the largest tract of  uranium deposits in the country. Restricting access to these deposits  puts our national security at risk because we have to rely on foreign  countries to provide us uranium.   It is also important to note that much of the lands affected by this  bill are in Arizona's Fourth Congressional District, represented by my  good friend, Congressman Gosar. Yet, Mr. Gosar has expressed very clear  opposition to this bill.   These three bills ignore the economic benefits of domestic energy  production. Energy development brings high-paying jobs, facilitates  manufacturing and investment, and provides government revenues. Energy  development in the United States also makes energy more affordable for  everyone.   The average salary paid in the natural gas and oil development fields  is $113,000 a year; and the energy industry supports 300,000 jobs.   Domestic oil production has allowed Americans to spend 28 percent  less in fuel, resulting in nearly $1,000 in savings per family in 2017  alone. To my constituents, that is a lot of money.   I believe in an all-of-the-above energy approach. In my home State of  Arizona, this is a reality and a necessity. We have to rely on multiple  and diverse energy sources to ensure affordable and reliable energy.   I support nuclear, hydroelectric, coal, sun, wind, and other  alternative sources, and I also support domestic oil and natural gas  production.   An all-of-the-above approach, like that in Arizona, would benefit  American families and their quality of life.   In contrast, the bans that the Democrats propose would harm the U.S.  economy, threaten our national security, and increase energy prices and  rates on consumers.   I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to make in order a resolution to prevent any moratorium on the use  of hydraulic fracking on Federal lands unless authorized by Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record the  text of my amendment, along with extraneous material, immediately prior  to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, this resolution would affirm that States  should maintain primacy for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and  prevent any President from imposing a ban on hydraulic fracturing.   In recent weeks, many of the Democratic candidates for President have  pledged to ban hydraulic fracturing in the United States, a campaign  promise straight out of the ``keep it in the ground'' playbook.   While this widely-used practice is often vilified by extreme  environmentalists and proponents of the Green New Deal, in fact,  hydraulic fracturing is heavily regulated by the States and governed by  stringent industry standards throughout the country.   American households and businesses have benefited significantly from  the shale gas revolution. After the introduction of hydraulic  fracturing techniques, U.S. gas bills fell by $13 billion collectively  every year from 2007-2013.   All the while, natural gas production using fracking is driving  emissions reductions, resulting in the lowest emission levels in a  generation. In fact, methane emissions have decreased 15 percent since  1990 as natural gas production increased over 50 percent.   Thanks to hydraulic fracturing, the U.S. is leading the way in  emissions reductions through innovation in the energy sector. In 2017,  U.S. carbon emissions reached the lowest level since 1992, and per  capita emissions reached the lowest level since 1950.   Also, banning domestic oil and gas production will return the U.S. to  a time when we relied on foreign countries for oil and gas. Remember  the 1970s? We do not want to put our country in a national security  risk.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, the bills before us today are harmful to  American jobs, American quality of life, and American security. The  message underlying these bills is the false notion that domestic energy  production is harmful.   I cannot disagree more. Domestic energy production creates hundreds  of thousands of well-paying jobs, lowers electricity bills, and  prevents us from being dependent on foreign actors.   Utilizing America's natural resources is a commonsense step for  America's energy future. America must be able to utilize its natural  resources for our economy and for our national security. We should  encourage an expansion of domestic energy production, but, instead, my  Democrat colleagues in the majority seek to limit them.    Mr. Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
