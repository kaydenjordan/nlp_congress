 Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman McCollum  for her leadership in bringing forward a proposal that protects and  preserves public lands, ensures access to clean air and drinking water,  and combats climate change.   I am especially pleased to see this bill's $90 million investment for  the first time in Sewer Overflow Control Grants to control and treat  sewer overflows and to help address the water infrastructure crisis our  country faces.   My amendment prioritizes grant funding from Macomb County's Chapaton  Retention Basin and other such sewer overflow systems that help protect  the water sources our communities rely on every day. This funding will  help make urgent water quality improvements to Lake St. Clair, to the  Great Lakes, and to freshwater bodies all across our country.   Mr. Chair, I would also like to thank the former distinguished Member  of this body and the current Macomb County Public Works Commissioner,  Candice Miller, for her partnership to make sure we protect Lake St.  Clair.
