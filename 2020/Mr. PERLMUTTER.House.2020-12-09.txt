 Mr. Speaker, I rise for a couple of purposes today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of Rob Strain, a friend  and constituent who is retiring as president of Ball Aerospace,  headquartered in Colorado.   Rob first joined Ball Aerospace in 2012, after serving as director of  NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. At Goddard, Rob's strong oversight  and leadership skills contributed to the success of more than 13  missions, as he was able to blend technical and programmatic solutions  while under intense congressional and agency scrutiny.   Rob has a hands-on managerial style and a collaborative nature, which  makes him a critical contributor on mission teams and not just the  person in charge.   Rob helped devise and execute a smooth transition from the flawed  tri-agency NPOESS program for the Nation's next-generation polar  weather satellites to the NASA/NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System, JPSS,  based at Goddard to ensure the continuity of these critical weather  satellite observations. The significance of his thoughtful, effective  leadership during the program's transition cannot be overstated.   Rob also served a key role for the final space shuttle servicing  mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. The mission encountered a major  programmatic challenge from a prelaunch computer failure 1 month before  the scheduled launch. In this ``failure is not an option'' moment, Rob  brought together the government and industry expertise to fix the  problem, ensured the team stayed on track, and minimized scheduled  impacts. The result was a successful servicing mission, extending  Hubble's incredible contributions to our scientific community as we  approach 31 years in service.   Prior to joining NASA, Rob led the Space Department of the Johns  Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where he was integral to the  successful development, launch, and operations of the New Horizons  spacecraft to Pluto. New Horizons overcame numerous technical and  instrument availability issues to meet an extremely tight planetary  launch window and successfully flew by Pluto in 2015.   Through his career at Ball Aerospace, Rob has been a strong champion  for diversity and inclusion across his teams and empowering all members  of the team to be themselves and contribute to the success of the  business and the mission. Despite the success Rob has achieved in his  career, he remains an incredibly approachable and humble person. Rob  remains accessible to individuals at all career levels, actively  seeking their input and making them feel valued.   Rob, I will miss your dry sense of humor, which often brought levity  to serious meetings and tense situations. Thank you for your friendship  and your work on behalf of the aerospace community, Colorado, and the  Nation. I wish you the best in your retirement.                                time  1030                          Election Results Were Fair     Mr. Speaker, the second purpose I rise today is to  respond to one of my friends who is questioning the validity of the  election. He couldn't be more wrong. The gentleman from Alabama and I  work on legislation together. We cosponsored a bill that was just  signed. But with respect to his allegations and the allegations of  attorneys that there has been major fraud in this election, I can tell  you that they couldn't be more wrong. There is not a shred of evidence.   I would say to my friend, under the Constitution--under Article I,  Section 1.4--the States are in charge of their elections. And under the  section concerning the Presidency, Article II, Section 4, we choose  when we hear from the electors of the electoral college--which will be  January 6. But citing a New York Post article of an unnamed Democrat,  who supposedly is an expert in elections, certainly is not evidence.   In the cases across the country, there has been no evidence, and case  after case has been thrown out, as they deserve to be thrown out. In  fact, the Supreme Court just threw out a case yesterday concerning  claims against Pennsylvania and its election process.   Mr. Speaker, I don't understand how these attorneys can bring these  cases without facing sanctions by the various courts for bringing  frivolous, vexatious, and abusive litigation. This election was fair.  There have been many instances where they are trying to find some level  of fraud. No fraud has been found. Joe Biden is the President-elect,  and we will make him President on January 20, when the inauguration  occurs.                            ____________________
