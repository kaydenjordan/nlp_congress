 HORN of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)    HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on the  issue of healthcare in Oklahoma. I hear from far too many Oklahomans  who can't afford the healthcare they need.   Today, Oklahoma has the second highest rate of uninsured people in  the Nation. Our State ranks 48th for uninsured children. We cannot  continue to let Oklahomans fall through the cracks of our healthcare  system.   The answer to solving our State's healthcare crisis is  straightforward. We must expand Medicaid. By not expanding Medicaid,  Oklahoma has lost up to $1 billion per year. Seven hospitals across our  State have closed, in part because we did not accept the healthcare  support our State is entitled to.   Expanding Medicaid in Oklahoma would extend health insurance to up to  200,000 Oklahomans who don't currently have insurance. It is the right  choice for our State. Instead, the administration and our Governor are  proposing an alternative plan to turn SoonerCare into a block grant  program.    The plan to block grant Medicaid would encourage cuts to healthcare  services, restrict access to healthcare providers and lifesaving  medications, and contribute to hospital closures. Too often, block  grants have often been misused for political pet projects and to fill  holes in the budget.   While we are still learning the specifics of the block grant plan,  here is what we do know: more than 500,000 children rely on SoonerCare,  and their insurance would be threatened by the plan to cap and slash  Medicaid. Enough is enough.                            ____________________
