 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my thanks to the people  of the 19th Congressional District for giving me the honor of serving  them in the House over these past 2 years.   I ran for Congress focused on how I could make a difference for the  people of our district. It is no secret that upstate New York has been  in a long, protracted period of economic decline, with many families  and businesses choosing to leave due to high taxes and few employment  opportunities.   As such, my focus upon taking office was how we can make upstate more  economically competitive while, at the same time, making sure that our  citizens, businesses, and local governments have an active voice  representing their interests before the Federal Government.   I listened to the people across the district--firefighters and  emergency responders, law enforcement, educators, business owners, and  average working families--who told me of the issues that we face: the  opioid crisis, the highest property taxes in the Nation, the exodus of  people and jobs from upstate New York.   A primary focus of mine was the opioid crisis. This issue has  devastated and destroyed countless lives across our Nation. I was  pleased to have become the primary sponsor of legislation in the House.  Working with my colleague from Michigan,  Mike Bishop, we successfully  enacted major opioid legislation, which included the STOP Act.   This legislation will crack down on the flow of illegal drugs, such  as fentanyl, coming into the U.S. from places like China through the  U.S. Postal Service. The STOP Act is now law, and I am proud to have  had a role in its passage.   Agriculture is another major concern in the 19th District. Serving on  the House Agriculture Committee, we have lowered the cost and increased  the flexibility of dairy risk management programs, fought for better  documentation to protect the sanctity of organic agriculture, made it  easier for veterans to transition into agriculture, and supported  increased broadband and cell service, which is critically important in  our rural areas.   I have also led on two initiatives which are critical to the economic  health of upstate New York. My legislation, offered with other members  of the New York delegation, would finally have ended our State's policy  of imposing a share of Medicaid costs from Albany onto local property  taxpayers.  [[Page H10109]]  This mandate is so significant that just the county government  taxpayers in New York State pay more in State-mandated Medicaid costs  than local taxpayers in the 49 other States combined.    People are fleeing upstate New York because of high property taxes,  and New York's Medicaid mandate is one of the reasons for that exodus.   The second initiative which I advanced was to preempt the absolute  liability standard for gravity-related construction site accidents on  federally funded projects. Again, New York stands alone among the 50  States in this absolute liability standard.   The fact is, this standard doesn't protect workers and adds  approximately 7 percent to the cost of every building project in our  State. With multi-billion-dollar projects like Gateway needing Federal  support, it is critical that we use the preemption power to finally end  this waste of taxpayer dollars and use those savings to rebuild and  repair more infrastructure.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I must comment on the state of our political  discourse in the United States. We all need to renew our efforts to  conduct our debates on public issues in a civil and respectful fashion.   There is no doubt that the fragmented media and a general decline of  standards has coarsened our public debate. There is plenty of blame to  go around for this situation.   I encourage all those who hold elected office to recognize that we  hold a sacred trust from the American people. We should uphold this  responsibility in an honorable and dignified fashion and renew our  efforts to improve the quality of public debate in the United States.   In doing so, we will renew our commitment to make a more perfect  union. Moreover, we will give honor to those who have sacrificed to win  and maintain these freedoms which we cherish.   The Constitution is forever our guide, and we should always remain  true to it. We must also continue to promote individual liberty, the  rule of law, and the dignity of all of our citizens. These are the  characteristics of America that make ours a truly great Nation.   May God continue to bless the United States of America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership and I  thank the ranking member for his leadership on this legislation.   The conference report provides much needed resources that will help  farmers cope with a 5-year, 50 percent collapse in the farm economy,  the largest such drop since the Great Depression.   During this process, we have acted in a bipartisan fashion to fix  broken government programs that have not worked as intended and left  farmers with nowhere to turn.   In upstate New York, perhaps none are hurting more than our local  dairy farmers. New York is the third largest dairy State, and our  farmers are hurting. The current dairy programs do not work, and  improvements to the farm bill combined with those in the bipartisan  Budget Act from earlier this year will help our farmers weather the  storm.   We have made the dairy safety net more flexible by increasing  coverage options, more affordable by reducing premiums, and more  enticing for participation by bringing more incentives for those  farmers to participate.   We have also worked to protect the SNAP program and laid the  groundwork for future Congresses to make additional changes. By  incentivizing work through better local workforce consultation and  reducing the number of waivers that States can bring, we can bring more  recipients into the workforce during a time of record low unemployment.   Additionally, changes like the National Accuracy Clearing House and  minimum standards for participant tracking will help enhance program  integrity and ensure that benefits are available to those that need  them most.    Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the farm bill. Upstate New York and  our farmers have waited long enough. I am proud to support this  legislation.
