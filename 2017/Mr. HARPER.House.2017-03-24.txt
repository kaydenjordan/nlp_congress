 Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare has failed. Contrary to what was  promised, premiums have gone up and there are fewer health insurance  options. This bill addresses a crisis that before now had no end in  sight.   Not only does this bill work to solve the problems we see in the  private insurance market, it addresses one of our Nation's most vital  programs--Medicaid. This program is a critical lifeline for hundreds of  thousands of Mississippians.   Medicaid is a safety net program that was designed for children, the  elderly, pregnant mothers, and the disabled. This bill will refocus  attention back on the program's initial goals, but will modernize it to  better serve these patients.   We should move decisionmaking authority down to those who are best  positioned to address these problems. A program run primarily by the  States with assistance from the Federal Government will best be able to  help those who need it most.   By giving States more tools to address costs, this bill will allow  States to explore ways to make accepting Medicaid more attractive to  providers, leading to better health outcomes. Without addressing the  current problems facing the Medicaid program, it will not survive. This  bill puts Medicaid on a path to sustainability. An insolvent safety net  will harm those it intends to help.   This is our moment. We have a historic opportunity to enact the  biggest entitlement reform in our lifetime. We have a chance to save  Medicaid.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.
