 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the Day of  the Deployed to honor the men and women of our Armed Forces who are  serving overseas.   Today we salute them for their service on behalf of the United States  of America. We also acknowledge the sacrifice of their families, who  are separated from their loved ones during deployment.  [[Page H8258]]    Mr. Speaker, serving one's country is a noble and selfless act. These  men and women have answered the call of duty, and today we honor their  dedication, service, and courage.   In 2016, there were nearly 1.3 million Active Duty military  personnel. Nearly 200,000 of those Active Duty members are deployed  overseas. From Japan to Germany, and from South Korea to Afghanistan,  our American men and women serve with distinction.   In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, more than 50 airmen from the  193rd Special Operations Wing are scheduled to return home this week  following an overseas deployment in support of Operation Inherent  Resolve.   Mr. Speaker, I would like all of our deployed troops to know that we  are proud of their efforts and are grateful for their service.                            ____________________
