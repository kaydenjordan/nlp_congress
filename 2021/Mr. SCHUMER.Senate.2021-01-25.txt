 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week, the Senate will continue  confirming President Biden's highly qualified and history-making  nominees.   In a few hours we will hold a vote on Janet Yellen to serve as the  next Secretary of the Treasury. Janet Yellen, of course, is no stranger  to this Chamber. She has been confirmed by the Senate no fewer than  four times and was reported favorably to the floor by a unanimous vote  of the Finance Committee on Friday.   The bipartisan support of Ms. Yellen's multiple nominations reflects  her breathtaking range of experience and just how well suited she is to  manage the economic challenges of our time. Ms. Yellen, I am proud to  report, is a native of working-class Brooklyn, the daughter of a  schoolteacher and physician, raised during the Great Depression. She  went to Fort Hamilton High School, one of James Madison High School's  rivals. A graduate of Brown and Yale, Ms. Yellen has taught economics  at some of the world's most prestigious universities. Of course, Janet  Yellen is best known for her tenure as Chair of the Federal Reserve,  overseeing a period of falling unemployment and steady economic  recovery from the global financial crisis.   Few people possess the experience and expertise that Ms. Yellen would  bring to the Treasury, particularly during this moment of economic  crisis. At the Treasury Department, there are long hallways on the  third floor where the portraits of all 77 Treasury Secretaries hang-- all of them men, all the way back to Alexander Hamilton, the first  Secretary. I am thrilled today to vote to confirm the first woman to  ever hold the position of Treasury Secretary and someday add her  portrait to that hallway.   On that note, I would add it was a great pleasure to read the Biden  administration's announcement today that the Treasury Department plans  to speed up the plans to add the portrait of Harriet Tubman to the $20  bill. This is an issue I have long championed and something that should  have been done a long time ago. I feel particularly strong about it  since Harriet Tubman was an Auburn, NY, resident, and our office worked  for years to successfully make her home in Upstate New York a national  historic monument.   I am glad the Biden administration is reversing the Trump  administration's foot-dragging. It is the kind of thing they did--no  excuse, no reason, just didn't do it. But now the Biden administration  is reversing the Trump administration's foot-dragging and will press  forward with plans to circulate new currency celebrating Harriet  Tubman's life and legacy.   After Ms. Yellen's confirmation tonight, the Senate will continue to  process nominations to President Biden's Cabinet for the Secretaries of  State, Homeland Security, and Transportation. With cooperation, the  Senate could complete both confirmations this week. Again, those are  the Secretaries of State, Homeland Security, and Transportation, in  addition to Treasury this evening.   I remind my colleagues that President Trump had his Secretary of  Homeland Security installed on Inauguration Day. We cannot allow our  national security and our domestic security to be compromised in any  way by the prolonged delay of Mr. Mayorkas' nomination                            ____________________     Madam President, as I announced on Friday, the  Republican leader and I have come to an initial agreement about the  timing of the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. This evening, managers  appointed by the House of Representatives will deliver  [[Page S114]]  to the Senate the Article of Impeachment and will read the article here  in the well of this Chamber.   Tomorrow, Senators will be sworn in as judges and jurors in the  impending trial, and the Senate will issue a summons to former  President Trump. After that, both the House managers and the former  President's counsel will have a period of time to draft their legal  briefs, just as they did in previous trials. Once the briefs are  drafted, presentations by the parties will commence the week of  February 8.   I want to thank the Republican leader for working with us to reach  this agreement, which we believe is fair to both sides and will enable  the Senate to conduct a timely and fair trial on the Article of  Impeachment. The schedule will also allow us to continue the important  work of the people, including confirming more members of President  Biden's Cabinet.   I want to be very clear about that last point. The Senate will  conduct a timely and fair trial.   I want to be very clear about that because some of my Republican  colleagues have latched on to a fringe legal theory that the Senate  does not have the constitutional power to hold the trial because Donald  Trump is no longer in office. This argument has been roundly debunked  by constitutional scholars from the left, right, and center. It defies  precedent, historic practice, and basic common sense. It makes no sense  whatsoever that a President--or any official--could commit a heinous  crime against our country and then defeat Congress's impeachment powers  by simply resigning so as to avoid accountability and a vote to  disqualify them from future office.   This is not merely a hypothetical situation. In 1876, President  Grant's Secretary of War, William Belknap, implicated in a corruption  scheme, literally raced to the White House to tender his resignation  mere minutes before the House was set to vote on his impeachment. Then,  as a matter of historical record, he burst into tears. Not only did the  House move forward with the five impeachment articles against him, but  a trial was then convened in the Senate.   Of course, the question came up as to whether the Senate could try  former officials, and guess what. The Senate voted as a Chamber that  Mr. Belknap could be tried ``for acts done as Secretary of War,  notwithstanding his resignation of said office.''   Those are the words of the Senate vote in 1876.   Mr. Belknap was ultimately acquitted, but the record is clear. The  Senate has the power to try former officials, and the reasons are  obvious. A President or any official, for example, could wait until  their final 2 weeks in office to betray their country, knowing they  could escape accountability or merely resign moments before the Senate  decides to convict and disqualify them from future office. The theory  that the Senate cannot try former officials would amount to a  constitutional get-out-of-jail-free card for any President who commits  an impeachable offense.   Now, it is certainly appropriate for the Senate to take the  resignation of an official into account. After all, the House decided  not to impeach Richard Nixon because, in that sense, Nixon took some  responsibility for his actions. But to state the obvious, President  Trump did not resign. He has not demonstrated remorse. He has not even  acknowledged his role in the events of January 6, and he has never  disavowed the lies that were fed to the American people by him about  who actually won the election.   Just to put a final nail into the coffin of this ridiculous theory, I  remind my colleagues, if a President is convicted on an Article of  Impeachment, the Senate holds a separate vote on whether to bar them  from future office. Once a President is convicted of an impeachment  charge, they are removed from office. In other words, they become a  former official. If we are to believe that the Senate can't hold former  officials to account, then the Senate could never proceed to that  second vote of disqualification, which is provided for in the  Constitution, even for a sitting President.   In saying this, I am expressing the view of legal scholars across the  political spectrum. Stephen Vladeck, a prominent constitutional expert  at the University of Texas, wrote in the New York Times that Donald  Trump is the ``poster child'' for why the conviction of an ex-President  is not just constitutionally permissible but necessary. More than 150  legal scholars signed a letter last week forcefully stating that an  impeachment trial of a former President is constitutional. Among the  signatories, one of the cofounders of the Federalist Society, as well  as one of President Reagan's Solicitors General, among other prominent  conservatives.   It is so obviously wrong to suggest that impeaching the President is  unconstitutional--that impeaching a former President is  unconstitutional. So why are some suggesting it?   Well, there seems to be a desire on the political right to avoid  passing judgment, one way or the other, on former President Trump and  his role in fomenting the despicable attack on the Capitol on January  6. There seems to be some hope that Republicans could oppose the former  President's impeachment on process grounds, rather than grappling with  his actual awful conduct.   Let me be very clear. This is not going to fly. The trial is going to  happen. It is certainly and clearly constitutional, and if the former  President is convicted, there will be a vote to disqualify him from  future office.   There is only one question at stake--only one question that Senators  of both parties will have to answer before God and their own  conscience: Is former President Trump guilty of inciting an  insurrection against the United States?   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The hour of 7 p.m. having arrived, the Acting Sergeant at Arms will  present the managers on the part of the House of Representatives.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding Rule III of the Senate Rules of Impeachment, at 2:30  p.m. tomorrow, January 26, 2021, the Senate proceed to the  consideration of the Article of Impeachment of Donald John Trump,  former President of the United States.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 15, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to  and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, for the information of all Senators,  there will be a live quorum at 2:15 p.m.; Senators are asked to report  to the floor at that time; at 2:30, the oath will be administered to  the Presiding Officer and Members of the Senate for the impeachment  trial of Donald John Trump, former President of the United States.                            ____________________     If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, at 8:06 p.m., the Senate adjourned until  Tuesday, January 26, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
