 Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge President Biden to move  quickly and comprehensively to restore U.S.-Cuban relations.   The last 2 years of the Obama administration saw an explosion of  positive change in Cuba. The fledgling Cuban private sector flourished.  Innovation, the internet, communications, and political space expanded.  And exchanges between our two peoples multiplied.   Official cooperation advanced significantly on law enforcement,  antinarcotics, migration, human trafficking, and the environment.  Dialogues began on tough topics like economic reform and human rights.   Tragically, these advances were wiped out by President Trump. Today,  we need strong, levelheaded leadership capable of rebuilding trust,  navigating a return to normal relations, and advancing U.S. interests.   We need to immediately end restrictions on travel; remittances;  financial transactions; and educational, scientific, environmental, and  cultural exchange.   We must remove Cuba again from the state sponsors of terrorism list  and rescind any sanction that impedes the delivery of humanitarian aid.   Let's not make the mistake of moving slowly and incrementally. We  need to act now. I call on the Biden administration to make this a  priority.                            ____________________
