 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the  Musser family of Michigan for nearly nine decades of outstanding  tradition and service at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island in  Michigan's beautiful First District.   The famous ``world's largest front porch'' has welcomed five sitting  U.S. Presidents, thousands of dignitaries, business leaders, movie  stars, and over 150,000 guests each season.   The rich traditions of the Grand Hotel are world-renowned and have  set the standards in the tourism industry for almost a century.   I personally congratulate my friend Dan Musser on 30 years of  exceptional service as the president of the Grand and wish him and his  wife, Marlee, and his sister, Mimi Cunningham, all the best as they  pass the torch and set out on new adventures.                            ____________________
