 Madam President, thank you to the people of Colorado for  this incredible honor that you have lent to me these last 6 years to  serve you in the U.S. Senate.  [[Page S7258]]    Thank you to my family--Jaime, Alyson, Caitlyn, Thatcher, to Mom and  Dad and Lisa--who supported me in this last decade of service with your  love and sacrifice, through missed ball games and lost teeth, school  concerts and junior high dances, sore throats and first moments.   Thank you to my incredible staff, many in the Chamber today, who are  in Colorado and Washington, who made so many great things happen and  whose difference will be felt for generations to come. You leave a mark  on the country far beyond the etching of a signature on a desk on the  floor.   Thank you to my colleagues and to Senator Bennet for the honor of  serving along your side and for your commitment to our Nation--and to  the Capitol Police, the staff, to the support staff in the Senate who  make it all possible.   But above all, and most importantly, thank you to this great and  extraordinary Nation for all that it means and represents--the hope and  optimism that for over two centuries has led people around the globe to  give up everything they have just to be here; to be a part of this  Nation, to then turn around and fight for it through political strife  and pandemics; to go to war to save the Union; to know how lucky and  blessed that we are that out of all of the billions of people through  the thousands of years of human history, we have had the privilege of  being here in this place at this point to be a part of it.   There has been a lot of coverage in the news lately about how the  pollsters got it wrong. But one thing they seem to get right--and it  won't come as a shock to my colleagues on the floor: Congress is about  as popular as a Rocky Mountain oyster in a bullpen.   We have been, together, able to do many good things, and I hope that  we can use those successes to drive even more successes and show the  American people that faith in this institution is actually well  deserved.   Over the last 6 years I have worked hard to pass the first-ever  mandatory sanctions on Kim Jong Un and North Korea to denuclearize that  regime. It was an honor to work with Senator Menendez throughout this  process.   Senator Markey and I led the passage of the first-ever comprehensive  strategy for a free and open Indo-Pacific, the Asia Reassurance  Initiative.   Gary Peters, along with Lamar Alexander and me, led the  reauthorization of the America Competes legislation to keep the United  States competitive in science and engineering, to get more women and  minorities into the STEM fields, and to advance our scientific research  and discoveries.   The 988 suicide prevention bill that Tammy Baldwin and I were able to  pass into law represents the first bill in American history to pass the  Senate and House unanimously with LGBTQ-specific language. This bill  will save lives.   I was honored to help move the Bureau of Land Management headquarters  to Colorado and to finally get funding for the construction of the  Arkansas Valley Conduit, and I helped lead the passage of legislation  to complete our VA hospital in Colorado, to advance our cybersecurity,  and to foster our relationships with Taiwan, South Korea, and beyond.   And it was an honor of my time in the Senate to work with Lamar and  Senators Manchin, Cantwell, Heinrich, Warner, King, Portman, Daines,  and Burr on the Great American Outdoors Act, the holy grail of  conservation legislation.   In my first remarks on the Senate floor, I spoke about how no matter  where across Colorado's four corners that you live--or across this  great Nation--we all hope for the same thing for our children: to live  in a loving home that values every citizen; that they learn the value  of hard work and perseverance; where hard work is met with merited  reward; that they find a nation of liberty and freedom that they help  make a little bit more free and a little bit more perfect. All of us  here in the Senate, the American people--all of us--are responsible for  the starting point that we hand off to the next generation, and we have  a moral obligation to make it the best starting point possible.   The accomplishments that we have had together truly have helped  create more opportunity for the next generation, and the work that we  continue to do to get through this pandemic together will ensure that  the next generation can indeed take advantage of those accomplishments  and that the starting point for them is better than the generation past  despite the struggles of today. You know, in Sunday school we learned  an important lesson about this--that struggles and tribulation produce  perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.   And since that very first speech that I gave on the Senate floor, I  have come to recognize something that all of us--that everyone here-- has undoubtedly experienced--that our service to country is filled with  moment after moment that gives us that lump in the throat, that brings  a tear to our eyes, that fills our hearts with wonder for this Nation.   Perhaps it happened to you when seeing the majesty of the United  States Capitol brightly shining in all its glory on a crisp State of  the Union Address night or maybe when we hear the passion in the voices  of our colleagues as they tell the story of life and struggle and hope  for the future. For me, these moments happen every day, and I am sure  they do for you as well--just part of the wonder of this Nation and its  Capitol.   It was late at night for me nearly 10 years ago when I was leaving  the Capitol building. I had walked through the Hall of Columns, and I  heard some voices ahead near the door that I was heading toward. When I  turned into the corridor, I saw a Capitol tour guide pointing at a  phrase that was painted on the wall. I looked at it and read it too. It  was William Jennings Bryan, and painted on the wall were these words:  ``Our government, conceived in freedom and purchased with blood, can be  preserved only by constant vigilance.''   I looked at the group reading it, and there in the center of them all  was a young veteran in a wheelchair with bandages around his knees  where his legs used to be. The gravity of this place, that moment, and  the duty that we owe to this Nation struck hard.   As I walked home, I kept thinking about it--about those words, about  that moment, about that veteran, about this Nation and our  responsibility. I thought about how that wall was painted with that  phrase, but there are others that are blank and empty, spaces that have  been left empty so that future generations can fill them in with their  history--with new portraits and new phrases and new moments. But no  matter the moment in time or the point in history, it is the same  patriotic responsibility that we owe to this Chamber--to defend and  serve our Nation, her Constitution, and the American people.   George Washington in his Farewell Address said that the name  ``American'' must always exalt the just pride of patriotism. He spoke  of our Constitution and how it must be sacredly maintained and that  virtue and wisdom must stamp every act. And despite the differences  over policy and politics, it is our Union that ought to be considered  as a main prop of our liberty, and that love of the one ought to endear  us to the preservation of the other.   I believe that is what Lamar Alexander very eloquently spoke about on  this very floor in his farewell just days ago. It is our country and  the unity of nation that, despite our differences, will help preserve  and will preserve our liberty.   Washington offered his advice in his farewell as an old and  affectionate friend--a friend who recognized our obligation to create a  better starting point for every new generation   But how do we heed this advice in a world of viral social media,  click bait, and sound bites?   Colorado Senator Bill Armstrong once said that while he was firm in  his principles, he was flexible on the details. We all come to this  place because of our core values and beliefs about this Nation. Those  principles make us who we are. They drive our actions. They drive our  debates. But, today, it seems as though we live in a world where  tactics are elevated to the same status and importance as principles,  and staying true to principle means that the tactics used to achieve  that principle are elevated to the same importance as the principle  itself. It is always my way or the highway. Senator Armstrong's  flexible details would now be derided as violations of principle.  [[Page S7259]]    We cannot govern when every tactic and detail is elevated to the  level of principle. There is no compromise with this approach. We  cannot find ways to bring people together for that unity of nation of  which Washington spoke when the test for principles becomes so  impossible to pass that only the very factions that he warned against  can prevail.   To my staff I often talk about this challenge as being one of the  pillar and the paint. The pillars in a building are more than just  ornamental. They are structurally necessary to the building itself. The  pillars are our principles. They make us who we are. But the paint  color--the details--we can figure that out together.   We can respect the pillar and find agreement on the paint. We can  hold people's principles in place, respecting those core beliefs that  make you who you are, while finding ways to work together to find  solutions to common challenges. That is how we pass the test of unity  that brings people together, respecting principles while achieving  solutions, because not every detail is a principle, and not every  principle is a detail, and we need a legislative body that can  recognize this. By doing so, we will follow through on the advice of  Washington and preserve our liberty with unity of nation.   Too many people have given up on the institutions of their  government, and it is my hope that the American people will find this  pillar-and-paint approach to be one that can make a difference because  if they believe it--they believe that it will--then the American people  will make sure their values are reflected in the representatives they  elect.   Several years ago, I had the honor of meeting a man named Donald  Stratton. He came to my office accompanied by his family and the family  of a sailor named Loren Bruner and the family of another sailor, Joe  George.   They were looking forward to yet another commemoration of the attack  on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941--79 years ago yesterday. Both Donald  Stratton and Loren Bruno were on the USS Arizona when it was attacked.  Donald Stratton was on one of the ship's towers. He was surrounded by  flame and surely believed that he would perish, when out of the chaos  of that morning came a rope thrown by a yet-unknown-to-him sailor by  the name of Joe George, who was aboard the USS Vestal, which was moored  next to the USS Arizona. This rope saved Donald Stratton's life and  several other shipmates.   No one knew their lifeline was thrown to them by Joe George until  years later. Once they learned who it was, they spent the rest of their  lives fighting to get Joe George honored and recognized by the Navy.   I was honored to be a part of that effort, and, finally, on December  7, 2017, led by Donald Stratton and the Arizona's remaining few, Joe  George received the Bronze Star with ``V'' device for valor aboard the  USS Arizona Memorial, with Donald Stratton attending one last time. He  was fighting for this country and his countrymen to the very end.   When I asked him how he did it, how he survived the attack and those  flames and got back into the fight for this Nation, he chuckled, he  laughed, and he gave me an answer that I truly didn't see coming at  all. He said: ``Well, Cory, everybody has to be somewhere.''   Everybody has to be somewhere. He is right. We are here in the U.S.  Senate. Most of you will still be here next Congress. Don't waste this  opportunity to be who this Nation needs you to be at this moment of  great challenge, to recognize the difference between the paint and the  pillar, to know the difference between a principle and a tactic, where  to take a stand and where to stand together, to bring a nation together  in unity for the preservation of liberty, to recognize that to be  American carries with it the greatness of a nation forged by fight and  fire, tempered by wisdom, and made great by men, like Donald Stratton,  who recognized that their duty and their time didn't just end with the  last calling of the roll. Everybody has to be somewhere. Make it count  for this Nation that you are here.   If you go into any of my offices, you will see on the wall my mission  statement, and it ends with this:         We represent a State where the words to ``America the       Beautiful'' were written--we will always look up to the Rocky       Mountain horizon in the work that we do and remind ourselves       that only through our actions will God continue to shed his       grace on our great nation.    Ours is a Nation founded on the optimism that no generation waits for  the next to be told where to go. It is the great American horizon that  compels us to continue to reach ahead, to rise, to achieve, and to  believe in America.   Ten years ago I sat on the floor of the United States House of  Representatives as we prepared--some of my colleagues here with me--to  be sworn into the 112th Congress. I watched with our daughter Alyson  patiently sitting by my side as the peaceful transition of power took  place--the hallmark of our Republic. As the most powerful  constitutionally prescribed Member of the Congress, the Speaker of the  House gave the gavel to a newly elected Speaker without gunshot or war,  peacefully transitioning to a new majority.    Today, I speak on the Senate floor with a heart of gratitude. As I  leave, with a new Congress set to begin, I go home not because of or  due to the threat of violence or revolution but because of the same  constitutional governance that has given this country over two  centuries of strength and certainty--a jewel among nations,  exceptionally blessed by God.   It has been a privilege to serve with you for this country. We owe  every man, woman, and child that lives here our commitment to them to  not pass on to the next generation a nation that is in decline or  retreat but a nation that rises, a nation that reminds itself that ours  is a country worth fighting for, a nation that believes in itself,  because when you believe in America, when you believe in this country,  the world has not seen anything yet.   Thank you to my colleagues. Thank you for the honor of serving with  you.   And, Madam President, this kid from Yuma yields the floor.   (Applause, Senators rising.)
