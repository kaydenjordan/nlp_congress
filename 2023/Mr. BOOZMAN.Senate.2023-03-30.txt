 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Frank  Thomas who is retiring as vice president and assistant to the chairman  at Stephens, Inc., after a long and dedicated career advocating on  behalf of Arkansas. In his 27 years at Stephens, Inc., he was  responsible for a number of duties, including outreach to elected  officials as leader of the government affairs office, but his service  and impact on Arkansas started long before.   Frank first pursued a career in journalism while attending the  University of Arkansas. He served as the student station manager of  KUAF before assuming the role of news director. He went on to work as a  reporter at television and radio stations in Michigan and New York. He  was called to continue serving Arkansans as an adviser to U.S. Senator  David where he served in a number of capacities, including as the  Senator's chief of staff.   In 2019, Frank was inducted into the University of Arkansas's Lemke  Alumni Society's Hall of Honor in recognition of graduates who have  enjoyed distinguished careers in journalism, brought honor and  integrity to their respective communities and contributed to the growth  of the school. Frank's expansive career has given him valuable  experience and a wealth of knowledge that he was kind enough to share  with Arkansas interns interested in serving The Natural State through  my office's summer internship speaker series. Throughout his life, he  has represented the very best of a public servant.   I am grateful for the friendship we have built and for his advice. I  wish Frank and wife Sylvia much happiness as he begins a well-deserved  retirement. I am confident their family, son John, daughter Lauren, and  granddaughter Finley are excited for this next chapter.                            ____________________
