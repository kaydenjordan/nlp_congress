 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, the American people put Democrats in charge to raise  our Nation from its knees--unless we have short memories.   We are putting people over powerful interests. We are rebuilding our  economy for working families. We are providing historically low  healthcare premiums for nearly 12 million Americans, including over  20,000 in my own district of New Jersey.   We are making the single largest investment in clean energy to secure  a livable future. Our planet is at the precipice of catastrophe. So we  are combating climate change and creating 9 million jobs in the  process.   Not bad, Madam Speaker, not bad.   Our bill includes legislation I happen to champion to expand zero- emission nuclear energy and offshore wind, where New Jersey leads the  way. I worked on a bipartisan basis on those two issues, and there is  nothing said today about that by my friends on the other side.   For years, Republicans sabotaged the IRS. The record is clear. They  safeguarded loopholes to help a privileged few pay a pittance in taxes.  And that ends today.   Five years ago, Republicans passed a $2 trillion tax scam for the  rich and the corporate tycoons. Today, we are closing the tax gap and  providing tax fairness.   Democrats are making prescription drugs affordable.   Democrats are lowering healthcare costs.   God bless our great country.
