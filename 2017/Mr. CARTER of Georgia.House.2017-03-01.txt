 First of all, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank  Representative Collins for holding this tonight, for organizing this,  also for his advocacy, and for what he has done to bring about  attention to this very important subject. This, of course, is something  that is very dear to my heart. As the only pharmacist currently serving  in Congress, I take this very seriously. I take that responsibility  very seriously.   But it is more than that because, you see, in my professional life,  for over 30 years, I had the honor of practicing pharmacy. I have built  up relationships over that time, relationships with families and with  patients. When I see what is happening in pharmacy now, it is an  affront. It is an affront to me, and it should be an affront to all  Americans. My heart is in this, truly in this.   In over 30 years of practice, I have built up relationships with  patients and with families. I have served grandparents, I have served  parents, I have served children, and total families. You can only  imagine the hurt that it brings whenever I see these people suffering  because of what has been mentioned here tonight.   Right now, in our country, prescription drug prices are something  that is in the forefront, in the news. There is a problem, a real big  problem, and that problem--yes, the pharmaceutical manufacturers have a  concern here, and they have responsibility. But there is a bigger  problem. It is what I refer to as the man behind the curtain. I wrote  an op-ed about this and talked about the man behind the curtain. That  is the PBMs, the pharmacy benefit managers. I am going to call them out  tonight.   Before I do that, I want to just say something about community  pharmacists because they play such an important and vital role in our  communities. They directly interface and build relationships with  neighbors and friends. I have been there, I have done that, and I  understand how important it is. Representative Collins has spoken about  it, and Representative Loebsack, a friend of pharmacy, has spoken so  many times. He has spoken about it as well. Representative Babin and  Representative Duncan understand how important the community pharmacies  are and how important they are to the healthcare system.   But beneficiaries are facing increased costs for prescription drugs  without much of a basis or notification on why these costs are  skyrocketing. So, very quickly, I want to talk about why these costs  are skyrocketing. Yes, as I said earlier, some of the pharmaceutical  manufacturers need to be held accountable. They do.   I say that, but I also say that I am a big fan of the pharmaceutical  manufacturers. You see, in my over 30 years of practicing pharmacy, I  have seen nothing short of miracles. I can remember when I started  practicing in 1980. I can remember that people would come in to get an  antibiotic and that we would have to dispense 40 capsules and have them  take four a day for 10 days. Now I can give them one capsule, and they  can take it and be done with it. People were going into the hospital  back then to be treated for infections. Now we can treat then. The  advances that we have seen are phenomenal.    We talk about the price of some of these drugs, for instance, the  drug that is used for hepatitis C. Yes, it is too expensive, and that  price has come down significantly. It is only as good as it is  affordable. If it is not accessible, if it is not affordable, then it  is no good. But stop for just one minute, and think about it. We cured  a deadly disease through research and development. The pharmaceutical  manufacturers put some of their profits back into research and  development, which I applaud.   We cured a deadly disease, hepatitis C, that was killing people.  Again, that price needs to come down so that it is more accessible to  people. But, again, we cured it. So I am going to cut the  pharmaceutical manufacturers a little bit of leeway there.   I think it is interesting that the President, in his first month in  office, called the pharmaceutical manufacturers to the White House. He  told them: You got to do something about these escalating drug prices.   He also talked about those people who are on the other side of R&D,  who are on the other side of research and development. He put a notice  out, and he said: You better beware because we're going to be watching  you.   The next day, the stocks of two of the major pharmacy benefit  managers went down. They went down significantly, almost 2 percent,  because they knew what was coming, and they know what is coming now.   First of all, let's talk about the profits of the PBMs. A quick  history, PBMs came about kind of in the mid 1960s, and all they were  was a processor. Their goal and their charge was just to keep up and to  process insurance claims as insurance came about and became more and  more popular to pay for medications. That is all they did.   But over time, they have evolved into more than that. If you look at  what has happened over the past decade, the profits of the three major  PBMs--and Representative Collins alluded to this earlier--you have got  three companies who control almost 80 percent of the market. That is  not good. That is not competition, and that is what we have to have in  health care in order to decrease healthcare costs. It is competition.  When you have three companies that account for almost 80 percent of the  market, that is never good.   But if you look at those three companies and you look at their  profits over the last decade, you will see that they have increased  some 600 percent--billions of dollars. Now, you can make the argument,  well, the pharmaceutical manufacturers, their profits have increased,  too. Yes, they have; and, yes, they should be accountable for that.  However, at least they are bringing value to the system by investing  into research and development.  [[Page H1453]]    PBMs bring no value to the healthcare system at all. They put no  money into research and development. All they do is skim it off the  top. As medications go up in price, they make more. Representative  Collins alluded to spread pricing. That is exactly what he is talking  about, and that is exactly how they are making their money. The more  expensive a drug, the more money the PBM is going to make. That's all  there is to it.   I served on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for the  past session in the 114th Congress. We had a problem with Mylan  Pharmaceuticals and a drug that they had, EpiPen. It went up to $600.  Unbelievable. Here was a drug that is a lifesaving drug that people  have to have for anaphylactic shock. We in Congress actually passed  legislation that required that drug to be on hand in gyms and in  schools in case there was a problem. Yet, they went up to $600.   It was really interesting because, during the time that we were  asking questions of the CEO, she mentioned, well, when it leaves us, it  is this price right here--I am just going to use round figures--it is  $150. By the time it gets to the pharmacist and by the time it is  dispensed to the patient, it is $600.   I asked her: What is that difference there? Where is that coming  from?   I don't know.   I don't know either.   Now, there is the beginning and the end. The beginning is the  pharmaceutical manufacturer. She doesn't know. The end is me, the  dispensing pharmacist, and I don't know.   That is what I'm referring to when I talk about the man behind the  curtain. That is where the PBMs come in.   Now, they will tell you: Well, we are taking that money, and we are  giving it back to the companies, to the insurance.   Well, if they are, and they're not keeping any of it, then why are  their profits going up so much? Why have their profits gone up over 600  percent? It's because they're keeping it. They're keeping it, and  they're adding no value whatsoever to the system.   Now, they will argue the fact, they will say: Well, we are keeping  drug prices down.   Oh, yeah? Well, how is that working out for you? It ain't working out  very well at all because drug prices are going up.   I mentioned the competition, the fact that we have got three  companies that control over 80 percent of the market. That decreases  choices.   We are talking about community pharmacies, and I know that is what  Representative Collins is really wanting to focus on here tonight, and  it is so very important because we have to have community pharmacies.  They are vital to the healthcare system. In many areas, the most  accessible healthcare professional is the pharmacist, particularly in  rural areas. As they go, and as they are eliminated, we are losing a  vital part of the healthcare system.   But PBMs are shutting out a lot of these community pharmacies. I  alluded earlier to the fact that I have served grandparents, parents,  and grandchildren. I've built up those relationships. One of the  toughest things that I have ever faced is for a family member to come  in to me literally in tears and say: I have got to change pharmacies.    I say: Why?   Because my insurance company, because my PBM says that I have to get  it from them through mail order.   Well, why would you have to get it through them through mail order?   Because they own the pharmacy.   Representative Collins alluded earlier about vertical integration,  and that is what we see. The PBM owns the pharmacy that they are  requiring the patient to go to. Well, guess what? That means they are  padding their pocket even more. That is the kind of thing that we  should be protected from.   I will give you a quick story, a true story. Back when I was still  practicing pharmacy and owned my pharmacy, my wife had insurance  through her employer. She had a different insurance plan than I had.  She got her insurance, and she got a prescription filled at my  pharmacy--at my pharmacy. Now, this is the pharmacy benefit manager who  owns the pharmacy. That night when I got home, I got a phone call from  the insurance company saying: Well, your wife got a prescription filled  here at this pharmacy, but if she gets it filled at our pharmacy, we  can give her a lower copay. We can give her a discount.   Now, supposedly there is a firewall in between the PBM and the  pharmacy. Well, guess what? There wasn't that firewall there that  night, not when I got that phone call.                                time  1915    Can you imagine? What is that doing? That is taking patients away  from the community pharmacist. That is unfair business practices. So,  that is what we talk about. Ultimately, who suffers?   I don't want to give the impression I am just here to try to make  sure that community pharmacies stay profitable and make sure that they  stay in business, although it is important. If they don't stay in  business, who is going to suffer? It is going to be the patient. It is  going to be the healthcare system.   Folks, the only thing that is going to bring down costs in our  healthcare system is more competition and free market principles. That  is what we are trying to do now in Congress, through the repeal and the  replacement of the Affordable Care Act.   We understand that we have got to get free market principles back  into the healthcare system. We have got to get competition in order to  drive healthcare costs down. We understand that. This is a big problem,  a big problem.   Very quickly, I want to talk about three bills that are being  proposed. First of all, I want to talk about Representative Collins'  MAC Transparency bill.   Transparency, that means give us an opportunity to see exactly what  is going on. If you mention transparency to a PBM, they go berserk: My  gosh, no, we can't have that. We can't have transparency.   But Representative Collins' bill, the MAC Transparency bill, which I  am proud to be an original cosponsor of, brings about greater  transparency in generic pricing--drug pricing, in general, but  particularly generic.   Many of the recipients don't understand the cost structure. They  don't understand how that works, where the original fees are  originating from, which are often a direct result of the fees that are  leveraged by the PBMs, the prescription drug plan sponsors.   Congressman Collins' bill addresses this issue, and it addresses  more. Under his legislation, a process would be established to help  mediate disputes in drug pricing. It would establish new criteria for  PBMs to adhere to when managing the costs of prescription drug  coverage.   This MAC Transparency bill is a step forward not only for the  industry, but for the beneficiary, and that is what is so very, very  important. It is no surprise that costs are going up. No surprise at  all. With the lack of transparency, that is what is going to happen.   We have got to have greater transparency in the drug pricing system.  And, yes, that includes pharmacy. Yes, that includes the pharmacy; yes,  it includes the pharmaceutical manufacturer; but mostly, it has got to  be with the PBMs.   If we have a CEO of a medication--a pharmaceutical company like Mylan  which we had come up and testify before us here in Congress, and I ask  her about that gap there and where that money is going, if she doesn't  know and I don't know, there is a problem. That means we need more  transparency. And that is exactly what happened.   Now I want to talk about another problem that is called DIR fees,  direct and indirect remuneration. Let me tell you, this will be the  death of community pharmacies.   DIR fees are what they refer to as clawback fees. What happens is,  when you go into a pharmacy, you get a prescription filled, the  pharmacy's computer calls the insurance company's computer, the PBM's  computer, and it tells us how much to charge the patient in a copay and  tells us how much we are going to get paid. However, with these DIR  fees, months later, after we have already been promised how much we are  going to be paid, pharmacists are getting bills from these PBMs that  are saying: Well, we didn't make quite as much that quarter as we  should have, so we are going to have to claw back this much.  [[Page H1454]]    I met with pharmacists from the New York State pharmacy association  and they were telling me, literally, horror stories about getting bills  for $85,000, $110,000 in clawback fees. Folks, that is not a  sustainable business model. When you are trying to run a business, a  community pharmacy, and you get a bill months later in the hundreds of  thousands of dollars, that is not sustainable. You can't stay in  business that way.   We have got to do something about DIR fees. Thankfully,  Representative Morgan Griffith from Virginia has a bill addressing  this. I am supporting him on that bill.   In fact, in a recent survey, nearly 70 percent of community  pharmacists indicated that they don't receive any information about  when those fees will be collected or how large they will be. Again,  ultimately, who ends up being penalized? Who ends up being penalized is  the patient. The patient ends up being penalized.   Understand, this is not a partisan issue. These PBMs don't care  whether you are Republican or Democrat. They care about one thing, and  that is profit. That is all.   Now, let's talk about one other. Let's talk about a bill that  Representative Brett Guthrie from Kentucky has, H.R. 592, Pharmacies  and Medically Underserved Areas Enhancement Act. Under this bill, many  of the individuals who seek consultation, especially seniors, can  continue to receive that quality input and expertise.   This bill is known as the pharmacy provider status. Simply, what this  will do is make sure that the pharmacists who give consultations are  being reimbursed for that. That is vitally important.   Pharmacies are the front line in health care. There are so many  diseases. The pharmacists who are graduating today are so clinically  superior to when I graduated. Their expertise is beyond anything that I  ever imagined it would be. We need to make sure that we are utilizing  that. That is going to be a key in helping us control healthcare costs:  utilizing all these allied health fields and making sure we are using  them to their fullest potential. This bill will help us do that.   So there are just three bills that are being introduced right now  with community pharmacists that impact pharmacy but, more importantly,  that impact health care and that are going to help us have a great  healthcare system and to continue to have a great healthcare system.    There are a couple other things that I wanted to mention. I am going  to hold off on those because, again, I want to make sure that everybody  understands the point that I am trying to make, and that is just how  important, how vital the community pharmacies are and just how bad the  PBMs are and how they are ripping off the public. They are ripping off  the public. Look at their balance sheets. Look at the profits. Again,  they want to argue, and they want to say: We are holding down drug  prices.   Again, how is that working for you? It is not working. It is not  working because they are pocketing the profits. If they were truly  doing what they said they set out to do, we wouldn't see escalating  drug prices like we are seeing.   Yes, there are some bad actors out there, as there are in every  profession. Yes, we had Turing Pharmaceuticals and Martin Shkreli, the  ``pharma bro.'' This guy was a crook, no question about it. We had  Valeant Pharmaceuticals and what they did with Isuprel and Nitropress.   Just recently, Marathon Pharmaceuticals bought a drug that was  available over in Europe. They brought it over here and got it approved  in America. It is a very important drug for muscular dystrophy. Now  they want to increase the price to an enormous amount that won't be  affordable for patients.   Those are bad actors. As my daddy used to say, you are going to have  that, and we understand that. We have Valeant and Turing and Marathon.  We are calling them out, too. They need to be called out.   But we also need to focus on what one of the biggest problems is in  escalating prescription drug prices, and that is the PBMs. They bring  no value whatsoever to the system. They put no profit back into  research and development.   Communities' pharmacists play an important role in our healthcare  system. I am proud to support our community pharmacists. I am proud to  have been able to practice in a profession for over 30 years that I  know brings a great deal of value to patients and to their families.   Again, I want to thank Representative Collins, and I want to commend  him for his hard work.   Representative Austin Scott is here, also. He has been a champion of  this as well. They understand. They get it. I appreciate their efforts  on that, and I appreciate everyone who has been here tonight. I thank  Representative Collins for hosting us here tonight. I appreciate his  support.
