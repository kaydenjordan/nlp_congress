 Mr. President, there is no shortage of examples showing  how our Nation systemically fails communities of color and other  minorities, but the events of 2020--namely COVID-19 and the killings of  Black Americans--have brought heightened attention and urgency to  addressing inequities and disparities throughout our nation.  Tragically, these inequities and disparities pervade our health care  system, resulting in poor health outcomes and barriers to care for far  too many communities.   Mr. President, I believe that healthcare is a right--not a  privilege--and that this right should extend to everyone in our Nation.  Yet, this is not the case. Our Nation falls short in ensuring that  right to everyone regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual  orientation, socioeconomic status, immigration status, or any other  factor, which is why I am reintroducing the Health Equity and  Accountability Act (HEAA). This bill is a comprehensive blueprint of  bold policy solutions that address a wide spectrum of health equity  concerns.   Despite progress made through the Affordable Care Act, health care  access remains a problem in the U.S., with minority communities  disproportionately facing barriers to coverage. HEAA expands access to  health care for many communities in need including immigrant  communities, rural communities, and of particular importance to my  state, citizens of the Freely Associated States who are living in our  country under the Compacts of Free Association.   We know that diversity in our health care workforce can improve  health outcomes, and yet racial and ethnic minorities remain  underrepresented in our health professions. HEAA seeks to address the  lack of diversity in our health workforce through loan repayment  programs and health professions fellowships. The bill would also help  providers better serve a diverse patient population with culturally and  linguistically appropriate health care services through investments  like cultural competency education and expanded language access  services to assist the over 12 percent of Hawaii residents and about 8  percent of people nationwide with limited English proficiency.   Women, children, and adolescents often face additional barriers and  disparities in accessing information, health education, health  services, and coverage. HEAA aims to dismantle those barriers and  address a range of infant, maternal, sexual, and reproductive health  needs, particularly for  [[Page S6332]]  marginalized and underserved communities. For example, HEAA would  invest in sexual health education for underserved, minority, and LGBTQ  youth and link them to services related to positive health behaviors.  The bill also seeks to address our country's tragically high maternal  mortality rate, particularly for Black women, who have a maternal  mortality rate three to five times that of White women. HEAA would  expand services to pregnant and postpartum women, develop maternal  health initiatives in rural areas, and establish a program to address  implicit biases and cultural competency in providers.   HEAA doesn't stop there. The legislation would also expand and  promote mental and behavioral health services for minority communities,  increase Federal resources for diseases that disproportionately affect  minorities--such as heart disease and diabetes in Native Hawaiians--and  improve data collection and reporting so we can more completely  recognize and address health disparities. In Hawaii, these investments  through HEAA will help combat diseases like viral hepatitis, which  disproportionately affects Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, and  Pacific Islander communities, and better understand the health  disparities faced by Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific  Islanders through disaggregated data collection.   Finally, HEAA addresses the ``social determinants of health''--non- medical factors like the environment, housing, education, and economic  stability that ultimately affect individual and community health. HEAA  would require non-health federal agencies like Department of Housing  and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, Department of  Agriculture, and Environmental Protection Agency to work together to  improve the social determinants of health.   Achieving health equity is achievable and to do it we must make bold,  substantial investments in transforming our health and health care  systems. I thank my colleagues for joining me in introducing the bill,  and encourage others to join us as we work to level the playing field  and empower everyone in our nation to achieve their full health  potential.                            ____________________     Mr. President, there is no shortage of examples showing  how our Nation systemically fails communities of color and other  minorities, but the events of 2020--namely COVID-19 and the killings of  Black Americans--have brought heightened attention and urgency to  addressing inequities and disparities throughout our nation.
