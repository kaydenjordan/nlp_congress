 Madam Speaker, today, we enter day 20 of the Trump  shutdown. President Trump has spent years as a reality television host,  but, unfortunately, reality is still not his strong suit.   This week, President Trump abused the backdrop of the Oval Office to  feed the American people divisive and distorted rhetoric, while still  ignoring the reality that a wall is wasteful and it is impractical and  inconsistent with our values.   President Trump has tried to convince the American people that there  is a crisis at our border. The crisis, Madam Speaker, here is one of  Donald Trump's own making: a government shutdown that has gone on too  long.   This is affecting real lives. This is a humanitarian crisis. Federal  workers and their families, 80 percent of whom live outside of the  metropolitan area of D.C., will go without a paycheck this Friday  because of this shutdown.   Madam Speaker, 7,000 workers in North Carolina are directly affected  by the shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of public servants across the  country are worried to death.   Senate Republicans have a choice. Do your constitutional duty, my  fellow Senators. Do your job as a Senate. Pass the House bill that we  have sent over to you.                            ____________________
