 Madam President, Mary Hulsman Allgeier was selected  as the #1 Citizen of Schnitzelburg, a historic neighborhood in  Louisville, KY. Mary has been a lifelong community advocate and  volunteer. She has given to and supported those in need as a leader in  Holy Family Parish for many years. In addition, Mary is a role model  for women in leadership and is instrumental in ensuring members of her  community understand their civic rights and responsibilities. Mary has  served her community faithfully from education to civic engagement and  is an example for us to follow. I am proud to join the people of  Schnitzelburg in honoring Mary Allegeier as their #1 Citizen.                            ____________________     Madam President, Col. Fred Johnson, U.S. Army,  Retired, was honored as Kentucky's 2019 Veteran of the Year. Since his  retirement from the U.S. Army in 2014, Fred Johnson has immersed  himself in community service in Louisville in both existing programs,  such as YouthBuild and Restorative Justice Louisville, and through  developing new, innovative ways to use the arts and storytelling to  help connect veterans with the broader community. His Veteran's Writing  Workshop series and the innovative Shakespeare with Veterans group that  he cofounded in 2016 are helping veterans communicate their stories in  creative and timeless ways. Colonel Johnson remains committed to our  country as is evident by his decision to teach sixth grade Social  studies class at Thomas Jefferson Middle School. I am proud to  recognize Col. Fred Johnson as a remarkable symbol of the rich veteran  heritage of Kentucky.

After serving on Active Duty and in  the Air Force Reserve, Karen taught science at Leestown Middle School  in Lexington, KY, where she began immersing herself in volunteer work  for veterans. She has worked with Military Missions, an organization  that sent care packages to over 8,500 deployed U.S. men and women last  year. One of her current passions is Lady Veterans Connect, a nonprofit  with a real heart for female veterans, particularly those who are  homeless. Karen Weaver has been an incredible role model to the  children of her classrooms and to the entire Commonwealth. I am honored  to recognize Karen in her service to our country and our State.                            ____________________
