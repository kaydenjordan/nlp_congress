 Mr. President, as healthcare professionals, first  responders, and communities across our country work around the clock to  fight the spread of the coronavirus, our televisions and news feeds  have been filled with a lot of numbers--the number of new cases  reported each day, the rising number of fatalities, unfortunately, and  the volatile ups and downs of the stock market. All of this data paints  a picture of the widening scope of this outbreak on a national scale,  but it fails to represent the impact it is having on individuals and on  small businesses in our communities.   I think of people like Joe Kenney, who opened Cobbleheads Bar & Grill  in Brownsville, TX, nearly 25 years ago. Like other restaurant owners  around the country, he is trying to adapt so he can keep his doors open  while he follows guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention. He canceled the restaurant's popular St. Patrick's Day  celebration and, instead, offered corned beef and cabbage as a takeout  option, but he is nervous about just how long he can hold on and how he  will be able to stay afloat.   Joe said: ``Shutting down two, three, four weeks, you can leave 25  years on the table with what we put into this place.''   Joe, to his credit, is especially, worried about his more than 30  employees and what will happen to them.  [[Page S1792]]    This is a familiar story for countless small businesses and their  employees--small businesses that are losing customers through no fault  of their own.   Erin Willis owns RM 12:20 Bistro in northeast Dallas. When she heard  Mayor Johnson's announcement of limiting restaurants to takeout  service, she said: ``I just hope we can survive this.''   Like Joe, Erin is mostly concerned about the well-being of her staff.  Hourly workers, particularly those who rely on tips, are seeing fewer  and fewer opportunities to collect paychecks. Erin is rotating  employees so that everyone can have some work, but the fears about how  long this could last are really settling in.   She said:         The service industry is their livelihood. If we all close,       they literally have nothing.    As more and more Americans are staying home, small businesses and  their employees are the hardest hit, but the impact does not end with  them. The hard stop on large gatherings doesn't just mean businesses,  schools, and workplaces are shutting down; it means vital community  events, including things like blood drives, are being canceled.   Officials from the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center said this has  put their community blood supply at risk of collapse, and while this  isn't related to treating those who have been diagnosed with the  coronavirus, it is vital to the ongoing, everyday work of our  healthcare system. Blood donations help people who lose blood during  major surgeries or after having suffered traumatic injuries. They also  help those who have chronic conditions and require occasional blood  transfusions.   Hospitals and donation centers are taking every precaution to protect  donors while they are fulfilling the need of blood donations, and I  encourage all Texans who are healthy and at low risk of contracting the  coronavirus to consider donating blood. During times like these, when  it is, perhaps, easy to feel that circumstances are beyond your  control, this is one small step each of us can take to support our  communities.   I know this is a time of serious uncertainty for both the physical  and financial health of our families and our country, but I want to  assure my constituents--the 29 million people I am privileged to  represent in the State of Texas--that the Senate is working to provide  them with the relief that we can.   Less than 2 weeks ago, the President signed a bill we passed that  provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding to combat the virus, which  has sent vital funding toward treating and preventing the spread of the  virus, including toward the purchase of masks and personal protective  equipment, as well as in supporting the development of a vaccine,  possible treatments, and more diagnostics. This was an important first  step toward bolstering our response in the early phases of community  spread, and now we are working to address the larger impact this virus  is having on American workers, families, and our economy.   Soon, the Senate will take another bipartisan step of providing  support by passing the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. This  legislation will go a long way in providing immediate relief for those  who are struggling to make ends meet during this challenging time.   It creates a new Federal emergency paid sick leave program for those  who are impacted by the coronavirus. Whether workers are diagnosed with  the virus or are caring for dependents who are affected, they will be  able to take up to 10 days of paid sick leave, and many Texas workers  will have access to 12 weeks of paid leave in order to care for  dependents because of coronavirus-related school closures.    This legislation makes important changes to unemployment insurance to  ensure that Texans can take advantage of these benefits during this  time of uncertainty.   It also provides food security for Americans of all ages, from  schoolchildren who rely on free lunches at school to seniors who are  unable to leave their homes, for every American deserves access to  basic nutrition.   This bill also makes coronavirus testing free of charge for all  Americans, and it includes a range of measures to support the  healthcare professionals who are literally on the frontlines of this  fight.   I proudly support the bill, and I am eager to get it to the President  for his signature. We shouldn't delay in sending it to his desk. We  have been able to come together and move two bills through Congress  that support healthcare workers, neighbors, and communities that are  being impacted by the coronavirus. I hope this trend of bipartisanship  will continue in the coming weeks and months as we work to build on the  actions we have already taken.   I echo the comment made by the majority leader that this is only the  beginning of our efforts to support our country. We will keep working  this week and next and for however long it takes in order to assist  American workers and families, to support our local businesses, and to  secure both the immediate and long-term viability of our economy. Via  three task forces, the Senate has already begun the work of putting  together the next economic recovery legislation, and we will not leave  until we get that bill passed, too.   While most Americans' daily lives have been upended by the spread of  the coronavirus, there are countless men and women who continue to go  to work and fill critical needs in our society. We owe a debt of  gratitude to the dedicated healthcare professionals who are on the  frontlines of this pandemic; to the scientists who are working  diligently to develop a vaccine; to the first responders who are  continuing to expose their own health for our safety; to the farmers  and ranchers and producers who are keeping us fed; to the grocery store  employees who are restocking shelves; and to the countless others who  are leaving their homes and their families each morning to keep us safe  and healthy. We need to say thank you to each of them. As these men and  women continue doing everything they can to respond to the spread of  the coronavirus, the Senate will do the same.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
