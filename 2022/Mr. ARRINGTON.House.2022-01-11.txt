 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great man, a  devoted father and husband, a selfless leader, and a legend in  Louisiana real estate law.   Malcolm Meyer graduated magna cum laude from Tulane University,  graduated from Tulane Law School, and then served 4 years as a JAG  officer in the United States Navy.   Malcolm Meyer practiced law over 30 years, taught and mentored  students as an adjunct professor, and he became a leading expert in his  field, literally writing the book on real estate transaction law in  Louisiana, the widely read and referenced ``Malcolm's Manual on  Louisiana Real Estate.''   Malcolm has used his vast knowledge and expertise not only to better  his colleagues and his profession, but to help the disadvantaged in his  community. Most notably, following the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina,  Malcolm spent countless hours of pro bono work protecting the property  and belongings of the most vulnerable in his State.   He has been recognized over the years for his outstanding volunteer  service by organizations, including Louisiana Appleseed Foundation,  Louisiana Land Title Association, and the prestigious George Herbert  Walker Bush's Points of Light.   On December 29, Malcolm was named the recipient of the 2021 Louisiana  Land Title Association Lifetime Achievement Award.   Strong countries and vibrant communities, Mr. Speaker, are not  established merely because of good laws but because of good men whose  hearts are devoted to the sum of all laws: Love thy neighbor as  thyself.   That is Malcolm Meyer to his core, and I know that unequivocally, Mr.  Speaker, because he is my father-in-law. I am so proud of him, and I  want to congratulate Big Mouse and send our best. We love Big Mouse,  and it is a well-deserved recognition.                           Recognizing Don McBeath     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding  west Texan, a great partner in delivering rural healthcare solutions,  and a dear friend, Don McBeath.   Don is retiring from his role as director of government relations for  the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals, what we refer  to as TORCH, where he has been a champion for over 150 rural hospitals  since 2007.    Prior to his time with TORCH, Don blazed the trail in telehealth by  serving as the director of telemedicine and rural health at the Texas  Tech University Health Sciences Center. Before that, he served as a  judge and several years in the DA's office.   I wish Don and Beverly all the best as they move into the next  chapter of their lives. I thank Don for his friendship and his  tremendous contributions to rural west Texas.                Congratulating Cash Patten and Berkley Waters     Mr. Speaker, rodeo is not just a sport; it is a way of  life and a heritage in the Lone Star State. I am pleased to see this  time-honored tradition is being kept alive by the next generation of  Texans.   I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of two outstanding west  Texans, 9-year-old Berkley Waters of Lubbock and 12-year-old Cash  Patten of New Home. Berkley and Cash, two great cowboy names, recently  competed in the barrel racing finals in the Junior World Finals rodeo  in Las Vegas.   West Texans are known for being hardworking, tough, and undeterred.  Cash and Berkley have these qualities, Mr. Speaker, in spades. Their  commitment to these virtues and their craft has allowed them to perform  at the highest level and on the biggest stage in their sport.   I want to congratulate Berkley and Cash for all their hard work and  what they have been able to accomplish at a young age.   God bless America and go west Texas.                            ____________________
