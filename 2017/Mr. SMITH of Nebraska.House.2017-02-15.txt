 Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 42 disapproving the rule  submitted by the Department of Labor relating to drug testing of  unemployment compensation applicants.   The goal of the 2012 bipartisan law signed by President Obama in  February 2012 is to reassure employers who fund the unemployment  compensation system that unemployment compensation claimants reentering  the workforce are truly able and available for work.   When I speak with employers in Nebraska's Third District, they  express a strong desire to hire individuals in a way that is beneficial  for both the employer and the employee.   According to UWC, the national association representing businesses in  the areas of unemployment compensation  [[Page H1202]]  and workers' compensation: ``The regulations adopted in final form not  only severely limited the circumstances under which a state may conduct  a drug test, but also unduly limited the types of tests that a state  would be permitted to conduct. . . .''   States, which are responsible for administration of the unemployment  compensation program, are also concerned.   Back in 2014, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker wrote to the Secretary  of Labor saying: ``Providing States more flexibility in defining  occupations that regularly conduct drug testing not only better serves  the public interest, but recognizes the unique labor force and  diversity in industry in each State.''   In recognition of the support we have received from employers who  fund the system and States which administer it, I include in the Record  their letters of support.                                                  February 10, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: We write to you today in support of       H.J. Res. 42, your legislation that would disapprove of the       United States Department of Labor's recent regulation       regarding states' ability to drug test individuals who apply       for unemployment insurance (UI).        Congress authorized the Labor Department to craft a rule       that would provide states the option to drug test       unemployment insurance applicants. Unfortunately, the Obama       Administration drafted the rule too narrowly, undermining the       intent of Congress and permitting drug testing in too few       instances.        Drug testing UI applicants can help individuals suffering       from substance abuse to access necessary care and treatment       so they may re-enter the workforce as healthy and productive       members of society. We believe this rule should be replaced       with a new rule that allows increased flexibility for states       to implement UI drug testing that best fits the needs of each       state.        Thank you for introducing this important legislation and we       look forward to working with Congress on this issue going       forward.            Sincerely,      Scott Walker,        Governor of Wisconsin.      Gary R. Herbert,        Governor of Utah.      Greg Abbott,        Governor of Texas.      Phil Bryant,        Governor of Mississippi.                                   ____                                                  State of Nebraska,                                          Office of the Governor,                                     Lincoln, NE, February 14, 2017.      Re H.J. Res. 42--Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation           Recipients.       Hon. Adrian Smith,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Smith: Thank you for being a co-introducer       of House Joint Resolution 42. The regulations which H.J. Res.       42 seeks to disapprove greatly exceed the authority granted       to the U.S. Department of Labor under Section 2105 of the       Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L.       112-96).        The U.S. Department of Labor regulations effectively limit       the application of P.L. 112-96 authorized drug testing to the       point that a state is, for all practical purposes, prevented       from adopting a meaningful drug testing program for       unemployment compensation claimants. These regulations are an       exhibit of executive overreach where the U.S. Department of       Labor effectively seeks to block the implementation of an Act       of Congress.        I thank you for your efforts to restore to the states their       right to enact drug testing requirements for unemployment       compensation claimants.            Sincerely,                                                     Pete Ricketts,      Governor.                                   ____                                                              UWC,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal: I am writing       on behalf of UWC--Strategic Services on Unemployment and       Workers' Compensation (UWC) in support of Resolution H.J. Res       42 that would disallow the final regulations posted by the       United States Department of Labor on August 5, 2016.        UWC is a national association representing business,       specifically in the areas of Unemployment Compensation and       Workers' Compensation. UWC members include many Fortune 500       companies as well as business associations and small       businesses impacted by unemployment law and policy.        The regulations as posted in final form are inconsistent       with the intent of Congress in enacting the Middle Class Tax       Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 and unduly restrict state       agencies choosing to test applicants for the use of       controlled substances.        Drug testing is a critical requirement of employment in       many industries and generally in determining whether a       prospective employee will be able to perform the       responsibilities of work for which the individual has       applied. The results of drug tests are also indications of       whether an individual is able to work and available to work       so as to be eligible to be paid unemployment compensation.        It is a federal statutory requirement of administrative       grants to states that as a condition of being paid       unemployment compensation for a week or weeks an individual       must be able to work, available to work, and actively seeking       work. The additional authority provided in Section 2105 of       the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012       permitted states to test for controlled substances consistent       with the able to work and available to work requirements that       were also included in the act.        The regulations adopted by the U.S. Department of Labor       were so narrowly drawn as to severely limit states from       electing to provide for drug testing of applicants. By       limiting the time within which a test may be conducted to the       period between the date of application and the date at which       the applicant began to claim a week of unemployment       compensation, such a test would be less likely to connect a       positive drug test with a subsequent week of unemployment       compensation that could be claimed up to 52 weeks after the       date of initial application.        The effect of such an interpretation is to render a test       useless for weeks claimed many weeks after the individual       became unemployed and prohibit testing for the weeks of       unemployment compensation as they are claimed.        The regulations adopted in final form not only severely       limited the circumstances under which a state may conduct a       drug test, but also unduly limited the types of tests that a       state would be permitted to conduct, the claimants that could       be tested, and the occupations with respect to which tests       could be conducted.        A number of states have indicated an interest in enacting       legislation consistent with federal law to permit drug       testing, but the severe limitations imposed by the       regulations have frustrated administration of drug testing as       part of the UI administrative process.        Employers pay the federal and state unemployment taxes       required to fund administration and benefits paid through the       Unemployment Insurance system. Drug testing of UI claimants       should be permitted as part of proper administration by       states to assure that only eligible claimants are paid and       that unemployed workers are able and available to work to       meet workforce needs of employers.        Thank you for the opportunity to express our support for       H.J. Res 42.            Sincerely,                                                 Douglas J. Holmes,      President.                                   ____                                    Secretaries' Innovation Group,                                    Milwaukee, WI, January 31, 2017.      Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: I am writing you on the topic of drug       screening and testing of Unemployment Insurance claimants in       my capacity as the Executive Director of the Secretaries'       Innovation Group, after consultation with Texas Workforce       Commission Executive Director Larry Temple and workforce       secretary members of SIG on a recent national conference       call. As you know, the Secretaries' Innovation Group is a       network of state workforce and human service secretaries from       states with Republican governors making up about half of the       country. We meet to exchange state program innovations and       opportunities and to press for national policies favoring       work, healthy families, federalism and limited government.        By way of background, in 2012, the bipartisan Middle Class       Tax Relief and Job Creation Act made a number of reforms to       the UI program, including overturning a 1960s-era DOL ban on       the screening or testing of UI applicants for illegal drugs.       The 2012 provision allowed (but did not require) states to       test UI applicants who either (1) lost their job due to drug       use, or (2) were seeking a new job that generally required       new employees to pass a drug test. However, in implementing       this law through regulation, DOL issued an overly       prescriptive final regulation making it almost impossible for       most states to implement the provision.        Our SIG state secretaries who run UI, WIOA and welfare to       work programs routinely meet with employers to seek their       input as to what characteristics they require to meet their       business needs. By far the most common stated requirements       are requests for individuals who are reliable and can pass a       drug test. Therefore it is highly important that states to       have the ability and authority to operate drug screening and       testing. It is also important they have the option to       condition UI benefits on cooperation in such tests and to       mandate treatment, if and when necessary, on a case by case       basis. States do not have the ability to operate this way       under the current restrictive regulation promulgated by the       Department of Labor.        During the national conference call with SIG workforce       secretaries to discuss drug screening and testing which took       place on  [[Page H1203]]       January 24th and included TX, AL, AR, ID, KS, ME, MD, MS, NE,       NM, NH, NV, ND, OH, OK, UT, WI, WY, none of the secretary       participants endorsed the DOL rule in question as written.        We hope the Congress will take up this issue and permit       states who wish to do so the ability to implement screening       and testing of UI claimants with the flexibility intended by       Congress.            Yours truly,                                                      Jason Turner,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, as Chairman Brady highlighted  earlier, Members of this body have clearly stated their intent time and  time again over the last few years through letters, hearings, public  comments, and meetings. Yet, the Department of Labor has continued to  push Congress' concerns to the side and legislate from the executive  branch.   Supporting this resolution means supporting the role of Congress to  write laws and for them to be implemented as intended.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to hopefully draw some  attention to the fact that we have a problem on our hands. We have a  problem with the Federal Government going too far, and we have a  problem with the State governments coming to us as policymakers at the  Federal level wanting to help their own constituents, their own  citizens in need. Right now the Federal Government stands in the way.   It is time for us as policymakers hopefully to act in a responsible  fashion to assist States in their need and their desire to help their  own citizens. States are better at that than is the Federal Government,  and I hope that we can empower the States to help their own  constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, since the law was enacted some 5 years ago, Members of  this body have clearly stated their intent time and time again through  letters, hearings, public comments, and meetings, and yet the previous  Department of Labor continued to push Congress' concerns to the side  and legislate from the executive branch.   Again, supporting this resolution means supporting the role of  Congress  [[Page H1206]]  to write laws and for the laws to be implemented as intended.   I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 42, disapproving of the  Department of Labor's regulation of the drug testing on unemployment  insurance applicants.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
