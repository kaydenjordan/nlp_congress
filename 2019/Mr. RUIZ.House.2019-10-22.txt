 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of renown  psychiatrist, a former associate dean of student affairs at Harvard  Medical School, a lifelong public servant, and my mentor and friend,  Dr. Alvin Poussaint.   Dr. Poussaint's career has been one of passion and service. During  the civil rights movement, Dr. Poussaint marched from Selma to  Montgomery with Martin Luther King, Jr., organizing Freedom Clinics  with the Freedom Riders.   Over his accomplished career, Dr. Poussaint and his experience,  insight, and intellect have been requested by the FBI, the White House,  and the Department of Health and Human Services.   One of the biggest blessings of my life is that our paths crossed  when I was a student at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Poussaint believed  in me and supported me in my studies and my student advocacies.   Dr. Poussaint embraced me and my approach to learning. He encouraged  me and guided my passion and energy, and he defended me from those who  wanted me to think that I didn't belong there.   Dr. Alvin Poussaint is one of the reasons I am standing up here today  as a physician and Congressman standing up for health and social  justice.   I wish him well in his retirement and celebrate his decades of  professional accomplishments and contributions to our society.                            ____________________
