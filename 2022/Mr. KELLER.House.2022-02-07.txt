 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for  organizing this Special Order, the important things for which we should  all be very passionate about.   Defunding the police is not just a Democrat slogan, it is a dangerous  policy that has been advocated by some Washington Democrats and is  having devastating consequences for the morale and safety of America's  law enforcement officers.   In 2021, 346 officers were shot, and ambush-style attacks increased  by 115 percent from 2020. Last month, we all watched as NYPD officers  lined the streets of Manhattan to honor two of their fallen brothers  who were shot and killed in the line of duty.   Criminal acts of violence against law enforcement are becoming all  too common. Despite this fact, Washington Democrats continue to call  for defunding the police, and stoke division between the public and the  heroes who keep us safe every day and sacrifice to do so.   Painting law enforcement out to be the bad guy doesn't make America  safer. It does exactly the opposite, and it only serves to embolden  more criminal behavior and lawlessness. Our officers protect us every  day and they need our support now more than ever.   I stand with law enforcement, and I stand for law and order. I thank  the gentlewoman from Florida for having this important Special Order.
