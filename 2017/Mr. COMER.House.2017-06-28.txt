 Mr. Speaker, I rise to applaud President Trump's selection  of Ms. Kelly Craft as the next U.S. Ambassador to Canada.   Canada is the number one export market for my home State of Kentucky.  Agriculture is the major industry in my congressional district, and  Canada is a critical export market for Kentucky farm products. As a  result of our successful history of trade with the nation of Canada, I  cannot think of a better person to lead relations between these two  countries than my dear friend, Kelly Craft.   Kelly was raised in Glasgow, Kentucky, which is 30 miles from my  hometown. She has a lifetime of achievements and is extremely  qualified. On a personal note, Kelly has always been there for and  believed in me, and I am very appreciative of her support and  friendship.  [[Page H5289]]    I look forward to Kelly Craft's great leadership as Ambassador to  Canada, and I urge a swift confirmation process in the Senate.                            ____________________
