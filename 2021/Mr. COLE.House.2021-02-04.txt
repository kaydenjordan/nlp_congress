 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  Massachusetts, my good friend, Chairman McGovern, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today is a sad one for us, for me personally, for the  Rules Committee, and for the entire House of Representatives. Today, we  are meeting on an unprecedented resolution by the majority, removing a  Member of the minority party from her committee assignments.   Now, before I continue, Madam Speaker, I want to be very clear that I  find the comments made by the Representative in question before she was  elected to Congress to be deeply offensive. Members of Congress are and  should be held to a high standard. And if she spoke any of what has  been reported while a Member of this body, her words would certainly  not meet that standard.   But at last night's Republican Conference, Representative Greene  expressed regret for her past statements, which speaks to a problem  with today's resolution. Representative Greene is not being given the  courtesy of a referral to the Ethics Committee, the body empowered to  investigate the conduct of Members. She is not being given the same due  process that is given to other Members before facing punishment by the  House.   Why is it so hard for the majority to give a Republican Member due  process before stripping her of her committees? That is all I asked the  Rules Committee last night, which the majority rejected.   Today's resolution raises serious questions for this institution.  Indeed, these questions have nothing to do with this particular Member  at all. Instead, they are about the future of the institution. The  action the majority is proposing to take today is not only premature  but, in fact, unprecedented in the history of the House.   Madam Speaker, what the majority is really proposing to do today is  establish a new standard for punishing Members for conduct before they  ever became a Member. The majority is proposing to hold Members of  Congress accountable for statements made before they were even a  candidate for Congress.   This change opens up troubling questions about how we judge future  Members of Congress and whether or not we, as an institution, should  impose sanctions on Members for actions they took before they were even  candidates for office.    Under this majority's new approach, could a Member be punished for  statements they made 5 years ago? Ten years ago? Twenty years ago?   I would remind the majority that several of their own Members have  engaged in activities or made comments that Republican Members find  offensive and inappropriate. If the majority changes hands in the  future, as it surely will at some point, how would the current majority  feel if these Members are stripped of their committee assignments with  no due process? My friends run the risk of setting off a tit-for-tat  exchange of escalating partisan punishment and score-settling that  could cripple the operation of the House now and well into the future.   But what has also never been done before in the history of the  institution is this: The majority has never taken steps to exercise a  veto over the minority's committee assignments. It has never been done,  Madam Speaker.   I know my friend, Chairman McGovern, attempted to point out some  cases in yesterday's Rules Committee hearing to the contrary. But each  of those cases he cited actually involved the party sanctioning their  own Members. The majority exercising a veto over the minority's  assignments has never happened before.   I would also like to point out that this is the same majority which  raised no objections a week ago when this House unanimously approved  resolutions on committee assignments.   In the past, the majority and minority have respected each other's  rights to place Members on committees without interference. It has  ultimately been the responsibility of each side to also hold their  Members accountable for unacceptable behavior, including making  decisions to remove Members from their committee assignments when  warranted.   Indeed, Madam Speaker, Republicans have removed Members from  committees in the past. I know. I have personally been part of those  proceedings.   We can and will do so again, if necessary, but it will be done with  due process and with the Members in question, whoever they may be,  allowed to make their case. That is a simple standard of fair play and  decency that the majority has decided not to extend to a Member of the  minority in this case.   I truly believe that the majority claiming a new right to be able to  exercise a veto over the minority's committee assignments will  ultimately be dangerous for this institution. A change in norms away  from an institution built on mutual consent and toward an institution  where the majority  [[Page H340]]  holds a veto power over everything, including committee assignments, is  ultimately an institution that cannot function.   If one side feels the other should take corrective action for one of  its Members and has failed to do so, then the bipartisan Ethics  Committee exists to adjudicate matters related to the Code of Official  Conduct. I believe it would be appropriate for the Ethics Committee to  determine if a new standard relating to the actions taken by a Member  of Congress before they are elected should be covered by the Code of  Official Conduct and make the appropriate recommendations for the  institution to guide us going forward.   I fear that doing anything other than this would send the institution  down a precarious path. The Ethics Committee is the appropriate venue  for considering claims of misconduct. That is traditionally what this  institution has done when considering the conduct of an individual  Member. I believe today it is appropriate to adhere to that norm.   Madam Speaker, the matter we are faced with is bigger than any one  individual Member. It is about how we, as an institution, will continue  to function in the future. I fear that if we open this particular  Pandora's box, we will not like what happens next. I would strongly  urge this House to consider an alternative course before it is too  late.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  just for informational purposes.   There is no way my friend from Massachusetts could have known this,  but last night the Republican members were formally named to the Ethics  Committee. We expect them to be approved today so the committee could  function immediately. But, again, my friend would have had no way of  knowing that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentlewoman from Georgia  (Mrs. Greene).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), my very good friend.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Georgia an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, just quickly, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, just to respond to my friend briefly, remember, we are  doing something here that has never been done before. The majority is  taking away a committee assignment of the minority. That has not  happened in this House before.   Also remember, we are applying, or you were choosing to apply the  code of official conduct to a Member before they were ever a Member.  That has not, to my knowledge, ever been done before either.   We haven't said: Let's do nothing. We have said: These are pretty  serious questions. Let's go to the Ethics Committee, adjudicate them,  have a discussion, and have a recommendation come back out.   So to say we don't want to do something is just simply inaccurate. I  think you are, frankly, overlooking the unprecedented nature of the  acts that you have decided upon, and where that may lead us when the  majority changes.   So with that, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  California (Mr. Issa).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 15 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished Republican whip of the  Congress and my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, just quickly for the Record, so my friend knows, the  resolution that the Republican whip, Mr. Scalise, was referring to just  a few minutes ago only concerned Republicans. So if you wanted to  object to Republicans, that is what you could  [[Page H344]]  have done. It didn't involve Democrats at all.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to amend House rules to state that any resolution  proposing to remove a Member from a committee assignment shall not be  in order unless offered by, or with the concurrence of, the leader of  the party of the Member that is the subject of the resolution.   Madam Speaker, this speaks to a norm of basic fairness that today's  resolution does not comply with. In the past, the majority has never  attempted to exercise a veto over the minority's committee assignments,  nor has the minority ever attempted to do the same to the majority.   This has been, in the past, an unwritten rule, a norm the House has  adhered to in order to protect the operations of the institution. But  the majority's actions today threaten that norm and threaten to set off  a new round of escalating partisan punishment anytime the majority  changes hands. Enshrining historical practice as a new rule is an  important step to protect the institution as a whole.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous  question, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, just in response to my good friend: I was actually  there. So, number one, she didn't get a standing ovation for things  that she said. She got a standing ovation for regretting things that  she had said, and saying she has been wrong, and denouncing QAnon and  denouncing school shootings. That is what she got the standing ovation  for. My friend didn't have the opportunity to hear that. I wanted to  take the opportunity to inform him.   Madam Speaker, I would advise my friend that I am prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I oppose the rule. Never before in the  history of this institution has the majority attempted to exercise a  veto over the minority's right to make committee assignments, yet,  today, the majority is choosing to do just that. This leads the  institution down a dangerous path, the end of which we cannot see.   Madam Speaker, there are alternative paths open that I believe the  House should consider. We owe it to ourselves and to the institution to  do so. Before we strip a Member of their committees for remarks that  person made before they were subject to the official rules of conduct  of the House, maybe we ought to have a discussion about that, if we are  going to extend that in a way we never have before in the institution.  I am not necessarily against that, by the way. I think that is a worthy  topic.   I also think that if we are going to strip a Member before they ever  served on a committee, they ought to have an opportunity to tell their  side of the story in a judicious proceeding. Our Committee on Ethics  has resolved a lot of naughty issues in a very bipartisan way, and not  with Members escaping punishment. So to say we have asked for nothing  be done, it is quite the opposite.   We have said: Let's go to the Committee on Ethics.   Let's hash through these tough issues of changing the scope of the  official conduct provisions of the House that applies to Members.   Let's talk about whether or not it is appropriate for the majority to  actually try to dictate the people that the minority puts on  committees.   And, finally, let's give a Member that we accuse of something an  opportunity to make his or her case.   That is what we have asked for, and that is what the majority has  chosen not to do.   Madam Speaker, I think it is a dangerous mistake. It is a mistake  that, frankly, when the majority changes, the temptation will be  overwhelming for a Member to say: ``Oh, well, there is a Member I  didn't like or said something or did something I didn't like. As a  Member, I think I am just going to take that committee assignment  away.''   I can give you a list of people that have done things that I think  are inappropriate, on both sides of the aisle, quite frankly. But we  have never done that here, and I don't think we should start doing that  here. All we have asked for is a process, a Committee on Ethics  discussion. We think that is the appropriate way to proceed.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question, ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
