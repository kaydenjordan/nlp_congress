 Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the 250th  anniversary of the town of Buxton, ME. It is a great pleasure to  celebrate the generations of industrious and caring people who have  made Buxton a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.   Named for the famous spa town in England, Buxton has a rich history.  For thousands of years, the Saco River Valley was home to the Abenaki.  In 1728, the Massachusetts General Court granted land to establish a  settlement that was called Narragansett Number One. As the population  grew, the town of Buxton was incorporated on July 14, 1772.   The early settlers turned the dense forests and fertile soil into a  thriving lumber industry and productive farms. With the Saco River  providing power, sawmills and gristmills were built, followed by woolen  mills, tanneries, churches, libraries, and flourishing retail stores.   Education has been central to Buxton from the start. The first  schoolmaster arrived in 1761, more than a decade before incorporation.  Soon, 17 homes in town hosted one-room schools so that every youngster  was within walking distance.   Buxton's early prosperity as an industrial center produced many fine  examples of New England architecture. Today, several homes, businesses,  and the First Congregational Church are listed on the National Register  of Historic Places.   Also on the Register is the Buxton Powder House, built by the  townspeople at a cost of $59 to store ammunition and arms during the  War of 1812. Since then, the people of Buxton have joined together to  erect monuments and memorials in tribute to the patriots who have  defended freedom throughout our Nation's history.   The spirit that built Buxton is evident today in many ways. Countless  volunteers have come together to make the town's sestercentennial a  memorable celebration. For nearly 30 years, townspeople have generously  supported the Buxton Toy Box that helps bring holiday cheer to  children. Buxton's active involvement on the Saco River Corridor  Commission shows a commitment to protect the natural resources that are  vital to the quality of life.   Nothing better demonstrates the Buxton spirit than a special moment  at this year's annual town meeting on June 18, when the townspeople  honored Deputy Chief Gene Harmon of the Buxton Fire-Rescue Department  for 60 years of dedicated service to his community and his neighbors.   Buxton's 250th anniversary is a time to celebrate the people who  pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great community.  Thanks to those who came before, Buxton, ME, has a wonderful history.  Thanks to those there today, it has a bright future.                            ____________________
