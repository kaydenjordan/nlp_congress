 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a few special  constituents in my region who deserve recognition.                      Honoring the Life of Bill Chanatry     Mr. Speaker, this past October, the Mohawk Valley lost a  local businessman, leader, and a dear friend when Bill Chanatry, owner  of Chanatry's Hometown Market in Utica, New York, passed away at the  age of 89.   Bill was raised in Utica and graduated from the highly acclaimed  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute--many of you known as RPI--and enjoyed  a 40-year career as an engineer, eventually serving in the Army Corps  of Engineers in Japan during the Korean war; and later he joined  General Electric Aerospace Electronics Division, where he served as a  project manager for the U.S. Navy E-2C Surveillance Radar Team in  Utica, New York.   Chanatry's, the family grocery store, was founded in 1912 by Bill's  father and his two uncles. In 1991, Bill eventually retired from  General Electric, GE, and became the president of Chanatry's and  oversaw a significant expansion and innovation, using his unique skills  in engineering to really bring Chanatry's into the forefront and to  maintain it as a family, home-owned business catering to the needs of  families in our community.   But along with all of these lifelong achievements that Bill had,  Bill's legacy is better defined by his terrific family: his loving  wife, Janet; five children, Ameena, Joanne, Michael, Bob,  [[Page H10504]]  and Mark; and, of course, all of their children, grandchildren, and  many great-grandchildren as well.   The strong personal relationships that Bill cultivated with so many  people in our community are thanks to his integrity, his loyalty, his  ultimate belief in the goodness of humankind. Much of the love that he  had came from his very strong devotion to faith. He also was known to  attend daily mass.   He also was such a good friend to so many as he worked in his post- retirement, in his post-GE life, retirement life at Chanatry.   Bill's son, Mark, a long-time friend of mine, dear friend, stated  that his father's greatest lesson to him when it came to rebuilding the  number one grocery store in Utica year after year is simply:  ``Chanatry's business was built on treating people right.'' And that  was Bill's message. Mark and his family continue that great legacy left  by their father, Bill.   For anyone who has been to Chanatry's, it is really hard to imagine  walking through the market and not seeing Bill attending to every  aspect of the business, taking the time to talk to individuals, to help  consumers and people coming in and individual customers, which is  something that he did every single day. It was a big part of his life.   He was also just hard to miss. He was full of energy, full of  excitement, a lot of fun to be around. Our community will dearly miss  Bill Chanatry, and especially his friends, his family, and his  customers.   Mr. Speaker, our entire community really lost a true leader in Bill  Chanatry, someone who was always able to innovate and actually reinvent  himself, and someone who--I think what is most important--actually made  a difference.                     Honoring the Life of James VanSlyke     Mr. Speaker, next, I would like to recognize another  really terrific person, a dear friend of my family. I would like to  honor the incredible life of a man named James VanSlyke of New  Hartford, New York.    Jim VanSlyke passed away on June 6, 2018, 1 day before his 89th  birthday. He is survived by his loving wife of 62 years, Virginia, whom  we all know as Ginny; his children, Matt, Patrice, Andy, and Mary; his  grandchildren, great-grandchildren; and nieces and nephews.   Hailing from Hamilton, New York, Jim stayed in his hometown after  high school, attending Colgate University, also in Hamilton. He  received a full academic scholarship and graduated in 1952 with a  master's degree in science.   My mother's hometown also happens to be Hamilton, where she and Jim  attended high school together. At Colgate, Jim also met my father, who  was a college classmate of his.   Immediately following Jim's graduation from Colgate, Jim went on to  serve in the United States Army. After honorably serving our Nation,  Jim continued his lifelong journey of service and moved back to Mohawk  Valley, where he dedicated 66 years of his life in the town of New  Hartford.   Upon his return, James began his 31-year career in New Hartford  School District, serving as a math and science teacher, a coach, a  guidance counselor, and a principal for both the junior high and senior  high school.   I had a the honor of attending New Hartford High School during his  tenure as principal. Back to Mr. VanSlyke, as I always called him. He  was respected, sometimes feared, but always a person with common sense  and someone who could be relied on for sage advice for many high school  students, including me.   Later in his life, Jim ventured into another form of public service,  where he served seven terms as the town and village justice for the  town of New Hartford.   Jim was regarded as a knowledgeable, fair, and hardworking man,  always making sure that he knew each aspect of the law relevant to the  case at hand.                                time  2045    If Jim didn't know the answer to something, he was quick to admit it  and also quick to find the answer. He was willing always to listen to  another's perspective, including other attorneys. His intelligence was  self-evident but humbly portrayed.   As an attorney, I appeared before Jim on many occasions in court. He  always asked me about my family, and especially my mother's sister,  whom he was quite fond of, my Aunt Polly, who was also a classmate at  Hamilton High School.   Jim was also a very talented high school athlete and a college  athlete, as I learned from my mother kind of the hard way. I am always  going to remember, there was an article written by someone I actually  went to Colgate with, I believe, and it was in Sports Illustrated. It  described Jim's famous son, who is a professional baseball player and  also my classmate in high school. He used to sit right behind me, a  baseball player named Andy Van Slyke, who many know, who also later  became a coach. I remember the article described Jim Van Slyke and Andy  as coming from a family with no athletic talent, to which my mother  immediately said:         He was the star of Hamilton High School in every sport, and       he went on to Colgate to be a star as well.    Though Jim never served as a professional athlete like his son, Andy,  Jim was a star in all of our minds. He was a terrific person, a great  educator, and later in life found a passion for cooking. His culinary  skills provided another way to express his deep love for his family by  bringing them together at the dining room table.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the life of one of New  Hartford's greatest educators, Jim Van Slyke. Our community will  forever remember the life and legacy of Jim Van Slyke. We will also  remember Jim's sense of humor and his kind and humble manner in every  aspect of his life.   Expressing Gratitude to Constituents, Members, Supporters, Family, and                                   Staff     Mr. Speaker, I now want to just say a few words about my  term in the 115th Congress and what an honor and a privilege it has  been for me to serve.   I want to first thank my constituents who have been terrific. I have  really enjoyed my time with them, serving them, and working very hard  every day to try to find results--actually excellent results--in the  115th Congress. I think we have reached some unprecedented levels in  our last 2 years.   I also want to thank my supporters. They were terrific, a lot of fun.  It was a great time, a lot of hard work, a lot of anguish, and a lot of  frustration. But through it all, they were very tough and hung in there  in spite of our loss this past November.   A lot of my volunteers, also among the supporters, were terrific. I  want to thank them for so much work, so many phone calls, and just a  great opportunity to serve with them.   I also want to thank a lot of the people in our community who serve  in social service agencies who have done so much to help the truly  neediest people in our communities. I am grateful that they reached out  to me and I was able to give back to them and provide much-needed  resources on the Federal level. I really appreciate their good counsel  and care and what they provided to me and my staff in making sure that  we were able to understand the issues and bring those issues back to  Washington and deliver to our constituents.   I wanted to also thank the local officials in my district throughout  the community who have been an invaluable resource for bringing issues  to the table that needed to be resolved and their hard work, their  belief in me and some of the amazing accomplishments we had throughout  the eight-county region and to the many towns and villages, it was  really an honor to serve.   Some of the resources we brought back to the city were tremendous. So  I want to thank them for their sage advice, their counsel, and their  good friendship. I hope that we can continue to provide solutions and  realize good things for them in the future.   Also I thank my friends and my family who have been through a lot in  my rather short time in public service. It has been very exciting and  filled with a lot of ups and downs, but a lot of challenges. I am just  grateful for them to kind of hang in there with me through all of this.   I stand here today as a Member of the 115th Congress. I also served  three terms in the New York State Assembly. I have been a lifelong  Republican. I never missed a vote since I was 18.  [[Page H10505]]  Oddly enough, I have never been endorsed by my local Republican  committee for any office I ever sought until this year. So maybe it is  bad luck in the end. But I wanted to just say thank you to so many of  the rank and file and people who serve in this capacity in both sides,  in all parties, in what they bring to the table and how important it is  to our constitutional Republic and democratic principles. I want to  just say I am grateful to them.   Toward that, I also want to just say thank you, especially to my  colleagues. You hear so many terrible things about Congress, and I  myself thought: What is wrong with these people here?   But I have gotten here and realize there really are terrific people  who care about this country. They care about their constituents, they  care about preserving our constitutional Republic, they care about  democratic principles, they care about serving mankind, and they  recognize the importance of where we are in the world. I say that about  people I have met genuinely on both sides of the aisle, there are  really terrific people who serve in this office. I may not agree with  everything that they have to say, but they have been really terrific to  me.   I especially want to thank my freshman class. They have changed my  life in so many ways. It has been such an honor, including, Mr.  Speaker, a couple of my favorite colleagues here, but I wanted to say  that I really appreciate the fact that our freshman class, the incoming  class for the 115th Congress, took a very special measure. It was  spearheaded by my colleague, Congressman Mike Johnson. We signed a  commitment to civility; something that I thought was a really great  idea, a terrific idea, something that really meant a lot to us who have  signed on to this. We have endeavored to stick to that commitment to  civility. I know I have.    Among some of the pledges we made was to introduce legislation and  make every effort to make sure it was bipartisan. I am honored to say  that every piece of legislation that I authored, unless it was district  specific, was cosponsored by one of my Democratic colleagues, and I  always wanted to get one of my freshman class members when I could. So  I am grateful to all the Democrats and the Republicans, everyone who  signed that commitment and came forward to try to work on resolutions  to stand together and to really work to get to know each other.   I think we did make a difference. Unfortunately, it isn't sound-bite  worthy. The media didn't really cover it. But I think it is something  people should really look at that makes our class so unique and why we  accomplished so much this first term.   I really want to just say thank you all to my family. My family has  been terrific. They stood through a lot. It was very hard for my family  to go through the political process, as ugly as it has become, which is  why that commitment to civility is so important and why I was so  dedicated to it.   It is okay to advance your cause, to argue, and to disagree. I am a  lawyer. That is a natural instinct, and that is good. But to make sure  in the end that we don't hold grudges, that we stand for each other and  respect each other when we walk away, and I think our freshman class  showed that this year. I am honored and proud to be part of that.   I am not done, but I think that my colleague from Texas (Mr.  Arrington) would like to say a few words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Arrington.    Thank you so much Representative Arrington. You are  terrific.   I might add something about the commitment to civility and why it  really reflects who you are also and why it was such an honor to serve  with you. I remember all of us having the discussion, the freshman  class, with the Democrats. We were at one of our social events, and you  were just always the consummate ``let's get along, let's be ladies and  gentlemen, let's work together. We have got to do this, because in the  end the tables are going to turn. You are going to be in power, and we  are not, or you are going to be in the majority, and let's just not  look at that. Let's go beyond that.''   I still remember those conversations with you. You are a terrific  Member. You served honorably. You have a wonderful family. I really am  grateful for your friendship and your support.   None of these friendships end here. This is an amazing 2 years in  this 115th Congress. I think it was really special. Maybe everybody  feels that way when they go to Congress, but I think our group was  really different, and I am including the Democrats in that as well.   We had a great group, and as we move into 116--I am sorry I am not  going to be joining you all--but let's keep on the tradition of what we  have done. Let's stay together and continue to work to protect our  constitutional Republic.   I am a huge Lincoln fan, and I have said this many times, certainly  in my community, but I look back on some of the tough times that we are  facing ahead, and I remember what Lincoln said at one point. I would  say the enduring message from his body of work was: Can we save this  Republic? Can we save it? Can we be self-governing?   We can, but we have to work together. We have to fight the fight. We  have to stand on our principles and find a way to compromise in the  end. I feel like that is what we have done with so many great bills and  so many accomplishments. If you look at what happened in the 115th--and  I think we can all take credit for this across the board--the  accomplishments are something that we haven't seen in decades in  Congress. In just one Congress all of our agenda was passed and done,  and much of it was bipartisan. I wish it all were, but maybe as we go  into the 116th we can make that happen as well.   But I just want to say thank you so much to you and all my colleagues  who served with me, whether they are in the freshman class or not, I  love you guys. You have been terrific. My life has changed, and my life  is better because of my service here and meeting all of you and finding  out, yes, there are really good people who serve this Nation, and they  are here in Congress--not everybody. But there are a lot of us out  there.   I am so proud and honored to have been serving here for 2 years and  to have met the people I met, whether they are in Congress, whether  they are the great staff or the people who work here, the people behind  me who we keep up at late hours to do their job, but it has really been  an honor. I want to say thank you so much to you.    One last thing, I do want to say thank you to--first of all, I want  to thank again the chairman of my committee, the Honorable Jeb  Hensarling--who is retiring--for his terrific service and great work  and what an honor it was to serve on the Financial Services Committee.   Also to the staff of the Financial Services Committee, I want to say  thank you. They were terrific, and they helped us every day come up  with an incredible agenda and very bipartisan work. I am grateful to  them to have had a number of bills that were originally sponsored by me  that either  [[Page H10506]]  were included in other bills, the S. 2155, or others, and for their  help in getting those across the finish line and having five original  sponsored bills that ultimately became law.   So I want to say thank you to them.   I also want to say thank you, last but not least, to my hardworking  staff. First of all, I put them in alphabetical order so you don't know  who is better than the other, but I want to say I loved having them on  my staff. They did a tremendous job.   Let me just say a hearty thank you to my staffers, Hannah Andrews,  Alexandra Cade, Haim Engelman, George Iverson, Maria Giurastante--I can  never say Maria's name--Kate Kelly brought me to New Orleans my first  time, Samantha LaMarca who was with me from the times in the assembly,  Rebecca Lumsden, Patrick O'Brien, Nick Stewart, Robert Simpson, Michael  Stademeier, Kathy Vences, Brett Wakeman, and Katie Ziemba.   I want to thank so many terrific interns who joined us and inspired  us every single day with their excitement, their youth, their  enthusiasm, and the fact that they were all so much more technically  proficient than I was, so I could just hand them my phone with trust  that they could fix whatever it was that was wrong with it. I want to  say thank you to them for the hard work and the hours that you put in  throughout the last 2 years.   It wasn't easy. We were in a tough position, whether it was the  media, whether it was just the position we were in as a targeted seat  in the Nation. But you came through. We did terrific work. We made  groundbreaking strides in our community.   I want to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you to all of you  for what you have done and what you have done to serve us and serve my  community and always have a servant's heart as you dealt with all the  constituents and the literally, I don't know if it is thousands, but  every time one of my constituents contacted me directly and I got to  the message, I copied, I pasted, and I sent it to you, and you reacted  and helped the constituent out.                                time  2100    I really am grateful to all of you for doing that because I love the  job that I do. I love serving. I love doing this kind of work to help  people. For the first time, I really felt like we got to help people in  the last 2 years.   Again, I want to say the last thank you to my family members: my son  and my parents. My parents, who passed away, never got to know that I  actually got here. I just want to say thank you to them for instilling  in me the integrity, the loyalty to people and the compassion for  fellow human beings and for helping this world, and also for the  tenacity that I got from my mother, who was really my inspiration.   I want to just say one of my favorite quotes that my dad used to  always say when I used to be in all the sports I attended, whether it  was curling--yes, I am a curler--whether it was basketball, horse  shows, equestrian--I did that as well--golf and a lot of sports I got  into, my father would quote, when I was disappointed that I didn't win,  from Rudyard Kipling's poem ``If.'' I am just going to pick out part of  it. ``If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster and treat those two  imposters just the same,'' and the poem goes on. But that is exactly  what it is. It isn't about winning and losing. It is about how you play  the game. We did a great job.   I want to say thank you, lastly, to my son, who has been my  inspiration. I am hoping that I get to see him at Christmas, but I am  not sure I will, because he is currently serving as a captain in the  Marine Corps. So we are very proud of him in our family for answering  the call to serve.   But I do want to say thank you so much again to everyone who has been  so kind to me. Whether it is Pat and Doris, the ladies in the Lindy  Boggs Room, everyone who is working here, it is really a highly  professional operation. You hear terrible things about Congress, but it  is not true. There are a lot of terrific people that work here that  aren't just Members. They are the people who keep the trains running on  time, the people who make this happen.   I just want to say thank you again for letting me have this  tremendous honor to do what I have done for the last 2 years. I wish  everyone the best of luck and God bless.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you, again, to my  colleague, Jodey Arrington, of west Texas, for his terrific remarks.  Yes, we did accomplish basically everything we set out to do in the  115th Congress.   I would be remiss if I didn't mention one more thing that Mr.  Arrington just referenced, the gentleman from Texas, is that every one  of us contributed in the freshmen class to perpetuating and finding a  new part of our commitment to civility.   I just wanted to mention our colleague from Florida, Mr. Charlie  Crist, who actually came up with these nice bands that so many of us  wear. It says: Practice the Golden Rule. It is emblematic. We wear them  because we are endeavoring to meet our pledge for our commitment to  civility.   I hope that you all and Congressman Crist and everyone continues on  this great path next year, including both sides of the aisle. I hope  everybody works on their commitment to civility.   But I want to say thank you again to my colleagues, also to our  Speaker pro tempore, the great president of our class, the amazing  General Jack Bergman, who is now a Member of Congress representing  Michigan. I am really honored to be among some of the great people that  serve here. I want people to rest assured there are good people in  Congress. There really are.
