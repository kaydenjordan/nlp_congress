 Madam Speaker, on many different occasions I have come to  this Chamber to point out exactly how we arrived at this moment where  we are experiencing record-breaking inflation. Each time, congressional  Democrats' desire to recklessly spend trillions of taxpayer dollars  continues to be the answer.   Here I am again, as the House prepares to vote on yet another  spending bill costing hundreds of billions of dollars filled with  socialist wish list items that increases Federal spending by double- digit and triple-digit percentage increases in some cases.   I, of course, will vote ``no,'' not only because it increases the  size of our government by increasing spending on non-defense programs  by 14 percent, but because it also fails to include the Hyde amendment,  which is a longstanding bipartisan agreement that protects taxpayer  dollars for being used to fund abortions.   Overall, the bill would increase the budget for the Environmental  Protection Agency by 20 percent, increase the budget for general  government activities by 17 percent, and include a 10 percent increase  for the Food and Drug Administration--the very same department that  botched the baby formula shortage.   This funding bill rewards bad behavior by giving funding increases to  departments that have failed the American people. It encourages illegal  immigration. It discourages increasing our domestic energy output by  restricting offshore oil and gas activities, and it fails to fund our  national defense priorities like the sea-launched nuclear cruise  missile.   It has been almost 2 years of complete Democratic control of  government. Instead of addressing the root causes of the crisis  Democrats created, this bill doubles down on their failed socialist  agenda. Tennesseans are fed up with the out-of-control spending here in  Washington. Americans all across the country are fed up with it, too.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, inflation is at the highest rate it has been  since 1981. Meanwhile, Congressional Democrats are spending this week  passing a funding bill full of liberal initiatives that will fan the  flames of the already red-hot inflation Tennesseans are facing due to  Democrats' reckless spending.   When will enough be enough?   Madam Speaker, Democrats' socialist spending spree includes an  overall 14 percent increase in domestic funding, a 20 percent increase  to the Environmental Protection Agency, and a 10 percent increase to  the FDA, the same department that failed to quickly address the baby  formula shortage when we all knew it was coming.   Borrowing more money from China, throwing it out the door and forcing  our grandchildren to pay it back only creates more problems, not solve  them. We need to return to our commonsense roots and end this  inflationary spending now.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time on the floor today to  speak about these important matters.   Mr. Speaker, when Tennesseans go to the gas pump and grocery store,  they are constantly reminded of the fact that everything was much more  affordable only 1 year ago.   Since President Biden has taken office and congressional Democrats  have recklessly borrowed and spent trillions of dollars, the cost of  living has skyrocketed at a rate not seen since 1981--when I was just a  junior in high school.   Common sense will tell you, this massive amount of deficit spending  overheated the economy and created a labor shortage from folks staying  home instead of working. Common sense will also tell you, that the only  way to fix this issue is to turn the money spigots off here in  Washington and stop this borrow and spend economic death spiral.   Unfortunately, common sense has again failed this Chamber as House  Democrats passed earlier today a funding bill filled with partisan  initiatives costing hundreds of billions of dollars. The socialist  spending bill House Democrats passed today increased some accounts by  double and even triple-digit percentages in some cases.   It rewards the Food and Drug Administration, which failed to quickly  address the baby formula shortage with a budget increase. It also  increases the budget for the Department of Homeland Security, who  instead of enforcing our laws and stopping illegal immigration, is  encouraging it by attempting to repeal title 42. It even increases the  budget to maintain and improve Federal buildings by 12 percent, even  though many of these buildings have been mostly empty for the last 2  years.   There are a lot of bad policies in this bill, but one of the worst  has to be the exclusion of the Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment is a  bipartisan amendment that has existed for decades to prevent your  taxpayer dollars from being used to help fund abortions. This is  completely incomprehensible to me. In no way, shape, or form should  taxpayers be subsidizing abortions with taxpayer dollars.   Tennesseans are sick and tired of borrowing money from China and  forcing their grandchildren to foot the bill. The State of Tennessee  should serve as a role model for Members of Congress. We have been  committed in Tennessee to enacting fiscally responsible policies up and  down each level of government. We don't even have a State income tax,  and yet are still able to fund the government without driving our State  into a hole of debt from which we will never get out.  [[Page H6911]]    I just can't help but think how one-party rule in Washington has  completely failed the American people. Democrats have controlled both  Chambers of Congress and the executive branch for almost 2 years now  and Americans are paying the price.   Tennesseans are rightfully upset with their Federal Government and  feel as though their concerns about the future of this country are not  being heard. A recent poll shows that in April of 2020, during the  height of the COVID lockdowns, Americans actually thought our Nation's  future looked brighter than it does right now.   We can't continue down this path. We must do everything we can to  rein-in the reckless spending. As interest rates begin to rise, our $30  trillion--and rising--national debt will only continue to get more  expensive as the interest on the debt grows right along with it,  squeezing out funding for other vital programs. With interest rates now  rising at a rapid clip, it is all just a ticking time bomb ready to go  off.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle to listen to the American people and Tennesseans back home and do  what is right for the sake of our country and our children. Recognize  the policy failures of the last 2 years and commit to joining  Republicans in our desire to restore fiscal common sense.
