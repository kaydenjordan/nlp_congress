 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3326, the World Bank  Accountability Act. Frankly, I don't quite understand why every Member  is not rising in support of H.R. 3326.  [[Page H441]]    This is important legislation, which is sponsored by my friend from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade  Subcommittee. It was cosponsored by a senior Democrat on our committee,  the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman). Mr. Chairman, it passed  our committee by a unanimous vote 60-0. Again, Mr. Chairman, this  measure passed our committee by a unanimous vote of 60-0.   H.R. 3326 makes a share of future World Bank appropriations  contingent upon vitally needed reforms, with focus on the World Bank's  International Development Association, known as IDA, which is the World  Bank's concessional lending window, dedicated to 75 of the world's  poorest countries.   Mr. Chairman, the reforms in this bill have emerged from five  different oversight hearings held in our committee over the past 2  years and they all enjoy bipartisan support.   The bill also supports the administration's goal of ensuring that the  World Bank's work is consistent with U.S. priorities that are,  obviously, financed by the U.S. taxpayer. In the President's FY 2018  budget, the administration called for a holding to account  international organizations whose missions don't advance U.S. foreign  policy's interest or which haven't been well managed. H.R. 3326 would  enact the administration's request for a 15 percent reduction on  authorized funds for IDA.   In addition, Mr. Barr's legislation contains crucial national  security provisions, including a prohibition on World Bank assistance  to countries that knowingly violate U.N. Security Council sanctions on  North Korea.   Also, safeguarding our national security is a provision that helps  ensure World Bank assistance won't be used for state sponsors of  terrorism.   Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense requirement that benefited from  the input of our democratic colleague on the committee: again, Mr.  Sherman from California.   So, again, Mr. Chairman, it does kind of beg the questions: Why are  we here today? Why are we debating a bill that received support from  every single Republican and Democrat on the committee?   As some who may be viewing our proceedings know, there is such a  thing known as a suspension calendar for relatively noncontroversial  items. This bill should have been dispensed with on what is known as a  suspension calendar since it passed our committee 60-0.   But now, apparently, the ranking member has had a change of heart on  opposing a bill that she voted for on committee. So some may be  confused, and indeed we are confused. It is interesting that we now see  opposition to linking these IDA payments to reforms, but that is  exactly what Democrats on the Financial Services Committee did in 2005.  It is exactly what they did when they voted to withhold 25 percent of  IDA funds in a foreign operation's appropriations bill. Last July, the  ranking member, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters),  consistent with her earlier vote, voted in support of H.R. 3326 as  well. So, again, some of us are confused as to why it is being opposed  now if she has voted for the policy of withholding twice, including  voting for the very bill we are debating today.    It is also important to note, Mr. Chairman, that the reforms included  in this bill are those that the World Bank itself deems are important.  As far back as 1992, a bank management review highlighted its perverse  staff incentives that made pushing money out the door more important  than making a dent in global poverty. And as recently as 2014, a bank  evaluation report confirmed that these very same perverse incentives  are still in place.   Then there is the notorious case of mismanagement in the Uganda  Transport Sector Development Project: a scandalous bank initiative,  where basic lack of project oversight led to sexual exploitation of  underage girls, repeated harassment of female staff, and deficient  safety measures that very well may have resulted in five fatalities-- lest we forget.   In 2015, the World Bank's president had this to say:         The multiple failures we have seen in this project on the       part of the World Bank, the government of Uganda, and a       government contractor are unacceptable. It is our obligation       to properly supervise all investment projects to ensure that       the poor and vulnerable are protected in our work. In this       case, we did not.        I am committed to making sure that we do everything in our       power, working with other stakeholders first, to fully review       the circumstance of this project, and then to quickly learn       from our, and other's, failures so they do not happen again.    Mr. Chairman, if the World Bank thinks these reforms are necessary,  shouldn't we all think these reforms are necessary?   And how about the testimony of Sasha Chavkin, a reporter for the  International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, who testified  before our committee?   Sasha said:         We found that, over a decade, spanning from 2004 to 2013,       projects financed by the World Bank physically or       economically displaced an estimated 3.4 million people around       the world.    Mr. Chairman, these are some of the world's most vulnerable displaced  by the World Bank that screams out for more reforms.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Barr for saying with his legislation that  enough is enough. He has produced a serious, long overdue reform bill,  one that was supported in our committee unanimously 60-0. We typically  could not get a 60-0 vote on a Mother's Day resolution, yet we have it  for this bill. Again, it just begs credibility and credulity as to why  are we here today debating a bill that was passed unanimously in  committee. I urge the House to adopt it unanimously.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the sponsor of the legislation that passed  unanimously 60-0 in our committee and the chairman of the Financial  Services Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say  when my colleague on the other side of the aisle talks about meaningful  participation, not one single amendment was offered by my Democratic  friends. It was a perfect bill. It passed 60-0.   I would also point out the only leverage we have as the United States  is our contribution, and that is what this bill does.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Huizenga), the chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on  Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.                                time  1515     Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased now to yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), the vice chairman of Financial  Services Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), another hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee who knows this bill passed 60-0 with no Democratic  amendments offered.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds again to say  it is an interesting narrative being told by the minority, but they  offered no amendments, voted for the bill 60-0. We have heard nothing  for 6 months until last Friday, the first time they decided to  articulate a specific concern about a bill they had already supported.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Hill), the majority whip of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First, Mr. Chairman, let me get the whole process debate out of the  way. Anybody who is watching this debate has got to be scratching their  head at the proposition that every single one of my Democratic  colleagues who come to the floor to denounce H.R. 3326 have already  voted for it. They voted for it 60-0 in committee.   Mr. Chairman, do you know how many amendments they offered in that  markup, their opportunity to refine the legislation, their opportunity  to improve the legislation, their opportunity to put their imprimatur  on the legislation? Do you know how many amendments they offered? Zero.  Zero amendments were offered by the minority who now claim that somehow  they were cut out of the process.   For 6 months, we have been waiting, waiting to bring this bill,  waiting to hear about these improvements, and only three legislative  days ago did, finally, the Democrats deign to offer any new improvement  to this bill.    So I think, Mr. Chairman, she doth protest too much. And now what I  don't understand, Mr. Chairman, is how my Democratic colleagues can  defend some of these rogue regimes and some of the activities of the  World Bank.   Dr. Jean Ensminger, Edie and Lew Wasserman professor of social  science at Caltech, testified that there is corruption throughout World  Bank projects in remote areas of Kenya near the Somali border.   She said: ``As I dug more deeply, it became apparent that corruption  had been entrenched in the project since 2000.'' And we are talking  about the poorest of the poor.   She goes on to say:         As the board was about to renew the project for 5 years,       finally, the internal investigation showed that 62 percent of       the transactions were fraudulent.    Except my friends on the other side of the aisle: It doesn't matter.  Don't worry about the fraud. Just send them U.S. taxpayer money. It  doesn't matter that the poor aren't actually helped. Just send them  money because it makes us feel good.   Sasha Chavkin from the International Consortium of Investigative  Journalists testified--and I alluded to this earlier about the forced  displacement of the poorest of the poor caused by projects financed by  the World Bank.   He went on to testify: ``We found, instead, that the bank repeatedly  funded governments that not only failed to adequately resettle  communities, but, in some cases, were accused of human rights abuses  such as rape, murder, and violent evictions associated with bank  projects. We found in several cases that the World Bank continued to  bankroll these borrowers even after evidence of these abuses came to  light.''   We have a bill to reform that, to make sure the poor are actually  helped, to ensure that instead of taxpayer money going to rape, murder,  and violent evictions, that it actually goes to help the poor. And why  my Democratic colleagues who were once for it are now against it is  beyond me.   We certainly know about the infamous World Bank project, road  project, in western Uganda where it was associated with an increase in  sexual exploitation of young girls. Teenage girls were being sexually  harassed on the way to school. Many were sexually exploited or wagged  by project workers, and once this became known, the World Bank denied  it.   So we have the simple bill to say that the U.S. taxpayer will demand  accountability. We will demand reforms. People should be aghast at how  this money has been spent at the World Bank. It is not how much money  you spend. It is how you spend the money. And if we want reforms, we  are going to have some accountability, something that my friends on the  other side of the aisle used to support, and they should be ashamed  that they are not supporting it today.   We must all support H.R. 3326. I very much commend the gentleman from  Kentucky for bringing this valuable piece of legislation to the floor.   Mr. Chairman, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, not only do I want to thank him for his leadership in  providing accountability to the World Bank to ensure that the poorest  of the poor are truly helped and that the hardworking, beleaguered  taxpayer has his funds respected, but I also want to thank him for this  amendment and his previous work to ensure that sanctions on one of the  most dangerous regimes on the face of the planet, North Korea, are  actually effective. We know the threat that North Korea presents to all  of our constituents and our country.   So I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his leadership, and I urge  the adoption of his amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Holding) having assumed the chair, Mr. Palmer, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3326) to  increase accountability, combat corruption, and strengthen management  effectiveness at the World Bank, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
