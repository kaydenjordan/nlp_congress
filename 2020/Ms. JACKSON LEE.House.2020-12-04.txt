 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1244, I  call up the bill (H.R. 3884) to decriminalize and deschedule cannabis,  to provide for reinvestment in certain persons adversely impacted by  the War on Drugs, to provide for expungement of certain cannabis  offenses, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate and find relief in the opportunity  to speak on behalf of H.R. 3884, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment  and Expungement Act of 2020, or the MORE Act of 2020.   I have great determination for the American people who, with a  majority of Democrats and Republicans, understand the importance of the  MORE Act, and I believe it is important to pass a long overdue measure,  and I encourage the rest of my colleagues to do so as well.   I don't rise today to promote drug use. I don't rise today to harm  those young people who are in the beginning of their life.   I do not rise today to undermine law enforcement. In fact, in  speaking to a representative of the law enforcement community,  detailing this legislation, there was a great relief and understanding  of the fairness and the justice that would be rendered with the passage  of the MORE Act.   It has taken us a long time to get here, and I would like to take the  opportunity to thank all of those who have made it possible for us to  consider this bill today; in particular, my colleague, our chairman on  the House Judiciary Committee, the author of this  [[Page H6828]]  bill, Chairman Jerry Nadler. He has worked without ceasing on this  legislation, as well as two very determined colleagues who have  continued their advocacy, and they were particularly instrumental in  getting us here, Congresswoman Barbara Lee and Congressman Earl  Blumenauer.   To summarize the provisions of the MORE Act, they fall into two  categories: First, simply, it would remove marijuana or cannabis from  the list or schedule of Federally controlled substances. This means  that, going forward, individuals could no longer be prosecuted  federally for marijuana offenses.   This does not mean that marijuana would now be legal in the entire  United States, as some have tried to argue. It would simply remove the  Federal Government from interfering with State laws and State  structures in the business of prosecuting marijuana cases and would  leave the question of legality to the individual States.   Those States choosing to decriminalize can do so without ongoing  interference from the Federal Government; and those States that choose  to continue to make marijuana illegal can continue to do so as well.   Second, the bill would establish a taxation structured to collect a  sales tax on marijuana which, over the course of 5 years, could  increase from 5 to 8 percent. The funds collected through this tax will  be used to establish a trust to do good, to reinvest in communities  ravaged by the war on drugs. I know it firsthand, by living and growing  up in those communities, those communities of color and those  communities beyond.   What I would also say is it would bring banking a relief. Businesses  who ultimately will come from this legislation, legally, will have the  legal right and opportunity to secure legal banking relationships. The  trust fund will be used for rehabilitation and re-entry programs in the  Department of Justice and for programs in the Small Business  Administration to ensure that the growing marijuana market is diverse  and opens up opportunities for entrepreneurship in communities that  have been adversely impacted by the war on drugs.   In the last week, in my community, a bright, young individual was  killed because of marijuana, marijuana sales. A bright light, yes, was  extinguished in a minute with violence. This is what we want to see  eliminated. We want a government structure that saves lives.   Finally, the bill would expunge and seal Federal marijuana arrests  and convictions and resentence offenders as appropriate, a much-needed  measure to try to undo the damage that has been done to our communities  since marijuana was arbitrarily placed on the list of controlled  substances back in 1970.   The numbers are staggering but, most of all, the numbers are  staggering with the imbalance of prosecution of African Americans and  people of Latinx heritage, Hispanic heritage. What an imbalance. What a  massive infusion of incarceration across this Nation.   Thousands of men and women have suffered needlessly from the Federal  criminalization of marijuana, particularly in communities of color, and  have born the burden of collateral consequences for those ensnared in  the criminal legal system that have damaged our society across  generations. This is unacceptable, and we must change our laws.   It is time for Congress to catch up with the reforms that States have  enacted. It is time for Congress to catch up with Americans. Thirty-six  States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam have adopted  laws allowing legal access to cannabis. Fifteen States, the District of  Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands have adopted laws legalizing  cannabis for adult recreational use.   A total of 47 States have reformed their laws in one form or another  pertaining to cannabis, despite its Federal criminalization.   The State legal cannabis industry already employs almost a quarter of  a million people, and the Federal Government needs to get out of the  way of State-level decisionmaking for their citizens.   We need to open the door to research, better banking, and tax laws.  We need to help fuel economic growth in this industry. We need to save  lives. We need to help young people. We need to bring our Nation  together.   And we need to do this without continuing to spend Federal resources  on criminalization and unjust incarceration for marijuana offenses.   We need to pass the MORE Act.   That is why I support it, and that is why I believe it is important  for us to unify and support this bill today. And I ask my colleagues to  do the same.   Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of the legislation and a senior member of  the Judiciary Committee, and its Subcommittee on Crime, Homeland  Security, and Terrorism, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3884, the  ``Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2020,'' or  ``MORE Act of 2020.''   I support this legislation because it accomplishes three very  important things.   First, it removes marijuana, or cannabis, from the list--or the  schedule--of Federally controlled substances.   This means that, going forward, individuals could no longer be  prosecuted, federally, for marijuana offenses.   To be clear, this does not mean that marijuana would now be legal in  the entire United States--it would simply remove the Federal government  from the business of prosecuting marijuana cases and would leave the  question of legality to the individual States.   States choosing to decriminalize can do so, without ongoing  interference from the Federal government, and those states that choose  to continue to make marijuana illegal can continue to do so, as well.   Second, the bill sets up a taxation structure to collect a sales tax  on marijuana, which, over the course of five years would increase from  five to eight percent.   The funds collected through this tax will be used to establish a  trust fund to reinvest in communities ravaged by the War on Drugs and  in communities of color.   The trust fund will be used for rehabilitation and reentry programs  in the Department of Justice and for programs in the Small Business  Administration to ensure that the burgeoning marijuana market is  diverse and opens up opportunities for entrepreneurship in communities  that have been adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.   Finally, the bill would expunge and seal Federal marijuana  convictions and resentence offenders, as appropriate--a much-needed  measure to try to undo the damage that has been done to our communities  since marijuana was arbitrarily placed on the list of controlled  substances, back in 1970.   Mr. Speaker, thousands of men and women have suffered needlessly from  the federal criminalization of marijuana, particularly in communities  of color, and have born the burden of the collateral consequences for  those ensnared in the criminal legal system that have damaged our  society across generations.   The racially disproportionate prosecution of marijuana offenses is,  in fact, a real problem at the federal level, and is not just a problem  at the state and local level.   Data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission proves the prosecution of  cannabis offenses at the federal level disproportionately affects  minority communities.   According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, about 84 percent of the  more than 2,000 marijuana offenders who were federally sentenced in  2018 were people of color.   Only 11 percent were white, even though more than 60 percent of the  U.S. population is white.   This is unacceptable and we much change our laws.   It is time for Congress to catch up with the times and the reforms  that states are enacting.   Thirty-six states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam  have adopted laws allowing legal access to cannabis.   Fifteen states, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana  Islands have adopted laws for legalizing cannabis for adult  recreational use.   A total of 47 States have reformed their laws in one form or another  pertaining to cannabis, despite its Federal criminalization.   Mr. Speaker, the State legal-cannabis industry already employs almost  a quarter of a million people and the federal government needs to get  out of the way of state-level decision making for their citizens.   We need to open the door to research, better banking and tax laws,  and we need to help fuel economic growth in this industry.   And we need to do this without continuing to spend federal resources  on criminalization and unjust incarceration for marijuana offenses.   In short, Congress needs to pass the MORE Act.   Mr. Speaker, I will address briefly why certain objections raised  against the bill lack merit and should be disregarded.   Some opponents propose merely re-scheduling marijuana (instead of  descheduling it completely).   I oppose rescheduling marijuana to a lower schedule, such as Schedule  III, because that  [[Page H6829]]  would only benefit industry, as cannabis-related businesses could start  receiving tax breaks that would be prohibited if cannabis remained  scheduled under Schedules I or II.   Rescheduling marijuana would do absolutely nothing to address the  problem of enforcement of marijuana laws.   The Controlled Substances Act does not distinguish among the  different schedules for purposes of enforcement and this amendment does  not even touch the penalties associated with marijuana--including  draconian mandatory minimums.   Keeping marijuana on the schedule of controlled substances at all  will only continue to exacerbate disparities in the criminal justice  system and further entrench the issues currently presented by federal  marijuana prohibition, VA doctors will continue to be prohibited from  prescribing medical marijuana for suffering veterans, and federal  employees will still be subjected to random workplace drug testing for  off-the-job marijuana consumption.   Next, let me address the misconception that decriminalization of  marijuana at the federal level will lead to an increase in crime.   In fact, there is every reason to believe it would be the exact  opposite.   Studies show that:   1. Laws allowing adult use of marijuana are not associated with an  uptick in overall criminal activity.   2. Medical cannabis regulatory laws are not associated with an uptick  in overall criminal activity.   3. Retail cannabis facilities are not positively associated with  increased criminality and may play a role in the prevention of certain  crimes such as larceny.   There is no need to anticipate that federal descheduling of marijuana  will lead to more crime; states will still be allowed to leave in place  their criminal laws and regulations related to marijuana, if they  desire.   Mr. Speaker, what is now largely a cash business will finally have  access to banking, which will reduce the potential that lawfully  compliant businesses become targets for crime.   In fact, for this very reason, decriminalizing marijuana at the  federal level will enhance public safety.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, veterans consume marijuana at rates far  higher than the general population, and many vets report substituting  alcohol and prescription drugs with medicinal marijuana.   Veterans often report using cannabis to treat symptoms of chronic  pain and mood disorders, like post-traumatic stress. In fact, marijuana  used for medical purposes can help veterans ease their reliance on  prescription and non-prescription opioids for pain relief.   And the clinical data support the use of cannabis treatment for these  indications. Descheduling will allow VA doctors to prescribe marijuana  without fear of punishment, and it will allow the choice to be with  doctors and patients, where it belongs.   Descheduling marijuana, as this bill would do, will greatly benefit  our veterans.   Let me discuss briefly the expungement provisions in the legislation.   The expungement provisions relate only to marijuana offenses, which  are not per se violent offenses.   Punishment for other offenses committed simultaneously (or, for that  matter, at any other time) would remain in place.   In the past several years, Congress has undertaken significant  efforts to address the injustices inherent in our system of criminal  justice.   Criminal justice reform has been a bipartisan pursuit.   Expungement is a critical component of any legislation seeking to  address the disparities in our criminal justice system.   This is especially true in the context of marijuana arrests,  prosecutions, and convictions, which disproportionately affect  overcriminalized communities of color.   These are the communities that today continue to suffer most from the  consequences of our failed drug policies.   There are two different kinds of expungement processes established by  the MORE Act.   For those individuals who are in prison on a marijuana conviction or  still under some form of federal court supervision, expungement takes  place by way of resentencing, under the watch of a federal judge who  will reevaluate whether, based on the person's conviction or  convictions, it is appropriate to expunge or recalculate his or her  sentence.   For those individuals who have completely finished serving their  sentences and are no longer under court supervision, expungement would  help give them a fresh start--again, consistent with the principles of  criminal justice reform we have espoused in a bipartisan manner.   The collateral consequences suffered by those with marijuana  convictions are numerous and vast and they are the direct result of the  unfair and unwise placement of marijuana on Schedule I.   We can help undo the harm by expunging federal marijuana convictions  in the manner set forth in the MORE Act.   Mr. Speaker, in voting to pass the MORE Act, this body will promoting  public health and safety and delivering restorative justice.   I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 3884, the  ``Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2020.'   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Hon. Jerrold L. Nadler,       Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary,       House of Representatives, Washington, DC.         Dear Chairman Nadler: I write concerning H.R. 3884, the       Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of       2019. This bill was primarily referred to the Committee on       the Judiciary, and additionally to the Committee on Education       and Labor. As a result of Leadership and the Committee on       Judiciary having consulted with me concerning this bill       generally, I agree to forgo formal consideration of the bill       so the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee on Education and Labor takes this action with       our mutual understanding that by forgoing formal       consideration of H.R. 3884, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and we will be appropriately consulted and       involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward so       we may address any remaining issues within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I also request that you support my request to       name members of the Committee on Education and Labor to any       conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate a response confirming this       understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the committee report for H.R.       3884 or in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration thereof.            Sincerely,                                         Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, November 24, 2020.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Education and Labor, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       3884, the ``Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and       Expungement Act of 2019'' (the ``MORE Act of 2019'').        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Education and Labor. I acknowledge that your Committee will       not formally consider H.R. 3884 and agree that the inaction       of your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in       H.R. 3884 which fall within your Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.

Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H.R. 3884, the Marijuana       Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2019, the       Committee on Ways and Means agrees to waive formal       consideration of the bill as to provisions that fall within       the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.

The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 3884.

Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I write concerning H.R. 3884, the       ``Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungemnent Act of       2019,'' which was additionally referred to the Committee on       Energy and Commerce.

December 1, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       3884, the ``Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and       Expungement Act of 2019'' (the ``MORE Act of 2019'').        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy       and Commerce. I acknowledge that your Committee will not       formally consider H.R. 3884 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in       H.R. 3884 which fall within your Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction.         I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 3884.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, marijuana is not a gateway drug. There is ample  scientific evidence demonstrating that the use of marijuana does not  cause the use of other illicit substances. And according to the  National Institute on Drug Abuse, the majority of people who are  marijuana users do not go on to use other, harder substances.   The bill does not have any provision to sell marijuana to children.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a distinguished member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from Florida for making  this a bipartisan bill. I thank him for his insight, and I know that we  will have many opportunities to work together.   I might add, if we pass the MORE Act, we will allow veterans,  hospitals, and doctors to be engaged in research to help our returning  soldiers and veterans who are suffering from a variety of diseases that  may be impacted by marijuana use.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jeffries), a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee and chair  of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is interesting my good friend has been in different  places than we have been in the House Judiciary Committee, but he  remains my good friend.   Obviously, our hearing this week was on the devastation of COVID-19  in the Nation's Federal prisons, lives that are lost and lives that  could be lost if strong structures are not put in place. That is our  job.   I think the other point that should be made is that we will be made  safer by this legislation. I can't explain to him the life that I have  led, the neighborhood that I lived in, the amazing loss of young lives  over marijuana because it was illegal. As we watched not only the life  lost in bloodshed, but the life lost in incarceration--imbalanced  incarceration, huge sentences--the loss of opportunity, of college, of  housing, and of jobs.   We are crying out for relief. Interestingly enough, two out of three  Americans say marijuana should be legal, including a majority of both  Democrats and Republicans.   Finally, the taxation is on those who use marijuana. It is not on the  small business person, it is on those who use and buy marijuana. So I  hope that we can move forward on what the American people want us to  do.  [[Page H6833]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline), who is a distinguished member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, let me indicate that this legislation  does not take away any of the responsibilities of the Department of  Transportation in its regulatory authority, and the facts belie any  worries regarding road safety.   According to a 2018 study of the National Bureau of Economic  Research, States that have legalized marijuana have not experienced  significantly different rates of marijuana- or alcohol-related traffic  fatalities.   All of the State laws dealing with driving under the influence  remain. Operating a motor vehicle under the influence of marijuana is  still illegal in every State--we insist on that--and even in these  States that have legalized the substance, and the MORE Act leaves these  in place.   Mr. Speaker, we need to talk about the many deaths that have occurred  because of the violence over illegal marijuana. I have seen it. We have  seen it. We have lost lives in their future, and we have lost them to  their families.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I would hope my good friend would not  be in opposition to the ability for there to be research on the use of  marijuana, as well substance abuse, and as well to provide a healing  and a restoration of these broken communities that have suffered the  plague of marijuana arrests, incarceration, and prosecution. That is  what we are doing in the MORE Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time each side  has remaining.    Mr. Speaker, you know what I am most--how should I  say it?--honestly grateful for in the backdrop of Thanksgiving? That we  had a Speaker of the House who never stopped negotiating and trying to  find relief for the dying Americans and those suffering from COVID-19  with a major infusion of dollars almost 8 months ago. I am grateful for  that.   I am grateful that we are now in the midst, if you will--late, but  engaging--of negotiations, and that we are committed not to leave this  place, not to go home for any holidays before we provide relief for the  American people. I am grateful for that. That is going to happen.   So it is important to note that work is going on, led by our Speaker,  and we hope that we will have the right partner to be able to save the  lives of the American people who are now suffering from COVID-19. The  MORE Act also saves lives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lee), distinguished member of the Committee on Appropriations and  one of the strongest advocates for the MORE Act to save lives, to help  young people.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), one of the determined and strong advocates for  this legislation, a distinguished member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).  [[Page H6836]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say that the aggressive enforcement of  marijuana possession laws needlessly ensnares hundreds of thousands of  people into the criminal justice system and wastes billions of taxpayer  dollars. I can assure you that States are able to protect our children,  which we will discuss in a later moment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez), the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the amount of time  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), a distinguished member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the distinguished chair of the  Oversight and Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me indicate very quickly that every 37 seconds,  between 2001 and 2010, there were 8 million arrests, every 37 seconds,  for marijuana. We spent $3.6 billion on the war on marijuana, and it  has not worked. We do today what saves lives.   We know that States are going to be able to continue to protect their  children, and this does not undermine the ability of Congress to  protect children as well. In every State that has legalized marijuana,  they have developed a comprehensive set of regulations to protect  consumers.   We also recognize that this issue of vaping is not generated by  marijuana use. With a comprehensive structure, we will be able to  protect children and not be selling marijuana to children. Those who  have died in our communities may now live. As well, we will further  understand the importance of a structure that is about restoration of  justice. The imbalance against people of color has been a tragedy.   Mr. Speaker, the MORE Act is crucial to be able to pass, and I ask my  colleagues to do so vigorously as we also fight COVID-19.   Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to thank the following  Members and committee and Member staff for their outstanding work on  the MORE Act: Joe Graupensperger, Milagros Cisneros, Christine Leonard,  Barbara Lee, Earl Blumenauer, Nydia Velazquez, and Frank Pallone.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
