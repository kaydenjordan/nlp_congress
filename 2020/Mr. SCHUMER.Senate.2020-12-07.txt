 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last night we received the sad news  that a former colleague of ours, one of our finest, Paul Sarbanes, had  passed away.   While our time in the Senate only overlapped for one term, Senator  Sarbanes made a deep impression. Known as the ``stealth Senator,'' he  was low-key but extremely effective. He was a leader on a wide-ranging  group of issues, from environmental stewardship, to consumer privacy,  to anything having to do with his home State of Maryland. He was very  soft-spoken, but he had determination like iron and worked and worked  and worked on issue after issue until he achieved his goals.   We mourn the passing of this beloved former colleague and this  consummate Senator.
