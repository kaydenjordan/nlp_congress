 Mr. Speaker, I am providing this statement to explain the  Reforming Disaster Recovery Act of 2019 (H.R. 3702), as ordered  reported to the House of Representatives by the Committee on Financial  Services, along with additional amendments made since committee  consideration:         The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), administered       by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), is       the federal government's largest and most widely available       source of financial assistance for state and local       government-directed neighborhood revitalization, housing       rehabilitation, and economic development activities. One of       the national objectives of the CDBG program allows       communities and states to use program funds to address       serious and immediate public health and safety threats.       Accordingly, Congress has used the CDBG program's framework       to provide additional assistance (CDBG-DR) for state and       local recovery activities in the wake of presidentially-      declared disasters. In response to a disaster, Congress must       pass each supplemental CDBG-DR appropriation on a case-by-      case basis. To date, Congress has appropriated $87 billion in       CDBG-DR assistance.        CDBG-DR grants are generally governed by the underlying       Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, (42 U.S. 5301       et. seq) (``CDBG statute'') and rules and the relevant       supplemental appropriation act. A supplemental appropriation       act providing disaster  [[Page H8924]]       assistance typically identifies the amount appropriated, the       period covered, the eligible uses of funds (to the extent       that they are different from the underlying CDBG statute and       rules), and the certifications required for assistance. For       each supplemental appropriation, HUD publishes a       corresponding Federal Register notice establishing the       allocation of funds to eligible grantees and describing the       rules, statutes, waivers, and alternative requirements that       apply to allocations under the notice.        In July 2018, the HUD Office of Inspector General (HUD OIG)       found that HUD's use of multiple Federal Register notices to       administer CDBG-DR assistance created challenges for       grantees. Specifically, HUD OIG found, among other       challenges, that grantees had to navigate confusing and       sometimes duplicative requirements contained in multiple       notices. HUD OIG recommended that HUD codify the CD BG-DR       program to: (1) establish a permanent framework for future       disasters; (2) reduce the existing volume of Federal Register       notices; (3) provide a standardized set of rules for all       grantees; and (4) ensure that grants are closed in a timely       manner. Further, the GAO has found that historically,       disaster relief has been inequitably distributed among people       of different races and ethnicities, economic classes, and       homeownership status. As a result, some of the largest HUD       fair housing settlements have come after major disasters, as       states and localities receiving disaster recovery grants       often did not serve affected families equitably.        H.R. 3702 adopts the HUD OIG recommendations by permanently       authorizing the CDBG-DR program, as well as addressing       concerns that have been raised about the administration of       the program. Among other requirements, the bill would mandate       that: (1) HUD allocate CDBG-DR funds within 60 days of a       Congressional appropriation; (2) HUD coordinate with FEMA,       and the Small Business Administration (SBA) to better improve       data sharing; and (3) any CDBG-DR funded new construction,       repair, or rehabilitation utilize minimum federal standards       for flood risk mitigation and storm water protection as well       as utilizing the latest national consensus-based building       codes and standards for construction in hazard-prone areas.       Additionally, H.R. 3702 would allow cities and counties with       well-developed disaster relief resources to become       precertified to receive funding more quickly and establish a       reserve fund to be used to provide technical assistance and       capacity building to help communities develop their action       plans. The bill would also require HUD develop best practices       that communities can use for disaster recovery.        The act includes two sections:        Section 1 states that the title of the bill is the       Reforming Disaster Recovery Act of 2019.        Section 2 is entitled the. ``Community Development Block       Grant Disaster Recovery Program.'' This section amends Title       I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42       U.S.C. 5301 et seq.) by adding a new sections 123 and 124 to       permanently authorize the CDBG-DR program and establish a       CDBG-DR reserve fund.        The new section 123 is entitled ``CD BG-Disaster Recovery       Assistance.'' Subsection (a) of the new section 123       authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development       (HUD) to provide Community Development Block Grant-Disaster       Recovery (CDBG-DR) assistances to States, including Puerto       Rico, units of general local government, and Indian tribes       for necessary expenses for authorized activities related to       disaster relief, resiliency, long-term recovery, restoration       of infrastructure and housing mitigation, and economic       revitalization in the most impacted and distressed areas       affected by Presidentially-declared disasters.        Subsection (b) of the new section 123 provides that when       allocating funding, the Secretary of HUD is required to       include an additional amount of funding for mitigation that       is not less than 45 percent of the amount allocated to a       grantee for unmet needs. The Secretary of HUD must allocate       funds to grantees within 60 days of the date of enactment of       an Act making funds available for disaster assistance. The       deadline for allocation of CD BG-DR funds shall not apply if       the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has not made       sufficient information available to the Secretary of HUD       regarding relevant unmet recovery needs to make allocations       in accordance with the deadline. The Secretary of HUD must       notify Congress of progress on or delay in receiving the       necessary information within 60 days following the       declaration of a major disaster and monthly thereafter until       all necessary information is received. The Secretary of HUD       is required to disburse funding allocated to a grantee, but       only if the grantee is in substantial compliance with the       requirements of this section.        The new subsection (b) also requires the Secretary of HUD       to coordinate with other agencies, including FEMA, and the       SBA, to obtain data on recovery needs when necessary       regarding disaster benefits, and share with FEMA and make       publicly available, all data collected, possessed, or       analyzed during the course of a disaster recovery for which       assistance was provided.        This new subsection (b) also requires that funds made       available must be used in accordance with section 312 of the       Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance       Act, as amended by section 1210 of the Disaster Recovery       Reform Act of 2018 (Division D, Public Law 115-254), and such       rules as may be prescribed. Households having the lowest       incomes must be prioritized for assistance under this section       until all unmet needs are satisfied for families having an       income of up to 120 percent of the median for the area. In       any case in which a CDBG-DR grantee provides assistance that       duplicates benefits, the new subsection (b) requires that the       grantees bear responsibility for absorbing such cost of any       duplicative assistance and return that amount to the       grantee's account or be subject to remedies for noncompliance       under Section 111 of the Housing and Community Development       Act of 1974. In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary       of HUD shall protect personally identifiable information.        Subsection (c) of the new section 123 provides that no       later than 90 days after the allocation of funds, the grantee       must submit a plan to the Secretary of HUD for approval       detailing the proposed use of all funds, which shall include       how the funds will be used to address disaster relief,       identification of officials administering the disaster funds,       an agreement to share data with Federal agencies, and a plan       for ensuring compliance with the Fair Housing Act. The new       subsection (c) also requires the Secretary of HUD to specify       criteria for approval of a grantee's disaster assistance       plan, including approval of substantial amendments to the       plan. The Secretary of HUD shall disapprove a plan if (1) the       Secretary determines that the plan does not meet the approval       criteria, (2) the Secretary determines that the plan does not       provide equitable allocation of resources between       infrastructure and housing projects or between homeowners,       rents and persons experiencing homelessness, (3) the       Secretary determines that the plan does not provide a       credible plan for ensuring compliance with the Fair Housing       Act, (4) the Secretary determines that the plan does not       prioritize the one-for-one replacement of damaged federally       subsidized affordable housing, or (5) the Secretary       determines the plan does not provide applicants for       assistance notice by the grantee of the applicant's right to       appeal any adverse action or inaction.        In developing the action plan, the new subsection (c)       provides that grantees, at a minimum, must (1) consult with       affected stakeholders, including residents, local       governments, and public housing authorities, to assess needs,       (2) publish the plan, including online for at least 14 days,       (3) ensure equal access to individuals with disabilities or       with limited English proficiency, and (4) publish the plan in       a way that allows stakeholders a reasonable opportunity to       review and provide feedback on the plan. In the event of a       disapproved plan, the Secretary of HUD shall permit a grantee       to revise and resubmit its plan. The Secretary of HUD shall       approve or disapprove a plan within 60 days of the plan being       submitted. If a plan is disapproved, within 15 days after the       disapproval, the Secretary shall inform the applicant of the       reasons for disapproval and the actions the applicant could       take to meet the criteria for approval. Applicants have 45       days following the date of the disapproval to submit       amendments or resubmit the action plan to the Secretary of       HUD. The Secretary of HUD has 30 days to approve or       disapprove the plan amendment or resubmission. The Secretary       of HUD shall ensure that all grant agreements are executed       within 60 days of approval of the grantee's plan.        Subsection (d) of the new section 123 requires the       Secretary of HUD to develop and maintain a system to ensure       that each grantee has an approved process for financial       controls and procurement, and adequate procedures to ensure       all eligible families and individuals are approved for and       provided assistance, as well as to prevent duplication of       benefits and detect waste, fraud and abuse, and to maintain       publicly accessible websites that make available information       regarding all disaster recovery activities. The Secretary       must provide, by regulation or guideline, a method for       qualitatively and quantitively evaluating compliance. As a       condition of making any grant, the Secretary of HUD shall       certify in advance that the grantee has the proper financial       processes and procedures in place.        Subsection (e)(I) of the new section 123 provides that a       grantee may not use less than seven percent but no more than       10 percent of its grant funds for administrative fees. The       Secretary of HUD may establish a series of percentage       limitations on a grantee's administrative fees, but only if       such limitations are based on the amount of grant funds       received, such series limitation is lower for grantees       receiving a greater amount of grant funds and higher for       grantees receiving a lesser amount of grant funds, and in no       case may a grantee use more than 10 percent of grant funds       for administrative fees. Subsection (e)(2) provides that       amounts under this section may not be used for activities       reimbursable by FEMA or the Army Corps of Engineers.        The new subsection (e)(3) also provides that the Secretary       of HUD may use one percent of CD BG-DR appropriated amounts       exceeding $1 billion for administrative costs, of which,       under new subsection (e)(4), 15 percent of that amount shall       be transferred to the HUD IG for audits, reviews, oversight,       evaluation, and investigations relating to amounts made       available for use under this section. The new subsection       (e)(5) authorizes the lesser of 0.1 percent or $15 million       for capacity building and technical assistance.        This new subsection (e)(6) provides that each grantee shall       use not less than 15 percent of funds for comprehensive       mitigation  [[Page H8925]]       planning, except that the Secretary may establish a lower       percentage for grantees receiving a grant exceeding $1       billion. Under the new subsection (e), each grantee must       ensure that comprehensive mitigation plans are coordinated       and aligned with existing comprehensive, land use,       transportation, and economic development plans, and       specifically analyze multiple types of hazard exposures and       risks. Each grantee must also coordinate and align mitigation       planning with other mitigation projects funded by FEMA, the       Army Corps of Engineers, the Forest Service, and other       relevant agencies. Mitigation planning funds can be used to       purchase data and development or updating of risk mapping for       all relevant hazards. The new subsection (e)(6) also directs       Grantees to prioritize the expenditure of mitigation dollars       for programs and projects primarily benefitting low- and       moderate-income households with the greatest risk of harm       from natural disasters.        The new subsection (e)(7) provides that after consultation       with the FEMA Administrator, the Secretary of HUD shall make       no CDBG-DR funds available for the construction,       reconstruction, or installation of any infrastructure or       residential, commercial or public buildings in hazard-prone       areas that does not, at a minimum, comply with the lasts       published editions of relevant national consensus-based       codes, and specifications and standards referenced therein,       except that the new subsection (e) provides that nothing that       in the new section 123 prohibits grantees from requiring       higher standards. The new subsection (e) provides that       compliance with this section may be certified by a registered       design professional.        The new subsection (e)(7) also provides a number of       definitions of key terms used. ``Hazard-prone areas'' are       defined as areas identified by the Secretary of HUD, in       consultation with the FEMA Administrator, at risk from       natural hazards that threaten property damage or health,       safety, and welfare, such as floods, wildfires, earthquakes,       tornados and high winds. The Secretary may consider future       risks and the likelihood such risks may pose to protecting       property, and health, safety, and general welfare when       determining or modifying a hazard-prone area. ``Latest       published editions'' is defined, with respect to national       consensus-based codes, and specifications and standards       referenced therein, the two most recent published editions,       including amendments that were adopted by State, local,       tribal, or territorial governments to incorporate the latest       hazard-resistant designs and establish criteria for the       design, construction, and maintenance of structures for the       purpose of protecting the health, safety and general welfare       of people against disasters.        The new subsection (e)(8) provides that the Secretary of       HUD shall require than any structure that is located in a       special flood hazard area, and that is newly constructed or       substantially improved using CDBG-DR funds must be elevated       with the lowest floor, including the basement, at least two       feet above the base flood level, except that critical       facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes, and other       public facilities providing social and economic lifelines (as       defined by the Secretary of HUD), must be elevated 3 feet       above the base flood level or higher if required by the       previous section. The new subsection (e)(8) also provides       that for existing structures consisting of multi-family       housing and row houses, the Secretary of HUD shall consult       with the FEMA Administrator and provide for alternative forms       of mitigation (apart from elevation) and shall exempt flood       level requirements for those structures that meet the       standards of the alternative form of mitigation.        Subsection (f) of the new section 123 provides that in       administering any CDBG-DR funds, the Secretary of HUD may not       allow a grantee to use its funds outside the scope of its       original application, may not permit a grantee to amend a       plan to retroactively approve a beneficiary's use of funds       other than for approved activities, and shall prohibit a       grantee from delegating the responsibility for inherent       government functions.        Subsection (g) of the new section 123 provides that the       Secretary shall require each grantee to provide ongoing       training to its staff and sub-grantees regarding grant       management.        Subsection (h) of the new section 123 provides that in       procuring property or services paid for with CDBG-DR funds, a       grantee shall follow its own procurement processes and       procedures or must comply with such processes or procedures       established through regulation by the Secretary of HUD. A       grantee's processes and procedures must (1) provide for a       full and open competition and require cost or price analysis,       (2) include requirements for sub-grantees, (3) specify       methods of procurement and their applicability, (4) include       standards of conduct for employees, and (5) ensure that all       purchase orders and contracts include any clause required by       Federal Statute, Executive Order, or implementing regulation.       The new subsection (h) provides that if the Secretary of HUD       finds that a grantee's procurement processes and procedures       do not comply with this section, the Secretary shall provide       the grantee with specific written notice of the elements of       noncompliance, provide the grantee a reasonable period of       time to come into compliance, and allow the grantee to       proceed with procuring property and services only if the       Secretary determines the grantee is making a good faith       effort to effectuate compliance with this section.        Subsection (i) of the new section 123 provides that funding       made available under this section shall not be considered       relevant to the non-disaster CDBG formula allocations. Except       for those statutes that relate to fair housing,       nondiscrimination, labor standards and the environment,       subsection (j) of the new section 123 authorizes the       Secretary of HUD to waive or specify alternative requirements       for any statute or regulation when the Secretary makes a       public finding that there is good cause that the waiver or       the alternative requirement would be consistent with the       overall goal of CDBG-DR. The new subsection (j) provides that       any waiver shall not take effect before the expiration of the       five-day period beginning upon the publication of notice in       the Federal Register of such waiver, and that the Secretary       of HUD shall not reduce the percentage of CDBG-DR funds that       must be used for activities that benefit persons of low and       moderate income to less than 70 percent, unless the Secretary       specifies that there is compelling need and that funds are       not necessary to address the housing needs of low- and       moderate-income residents.        Subsection (k) of the new section 123 provides that       grantees may adopt, without review or public comment, any       environment review approved by a Federal agency        Subsection (l) of the new subsection 123 provides that for       each major disaster for which CDBG-DR assistance is made       available under this section, the Secretary of HUD shall       collect information regarding all recovery efforts and shall       make the information available to the public, while ensuring       personally identifiable information is not made publicly       available. Under this subsection, the Secretary of HUD may       make full and unredacted information available to academic       and research institutions to study the equitable distribution       of recovery funds, adherence to civil right protections, and       other areas.        Subsection (m) of the new subsection 123 provides that the       Secretary of HUD shall direct the Office of Community       Planning and Development to collaborate with the Office of       Policy Development and Research to identify best practices       for grantees on issues related to disaster recovery to be       published by the Secretary of HUD as a compilation. After       disseminating the compilation, the Secretary of HUD must       issue regulations that establishes requirements grantees must       follow when using best practices to qualify for expedited       review and approval. The guidance must establish standard       language grantees can include in their action plans and       standardized programs and activities based on best practices.        Subsection (n) of the new section 123 requires the       Secretary of HUD to establish a program under this subsection       to pre-certify eligible grantees for assistance. To be       eligible for precertification, a locality shall demonstrate       compliance with the requirement of this section and shall       have previously received CDBG-DR assistance in connection       with two or more Presidentially-declared disasters. The pre-      certification shall be effective for a term of 10 years.        Subsection (o) of the new section 123 requires the       Secretary of HUD to recapture any unused CDBG-DR funds if the       grantee notifies the Secretary that it has completed all       activities provided under the grant or the grantee has not       spent all or part of the appropriated funds within 6 years.       Under the new subsection (o) the Secretary of HUD may,       subject to authority provided in advance by appropriations       Act, transfer unused funds to the Secretary of the Treasury       for deposit into the Community Development Block Grant       Disaster Recovery Reserve Fund established under section 124,       except that the Secretary of HUD may permit the grantee to       retain amounts needed to close out the grant. Under the new       subsection (o), the Secretary of HUD is required to extend       the time period by not more than four years if the Secretary       of HUD waives the six-year time requirement and submits a       written justification to the House and Senate Committees on       Appropriations. Under the new subsection (o), after the       initial extension period, the Secretary may provide an       additional extension of no more than four years to insular       areas and shall provide additional technical assistance to       help increase capacity within the insular area receiving the       extension and submit a written justification for the       extension to the House and Senate Committees on       Appropriations.        Subsection (p) of the new section 123 provides a number of       definitions applicable to the new section.        New section 124 is entitled ``Community Development Block       Grant Disaster Recovery Reserve Fund.'' This section       establishes the Community Development Block Grant Disaster       Recovery Reserve Fund, which shall consist of amounts       appropriated to the Reserve Fund or recaptured funds as       specified under this section. Funds shall be available only       for providing technical assistance and capacity building for       grantees to facilitate disaster recovery planning and       increase capacity to administer assistance.        New section 124 also provides that the Secretary of HUD       shall issue proposed rules to carry out sections 123 and 124       within six months of H.R. 3702 being enacted, and issue final       regulations within 12 months of H.R. 3702 being enacted.        H.R. 3702 is an important step in putting forward a       framework for HUD to address disasters that affect       communities across the United States. I commend       Representative Green and Representative Wagner for their  [[Page H8926]]       dedicated efforts to bring this bill before the House, and I       urge all members to support this legislation.     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4634) to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of  2002, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4634         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that we are considering H.R. 4634 to  reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, for 7 years.  This is a bipartisan bill that passed unanimously out of our committee.   I would like to thank Chairwoman Maloney, Chairman Clay, and Chairman  Cleaver for their efforts to bring this bill to the floor today. I  would also like to thank Ranking Member McHenry for working with me to  ensure the availability of affordable terrorism risk insurance coverage  across our country for small businesses, nonprofit organizations,  hospitals, and educational institutions to name just a few of the  entities that rely on this Federal program.   The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was enacted in the aftermath of the  tragic September 11 terrorist attacks, which resulted in the largest  insured losses on record from a nonnatural event. Insurance and  reinsurance companies reeled from the losses, and terrorism risk  insurance became unavailable or extremely expensive, complicating the  recovery efforts due to the importance of insurance in many business  transactions.   Congress passed TRIA to ensure that the terrorism risk insurance  coverage would remain available and affordable, and since that time,  the program has been effective at doing just that. Treasury data show  the program has been successful with nearly 80 percent of all TRIA- eligible policies, including terrorism risk coverage, and policyholders  paying an average of only 2.5 percent of their total premiums for  terrorism risk coverage. Treasury data also demonstrates that TRIA is  important across America and not just in densely populated urban areas.  In fact, the take-up rate is higher in the Midwest than it is in the  northeast.   This bill is supported by a broad coalition of over 300  organizations, including the American Property Casualty Insurance  Association, the Reinsurance Association of America, the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce, and the American Bankers Association.   I understand that the Senate Banking Committee is considering  identical legislation this week, and I hope that we can act quickly to  get this bill signed into law. I would urge all my colleagues to  support this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, to the Members, I cannot express how pleased  I am at the effort that was put together by Mr. McHenry to make this a  bipartisan bill. I am very appreciative of that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney), the chairwoman for the Subcommittee on Investor  Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Meeks), the chair of our Consumer Protection and Financial  Institutions Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, and to the Members, we heard Mr. Meeks a moment ago, and  we heard from Mrs. Maloney. I can't tell everyone how much time and  effort they have put into making sure that we get TRIA reauthorized.   What is interesting about what happened in our committee, aside from  the fact that Mr. McHenry and I worked well together, we had the East  and the Midwest working very well together. We had roundtables by Mr.  Meeks and Mrs. Maloney in New York, and then in Missouri, we had Mr.  Cleaver and Mr. Clay working together.    This has been a wonderful opportunity for all of us to work together  to see to it that we do the right thing as it relates to responding to  the possibility of terrorism and how we handle that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Clay), the chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development  and Insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased and so proud that we are on the floor  today on a bipartisan bill, and I certainly expect the support from  both sides of the aisle.   America stands united against terrorism and the hatred and violence  that it represents, and we are stronger as a country when we take steps  to ensure that our country can quickly respond to terrorism. By  reauthorizing TRIA, we are helping to do just that.   Again, I thank Ranking Member McHenry for working with me on this  important bill, as well as all of the members on the committee who have  shown real leadership on this issue. We heard from some of them today,  particularly Representative Maloney, who has worked for a long time on  this legislation. This was so important to her.   Mr. Cleaver, Mr. Clay, and Mr. Meeks have contributed mightily to the  organizing of this bill, to work on any difficulties that we may have  had, and I am very pleased about that.   Once again, I must say to Mr. McHenry, we have shown that it is  possible. Despite the fact that we may not agree on a lot of other  things, we came together on this legislation. We agreed, we worked  together, and we provided leadership and inspiration to others,  understanding that this was possible.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
