 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, just a little over a month ago, President Trump stood  here at this podium behind me and told us: ``People who are terminally  ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure.''   Along with President Trump, I want to give patients a chance right  here at home.   A little over a year ago, this House passed the 21st Century Cures  Act, made unprecedented acceleration of discoveries. Thanks to our  researchers and our academic institutions, and those working in the  pharmaceutical and medical device companies, Americans have access to  more and more innovative treatments. However, I continue to hear from  patients with serious life-threatening conditions, including my  constituents in north Texas, who are frustrated with what they see as  regulatory barriers from trying and experimenting with new therapies  when everything else has failed.    When potentially lifesaving treatments exist but remain unavailable  to patients, we have an opportunity to move past what has long been a  dilemma towards delivering a hopeful message.   Since 2014, 38 States, including Texas, have passed a version of  right-to-try laws.   I am pleased that the House of Representatives is considering right- to-try legislation that gives patients a chance at life by improving  access to experimental treatments.   Mr. Speaker, a lot of people deserve thanks for getting this bill to  us today, but, in particular, I want to thank the President of the  United States, President Trump, and Vice President Pence for their  leadership in this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Members to support this bill.
