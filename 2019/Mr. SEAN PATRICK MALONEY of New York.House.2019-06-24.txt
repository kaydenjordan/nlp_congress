 Mr. Speaker, I have the honor  of serving as the chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime  Transportation Subcommittee, and yesterday, the United States Coast  Guard Auxiliary celebrated 80 years of service to the United States.   Since June 23, 1939, the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary has  contributed to the safety and security of our citizens, ports,  waterways, and coastal regions by providing crucial support to our  hardworking Active-Duty Coast Guard workforce.   As the uniformed auxiliary service of the Coast Guard, these women  and men provide Public Safety Boating Education training, conduct  safety patrols, and provide important mission support functions that  are essential to the continued success of Coast Guard operations.   Each year, Coast Guard Auxiliary provides nearly 4 million hours  operating 1,800 vessels, 160 aircraft, and 1,400 radio facilities  helping to maintain a keen awareness of our expansive maritime domain.   In 2018 alone, the Coast Guard Auxiliary conducted 542,000 vessel  safety checks and marine dealer visits, delivered over 120,000 hours of  boating safety instruction, logged nearly 15 million hours of support,  saved over 600 lives, assisted over 17,000 boaters in distress, and  prevented the loss of more than $94 million in property.   So today I ask my colleagues to recognize the great Americans who  have served and those who continue to serve the United States Coast  Guard Auxiliary for their selfless service to our great Nation.                            ____________________
