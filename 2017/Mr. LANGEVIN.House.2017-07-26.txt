 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, the establishment of a National Ocean Policy was a  landmark step for our country. I particularly want to commend Senator  Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island for his leadership on this issue.   Ocean planning just makes sense, as we have seen in Rhode Island  during implementation of our Special Area Management Plan. Instead of  haphazard policymaking or turning the ocean into a political football,  we brought all stakeholders to the table, commercial and recreational  fishermen, energy development companies, conservationists, and other  local interests.   The National Ocean Policy builds on this type of collaboration. It is  a bottom-up approach, and it empowers local communities who use our  oceans.   I want to echo the words also of my colleague, the Congressman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), in support of this amendment, and I urge  my colleagues to allow this forward-thinking approach to continue. I  thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
