 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last month, over 50 Americans were  killed in mass shootings in this country while we were on the August  recess when we should have been here doing our job. One hundred  Americans are killed every day from gun violence. There are 100 desks  in this room. There are 100 chairs by those desks. And if these were  the Americans killed by gun violence, they would add up to every single  desk that is in this room. Yet the majority leader didn't bring us back  during the August recess. He didn't say we should cancel our vacation  and come back to work for the American people. He hasn't put a bill on  the floor or given an opportunity for anybody else to put a bill on the  floor now that we have been back in session for the last 2 weeks.   In the last 18 months, Colorado alone has lost 885 people to gun  violence. That is a record in my State.   The House of Representatives has done their job. I think more than  200 days ago, they passed background checks over there, and we haven't  even taken them up over here. This isn't a matter of bringing up the  bill and voting on the bill; we can't even get the bill to the floor.  For 200 days, we haven't been able to bring the bill to the floor. Why?  Because the majority leader of the United States of America says that  he is only going to bring gun legislation to the floor if he knows what  the President will sign. He is not capable, as the majority leader of  the United States, to put an amendment on the floor for an up-or-down  vote even when that amendment passed the House of Representatives 200  days ago and 96 percent of the American people support it. Ninety-six  percent of the American people support it.  [[Page S5518]]    Why can't he bring it to the floor? He says that only if the  President tells him that he will sign it will he bring it to the floor.  We all know how hard it is for the President to make up his mind about  anything--particularly about guns when he has one thing to say right  after a tragedy has happened, and then 2 days later, after he meets  with the NRA, he is singing from a completely different song sheet.   Here is what Mitch McConnell said in 2014:         The Senate should be setting national priorities, not       simply waiting on the White House to do it for us.    I wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. This is an independent  branch of government. The 100 people sitting in this room have been  sent here to represent the people who voted for us and the people who  didn't vote for us. And 96 percent of them say they want background  checks on guns, but we can't even have a vote.   I would like to see a vote just so I could see who in this Chamber  wants to vote against background checks. I think it would be amazing  for the American people to learn that, instead of just hiding behind  this myth that the President of the United States gets to decide what  comes to the floor. He is not the majority leader. There is one person  in America who gets to decide what comes to this floor--one person in  America--and that is the majority leader, Mitch McConnell from  Kentucky. It is not Donald Trump. He knew that in 2014, and he knows it  today. But the NRA is too scared to see this thing come to the floor  because they know that it will pass and that they will lose as a result  of that. It is long past time for us to beat the NRA on this issue.    I know my colleague from Washington State is here, so I will not go  on for too long, but if I could, I will just take a couple of minutes.   I am also from a Western State, the State of Colorado, and 20 years  ago, we had one of the very first school shootings in this country. It  was at Columbine High School. In the wake of that, we passed background  checks. We passed the same bill that Mitch McConnell will not bring to  the floor--the same bill almost 20 years ago.   My oldest daughter is 20 years old. She was born right after  Columbine. Our two other daughters are 19 and 15. Like so many children  across this country, they have grown up thinking that going to school  is unsafe, that they could be shot at school. They have had to do  drills that we never had to do when we were kids--never had to do. They  have the knowledge that the U.S. Congress doesn't care about them  because for 20 years we have done nothing.   In Colorado--a Western State, a Second Amendment State--we passed  these background checks. As a result, every year, 2 or 3 percent of the  people who come to buy a gun can't buy a gun because they are murderers  or they are rapists or they are domestic abusers. They are people who  shouldn't have a gun. I would like to see anybody come to this floor  and tell me why Colorado would be safer if we didn't have those  background checks; why we would be safer if murderers got guns and  rapists got guns and domestic abusers got guns. They can't come here  and do it.   They are hiding from the vote, and it is their responsibility to  vote. There is only one person in America who can hold that vote, and  that is Mitch McConnell. I can tell you this: It is not because we are  too busy around here. We were in session last week for 27 hours. That  is not even a French workweek. That is pitiful--pitiful--27 hours. Do  you know how many amendments we have considered in the 9 months that we  have been here this year? We have considered 18. That is two amendments  a month. We have passed four amendments in this broken place. It is  pitiful.   Before he became majority leader, Mitch McConnell came down here and  said that we were going to work on Fridays, that we were going to have  regular order. We had a 27-hour workweek. I can tell you this: It is  not because we are considering the election protection legislation,  which is one of the bipartisan bills the Senators in this Chamber want  to vote on to respond to the Russian attack on our democracy. It is not  because we are too busy with those bills. We are doing nothing here  except for confirming judges for Donald Trump.   I think I speak for my colleagues when I say I am willing to work  more than 27 hours. I am willing to work a French workweek or a U.S.  workweek if it means we could actually have votes on amendments that 96  percent of the American people support.   I close by saying there is no one else to do this job but us. The  House has done its job. Donald Trump can't make up his mind about  anything. Maybe he would like us to send him the background checks to  help him make up his mind about what he can do for the American people,  but I can tell you this: Our kids can't do this. They are too busy.  They are in school. They are trying to learn reading and math. They  should not be asked to try to figure out how to stop these mass  shootings in this country or what it would look like to have a  representative body of the United States actually represent the people  who sent us here instead of sitting around in our offices, trying to  avoid hard votes. How is it a hard vote when 9 out of 10 Americans  support it? It is only a hard vote because the NRA is taking names and  watching this.   I say to my colleagues: We would be so much better off, Democrats and  Republicans, with our ripping this bandaid off and getting on with the  business that the American people sent us here to do. Mitch McConnell  should put on this floor these background checks.   I thank my colleagues for their patience.   I yield the floor.
