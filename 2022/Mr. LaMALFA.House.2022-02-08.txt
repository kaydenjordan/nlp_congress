 Mr. Speaker, in 2021, U.S. drug overdoses due to  fentanyl skyrocketed, and it is now reported to be the leading cause of  death for Americans aged 18 to 45. The leading cause of death for  Americans between 18 and 45 is imported fentanyl, mostly coming across  our open southern border.   Instead of combating this epidemic by prosecuting drug traffickers or  banning molecularly altered fentanyl substances, the Biden  administration is making America's drug problem worse by actually  putting crack pipes into the hands of users--crack pipes distributed by  the U.S. Government into the hands of drug users. Yes.   This has been already modeled in San Francisco, so I guess we want to  do the Californication of the rest of the country with these crazy  ideas coming from the Biden administration. Boy, we have gone from just  don't do it to, hey, just hand it all out.   It is unbelievable that this is a policy at a time of drug problems  in this country skyrocketing, harm coming to people, and the Biden  administration wants to hand out free crack pipes in the name, I guess,  of racial equity. Unbelievable.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  hosting this Special Order tonight and continuing to keep the effort up  to put this in front of the American people and the Congress and the  White House.   We have talked a couple times here this evening so far, and this is a  statistic that I don't know if it is reaching across to enough people.  The leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45 is fentanyl. It  isn't car wrecks, it is not gun violence--which is usually people  violence it takes people to run a gun, to clear up a term--it is not  cancer, not some other form, it is a drug.   So what is this? It really boils down to it is a border problem.   So when the Biden administration decided to have a much more open,  hands-off policy on our borders, the opposite of what the Trump  Administration had been attempting to do, this problem has been  exacerbated. The number of people coming across, some for asylum  reasons, others for economic reasons, but the ones that are mixing in,  that are coming with them are bringing this stuff with them.   Now, as a Californian we have prime examples of what that looks like  on our streets, what it looks like for homelessness and for people  literally dying on the street; San Francisco being a shining example of  what most cities don't want to be with the problems they have on their  streets with homelessness, with drug use, people dying on our streets.    Needle programs. We call it clean needle exchange programs. They are  not even exchange programs. Even one of my district towns, Chico,  California, a nice town, people bring these needles in. And they don't  exchange them, as I mentioned, they just give them out until finally  the city council changed, and they have moved in a direction to try and  stop this sort of thing. It was killing a small valley town like Chico.  And yet our administration is promoting an open border policy that is  allowing in this fentanyl.   You heard some of my colleagues tonight talking about how small of an  amount it takes to not only negatively affect people, but kill them. It  is extremely potent. It doesn't take much of this stuff to cause a  death. And it is coming across, pounds and pounds at a time, over our  border.   Why are we allowing this to happen? It's coming freely over our  borders, distributors without consequence putting it out, harming our  people, harming this country.   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if the Democrats, if  the White House really cared about the health and safety of the  American citizens, they would implement commonsense policies to combat  this epidemic, increasing search and seizures at our border,  prosecuting traffickers instead of letting them go.   It is just so unbelievable. People come up to me all the time as  their Representative ``We just can't believe what is going on in our  country lately.'' The prosecution letting people out of prison, right  back to offend once again.   And this wide-open border that is just an open conduit to so much  harm from terrorism. They picked up five Syrians the other day. It  isn't just people coming from Central America wanting a better life or  reuniting families when you have single young men coming across the  border. This is a fraud that is being committed against the American  people here, and fentanyl is just one example of harming not just  economically but our open border, and so many people with an illegal  drug because we have a terrible policy.   Our border control folks are so demoralized by what is going on here,  and so are the people of this country. We have many crises these days,  but this is one of the worst because we are losing the identity of our  country with what has been going on.   President Biden's team needs to get on the job here and enforce our  border and not allow this poison to keep coming across.
