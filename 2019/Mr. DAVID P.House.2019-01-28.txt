 ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Dr.  C.H. Charlton, affectionately known to all of us at home as ``Rev,''  for his 43 years of faithful service as pastor of Friendship Baptist  Church in Johnson City, Tennessee.   A native of southwest Virginia, Dr. Charlton was previously pastor of  several Baptist congregations near his hometown of Radford, later  moving to Johnson City, where he found his home at Friendship Baptist  Church.   Dr. Charlton is also a dedicated public servant. He served as the  first African American mayor in southwest Virginia and is recognized by  the Virginia Historical Society as contributing significantly to the  State's history.   Dr. Charlton continued to serve in Johnson City by sitting on the  city's Regional Planning Commission and Board of Education while  working as a professor at Northeast State Community College.   Furthermore, I am proud to have served with him on the City  Commission, where he served 2 years as vice mayor of Johnson City.   Rev is a shining star on the hill. For nearly six decades, Dr.  Charlton has dedicated himself to serving the Lord, his wife, his  family, and his community.   I wish my friend the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
