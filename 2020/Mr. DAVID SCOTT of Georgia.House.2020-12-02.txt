 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very,  very much for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I have served in this body for 18 years, and throughout  those 18 years, I have had a man that I am convinced was sent by God  enter my life at a critical time, and that man is the chairman of the  Agriculture Committee, Collin Peterson.   I am here to certainly ask everybody to make sure you vote  unanimously on the bill.   But I am here to express a great friendship, a heartfelt gratitude.  And I say, as so many of my colleagues, you cannot have gone through  this tremendous challenge of being an elected official without God  having sent people your way to help you, to guide you. Such a man is  Collin Peterson and let me tell you why.   When I came to Congress 18 years ago, I was assigned to the  Agriculture Committee, and I was the only African American on that  committee for several years. Sometimes, when you are going into the  crevices and the corners of life where you have not been before, God  sends somebody along to give you a helping hand. Such a man in my life  is Collin Peterson.   Not only that; he took me under his wing and guided me. Not just on  one committee did he have me chair, several, starting with livestock,  moving on to credit, energy, the commodities, and now the financial  exchanges; daring to move me into areas where I did not know that he  had faith in me. And so I wanted to take this moment to say thank you.   Now, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, thanks to your good right hand,  you have opened a way that I might become the next chairman of the  House Agriculture Committee. No man, nothing, has helped me more to be  in this position than my friendship with this great man, Collin  Peterson.
