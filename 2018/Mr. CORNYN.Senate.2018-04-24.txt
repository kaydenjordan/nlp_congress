 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, after some drama and a rare  act of civility on the part of Senator Coons, for which I applaud him,  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the nomination of Mike  Pompeo as Secretary of State. This is despite Chairman Corker  repeatedly pointing out how qualified for this appointment Director  Pompeo actually is, but, apparently, it fell on deaf ears.   This sort of treatment is unprecedented, in my memory certainly, for  a Secretary of State. Director Pompeo was, in fact, first in his class  at West Point and led the Harvard Law Review. He served his country in  the military and served the people of Kansas in Congress, not to  mention the fact that Mike Pompeo already serves in one of the most  sensitive and important positions in the Trump administration as  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.   I spoke yesterday about the confirmations of some of the most recent  Secretaries of State, not just Secretaries Clinton and Kerry. Secretary  Kerry got all but three votes in the Senate, and Secretary Clinton lost  only two votes in the Senate, but I also spoke of Secretary Powell and  Secretary Rice. All were confirmed overwhelmingly because the Senate  has always had a tradition, until now, of showing some deference to the  President when confirming nominees to positions like this that have  national security importance. The world needs to know that this  President has confidence in this nominee, and he does. That is the key  to his effectiveness in international diplomacy--knowing he has the  President's ear.   Our Democratic friends once upon a time acknowledged that, in the  words of the senior Senator from Delaware:         The President, regardless of what party they are from,       needs, for the most part, to have the team they want to put       in place. They have been elected to lead. Let's give them a       chance to lead.    The opposition we are seeing breaks with this longstanding tradition  in a shameful and partisan way. Of course, our Democratic colleagues  have been slow-walking and obstructing qualified nominees since the  President was sworn in, just to hinder progress for hindering  progress's sake alone. This is the kind of hyperpartisan approach to  foreign policy that threatens to harm our national security because  this is an important national security post. Not only should we confirm  Mr. Pompeo so the President can have the support of his full Cabinet,  but also so the American people can have the assurance that our  national security is not being treated like a pinata that our  Democratic colleagues are whacking with a stick.  [[Page S2361]]    The American people can see through this kind of concerted effort to  prevent the President from filling Cabinet roles that deserve to be  filled. In fact, that seems to be the approach: wherever, whenever,  however to block President Trump from accomplishing anything he seeks  on behalf of the American people, even though he was elected President  of the United States.   Several editorial boards have already pointed out the importance of  filling this position and have urged our Democratic colleagues to allow  Director Pompeo to be confirmed expeditiously. USA Today editorial  writers penned a piece saying:         Unless a nominee has clear ethical or competency failings,       presidents should be accorded wide latitude to select top       aides whom they trust and agree with. Pompeo passes that test       and merits approval.    The Washington Post writes: ``Mr. Pompeo should be deployed to Foggy  Bottom in the hope that he will fulfill his promise to revive and  reassert U.S. diplomacy.''   The Chicago Tribune writes: ``Pompeo knows well how to work with both  Congress and the president--who trusts him so much he sent him on a  secret mission to Pyongyang to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong  Un'' in advance of the President's meeting with him in a few weeks.   It doesn't stop there. There are nearly a dozen editorial boards that  say the same thing these newspapers have--that Mr. Pompeo is  undoubtedly qualified and the President trusts him, and on these two  points, the Senate should confirm him.   The flip-flop our Democratic colleagues are doing from last year,  when 15 of them supported Mr. Pompeo's nomination to the CIA, should be  a source of embarrassment. To say that somehow the job of the Secretary  of State is more important or more sensitive than that of the CIA  Director--both of them are extraordinarily important. If they had the  confidence in him to vote to confirm him to the CIA and are now  searching for reasons to support a ``no'' vote for Secretary of State,  it is pretty clear what is happening. Some of the most radical  activists in the Democratic base are clearly getting to some of these  Senators.   There is still time to put country above politics, national security  over the next election, and principle over posturing. I urge all of our  colleagues to give this nominee the same treatment the Senate gave  Secretaries Powell, Rice, Kerry, and Clinton, and confirm Mr. Pompeo as  our next Secretary of State.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr.  Paul).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
