 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Ken Hechler, a  former Presidential adviser, veteran, public servant, author,  Congressman, West Virginia's 26th Secretary of State, and educator who  left a significant imprint on my home State of West Virginia.   Ken was born on September 20, 1914, in Roslyn, NY. Always a staunch  advocate for engaging the public in politics, he helped organize  support for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal while attending  Swarthmore College. He later earned a master's degree and Ph.D. in  political science, both from Columbia University.   Shortly after the United States entered World War II, Ken was drafted  into the Army where he trained as an infantryman and a tank commander.  Eventually he was assigned as an Army combat historian and rose to the  rank of colonel. He was one of five people assigned to interview  leaders of Nazi Germany after the war.   His experience as a war historian led to his joining the Truman  administration as an adviser on local issues during his tours across  the Nation. He remained on Truman's administration throughout the  remainder of his tenure and briefly into the administration of Dwight  D. Eisenhower.   He was the author of ``The Bridge at Remagen,'' which detailed the  Army's crossing of the Rhine River during World War II. This  publication helped make him a household name.   Ken later joined the American Political Science Association, with one  of his jobs requiring him to find political science professors for  colleges. His legacy in West Virginia began in 1957 when he got a  request to teach political science at Marshall College, now Marshall  University. Following one term at Marshall, he ran for Congress and  won. He served nine terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from  1957 to 1977.   He saw West Virginia for the welcoming place it is. Once you have  visited our little State, it never really leaves you. Most importantly,  Ken recognized quickly the issues that matter in West Virginia--mostly  concerning the coal industry and protection of our miners. In the wake  of the explosion at the Consol No. 9 mine in my hometown of Farmington,  Ken played a key role in the promotion of the Coal Mine Health and  Safety Act of 1969. I personally lost many individuals who I knew well,  including my dear Uncle John and several classmates, in that explosion.  The implementation of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act set the  groundwork for everything we have accomplished for our miners since  then. I will always be grateful for Ken's contributions.   Among his many history-making legacies, Ken joined the march to Selma  with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1965. He was the only  active Member of Congress to participate.   After a successful tenure in Congress, Ken served as West Virginia's  Secretary of State. He moved his desk out front so he could interact  with visitors passing through. He loved to visit with all West  Virginians. He fought for transparency in our campaign finance system,  was passionate about protecting our democratic process, and fought to  ensure that West Virginians had access to cast their ballots.   Ken never gave up his commitment to public service and continued to  be active on the issues that matter to the public. At the age of 85, he  walked 530 miles with Granny D to show his unwavering commitment to  campaign finance reform, shortly after the McCain-Feingold Act passed  Congress. Put simply, Ken was never one to back down from a challenge.  The man was fearless and fought tirelessly for causes he believed in.   What is most important is that he lived a full life, surrounded by  dear friends and family. It is my hope that Ken's loved ones are able  to find peace, strength, and support in one another. This is a time to  celebrate his life and vast accomplishments, as well as the countless  lives he touched, and to honor his memory in our thoughts and prayers.   Again, I extend my most sincere condolences to his loving wife,  Carol, and the entire Hechler family and dear friends. I am honored to  join the people of West Virginia and beyond in recognizing his memory,  as well as the unwavering love he had for his loved ones and our great  Nation. His legacy of service will live on forever.                            ____________________
