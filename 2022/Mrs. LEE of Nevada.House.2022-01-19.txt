 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about news  that many people don't hear too much about coming out of Washington.   Too often they only hear one side of the story about divisiveness,  gridlock, and a general unwillingness to put results over politics.   And don't get me wrong, it is a problem, but there are a whole lot of  us in this body that are fighting every day to put an end to that and  break the cycle in Washington, especially when it comes to our  veterans.   In the past 2 months alone we have seen legislative breakthroughs  that had the support of both Democrats and Republicans to help make  sure that our country continues to serve our Nation's veterans.   I introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation with Representatives  Anthony Gonzalez, Tony Gonzales, and Colin Allred to invest in the Zero  Suicide initiative and bring accountability into the VA.  [[Page H225]]    Last week, this House passed legislation that will end a GI Bill  disparity between the National Guard and Reserve members so that every  single servicemember can access the benefits their sacrifices have  earned.   And last month, President Biden signed the REMOTE Act into law to  extend legislation to protect student benefits for veterans.   In southern Nevada alone, 200 veterans were facing cuts in their  benefits, but with our votes in the House and Senate and President  Biden's signature, those benefits were extended, and it was just that  easy.   These are just a few examples of the bipartisan wins this Congress  has been able to accomplish for veterans.   You see, a lot of legislation before us, especially bills that serve  our veterans, are common sense. And I encourage Washington to not lose  sight of those two words: Common sense.                            ____________________
