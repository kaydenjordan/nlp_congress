 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week to  memorialize our officers who lost their lives in the line of duty and  call for action.   In my district in Riverside County, we have lost six deputy sheriffs  in the line of duty since 2020. This is in addition to the losses our  local police departments have suffered over the years, including Palm  Springs Department Police Officers Lesley Zerebny and Gil Vega, who we  lost on October 8, 2016.   It is because of Officers Zerebny and Vega and Deputies Brett Harris,  Darnell Calhoun, and Isaiah Cordero that I have authored legislation to  support families of fallen officers and why I have fought to improve  the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program so that their families can  get the support they need.   This National Police Week and all year round, I am standing up for  law enforcement officers and their families. I am pushing for support  for those grieving the loss of their brothers and sisters in uniform,  and I am calling for action on behalf of those who protect and serve  our communities every day.                            ____________________
