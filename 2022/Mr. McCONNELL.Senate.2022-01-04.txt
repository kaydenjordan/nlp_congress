 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a week ago, the Senate lost a  distinguished former colleague and the State of Nevada lost an  unparalleled advocate.   Senator Harry Reid's path to this Chamber was a quintessentially  American story. His incredible path from childhood poverty, to the  boxing ring, to leading the U.S. Senate took both toughness and  tenacity. And in this Chamber, just like everywhere else, Harry left it  all in the ring.   As leaders of our respective parties, the two of us disagreed  energetically and often. We had sharply different views, goals, and  philosophies on everything from public policy to the institution of the  Senate itself. But through  [[Page S20]]  all the heat and light, I never doubted that Harry was doing what he  earnestly believed was right for Nevada and for the Nation.   Elaine and I were grateful to enjoy a joint friendship with Harry and  Landra, the light of Harry's life, his beloved high school sweetheart.  The Senate's thoughts and prayers continue to be with her and the  entire Reid family.    Mr. President, in eastern Kentucky, one man has been  at the center of efforts to expand eye care for nearly 40 years. Dr.  Jerald Combs, who passed away last month, played an instrumental role  in modernizing and extending access to optometric care across  Kentucky's Appalachian region. Today, I recognize Dr. Combs as an  outstanding Kentuckian whose work made a vast impact on the lives of  his patients.   When Dr. Combs began his practice in Martin, KY, in 1983, optometry  in eastern Kentucky was an underdeveloped practice. Many residents  lacked access to the eye care they needed, leaving far too many without  good vision. Dr. Combs made it his mission to change that status quo  and improved many lives in the process. His clinic served the entire  eastern Kentucky region, attracting patients from far and wide who  needed his care.   Perhaps Dr. Combs' greatest legacy will be his efforts to increase  optometry training opportunities in his community. Because of his work  in this area, the University of Pikeville named their college of  optometry in his honor. The school's Jerald F. Combs Endowed  Scholarship gives students of all backgrounds the ability to study the  subject, providing expertise to those who will stay in eastern Kentucky  and help develop the field further.   Throughout his life, Dr. Combs was committed to serving his community  and our Commonwealth and earned many awards for his efforts. The  Kentucky Optometric Association lavished him with praise, granting him  both their Optometrist of the Year Award and Distinguished Service  Award twice. He also served as president and a board member of the  association for many years. Outside of optometry, Dr. Combs helped his  community through the Knott County Youth Foundation, the Knott County  Little League, the Kiwanis Club, and the Hazard Lions Club. He served  on the University of Pikeville Board of Trustees, steering the school  to success.   I knew Dr. Combs personally and was saddened to learn of his passing  last month. Few Kentuckians play as big or instrumental of a role in  their community as he did. While we all mourn his loss, we can also be  confident that his legacy, expanded access to eye care among Kentucky's  most vulnerable communities, will last for many years into the future.  I would like to express my personal gratitude for Dr. Combs' decades of  service to the Commonwealth and encourage my Senate colleagues to join  me in sharing condolences with the family, friends, and colleagues.                            ____________________     Mr. President, few Kentucky creations have had as much  impact on American culture as Bluegrass music. It is the spring from  which all other country music flows and one of our State's most world- renowned exports. Owensboro, KY, has played an important role in  maintaining and promoting Bluegrass history, style, and heritage and,  in recognition of that work, was recently named the Bluegrass Capital  of the World. Today, I honor Owensboro for earning this title and  helping preserve Kentucky's proud Bluegrass culture.   Owensboro's deep connection to Bluegrass music dates back to the  genre's earliest days. Bill Monroe, widely recognized as the ``Father  of Bluegrass'', was born just outside Owensboro in Ohio County, KY. His  musical group, the Blue Grass Boys, adapted the unique style of music  they found in Scotch-Irish communities in Kentucky's Appalachian  foothills and popularized it for a mainstream audience. Listeners,  entranced by Blue Grass Boys' soaring melodies, jaunty rhythm, and  homespun style, started a craze for Bluegrass music that brought  national fame to generations of Kentucky artists.   Owensboro's leaders have recognized their unique role in Bluegrass  history and sought to capitalize on that connection. City officials  ushered in the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and Museum in downtown  Owensboro in 1991, inviting both tourists and locals to learn about and  enjoy Bluegrass history. The city's annual ``River of Music Party'', or  ROMP, welcomes more than 20,000 visitors to the banks of the Ohio River  to celebrate Bluegrass artists and help sustain this proud Kentucky  tradition. And just recently, Owensboro Mayor Tom Watson signed the  official proclamation naming his city the Bluegrass Capital of the  World, cementing Owensboro's important place in Bluegrass history.   Owensboro's leaders have also initiated a strong campaign to educate  and popularize Bluegrass among the next generation of Kentuckians. The  Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and Museum features rotating exhibits  highlighting key parts of Bluegrass history and hosts artists that  promote the genre. The museum offers lessons in musical instruments  like the mandolin, banjo, and fiddle, helping ensure the survival of  their unique sounds and style. The museum's Bluegrass in the Schools  program has introduced Bluegrass music to nearly 10,000 elementary  students, including in 24 Owensboro-area schools, connecting young  Kentuckians with their State's culture and history.   Bluegrass music is the soundtrack of Kentucky. From the first pluck  of the banjo, strum of the guitar, or drone of the fiddle, the genre is  immediately recognizable. Owensboro's leaders have done incredible,  extensive work to preserve and promote this unique Kentucky music and  are incredibly deserving of their city's recent designation as  Bluegrass Capital of the World.   Mr. President, the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer highlighted the  city's new title in a recent article. I ask unanimous consent the  article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           [From the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, Nov. 24, 2021]                       Bluegrass Capital of the World         The City of Owensboro has officially been designated the       ``Bluegrass Capital of the World'' after more than a year of       effort by the city and the Bluegrass Hall of Fame and Museum.        Mayor Tom Watson officially signed the proclamation       permanently linking Owensboro and bluegrass music during a       Nov. 12 ceremony at the Bluegrass Hall of Fame and Museum.        ``About 15 months ago we started talking about this idea,       and it has taken a little while to get it to this point, but       we are here today to declare the City of Owensboro as the       Bluegrass Music Capital of the World,'' Watson said during       the event.        Watson called Chris Joslin, museum executive director, to       the stage and asked him to turn around so he could officially       sign the proclamation on his back, telling him, ``a lot of       this is going to be on your back.''        ``The idea is to create a sustainable structure and utilize       our bluegrass music presence to build out economic       development opportunities and increase tourism,'' Watson       said.  [[Page S22]]       ``In short, attract new businesses that manufacture or       provide services that are consumed outside our community       connected to bluegrass music and attract people to Owensboro,       the epicenter of bluegrass music.''        Joslin said Owensboro began celebrating its bluegrass       heritage during the early 1980s, when a concert series was       formed pairing bluegrass artists with the Owensboro Symphony       Orchestra.        ``I think it demonstrated that bluegrass music could be a       differentiator for this community, creating something unique,       creating something that no other community has,'' he said.        Joslin said the opening of the Bluegrass Hall of Fame and       Museum at 311 West 2nd St. in Owensboro in 2018 signaled to       the world that the organization means business and is part of       an economic strategy that begins with cultural tourism, and       can grow as more and more people and industry related to the       music industry comes to the city.        ``I have said before that I believe that most communities       like ours, they want to be known for something,'' Joslin       said. ``Something that matters, something that is authentic       and compelling, something that has a positive, tangible       impact on their community. I can tell you that if the news of       that something extends beyond the city limits and the county       line, well there is opportunity there, and opportunity       attracts people, it attracts investment.''        ``Friends, I can tell you that this is our time, this is       our opportunity, and we are claiming it today as the       Bluegrass Music Capital of the World.''        Mike Simpson, chairman of the International Bluegrass Music       Association, provided a brief history of the bluegrass       musical genre.        ``The odyssey of this original American art form started       right down the road here in Ohio County, and much of its       history can be traced right here to Owensboro, Kentucky,''       Simpson said.        Simpson cited early bluegrass musicians Arnold Schultz,       Pendleton Vandiver and his grandfather, Cleveland Baize, as       forging a music combining Irish, Scottish and blues music.        ``Pendleton Vandiver had a nephew by the name of William       Smith Monroe that listened to that music, and he and his       brothers, Charlie and Birch, they left Ohio County and they       took it to the world,'' Simpson said. ``In 1936 they signed a       record deal with RCA Victor, and soon the bluegrass music was       being spread across radio airwaves across this country.''        Simpson said in 1945, bluegrass came to the Grand Ole Opry       at Nashville's famed Ryman Auditorium when Chubby Wise,       Howard Watts, Lester Flat and Earl Scruggs stepped onto the       stage.        ``That was bluegrass' sonic boom,'' Simpson said.        Today, bluegrass is a celebrated part of Owensboro's       culture. With the only dedicated Bluegrass Hall of Fame and       Museum, the annual ROMP Festival attracting 25,000 annually       to enjoy bluegrass and roots music, as well as bluegrass-      themed media being created in Owensboro, it has become       ingrained in the city's culture.        Simpson said Owensboro being officially known and       celebrated as the ``Bluegrass Capital of the World'' was ``a       long time coming.''                            ____________________
