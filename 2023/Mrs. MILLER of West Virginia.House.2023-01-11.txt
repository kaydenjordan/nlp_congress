 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   All life is sacred. Defending innocent lives should not be a policy  issue.   This legislation protects babies who are not only born but who are  then left without care from an attempted abortion. A baby who survives  an abortion should receive the same medical attention that any other  premature baby would.   These precious souls are given another chance at life. It is  unacceptable that there are no criminal charges for those who want to  take their life away. The people who allow babies to be killed after  birth must be fully prosecuted.   Let's be clear: Killing a baby who is born alive, regardless of an  attempted abortion, is murder.   The previous Democrat-controlled House has refused to vote on this  bill. Today, a Republican-led majority keeps our commitment to America  by voting on legislation that upholds the sanctity of life.   I urge the passage of this bill on the House floor.
