 Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of  Andrei Iancu to be Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual  Property and Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.   USPTO is critically important. It is a critically important agency  that stands at the crossroads of innovation, technology, and property  rights. It is tasked with ensuring that our laws properly compensate  ingenuity and invention, while at the same time stopping bad actors who  seek to game the system.   Intellectual property has been a focus of mine throughout my entire  Senate service. Early in my tenure, I authored the Hatch-Waxman Act,  which made possible the rise of the modern generic drug industry. More  recently, I played a key role in the America Invents Act, which  rebalanced our patent system to ensure high-quality patents and reduce  abusive litigation. Just last Congress, I authored the Defend Trade  Secrets Act, a landmark piece of legislation that created a federal  private cause of action to prevent trade secret theft and other  nefarious activity.   I have also led the charge against patent trolling--the practice of  buying up patents solely for the purpose of bringing lawsuits--and  argued forcefully that forum shopping in patent cases must not be  allowed. I was gratified to see the Supreme Court last year strike a  blow against abusive forum shopping in its TC Heartland decision.   In my remaining months here in this body, I intend to continue ahead  full-bore on intellectual property reform. Digital music licensing,  royalties for visual artists, and online filtering are just a few of my  intellectual property priorities for this year.   Given my focus on intellectual property, I take a keen interest in  the Patent and Trademark Office and in the individual selected to run  the office. I have to say that I couldn't be more pleased by President  Trump's nomination of Andrei Iancu to be the next USPTO Director.   Andrei has an extensive background in patent litigation. He is a  partner at Irell & Manella, one of the Nation's leading intellectual  property law firms. For 6 years, he was the firm's managing partner.  Andrei has represented clients across the spectrum, from tech companies  to drug manufacturers to aerospace firms. He understands all sides of  patent law because he has litigated all sides.   In an area fraught with allegiances to particular industries or  groups, Andrei can bring a neutral, unbiased perspective because he has  already had to approach issues from so many different angles.   Andrei has been named a leader in intellectual property and patent  law by Chambers USA every year for the last 11 years. He has been named  attorney of the year by California Lawyer and lawyer of the year by the  Los Angeles Business Journal. His bona fides are top notch. I have full  confidence that Andrei will make an outstanding USPTO Director.   Subject-matter eligibility, PTAB reform, and continued controversies  over forum shopping are just a handful of the issues that will soon be  coming across his desk. There will also be questions about fee setting,  fee diversion, and IT modernization. As I move forward on my  intellectual property priorities this year, I look forward to working  with Andrei and his future colleagues at USPTO to make our patent and  trademark system the best it can possibly be.   We owe it to the American people to ensure that our intellectual  property laws keep pace with our rapidly changing world. That has  always been one of my chief focuses here in this body, and it will  continue to be so throughout the rest of my term.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would also like to take a couple of  minutes to  [[Page S596]]  discuss a bill that I will be introducing with Senators Coons, Graham,  and Whitehouse called the Clarify Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or  the CLOUD Act. It is a tremendously important bill that will help to  solve the problems that have arisen in recent years with cross-border  law enforcement requests.   The rise of email and cloud computing has put our data privacy laws  on a collision course with the privacy laws of other countries.  Information in emails or in the cloud can be stored on servers  virtually anywhere in the world. This means that when law enforcement  seeks access to such information, the information may be located in  another country.   This state of affairs causes problems both for law enforcement and  for email and cloud computing providers. It causes problems for law  enforcement because warrants traditionally stop at the water's edge and  because laws in other countries may prohibit disclosure to foreign law  enforcement, and it causes problems for email and cloud computing  providers because they find themselves caught between orders by U.S.  law enforcement to disclose data in other countries and laws in those  other countries that may forbid such disclosure.   The question of whether warrants issued to U.S.-based providers may  require providers to disclose data stored in other countries is  currently before the U.S. Supreme Court in the United States v.  Microsoft case. Oral argument in the case will be heard later this  month.   No matter how the Court rules, however, problems will remain. Either  law enforcement will lack the ability to obtain in a timely manner  email and documents in the cloud that are stored overseas or providers  will find themselves caught between conflicting domestic and foreign  laws.   The CLOUD Act creates a clear, workable framework to resolve these  problems. The bill has four key components.   First, it authorizes the United States to enter into bilateral data- sharing agreements with qualifying countries under which the United  States agrees to lift its bar on disclosure to law enforcement in a  qualifying country if that country similarly agrees to lift any bar it  has on disclosure to U.S. law enforcement. The CLOUD Act sets forth  stringent requirements for such agreements in order to ensure privacy  and data security. In particular, it provides that any requests by  foreign law enforcement to U.S. providers under such an agreement  cannot target or request information on U.S. persons.   Second, the CLOUD Act clarifies that a warrant served on a U.S.  provider may reach data stored overseas provided the data is within the  provider's possession, custody, or control. This will enable U.S. law  enforcement investigating crimes to obtain information stored overseas  without having to resort to cumbersome diplomatic channels.   Third, the CLOUD Act gives email and cloud computing providers the  ability to challenge a warrant issued for data stored overseas if  complying with the warrant would cause the provider to violate the laws  of a foreign country. The court hearing such a challenge determines  whether, in the interests of international comity, the warrant should  be modified or quashed.   Finally, the CLOUD Act authorizes providers to disclose to a foreign  government the fact that the provider has received a warrant for  information stored in that country, provided the foreign government has  entered into a bilateral data-sharing agreement, as previously  described. This will enable the foreign government to assess compliance  with the terms of the agreement and intervene diplomatically if it  believes the request is inappropriate.   The CLOUD Act has broad support in both the tech community and among  law enforcement. It bridges the divide that sometimes we see between  these two groups.   The bill is an outgrowth of my International Communications Privacy  Act, or ICPA, coupled with the United States-United Kingdom bilateral  agreement framework that many of my colleagues are familiar with.  Indeed, the United States-United Kingdom bilateral agreement framework  outlined in the CLOUD Act is intended as a model for future agreements  between the United States and other countries that are committed to  privacy, human rights, and international law enforcement cooperation.   Expeditiously implementing similar agreements with the European Union  and other allies is critical to protecting consumers around the world  and facilitating legitimate law enforcement investigations.   I am pleased to be introducing this very important landmark  legislation with my friends from Delaware, South Carolina, and Rhode  Island, and intend to push hard to see it enacted in the very near  future.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I thank my colleague.
