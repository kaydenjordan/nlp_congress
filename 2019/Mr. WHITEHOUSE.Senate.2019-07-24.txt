 This is 250.    Madam President, let me first thank my friend Senator  Schatz for his incredibly kind remarks. He is an outstanding colleague.  We work together extremely well. He brings a good cop ``aloha''  sensibility to a conversation, whereas I tend to lean more toward the  bad cop, and he has a remarkable vision for how this can be solved. I  am incredibly honored that he is here.   For the 250th week that the Senate has been in session, I rise to  call this Chamber to wake up to the threat of climate change. In April  of 2012, I delivered the first of these speeches. I  [[Page S5045]]  began: ``I know that many in Washington would prefer to ignore this  issue, but nature keeps sending us messages--messages we ignore at our  peril.''   It was a cry of frustration--frustration that the Supreme Court's  infamous Citizens United decision had killed the bipartisan work that I  saw here on climate for 3 years; frustration that the fossil fuel  industry's death grip had tightened around this Chamber, preventing  action; frustration that our Democratic administration had abandoned  leadership on climate change and would barely even talk about it.   It has been a run, and here I am, still at it, 7 years on. Some  things have changed; some things have not.   Let's start with what has not changed. What has not changed is the  scientific certainty about what is happening in our atmosphere and  oceans. Scientists have understood that burning fossil fuels has caused  our planet to heat up since the days when Abraham Lincoln was riding  around Washington, DC, in his top hat. This is not new news.   Nearly four decades ago, Exxon's own scientists reported to Exxon  management that there is ``little doubt'' that atmospheric  CO2 concentrations were increasing due to fossil fuel  burning. They said back in 1982 that the resulting greenhouse effect  ``would warm the Earth's surface, causing changes in climate affecting  atmospheric and ocean temperatures, rainfall patterns, soil moisture,  and . . . potentially melting the polar ice caps.''    There was no legitimate debate over the science when I started in  2012, and there is no legitimate debate over the science today. Indeed,  the science has only strengthened. With each passing year, as Senator  Merkley said, we rely less on complicated climate models and on  scientific forecasts and, unfortunately, more on straightforward,  realtime measurement of the changes. Today, we observe with our own  eyes what recently was predicted: glacial collapse and retreat, sea  level rise, arctic warming, and increasingly extreme weather.   Another constant since 2012 is the fossil fuel industry's remorseless  campaign, A, to block climate change and, B, to do this while hiding  its hands behind front groups. I have delivered dozens of these  speeches about the dozens of climate denial front groups. Indeed, we  have had whole groups of Senators come to the floor to talk about the  web of denial that the fossil fuel industry has constructed to  propagate fake science, to hide that it is the fossil fuel industry  pulling these strings, and to push its muscle and weight around  Congress. Mostly, it is funded by Big Oil and the Koch brothers. They  set these groups up, and they set them loose to sow false doubt about  real climate science and to obstruct, obstruct, obstruct here in  Washington.   They have spent--at a minimum--hundreds of millions of dollars on  this anti-climate campaign. With that money, they have talked up some  seriously ridiculous notions, such as carbon pollution is good for us  all because carbon is plant food. They have taken out billboards  comparing climate scientists to the Unabomber. It is false and ugly  stuff powered by hidden money.   Oil giants still spend huge amounts to infect America's corporate  lobbying with their obstruction message. InfluenceMap reckons the  biggest anti-climate lobbying force in Washington is the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce, a trade group that purports to represent typical patriotic  American businesses. It should, more properly, be called the ``U.S.  Chamber of Carbon.'' There it is at the rock bottom, side by side with  the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statistical tie for  worst obstructor of climate action in America.   Why wouldn't Big Oil go to all this trouble? They are defending a  $650 billion per year subsidy in the United States alone, according to  the International Monetary Fund. So it is logical, but it is still  shameful.   There is a vast majority of American companies that have a different  view and that want to see climate action. Yet in Congress, that vast  majority is a silent majority. When I say ``silent,'' I mean they are  not showing up in Congress--not to push back, not to correct the  record, not even to seek serious climate legislation. Corporate America  was AWOL in Congress in 2012, and they are AWOL in Congress now.  Corporate America's silence was deafening then, and it is deafening  still today.   So what has changed since that first speech 7-plus years ago? First  of all, the economics of renewable energy changed in a big way. In  2012, wind and solar weren't cost-competitive with fossil fuels.  Storage and electric vehicles were nowhere. That year, the average cost  of solar was over $200 per megawatt hour. Today, it is one-quarter of  that. The cost of wind power is down, and offshore wind is emerging.  Battery storage now competes on price with gas-fired, peak-demand  plants in many areas. Automakers around the world are making more and  more electric vehicles, driving costs down and performance up for  consumers. Even with that massive subsidy for fossil fuel, renewables  are starting to win on price.   Another new area is that we are starting to capture carbon. This  little cube that I have in my hand is CO2 that was pulled  out of the air by direct air capture technology and can be turned into  tiles, blocks, bricks. There it is. It is the beginning of a new era of  carbon capture. The group that did this is competing in Wyoming this  summer for the XPRIZE for carbon capture.   Another big thing that has changed since 2012 is that economists,  central bankers, Wall Street bankers, real estate professionals, and  asset managers are all recognizing the major risks that climate change  poses to the global economy. It is not free to ignore it, and the costs  could come in the form of crashes. Back in 2012, these economic  warnings--these crash warnings--were uncommon. Today, they are coming  from everywhere.   Freddie Mac predicts that rising sea levels will prompt a crash in  coastal property values greater than the housing crash that caused the  2008 financial crisis.   First Street has shown how sea level rises already are affecting  coastal real estate values up and down the east coast. It found that  rising seas have already resulted in $16 billion in lost property  values in coastal homes from Maine to Mississippi.   Moody's warns that climate risk could trigger downgrades in coastal  communities' bond ratings. Just last week, the mayor of Honolulu  testified at Senator Schatz's Climate Committee's first hearing that  the credit rating agencies are already grilling him about this.   BlackRock has estimated that some coastal communities face annual  average losses of up to 15 percent of GDP from climate change by the  end of the century. Heads up, Florida.   Coastal property is not the only financial risk. The Bank of England,  Bank of France, Bank of Canada, San Francisco Fed, and European Central  Bank--along with many top-tier, peer-reviewed economic papers--are all  warning of systemic economic risk. That is central banker speak for  something that poses a risk to the entire economy, all from stranded  fossil fuel assets called the carbon asset bubble.   One other thing I have spent a lot of time on is oceans--the heating,  the acidification, the lost and shifting fisheries, the collapse in  coral and expanding dead zones, and, of course, the rising sea levels.  Our terrestrial species needs to pay a lot more attention to the seas.  There has been a real shift in attention in these intervening years.   Then you have Standard & Poor's, Moody's, Citigroup, and more  economists warning that the costs of climate change will not be  measured in the hundreds of billions or even in the trillions but will  be measured in the tens of trillions of dollars. That is a penalty  worth avoiding and worth the attention in the Senate.   So here I am, 7-plus years later, giving my 250th speech. Somewhere  between persistent, tiresome, and, I suppose, foolhardy is where you  will find me.   I never thought I would still be at it well into 2019, but the fossil  fuel industry, with all of its wretched dark money, is still calling  the shots in Congress while the rest of corporate America still sits on  its hands. The U.S. Senate still is not seriously considering any  legislation to reduce carbon pollution, and I am still frustrated, but  I am optimistic because the denial wall is cracking.   Bankers and asset managers and financial titans recognize the massive  [[Page S5046]]  economic risks of a fossil fuel-based economy and see the huge economic  potential of a low-carbon economy. They now see real business incentive  to push back on the fossil fuel denial apparatus. They now see real  business peril in allowing the fossil fuel denial apparatus to rule.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the end of  my remarks the ``Economists' Statement on Carbon Dividends'' that was  published in the Wall Street Journal, which illustrates that exact  point.   I am also optimistic because people are talking about climate change  again, and colleagues are talking about climate change. Americans  everywhere are talking about climate change. Most Republicans want  action on climate change. Voters are engaged on climate change, and  more than anyone else, young people especially are engaged. From young  hero Greta Thunberg to kids all across this country, to the young  plaintiffs in the Juliana suit, young people are engaged. Any  politician who wants a long career had better care about what young  people think. Any political party that wants to matter in a decade had  better care.   Over in the House, it is starting to show. A few Republicans have  actually introduced legislation to put a price on carbon emissions.  Even President Trump--the guy who handed over the keys to his  administration to the fossil fuel industry--feels the need now to talk  about the environment. As empty as that talk is, the pressure he feels  is progress. The fact that he feels he has to talk about it is  progress.   As for me, I can't wait to stop giving these speeches. These speeches  chronicle the continued failure of this body and the continued failure  of our country to grapple with an evident climate crisis, and these  speeches chronicle the fake science and the political mischief and  muscle that the fossil fuel industry has used to debauch our American  democracy. Marking that sordid history is important, but I want it to  be history. When the dark days of denial and obstruction are past,  these speeches will no longer be necessary.   I particularly thank my colleague from Hawaii, Senator Schatz; my  colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley; my colleague from  Massachusetts, Senator Markey; and other colleagues who have been  incredible friends and allies in this fight, like Senator Heinrich of  New Mexico and Senator Warren of Massachusetts. I thank my colleagues  for being here today and for being such extraordinary partners and  teammates. We are a band of brothers and sisters in this cause, and our  band is growing.   As more and more Americans, from kitchen tables to corporate cocktail  parties, come to terms with the real scope of the problem and the  danger this failure presents, not only am I proud of my colleagues who  are with me already, but I am very hopeful my colleagues across the  aisle will also soon become great partners.   Until then, I conclude for the 250th time by saying it is time to  wake up.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 16, 2019]  Economists' Statement on Carbon Dividends--Bipartisan Agreement on How                          to Combat Climate Change         Global climate change is a serious problem calling for       immediate national action. Guided by sound economic       principles, we are united in the following policy as       recommendations.        I. A carbon tax offers the most cost-effective lever to       reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is       necessary. By correcting a well-known market failure, a       carbon tax will send a powerful price signal that harnesses       the invisible hand of the marketplace to steer economic       actors towards a low-carbon future.        II. A carbon tax should increase every year until emissions       reductions goals are met and be revenue neutral to avoid       debates over the size of government. A consistently rising       carbon price will encourage technological innovation and       large-scale infrastructure development. It will also       accelerate the diffusion of carbon-efficient goods and       services.        III. A sufficiently robust and gradually rising carbon tax       will replace the need for various carbon regulations that are       less efficient. Substituting a price signal for cumbersome       regulations will promote economic growth and provide the       regulatory certainty companies need for long-term investment       in clean-energy alternatives.        IV. To prevent carbon leakage and to protect U.S.       competitiveness, a border carbon adjustment system should be       established. This system would enhance the competitiveness of       American firms that are more energy-efficient than their       global competitors. It would also create an incentive for       other nations to adopt similar carbon pricing.        V. To maximize the fairness and political viability of a       rising carbon tax, all the revenue should be returned       directly to U.S. citizens through equal lump-sum rebates. The       majority of American families, including the most vulnerable,       will benefit financially by receiving more in ``carbon       dividends'' than they pay in increased energy prices.

Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Janet Yellen have chaired       both the Fed and the Council of Economic Advisers.        George Shultz and Lawrence Summers are former Treasury       secretaries.     I yield the floor.    Madam President, may I propose to my wonderful  colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, that the Good Lord forbid  that I have to get to 500 such speeches before we solve this problem.    I would note that if we look back to 2009, there are  some very important signs of optimism.   On the legislative side, Senator Markey--then-Representative Markey  with his colleague Representative Waxman--successfully ushered, with  significant industry and popular support, a serious climate bill  through the House of Representatives, proving that it can be done,  proving that real climate legislation can pass in this body.   In that same year, in 2009, a gentleman named Donald Trump--the same  Donald Trump who is President now at the other end of Pennsylvania  Avenue in the White House--took out an advertisement in the New York  Times, and in his advertisement, Donald Trump and his children--Donald,  Eric, and Ivanka--as well as the Trump Organization, all said that the  science of climate change was incontrovertible. They further said that  if we did not act, the consequences of climate change would be  catastrophic and irreversible.   So we have the living experience of legislation passing, led by then- Representative Markey and Representative Waxman, and all we need,  really, is to bring back that 2009 Donald Trump. Come on back, buddy.  We want you because you were right in 2009.   I yield the floor.
