 Madam Speaker, every American knows the image of  George Washington crossing the Delaware, the fallen rifleman at  Gettysburg, and the marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima. Our history  is punctuated with moments of individual heroism and virtue so profound  and moving that they live forever in the memories of our countrymen and  the proud story of our country.   To these iconic images, history has now added another: that of a  young marine sergeant in full combat gear cradling a helpless infant in  her arms amidst the unfolding chaos and peril in the besieged Kabul  Airport and proclaiming: ``I love my job.''   The entire story of the war in Afghanistan is told in this picture:  the sacrifices borne by young Americans who volunteered to protect  their country from international terrorism, the heroism of those who  serve their country even when their country failed them, the idealism  of a generation that tried to bring enlightened modernity to an  afflicted society, and, most of all, the stark contrast between good  and evil, tyranny and freedom, barbarity and justice, and brutality and  mercy.   Above all others, this is the image that describes it all. It is  given power and immortality by the spirit of the young woman in this  photo, Marine Sergeant Nicole Gee. Through the ages to come, this  picture will speak of the sacrifice of blood and treasure of 20 years  of struggling and of the vision, hope, liberty, justice, and humanity  that summoned patriots like Nicole Gee to leave their homes and  families and place themselves in harm's way on the other side of the  world. As Shakespeare put it: ``This story shall the good man teach his  son.'' Historians looking back on this age will find its story  summarized in this single picture and illustrated in the life, dreams,  and ultimate sacrifice of Nicole Gee.   They will note that her life ended just days after this photo was  taken at the age of just 23 years. They will remember that this angelic  young lady was cut down with 12 of her brothers and sisters by  incarnate, insensate evil. They will ponder where that young life might  have led.   That is an important question, and the answer is known to all who  knew her. She could have done anything she wanted. She was married to  her high school sweetheart, 4.1 GPA at Oakmont High School, ``one  pretty badass marine,'' as her sister put it. She could have done  anything she wanted, and what she wanted most was to serve her country  and to serve humanity.   Who else but a guardian angel amidst the chaos and violence of those  last days in Kabul could look beyond all that and look into the eyes of  an infant and proclaim: ``I love my job''?   Speaking of the fallen heroes of past wars, James Michener asked the  haunting question: Where do we get such men?   Well, here is the answer: We get such men and women from little towns  across America like Roseville, California. They leave their family and  friends in pursuit of the highest virtues of which human beings are  capable, and they do it because their country asks them and because it  is noble.   I don't know how to offer condolences to Nicole's family, to her  husband, Jarod; her father, Rick; her sister, Misty; and her family and  friends. The loss they bear is beyond my comprehension. I can only  offer my awe and gratitude that humanity has within itself a small band  of brothers and sisters like Nicole Gee; for without them, America,  that ``last best hope of mankind on this Earth,'' would not be  possible.   A few steps from here in the rotunda is a fresco called The  Apotheosis of Washington. It depicts General Washington in uniform  ascending to the heavens flanked by Victory and Freedom and surrounded  by the essence and fruits of a free nation. And in that depiction,  Washington beckons.   From little towns like Roseville, California, decent young men and  women with promising futures like Nicole Gee have answered. I don't  know how their families can bear it, but I do know that we owe them.  Before her father left the stage at a community memorial, he had one  request. He pleaded:  [[Page H4560]]  ``Never forget her please, never forget her.''   We can never repay that debt except to honor her memory, keep her  sacrifice always in mind, and to draw inspiration from her dedication  and devotion to God and country--to all those who sacrificed everything  ``to proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the  inhabitants thereof.''                            ____________________
