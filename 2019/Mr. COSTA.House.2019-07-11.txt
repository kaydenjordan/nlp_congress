 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the  continuing humanitarian crisis that is taking place at our border  between the United States and Mexico.   Despite Congress' recent effort to provide relief to thousands of  people in detention centers, children continue to be separated from  their families, and people continue suffer from a lack of basic living  standards that they need.   This is not the American way.   What is more, this administration has just announced new ICE raids in  major American cities that will solve nothing.   We need to do more. Congress needs to act and seek long-term  solutions to addressing the problems forcing people to flee their homes  and seek asylum, women and children literally moving 2,000 miles, and  they are not coming to Disneyland.   Congress needs to act. We should be focusing on attacking the problem  at its source by increasing support to Central American countries like  El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, where the majority of these  migrants are coming from.   We should not be cutting foreign aid to these countries. That just  exacerbates the problem. I asked Secretary Pompeo in a hearing of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs almost 2 months ago: Why does not the  President call a meeting with the President of Mexico and bring  together the Organization of American States to come up with a  comprehensive long-term solution to this problem?   I have spoken with the Ambassador from Mexico to the United States.  She has expressed to me the problem that they are facing at their  southern border with Guatemala. That is what we should be doing,  cooperating and working with the Mexican Government and our other  neighbors to the south.   We must also work to secure a basic standard of living for the  detention facilities to provide for immediate relief. That is why I am  cosponsoring H.R. 3239, Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in CBP  Custody, to provide house screening and emergency care, to improve  water and sanitation and hygiene standards, and to improve nutrition  and shelter standards.   These are things that we are doing in the Middle East with the  refugee relief programs for the Syrian refugees. Why would we not do  this at our own border, and increase the coordination and surge  capacity for the agencies to address what the needs are of these  migrants?   We really do have a humanitarian crisis at our border, to be sure. I  think we all recognize and understand that.   But, finally, we need to work together. We need to work together in a  bipartisan fashion. That is how Congress should operate to achieve  lasting, comprehensive immigration reform.   When I first came to Congress, I supported comprehensive immigration  reform with the Bush administration and then with the Obama  administration.   In 2013, we had a bipartisan package that was very close to passage.  As a matter of fact, I think it would have passed the House had the  Speaker at the time brought it to the floor. Unfortunately, we lost  that opportunity.   I urge my colleagues to join me in their commitment to working to  resolve this humanitarian crisis that we are facing at the border. That  is the American way. That is what we should be doing as Members of  Congress.                            ____________________
