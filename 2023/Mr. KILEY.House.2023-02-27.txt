 Mr. Speaker, Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh has announced  his intention to leave the Biden administration, and reports suggest  Deputy Secretary Julie Su is the leading candidate to replace him. As  chair of the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, I am urging  President Biden, in the strongest terms, not to appoint Julie Su to  this important cabinet post.   Prior to joining the Biden Labor Department, Su was California's  Secretary of Labor under Governor Gavin Newsom. To say she failed the  people of California in that role would be an extreme understatement. I  was serving in the State assembly during her tenure. I witnessed  firsthand failures on a scale that no State in this country has ever  experienced.   I have already sent a coalition letter from Members of the California  Congressional delegation to President Biden urging him to nominate  someone, anyone, other than Su. Today, I will expand on the points we  raised in that letter.   The amount of suffering Su's labor department inflicted on my  constituents and millions of Californians needs to be understood by the  President and by every Senator who would be voting on her nomination.                                time  2030    Specifically, I will be discussing three main failures in her tenure  in California, each of which is independently disqualifying.   First, under her supervision, California's unemployment office, known  as the EDD, failed to deliver benefits to millions of Californians.   Second, at the same time, thanks to Su's gross negligence, the EDD  allowed the largest fraud of taxpayer dollars in history.   Third, Su helped destroy the careers of thousands of California  freelancers as an architect of a labor law that effectively bans  independent work.   Let's start first by looking at the EDD's staggering failures under  Su's watch to perform its basic function of delivering benefits to the  unemployed.   California had the highest or second-highest unemployment rate in the  entire country through most of the COVID-19 era. This in itself could  be seen as a significant failing of the State's secretary of labor.  What was even worse is that those people who lost their paychecks on  the government's orders, millions of Californians, had to wait weeks,  months, or in some cases indefinitely for the unemployment benefits  they were entitled to by law.   Now, in fairness, the COVID shutdown presented unemployment  departments with unprecedented demands, and a number of States  struggled to keep up. What happened in California under Su's management  is simply without comparison.   An estimated 5 million claims were delayed, many for months on end.  An estimated 1 million people were wrongfully denied benefits. As a  result, many of my constituents were left helpless with no income, no  ability to provide for their families. Many became dependent on food  banks and had to cut back on basic necessities. They had to dip into  their lifesavings or take on debt.   For example, in late April 2020, my office received a call from a  woman named Emily, who was inconsolable, saying she was on the brink of  giving up hope. She was out of work and her EDD claim had been pending  for a month. She had no money, no way to pay her bills or put food on  the table. I just can't do this anymore, she said, adding that she  couldn't hang on the Governor's promises anymore. We later learned the  agency had made a basic processing error, denying her claim and not  even telling her.   I could provide hundreds of other stories just like this. At times,  during 2020, my office would open dozens of new cases every day from  constituents who could not get their benefits. We heard from folks who  would call the EDD hundreds of times with no answer, who received  notices with someone else's Social Security number, someone else's  employer, someone else's earnings, who would wait weeks, months, or  forever for their benefits.   The level of service was worse than anything I had ever seen in  government, eclipsing the very worst horror stories of bureaucratic  ineptitude. By one estimate, only one in a thousand people would reach  a live person when they tried to call the EDD.   Sometimes, after finally getting through, the caller would be  abruptly hung up on. The callback option routinely failed with people  requesting a call back and then not getting one.   Often, no reason was given for benefit denials, and when one was  given, it often didn't make sense. One claimant had an electronic  application denied as illegible--an electronic application.   San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, a Democrat, started a hashtag  featuring the worst of these incidents. He called it #EDDfailoftheday.   Months went by with no progress made. You don't need to take my word  for it. In July 2020, 61 of the 80 members of the California Assembly,  mostly Democrats, wrote as follows:   ``In our fifth month of the pandemic, with so many constituents yet  to receive a single unemployment payment, it is clear that EDD is  failing California. Millions of our constituents have had no income for  months. As Californians wait for answers from EDD, they have depleted  their lifesavings, have gone into extreme debt, and are in deep panic  as they figure out how to put food on the table and a roof over their  heads.''   The lawmakers went on to explain how the EDD, time and again, failed  to take responsibility and failed to correct its mistakes. They wrote  that they had been met with longwinded excuses, fumbling non-answers,  or unclear and inconsistent data, along with a ``lack of transparency  and accountability,'' even ``obfuscation and dishonesty'' in their  dealings with the agency.   We have exhausted all avenues at our disposal, they said, as the  agency had addressed only a few of the many issues we have highlighted  for months and was only scratching the surface of the disaster that is  the EDD.   Those are the words of the Democrat supermajority in the legislature:  the disaster that is the EDD. The legislators lamented ``how little has  improved at EDD over the course of the pandemic.''   Independent reports would soon confirm the extent of the agency's  mismanagement and deception. While the EDD had said in July 2020 that  its claims backlog would be cleared by September, a report found 1.5  million claims remained unresolved and the backlog was increasing by  10,000 each week.   The independent Legislative Analyst's Office found the EDD  mischaracterized the crisis repeatedly to the legislature. For  instance, the EDD claimed that 705,000 claims were denied when the real  number was 3.4 million.   Under Julie Su, California's unemployment office became the national  poster child for government failure. Su failed to prevent avoidable  problems, failed to address the crisis as it spiraled out of control,  and failed to honestly acknowledge problems after the fact.   Millions of Californians paid the price. It bears emphasizing that  these were people who had lost their jobs on the government's orders  and had been paying into the very system that was now failing them.   Even allies of the Governor and Secretary Su concluded that she was  responsible. Democrat Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, who is  chairwoman of the Assembly Accountability and Administrative Review  Committee, said that Su has not done a  [[Page H908]]  good job at running the Employment Development Department, saying that  Su's mismanagement caused heartache for millions of Californians.    That is the first reason, that heartbreak for millions, why President  Biden should not even consider elevating Deputy Secretary Su. The  second independent basis for disqualification is the historic fraud of  taxpayer dollars that occurred on her watch.   As so many hardworking citizens waited in vain for the checks that  they were owed by the EDD, there was one group of claimants for whom  the delivery of benefits was swift and seamless: prisoners and  fraudsters who were not entitled to them.   In the largest fraud of taxpayer dollars in history, an estimated $32  billion was wrongfully paid out from the EDD to State prison inmates  and international crime syndicates. Payments were made to murderers,  rapists, and child molesters, and 133 death row inmates collected over  $400,000. These hardened criminals didn't have to try hard. They used  names like Dianne Feinstein and John Doe without raising an eyebrow.  The district attorney of Sacramento County called the scheme  ``relatively easy.''   The scale of this fraud boggles the mind. It equates to over $800 per  person in California. The amount of money wasted was enough to pay the  annual salary of 330,000 teachers in California. You could end world  hunger with this kind of money.   Where did the money go? It went to the worst of the worst, funding  organized crime both domestically and internationally. This $32 billion  was used not to help citizens who had lost their jobs or to pay  teachers or to end hunger but to fund further criminal activities.   It was easily preventable. Nothing even close to this happened in any  other State. The reason it happened in California was Secretary Julie  Su. She made the inexplicable decision to forgo a basic fraud  prevention system. She ignored the Federal Government's guidance that  claims be crosschecked against the prison rolls, which was standard  practice in other States. The agency sent hundreds of benefit cards to  the same address, sent cards directly to correctional facilities, and  issued benefits to infants and centenarians.   The district attorney of Sacramento County called the EDD's response  to the fraud ``slow and nonexistent'' and advised to look to other  States for solutions.   Fresno County's district attorney said the administration did nothing  until the elected district attorneys brought it to the media, adding  that she did not think the State ``has a handle on it.'' Riverside  County's district attorney said: ``I don't know who was at the wheel.''   The chairwoman of the State Assembly committee responsible for  overseeing the EDD, a Democrat, decried the failure to follow ``simple  and obvious steps that are implemented across the country.'' She added:  ``It is absurd. This is outrageous.''   Perhaps most outrageous of all, as the district attorneys who  uncovered the fraud put it: ``Fraudulent unemployment claims deny those  who have lost their employment, many due to COVID-19, who are legally  eligible for benefits and are truly in need from getting the financial  assistance they need.''   Assemblyman David Chiu, a Democrat from San Francisco, summed it up  this way: ``It is egregious that my constituents make a single typo  that holds up their EDD benefits for months while an inmate on death  row can use a fake name and still get benefits paid out.''   As if these first two reasons were not enough--the heartbreak for  millions and the waste of billions--Deputy Secretary Su should not be  elevated to the Biden cabinet for a third independent reason. As  California's secretary of labor, she championed and ruthlessly enforced  a labor law that has been called one of the most destructive pieces of  legislation in the past 20 years.   It wasn't me that called it that. This quote came from Gavin Newsom's  own former deputy chief of staff, Yashar Ali, who added: ``It is truly  horrific how many people have been negatively impacted by the law.''   That law, AB5, effectively bans independent work of any kind. While  it was promoted as a way to convert rideshare drivers to the status of  W-2 employees, the law has ensnared hundreds of professions:  videographers and caricaturists, transcriptionists and interpreters,  technicians and engineers, analysts and consultants, musicians and  conductors, artists and dancers, writers and editors, coaches and  trainers, teachers and tutors, nurses and doulas. Hardly an industry or  trade is unscathed.   It is a law so bad that affected industries have had to lobby the  legislature for exceptions, over 100 of which have been granted, but  only to those with enough influence. Countless other Californians,  spanning hundreds of professions, remain subject to the law and have  lost their ability to earn a living in our State or had their  professional options severely restricted.   In fact, many national companies now explicitly disclaim on their  applications that they can no longer work with California freelancers.  In many professions, independent contracting is the only viable  business model. In others, it is much preferred, thanks to the  flexibility and freedom it affords. Regardless, the blunt instrument of  AB5 forbids it.   Most devastated by this law are the most vulnerable: seniors,  caregivers, students, reformed convicts, single mothers, people with  disabilities or health issues or mental health needs, all of whom rely  on independent contracting to balance work with their personal life  circumstances.   Consider just a few testimonials of Californians whose lives have  been upended by the law.   A woman named Jodie said: ``I worked years to gain my skill as an  American Sign Language interpreter. It was my goal since I was 9 years  old. After AB5, I lost all three of my agencies. The dream I worked for  is lost. I can't provide for my family and thousands of California's  deaf won't be serviced.''   Andy said: ``I work with underserved artists of color. None of my  career as an artist, technician, designer, and producer would have been  possible under AB5. Artists of color will be less able to create their  own work.''    Megan said: ``I am a nurse practitioner. AB5 is widening the gap in  healthcare as small rural practices that can only be staffed with  contractors shut their doors. Setting my own schedule has allowed me to  spend time with my children that I will no longer be able to.''   Daniel said: ``I am a chiropractor in California. I was just  terminated from my wonderful independent contract, 10 hours per week  job. The company cited AB5. I have had this job for 10 years. The job  allowed me flexibility to take care of my three special needs kids. Now  it is gone.''   Jared said: ``AB5 forced me to shut down my business. I went from  making $80,000 per year in home services to a minimum wage employee. My  family trade is gone. I have gone from working 4 days a week to spend  time with my kids to not knowing if I can make ends meet working 7  days.''   Kathi said: ``I am a 71-year-old transcriber. I raised six kids and  went to work in my forties, but I had to retire at 62 due to health  issues. I depend on my at-home transcription pay to survive and pay my  bills. For 8 years I did okay, until AB5.''                                time  2045    Barbara said: ``I am a proofreader. Competition is fierce, and it is  hard to get clients, but I did it. I was thrilled to choose jobs I was  best suited for and to work when I wanted. After AB 5, Californians  need not apply.''   Julie Su has been called an ``architect'' of this law. After its  enactment, she used her position as California Secretary of Labor to  ruthlessly enforce it.   Here is what Su said in her own words: ``The way to enforce AB 5 is  just doing investigations and audits. That will be on both wages and  tax. So we will be doing investigations and audits so that those who  want to comply with the need to reclassify can do so, and those who  don't will understand that is not the kind of economy we want in  California.''   Think about how callous those words are, Mr. Speaker.   Just wiping out hundreds of professions of countless people, ``that  is not the kind of economy we want in California,'' she said.  [[Page H909]]    She went on to say: ``So we can issue citations and demand both wages  and taxes and other kinds of penalties.''   Su shamelessly kicked this harassment strategy into high gear after  the COVID shutdowns began. She even defied the will of Congress in the  process. It was one of the most disgraceful episodes of the COVID era  in California. Congress had provided benefits to independent  contractors through the CARES Act and put States in charge of  distributing those benefits. Yet under Julie Su, the EDD wrongfully  withheld those benefits as she aimed to exploit this sudden need that  independent contractors had to interface with her department.   A website called The People v. AB 5, run by four self-described  ``Democrats who support unions'' but were opponents of the law,  explained Su's scheme. They wrote that EDD ``attempted to weaponize the  COVID-19 crisis by leading out-of-work Californians into a trap.''   Instead of giving them access to the benefits Congress had included  for independent contractors in the CARES Act, the EDD tried to shoehorn  them into the regular unemployment system where they would then have to  name the names of their business partners. Then, once it had that list,  EDD would pounce, launching audits of the named businesses for  allegedly violating AB 5 and hitting them with fines ranging from  $5,000 to $25,000 per ``misclassification.'' This would be applied  retroactively to before the law even existed.   The website gave an example of a small ``princess for your little  girl's birthday party,'' business whose owner was audited and fined  $60,000 dating back several years.   Incredibly, as small businesses were on their last legs, the EDD  plowed ahead with these harassing audits using personnel that could  have been processing unemployment claims or detecting fraud. The worst  consequence of all this was that countless freelancers who were forced  out of work by AB 5, COVID, or some combination of the two, had to wait  weeks or months for benefits as Su's department played its political  games.   You don't need to take my word for this, Mr. Speaker. California  Congressman Adam Schiff wrote a letter to Secretary Su in April of 2020  rebuking her for failing to release the benefits independent  contractors were owed under the CARES Act.   Schiff wrote as follows:         I represent thousands of independent, freelance contract,       and gig workers, including many in the entertainment       industry, who often do not qualify for standard unemployment       benefits. The CARES Act, which was signed into law 2 weeks       ago, dramatically expands unemployment coverage, and I led an       effort in the House to extend this coverage to nontraditional       and independent workers.        As States are now working to implement these expanded       benefits, I am hearing from many of my newly eligible       constituents who are concerned because they are not yet able       to apply and are increasingly worried as their financial       responsibilities continue to mount without anticipated       income.    It is little wonder that the coalition behind AB 5 has issued a  letter endorsing Su to be President Biden's new Secretary of Labor. The  letter signed by the California Labor Federation, SEIU California, and  the California Teachers Association, among others, begins: ``There is  no one more qualified to help lead.''   They know exactly where she would lead the country: down the same  disastrous path as California--something her former boss, Gavin Newsom,  has explicitly called for, saying that California is a model for the  Nation and promising to highlight California's ``policy innovations''  so they can be scaled up nationally.   Given Julie Su's role as an architect and enforcer of AB 5, there is  no doubt that as U.S. Secretary of Labor she would do everything in her  power--and likely things not properly in her power--to nationalize the  law and its destructive consequences.   In fact, there are already two vehicles for doing so. The PRO Act,  which passed the House last year would cost at least 350,000 freelance  workers their ability to earn a living, and at this moment, the  Department of Labor has a proposed rule that would similarly threaten  the livelihoods of independent contractors nationwide.   This is not a trivial matter. Fifty-seven million Americans engage in  freelance work. They deserve a Secretary of Labor who defends their  freedom to work and respects them as professionals. Julie Su's track  record suggests she would be a Secretary who does just the opposite.   President Biden faces a very clear choice: Does he want a Secretary  of Labor who will fight for workers, taxpayers, and citizens, or does  he want the hand-selected rubberstamp of special interest groups?   This is a moment of vital importance for the American workforce. We  are coming out of an era of unprecedented upheaval and heading toward  an era of unpredictable transformation.   The position of Secretary of Labor cannot be treated as a gift to  special interests. It cannot be occupied by someone who has harmed so  many workers in so many ways. It cannot be consumed by the incompetence  and corruption that Californians are all too familiar with.   Mr. Speaker, I urge President Biden to cease consideration of Julie  Su for Labor Secretary and to appoint a new Secretary who is competent  and qualified, who is pro-worker and pro-small businesses, who will  work with Democrats and Republicans alike, who will unleash our  economic potential rather than suppress it, and who understands that it  is ingenuity and hard work--not the heavy hand of government--that has  made the American workforce the greatest engine for progress the world  has ever known.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 51 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, February 28, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
