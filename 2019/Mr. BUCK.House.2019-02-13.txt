 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I am an original cosponsor of this  resolution, and it was my understanding at the time that I cosponsored  this that we would have the opportunity to make this resolution better.  This amendment that I have offered does just that.   I actually thought of this amendment after the chairman of the  committee held a hearing on this issue, and I listened carefully to the  witnesses.  [[Page H1553]]  The witnesses talked about the fact that our intelligence sharing with  Saudi Arabia helped target sites in Yemen to bomb and reduced civilian  casualties.   I want to make sure that we continue to help Saudi Arabia reduce  civilian casualties. I want to make sure that we are doing everything  we can to avoid the humanitarian crisis there. At the same time, we  recognize the geopolitical significance of our relationship with Saudi  Arabia.   I support the resolution with the understanding that we have an  opportunity to improve this legislation. I am concerned about how  broadly the legislation is drafted, and it may inadvertently call into  question our ability to maintain intelligence-sharing agreements around  the globe; not just in this situation.   My amendment addresses these potential unintended consequences by  guaranteeing that this resolution does not curtail our Nation's  intelligence-sharing capabilities. It ensures our country will not face  another major terrorist attack or be caught flat-footed in battle  because the necessary intelligence information didn't reach our  leaders.   My amendment keeps the spirit of this important legislation intact,  while ensuring that this Congress isn't hamstringing our intelligence  capabilities.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment that will keep our intelligence sharing agreements in place.   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's remarks, but it  doesn't. This resolution is not clear, and that is the problem. This  amendment clarifies something that is unclear.   My friends on the other side of the aisle feel that we must cut our  intelligence-sharing operations in order to fully withdraw our forces  from the region. I don't believe that this is the right course.   The Middle East is a dangerous, war-torn part of the world where we  need intelligence sharing more than ever. As such, we must ensure that  we are not putting our intelligence agreements in jeopardy by passing  this resolution.   My amendment keeps the intent of this legislation, allowing Congress  to exercise its Article I powers, while ensuring that we are not  cutting off our nose to spite our face.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 252,  noes 177, not voting 8, as follows:                               [Roll No. 81]                                 AYES--252       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Axne      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (UT)      Bost      Brady      Brindisi      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burchett      Burgess      Bustos      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Case      Chabot      Cheney      Cisneros      Cline      Cloud      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Conaway      Cook      Correa      Craig      Crawford      Crenshaw      Crow      Cuellar      Cunningham      Curtis      Davids (KS)      Davidson (OH)      Davis, Rodney      Delgado      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Duffy      Duncan      Dunn      Emmer      Estes      Ferguson      Finkenauer      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx (NC)      Fulcher      Gaetz      Gallagher      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Golden      Gonzalez (OH)      Gonzalez-Colon (PR)      Gooden      Gosar      Gottheimer      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Green (TN)      Griffith      Grothman      Guest      Guthrie      Hagedorn      Harder (CA)      Harris      Hartzler      Hastings      Hern, Kevin      Herrera Beutler      Hice (GA)      Higgins (LA)      Hill (AR)      Hill (CA)      Holding      Hollingsworth      Horn, Kendra S.
