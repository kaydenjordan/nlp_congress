 Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nomination of Judge  Brett Kavanaugh, as some of my colleagues have been doing today.   President Trump has chosen a superbly qualified nominee to the  Supreme Court--and believe me, I know what is good and what isn't good.  Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most widely respected judges in the  country. He has authored 300 opinions during his 12 years on the bench  in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals--the second highest court in the  country. The Supreme Court has adopted the positions in his opinions a  dozen times. He has written multiple dissents that have carried the day  in the Supreme Court. He has authored articles in the Harvard Law  Review, the Yale Law Journal, and the Georgetown Law Journal. He has  also taught courses at Harvard, Yale, and Georgetown. None other than  Elena Kagan, in fact, hired him to teach at Harvard.   I would like to take some time today to focus on a subject on which  Judge Kavanaugh has really made his mark as a jurist. I want to talk  about substance. I want to talk about what Judge Kavanaugh has written  in his opinions and how he has been a true intellectual leader on the  court. I hope my colleagues on both sides listen to this because we  haven't had a nominee like him in a long time.   So much of the discussion about Judge Kavanaugh, so far, has been  substance-free. Democrats have hurled accusation after accusation that  has been divorced from reality. They say those who support Judge  Kavanaugh are complicit and evil. They say his nomination threatens the  destruction of the Constitution. They say people will die if he is  confirmed. Lost in all of this is any actual discussion of Judge  Kavanaugh's written opinions, of the way he approaches cases.   When Judge Kavanaugh met with me last month, he said he hoped my  colleagues would read his opinions. That is how they can learn what  kind of a judge he is. That is how they can learn how he thinks. That  is how they can learn why he is so respected by Democrats and  Republicans alike who are on the circuit courts of appeals and who hold  other judgeships.   Regrettably, my Democratic colleagues have been too busy one-upping  each other's apocalyptic rhetoric to take a look at what Judge  Kavanaugh has actually written, so I would like to take some time to do  that today. I would like to focus in particular on the subject on which  Judge Kavanaugh has arguably had his greatest influence as a judge--the  separation of powers.   The separation of powers is a core component of our Constitution. It  is, in fact, the first and the most important way the Constitution  protects our liberty.   Justice Scalia was fond of saying that ``the genius of the American  constitutional system is the dispersal of  [[Page S5552]]  power.'' By separating authority among competing branches of government  and then further dividing it between the Federal Government and the  States, the Constitution makes it extremely difficult--indeed, nearly  impossible--for any one individual or faction to consolidate enough  power to truly threaten liberty. The side effect, of course, is a  degree of inefficiency because you must get so many people with so many  divergent interests to agree in order to enact lasting changes.   Policymaking can be a messy, slow process, but that was the point. By  creating multiple power centers, the Founders ensured that no one  person or group could exercise too much power.   Sometimes we forget that the purpose of the separation of powers is  to protect liberty. We get frustrated with the slow pace of  legislation, and so we want to give more power to the executive branch  because the President can act more quickly than a large, multimember  body like Congress. Yet we do not want to give the executive branch too  much power because the President might not always be of our same party.  So we create these weird hybrids called agencies that, like Congress,  create rules for people to follow but that, like the President, are  able to act quickly when necessary. Also, like the President, these  agencies decide when and how to enforce the law. They decide when to  bring suit or when to levy penalties for violations of agency rules.  They exercise significant power over our lives, and they don't fit  neatly within the constitutional design because they partake of all  three branches of government.   Judge Kavanaugh sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit,  often called the second highest court in the land. The DC Circuit  enjoys this esteemed position because it hears many of the cases that  involve these agencies that I have just described.   Federal agencies have significant power over many aspects of our  lives, and the DC Circuit has authority to review the actions of nearly  every Federal agency--important parties, important court.   Judge Kavanaugh's central contribution to separation of powers  jurisprudence has been his commitment to upholding the structure of our  constitutional design against misguided efforts to insulate agencies  from political accountability.   I described earlier how agencies are these weird hybrids. Like  Congress, they make laws in the form of regulations. Like the  President, they enforce those laws. Like the judiciary, they adjudicate  disputes that arise under those laws, the very same laws they wrote in  the first place. It is a recipe for abuse if not kept under control.  That is why Judge Kavanaugh has been so careful to scrutinize agency  design and agency decision making to ensure that officials have the  necessary accountability. Accountability is what keeps these agencies  in check, given that the traditional separation of powers, which is  what keeps our three branches of government in check, does not apply.   In only his second term on the DC Circuit, Judge Kavanaugh authored a  masterful dissent in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board was a  newfangled agency that Congress created in 2002 in the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act. The Board has broad authority to regulate audits of public  companies and oversees the registration and inspection of audit firms.  It also sets audit standards and brings enforcement actions against  violators. It is, in short, a very important agency.   The problem with the Board was that Congress had chosen to completely  insulate it from political accountability. Board members are not chosen  by the President. They are chosen by the Securities and Exchange  Commission, which is, in turn, chosen by the President. Board members  cannot be removed by the President. They can be removed only by the  SEC, which, in turn, can be removed by the President.   The rub was that Congress had placed strict limits on the SEC's  ability to remove Board members and strict limits on the President's  ability to remove SEC Commissioners. The Securities and Exchange  Commission could remove a Board member only for ``good cause shown,''  and the President could remove an SEC Commissioner only for  ``inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.'' So not  only could the President not remove a Board member who was doing a bad  job, but he also could not remove an SEC Commissioner for refusing to  remove a Board member who was doing a bad job unless he could somehow  show that the SEC Commissioner's failure to remove the Board member was  a neglect of duty.   As Judge Kavanaugh explained:         The President's power to remove is critical to the       President's power to control the Executive Branch and perform       his Article II responsibilities. Yet under this statute, the       President is two levels of [removal limitations] away from       Board members. . . . This structure effectively eliminates       any Presidential power to control the [Board],       notwithstanding that the Board performs numerous regulatory       and law-enforcement functions at the core of executive power.    Judge Kavanaugh's logic was inescapable: The President cannot do his  job if he cannot control his subordinates, and he cannot control his  subordinates if he cannot remove them from office. The structure of the  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board made it immune from  Presidential control and, thus, immune from political accountability.  Here, you had an agency exercising executive power with no oversight  from the Chief Executive himself. This is contrary to the separation of  powers, which vests executive authority in the President precisely  because the President is a politically accountable actor.   As Justice Jackson memorably taught, the power to enforce the law is  among the most awesome of powers granted to government. By cutting off  the exercise of executive power from Presidential oversight, the  Board's structure violated the Constitution.   Although Judge Kavanaugh's position was the minority view among his  DC Circuit colleagues, his position ultimately prevailed at the Supreme  Court. It was a significant victory for a young judge and a sign of  things to come.   Over the next decade, Judge Kavanaugh continued to uphold the  separation of powers in a range of cases that called on him to  interpret the scope of agency authority. He brought a discerning eye to  these cases, always careful to ensure that agencies did not act beyond  the powers Congress had granted them.   In Loving v. Internal Revenue Service, for example, he rejected an  effort by the IRS to stretch the words of a statute authorizing the IRS  to regulate the practice of ``representatives of persons before the  Department of the Treasury'' to include the authority to regulate tax  preparers.   Similarly, in White Stallion Energy Center v. EPA, Judge Kavanaugh  concluded that the EPA contravened the Clean Air Act when it refused to  consider costs in setting air quality regulations. This was yet another  case in which Judge Kavanaugh's position ultimately prevailed at the  Supreme Court itself.   Of course, Judge Kavanaugh's searching review doesn't mean that  agencies always lose. In American Trucking Association v. EPA, for  instance, he upheld the EPA decision to authorize a State emissions  rule over a vigorous dissent because he concluded the Agency had met  the statutory requirements in rendering its decision.   The key is that Judge Kavanaugh reviews agency action carefully to  ensure that it conforms to Congress's commands. This is an essential  aspect of the separation of powers. Congress determines the limits of  agency authority. Congress sets the rules for when agencies may and may  not act and for what they may and may not do. That is the very essence  of legislative power--the power to set the rules that others must  follow.   When agencies transgress the bounds Congress has laid down, they  exercise power that no one has granted them, power that Congress alone  can give.   Judge Kavanaugh returned to the theme of agency accountability and  the separation of powers in another powerful dissent earlier this year.  The case is PHH Corporation v. CFPB, and it is another tour de force  for Judge Kavanaugh.   At issue in the case is the structure of the Consumer Financial  Protection  [[Page S5553]]  Bureau, or CFPB. The CFPB is an incredibly powerful agency with vast  authority over American life. Its jurisdiction includes banks, credit  unions, securities firms, payday lenders, mortgage servicers, and an  array of other financial services companies.   When Congress created the CFPB in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, it placed  strict limits on the President's ability to remove the agency's head.  Specifically, Congress provided that the President may remove the CFPB  Director only for ``inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.''   You may recall that language from my discussion of the Free  Enterprise Fund case. It is the same restriction that Congress placed  on the President's ability to remove SEC Commissioners, but there is a  significant difference between the SEC and the CFPB.   The SEC is a multimember body. It cannot act without the agreement of  a majority of Commissioners. The CFPB, by contrast, is a unitary body.  It has a single Director. The only person the CFPB Director has to  agree with is himself. Coupled with the fact that the CFPB is an  incredibly powerful agency whose funding isn't even directly controlled  by Congress, this raises serious separation of powers concerns.    An agency head who can do virtually whatever he wants without fear of  Presidential reprimand, and who can do it on his own without having to  get the consent of fellow Commissioners, is accountable to no one. The  President cannot check him. His colleagues cannot check him. In a very  real sense, he is a law unto himself.   Judge Kavanaugh's dissent confronts this problem head-on in its very  opening lines:         This is a case about executive power and individual       liberty. To prevent tyranny and protect individual liberty,       the Framers of the Constitution separated the legislative,       executive, and judicial powers of the new national       government. To further safeguard liberty, the Framers       insisted upon accountability for the exercise of executive       power. The Framers lodged full responsibility for the       executive power in a President of the United States who is       elected by and accountable to the people.    Judge Kavanaugh then eloquently explains how the CFPB's structure and  limits on Presidential oversight violates these core principles. He  said:         The Director of the CFPB wields enormous power over       American businesses, American consumers, and the overall U.S.       economy. . . . The Director alone may decide what rules to       issue. The Director alone may decide how to enforce, when to       enforce, and against whom to enforce the law. The Director       alone may decide whether an individual or entity has violated       the law. The Director alone may decide what sanctions and       penalties to impose on violators of the law. Because the CFPB       is an independent agency headed by a single Director and not       by a multi-member commission, the Director of the CFPB       possesses more unilateral authority--that is, authority to       take action on one's own, subject to no check--than any       single commissioner or board member in any other independent       agency in the U.S. Government.    And then Judge Kavanaugh drops the hammer. He said:         [O]ther than the President, the Director enjoys more       unilateral authority than any other official in any of the       three branches of the U.S. Government. That combination--      power that is massive in scope, concentrated in a single       person, and unaccountable to the President--triggers the       important constitutional question at issue in this case.    Judge Kavanaugh eloquently explains how the CFPB's structure, coupled  with the agency's complete lack of accountability, poses a threat to  individual liberty. The CFPB wields enormous power and yet is  accountable to no one--not the President, not the Congress, not the  American people.   The central purpose of the separation of powers is to prevent any one  individual group from wielding too much power. It does this by  dispersing authority and by playing the branches off of each other. But  the CFPB's structure does not disperse power. It consolidates power,  and it does so in a single individual who has no superior. This is a  textbook violation of the separation of powers and one that I fully  expect the Supreme Court to correct if it hears this particular case.    I have spoken at length today about Judge Kavanaugh's writing and  jurisprudence. I focused on actual cases that he has decided and on his  important contributions to constitutional law.   In short, I have done what Judge Kavanaugh asked me to do. I have  reviewed his opinions and considered his analyses. I have done what all  of my colleagues should be doing. We should be reading what Judge  Kavanaugh has actually written. We should be looking at his judicial  philosophy and how he decides cases.   Judge Kavanaugh is an outstanding choice for the Supreme Court. His  opinions are cogent, his writing eloquent, and his reasoning ironclad.  He understands that the purpose of the Constitution is to preserve  liberty and that the Constitution does so both through the substantive  guarantees in the Bill of Rights and reconstruction amendments, and  through the structural protections in articles I, II, and III of the  Constitution.   Congress may from time to time experiment with new ways of delegating  authority or structuring agencies, but it cannot do so in ways that  violate our Constitution's separation of powers. Individuals who  exercise Executive power must be accountable to the President. Agency  officials cannot be fully insulated from Presidential oversight. A  person who has power to regulate broad swaths of our Nation's economy  must have some checks on his or her authority. This is a requirement  for our system of government. It is a requirement of our Constitution,  and it is essential to the preservation of liberty.   Judge Kavanaugh understands this. He understands the Constitution. He  understands the proper role of a judge. He is one of the most brilliant  and most distinguished legal thinkers in our country today. I am proud  to support his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, and I urge all of  my colleagues to support him as well.   We have to get away from the politics of the Supreme Court. When we  have someone who has the qualities, the ability, the reputation, and  the historicity of doing what is right on the bench, we should give  that person an opportunity to serve.   Judge Kavanaugh deserves an opportunity to serve. He has more than  adequately proved that he deserves it. We are going to be lucky to have  him on the U.S. Supreme Court.   I am not sure that he is always going to rule the way I want him to  rule, either, but nobody does, and from time to time, we may be  disappointed. But the fact is that I know one thing: He is going to  apply the best of legal knowledge to the opinions that he writes, and  he will be a force on the Court who will get along with the other  Justices by showing mutual respect for them and receiving mutual  respect back from them.   Judge Kavanaugh is the type of guy who really will make a tremendous  difference for our country. He deserves this appointment. We need to  sustain him and support him, and we need to get the politics out of  this nomination.   We are lucky that he is willing to serve. I believe that almost  everyone in this body will henceforth, once he is confirmed, come to  the conclusion that we are really lucky to have him as a Justice on the  U.S. Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.
