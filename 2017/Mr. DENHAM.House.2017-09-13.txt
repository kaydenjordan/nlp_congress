 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this en bloc package  which includes my amendments to the Financial Services division of this  bill.   Mr. Chair, my amendment supports the efficient implementation of the  Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act. This is the act that I authored  that was signed into law last year that simply puts in place a board to  manage, to liquidate, to identify unneeded and vacant properties.   There is an opportunity we have today to sell off the things that we  don't need: properties that have been sitting vacant for years,  properties that are costing us millions and millions and billions  across the country. There is an opportunity for us not only to sell  these off and bring in the much-needed revenue to start building roads,  bridges, and put towards our infrastructure package, but also to get  them redeveloped, rebuilding communities and putting people back to  work.   Now, what we need right now is to get this board put into place, and  congressional leadership will make recommendations to the President on  their board. We need the Senate to confirm the chairperson of the  board, and, finally, we need an executive director and a staff to help  vet these high-value properties and push the reluctant agencies that  don't want to get rid of these properties to actually liquidate the  things that they don't need.   It is time to put this board in place, and this en bloc amendment  will help us to do so. This will help us to build infrastructure across  the country and sell off the things that we don't need.
