 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is good to see the Senator from Hawaii  as the Presiding Officer.   Madam President, I rise today to honor workers in this building-- something that Senator Hirono does every day of her life in this job-- workers in this building who are too often overlooked but whose work is  essential to the functioning of our government: our Capitol custodial  staff.   In the days after the January 6 insurrection, when domestic  terrorists stormed this building, we rightly honored Capitol Police  Officer Eugene Goodman and many other Capitol police officers who put  their lives on the line to protect all of us, to protect our democratic  process, and, essentially, to protect our democracy.   Last week, I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in introducing  legislation to award Officer Goodman the  [[Page S116]]  Congressional Gold Medal. He and others may well have saved our lives  and protected our democracy. They did it without the support they  needed from their leadership. They did it without the support from the  Trump White House on down.   But those officers aren't the only ones who deserve our honor and our  gratitude. They are not the only ones who put their lives on the line  serving our country on January 6 or over the past year during this  pandemic.   Every day, Capitol custodial staff do their jobs with skill,  dedication, and dignity. They showed up for work during this pandemic  even when many in this building didn't take it seriously and put those  workers' health at risk by not wearing masks.   Capitol custodial workers were here on January 6, doing their jobs,  when White supremacists stormed this building, barging into this  Chamber, acting as though no one could ever possibly hold them  accountable. Because the President was on their side, they thought they  were invulnerable.   And when their rampage was over, it was largely the Black and Brown  custodians who were left to restore dignity and respect to the Capitol.  Their work allowed us to continue ours that night: certifying the  electoral votes, securing the election and our democracy.   Many Americans were so moved to see those workers still doing their  jobs. That is what service looks like. That is what love of country  looks like. That is what the dignity of work is all about.   Unfortunately, it tells you a whole lot about the problems that have  been allowed to fester for too long in this country: White supremacists  make a mess; Black workers clean it up.   We have a lot of work to do to fix that and to ensure that hard work  pays off for all workers in this country. We simply don't value and  respect all work the way we should.   I think of the words of Dr. King, who, as you know, died fighting for  workers, sanitation workers in Memphis. He said:         If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep       streets even as Michelangelo painted or Beethoven composed       music or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so       well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to       say, ``Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job       well.''    Dr. King said:         No work is insignificant. All labor that uplifts humanity       has dignity and importance.    No work is insignificant. All labor has dignity. We ought to treat it  that way, starting with honoring these workers.   In the days after January 6, pictures of Capitol workers cleaning up  after these terrorists were reported on the news, captured by dedicated  journalists who also risked their lives to do their jobs that day.  These photos struck a chord with so many people. Americans began  writing thank-you letters, sending them to the Architect of the Capitol  to pass on to custodial staff, to police officers, and to others.   Many of these workers are represented by AFSCME Local 626, which  gives workers a voice on the job and is also working on ways to honor  its members.   Members of Congress should do the same. In the coming weeks, I will  be introducing a Senate resolution to recognize the Capitol custodial  staff for their bravery and their service to our country on January 6.  I hope my colleagues will join me--all of them--not as Republicans or  Democrats but as Members of this body, as Americans all.   This Capitol is the people's House. The insurrectionists ransacked  it. The Capitol custodians picked up the pieces. They deserve our  eternal gratitude. To all the Capitol custodians who come to work in  this building each day to ensure our democracy functions, thank you,  thank you, thank you.
