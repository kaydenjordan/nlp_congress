 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1430, the so-called HONEST Act.  This is the third time the majority has tried to move this misguided  legislation, which was formerly known as the Secret Science Reform Act.   Unfortunately, in this case, the third time is not the charm. The  Secret Science bills that the Republicans tried to enact over the  previous two Congresses were insidious bills designed, from the outset,  to prevent the EPA from using the best available science to meet its  obligations under the law. Those bills were constructed to hamstring  the ability of the EPA to do just about anything to protect the  American public.   As the American Lung Association said at the time: ``The legislation  will not improve EPA's actions; rather, it will stifle public health  protections.''   The HONEST Act, if anything, is even worse than those two previous  bills. There are several reasons for this. Like the prior Secret  Science bills, the HONEST Act requires the EPA to release the  underlying data from any science that is relied upon when taking  action. This would cause a host of cascading problems for the Agency,  which is, of course, the real reason they are pushing this bill.    First, the EPA relies upon science drawn from many sources. Since EPA  does not own or control the data for most of these scientific sources,  the EPA would have no authority to order the public release of such  data. This would preclude the EPA from using the vast majority of peer- reviewed science in existence today.   Second, under the HONEST Act, scientific studies relied upon by the  EPA must be reproducible from the data that is publicly released.  However, the EPA frequently investigates and relies upon scientific  studies that are inherently not reproducible.   For instance, the EPA might study natural or manmade environmental  disasters, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, to better  understand the effects on the environment and to improve disaster  response. Under this bill, the EPA couldn't use this type of  information at all.   These problems with the legislation were apparently not enough for my  Republican colleagues. They have worked hard to make the bill even  worse this Congress. The newest addition to the bill would permit the  EPA to redact from public disclosure confidential information, such as  trade secrets and public health information. However, the bill then  sets up an unrestricted process whereby anyone who signs a  confidentiality agreement can access any restricted information in the  EPA's possession.   This provision is a Pandora's box, which could have untold  consequences for the EPA, industry, and the general public. First, the  EPA will find it much more difficult to collect scientific data in the  first instance if people think it will be disclosed at will. This will  cripple the EPA's ability to conduct their own science, which is  important since the rest of the HONEST Act essentially places all non- EPA science off limits.   This provision is also in direct conflict with any number of other  Federal laws, like the Freedom of Information Act, and HIPAA. The bill  provides no guidance to the Agency on how to navigate the minefield it  creates, which will surely lead to a morass of lawsuits and legal bills  for the EPA.   Finally, this provision places no restrictions on who can access  restricted information. For instance, could a chemical manufacturer  obtain access to the trade secrets of a competitor simply by signing a  confidentiality agreement? Could insurance companies seek the health  information of potential customers?   The potential for abuses with this provision are endless.   In a day and age when the most valuable commodity on the black market  is personal information and trade secrets, it is unconscionable that we  are providing an easily accessible source for criminals around the  world.   Finally, the HONEST Act also foists upon the EPA a massive unfunded  mandate. While we have no CBO cost estimate for this bill, prior  versions were estimated to cost the EPA $250 million per year. However,  the bill restricts the EPA to spending only $1 million to implement its  provisions. In essence, this hits the EPA with a $249 million unfunded  mandate every year.   If that were not bad enough, this bill comes in the face of massive  proposed budget cuts to the EPA's science program by the Trump  administration.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans claim that this bill is just implementing  scientific's best practices. It is odd, then, that a host of scientific  societies and science stakeholder groups have expressed their  opposition to this legislation. This includes the American Association  for the Advancement of Science, the Association of Public and Land- grant Universities, the Association of American Universities; and the  American Chemical Society.   If Republicans don't want to be labeled as flat-Earth science haters,  I think they would want to listen to what scientists say instead of  lecturing them about things they don't understand.   In reality, this bill isn't about science. It is about undermining  public health and the environment. That is why a host of public health  and environmental groups are actively opposing the bill. This includes,  among others, the American Lung Association, the American Thoracic  Society, the American Public Health Association, the Union of Concerned  Scientists, and the Environmental Defense Fund.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record some of the letters I received  in opposition.                                                     March 27, 2017.        Dear Representative: The undersigned health and medical       organizations are writing to express our opposition to the       EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 and the Honest       and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017. Our       organizations are dedicated to saving lives and improving       public health.        Science is the bedrock of sound medical and public health       decision-making. The best science undergirds everything our       organizations do to improve health. Under the Clean Air Act,       EPA has long implemented a transparent and open process for       seeking advice from the medical and scientific community on       standards and measures to meet those standards. Both of these       bills would restrict the input of scientific experts in the       review of complex issues and add undue industry influence       into EPA's decision-making process.        As written, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would       make unneeded and unproductive changes that would:        Restrict the ability of scientists to speak on issues that       include their own expertise;        Block scientists who receive any EPA grants from serving on       the EPA Scientific Advisory Board, despite their having the       expertise and conducted relevant research that earned them       these highly competitive grants;        Prevent the EPA Scientific Advisory Board from making       policy recommendations, even though EPA administrators have       regularly sought their advice in the past;        Add a notice and comment component to all parts of the EPA       Scientific Advisory Board actions, a burdensome and       unnecessary requirement since their reviews of major issues       already include public notice and comment; and        Reallocate membership requirements to increase the       influence of industry representatives on the scientific       advisory panels.        In short, EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would limit       the voice of scientists, restrict the ability of the Board to       respond to important questions, and increase the influence of       industry in shaping EPA policy. This is not in the best       interest of the American public.        We also have concerns with the HONEST Act. This legislation       would limit the kinds of scientific data EPA can use as it       develops policy to protect the American public from  [[Page H2538]]       environmental exposures and permit violation of patient       confidentiality. If enacted, the legislation would:        Allow the EPA administrator to release confidential patient       information to third parties, including industry;        Bolster industry's flawed arguments to discredit research       that documents the adverse health effects of environmental       pollution; and        Impose new standards for the publication and distribution       of scientific research that go beyond the robust, existing       requirements of many scientific journals.        Science, developed by the respected men and women       scientists at colleges and universities across the United       States, has always been the foundation of the nation's       environmental policy. EPA's science-based decision-making       process has saved lives and led to dramatic improvements in       the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the       earth we share. All Americans have benefited from the       research-based scientific advice that scientists have       provided to EPA.        Congress should adopt policy that fortifies our scientists,       not bills that undermine the scientific integrity of EPA's       decision-making or give polluters a disproportionate voice in       EPA's policy-setting process.        We strongly urge you to oppose these bills.            Sincerely,      Katie Huffling, RN, CNM,        Director, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.      Harold P.

Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Majority Whip,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative McCarthy: As leading U.S. science,       engineering, and academic institutions, we are writing to       express our concerns regarding H.R. 1430, the Honest and Open       New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of 2017. We encourage       you and your colleagues to take additional time to evaluate       the unintended consequences of this bill before considering       it on the House floor. This bill is virtually identical to       the Secret Science Reform Act of the 113th and 114th       Congress, on which we expressed similar concerns that have       remained unchanged.        Of course, regulations and agency actions should be       informed by the best available science and a rigorous       scientific process. Undermining the integrity of the       scientific process, or the ability of federal agencies to       utilize rigorous science in establishing policies, could have       long-term negative consequences. It is with this in mind that       we urge caution in setting laws that submerge science beneath       politics.        The research community is concerned that some key terms in       the bill could be interpreted or misinterpreted, especially       terms such as ``materials,'' ``data,'' and ``reproducible.''       Legislation removing concepts like reproducibility and       independent analysis from the hands of scientists and into       the hands of legislators could undermine the scientific       process and reduce the benefits that science could bring to       society.        With respect to reproducibility of research, it is often       impossible to repeat an experiment down to the last detail.       Some scientific research, especially in areas of public       health, involve longitudinal studies that are so large and of       great duration that they could not realistically be repeated.       Rather, these studies are verified utilizing statistical       modeling or independent data analysis. The same may be true       for scientific data from a one-time event (e.g., Deepwater       Horizon Gulf oil spill) where the data are gathered in real       time. It is unclear if data from studies like these would be       permitted under this bill. As a result, we could foresee a       situation where the EPA would be prevented from using the       best available science and disseminating public information       in a timely fashion.        In addition, H.R. 1430 would give the EPA administrator       sole authority to disclose private information gathered in       research studies, which might include confidential health and       proprietary business information, to anyone who signs a       confidentiality agreement with the EPA. It is unclear whether       the EPA has this authority, and very clear this would deter       individuals and businesses from participating in studies used       by the EPA. This would again constrain the EPA from making a       proposal based on the best available science.        We thank you for your consideration and stand ready to work       with you to evaluate the unintended consequences of this bill       before consideration on the House floor.

Mr. Speaker, for the many reasons  I have spoken about today, I strongly oppose this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), the vice ranking member of the  full committee and ranking member of the Science, Space, and  Technology's Subcommittee on Oversight.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, since the time that  President Nixon signed into law authorizing the EPA, it appears to me  that there has been no evidence that they have done anything other than  attempt to protect the lives of the American people. I don't believe  that this legislation is going to do anything to further that.   It will give them a lot of unfunded mandates, far more than what they  would ever be funded to carry out. I would ask everyone to respect the  Agency and vote ``no'' on the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded  vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
