 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and Mr. Valadao for  their strong leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 299, the Blue Water Navy  Vietnam Veterans Act.   Our Nation's warfighters are told they will receive benefits and  coverage through the VA because of their service, but reality shows  this has not always been the case, as with Agent Orange. This  legislation would correct the issue by providing rightly earned  benefits to men and women who were exposed to the herbicide Agent  Orange during their time of service.   Also included in the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act is language  from my bipartisan bill, H.R. 4843, that provides coverage for children  with spina bifida due to a parent's exposure to Agent Orange.   I thank Bill Rhodes, a veteran in my district, who has advocated  tirelessly for his fellow veterans. I think it is pretty cut and dry:  if you served America through the Armed Forces and were exposed to  Agent Orange, our grateful country should cover the medical expenses.   Our veterans make great sacrifice, and they deserve the best benefits  and care possible. The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act is a great  step toward providing these benefits, and I commend Chairman Roe and  the Veterans' Affairs Committee for their work to make this legislation  a reality for our veterans.
