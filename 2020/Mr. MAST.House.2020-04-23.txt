 Madam Speaker, we are a body of 435 representatives. That  is true. There is only one that can demand that that gavel go up and  down.   And I have a very simple question for this body: Can anybody, will  anybody, in this body stand and say that the Speaker has demanded that  we act here with the urgency that our people require, with the urgency  that this body is capable of?   You believe this body has acted with the urgency we are capable of,  that our people require?   I think it is sad that there are people that believe that we have  acted in urgency. There has been no haste by this body.   It will be said of this time that those who could do the most did the  least.
