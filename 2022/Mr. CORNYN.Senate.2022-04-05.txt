 Mr. President, later this week, perhaps in a day or two,  the Senate will vote on the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson  to serve as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.   Last week, I laid out my reasons for my opposition to this  nomination, and yesterday, I voted against her nomination in the  Judiciary Committee. But I want to make clear that my vote against  Judge Jackson is not a rebuke of her legal knowledge, her experience,  or her character. Judge Jackson is obviously very smart. She has vast  practical experience, which I think is very useful. She is likeable.  And she is very clearly passionate about her work.   The Senate's constitutional duty to provide advice and consent,  though, requires us to look beyond Judge Jackson's resume and  personality to understand her judicial philosophy and the lens through  which she views her role as a judge.   Certainly, the Senate must evaluate whether Judge Jackson will act  fairly and impartially. We have also got to make a judgment whether she  will leave her personal beliefs and her policy preferences at the door  and whether she will respect the bounds of her role as a judge or  attempt to establish new judge-made law.   This last point is absolutely critical, in my view. The Founders  wisely established a system of checks and balances to ensure that no  person or institution wields absolute power. The legislative branch, of  course, makes law; the executive branch enforces the law; and the  judicial branch interprets the law. We have each got our  responsibilities under the Constitution.  [[Page S1953]]    And while that is certainly a simplification of the duties of each of  the three branches, it does illustrate that there are separate lanes or  roles for each branch in our constitutional Republic. And we talked  about that during Judge Jackson's confirmation hearing.   The judge said she understands the importance of staying in her lane.  She used that phrase many times during the confirmation hearing. She  said she would not try to do Congress's job making laws.   But over the years--and I think this is a blind spot for Judge  Jackson and, frankly, many on the bench, particularly at the highest  levels. Over the years, we have come to see a pattern of judges who  embrace the concept of judge-made law.   In other words, it is not derived from a statute passed by the  Congress, it is not derived from the text of the Constitution itself,  but rather, it is made as a policy judgment without any explicit  reference in the Constitution itself. Now, that, I believe, is judicial  policymaking or legislating from the bench.   The Supreme Court over the years has developed various legal  doctrines like substantive due process. That is a little more opaque, I  would think, to most people than judge-made law, but basically, it is  the same thing. It is a doctrine under which judges create new rights  that are not laid out in the Constitution.   It shouldn't matter if a person ultimately agrees or disagrees with  this new right. If you like the result, well, you are liable to  overlook the process by which the judges reached a decision. But if you  disagree with it, then, clearly, it is a problem to have judges-- unelected, unaccountable to the voters--making policy from the bench,  no matter what it is called.   It is deeply concerning, I think--and it should be--to all Americans,  to have nine unelected and ultimately unaccountable judges make  policies that affect 330-or-so million people and they can have no say- so about it at all. They can't vote for them; they can't vote them out  of office; they can't hold them accountable. In fact, the whole purpose  of judicial independence is so judges can make hard decisions, but they  have to be tethered to the Constitution and the law, not made up out of  whole cloth.   No judge is authorized under our form of government to rewrite the  Constitution to their liking or impose a policy for the entire country  simply because it aligns with their personal belief or their policy  preferences.   As our Founders wrote in the Declaration of Independence:         Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just       powers from the consent of the governed.    When judges find unenumerated and invisible rights in the  Constitution and issue a judgment holding that, in essence, all State  and Federal laws that contradict with their new judge-made law is  invalid and unconstitutional, there is no opportunity for anybody to  consent to that outcome like you would if you were a Member of the  Senate or a Member of the House. People could lobby us. They could call  us on the phone. They could send us emails, use social media to try to  influence our decision. They could recruit somebody to run against us  in the next election. They could vote us out of office if they didn't  like the outcome.   But none of that would apply to life-tenured, unaccountable Federal  judges making judge-made law at the highest levels--no consent of the  governed, no legitimacy which comes from consent.   Abraham Lincoln made clear that it is the concept of consent that is  the foundation for our form of government. He said famously: No man is  good enough to govern another man without that man's consent.   Of course, he used that in the context of slavery, and he was right;  but it has broader application as well.   As I said, when it comes to the executive and legislative branches,  it is easy to see how consent and the legitimacy that flows from that  comes into play. Voters cast their ballot for Senators, for Members of  the House, for the President.   Once a person is in office, voters conduct what you could describe as  a performance evaluation. The next time that person is on the ballot,  voters determine whether that person should remain in office or be  replaced by someone new.    But, again, that is not true of the judicial branch, which highlights  and demonstrates why the judicial branch is different, why it shouldn't  be a policy maker, why judges shouldn't be pronouncing judge-made law  that is not contained in the Constitution itself.   It is important that our courts remain independent and be able to  make those hard calls, but even people like Justice Breyer, who Judge  Jackson will succeed on the Supreme Court, has written books worried  about the politicization of the judiciary, and I think that is one  reason why our judicial confirmation hearings can get so contentious-- witness Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, which was a low point,  I believe, for the Senate Judiciary Committee and for the Senate as a  whole.   But people wouldn't get so exercised over these nominations if people  were simply calling balls and strikes like the umpire at a baseball  game. Judges should be umpires; judges should not be players.   So Justices on the Supreme Court are not held accountable at the  ballot box, and they aren't evaluated every few years for their job  performance. They are nominated by the President and confirmed for a  lifetime appointment.   When Justices engage in blatant policymaking, it takes away the power  of ``we the people'' to decide for ourselves and hold our government  accountable. It speaks to that statement in the Declaration of  Independence that says government derives its just powers from the  consent of the governed. But that is totally missing when it comes to  judge-made law and identifying new rights that are nowhere mentioned in  the Constitution.   Again, I understand, when you like the outcome as a policy matter,  you are not liable to complain too much. But we should recognize this  over the course of our history as a source of abuse by judges at  different times in our history, and we have seen the horrible outcomes  of things like Plessy vs. Ferguson, where the Supreme Court, without  reference to the Constitution itself, using this doctrine of  substantive due process, said that ``separate but equal'' was the  answer for the conflict between the rights of African-American  schoolchildren and the rest of the population. They said it is OK. You  can satisfy the Constitution if you give them separate but equal  educations.   Well, of course, that is a shameful outcome, and we would all join  together in repudiating that kind of outcome. And, thankfully, years  later--too many years later--Brown v. Board of Education established  that the ``separate but equal'' doctrine was overruled, and that is as  it should be.   But the point I am trying to make here is whether it is the Court's  decisions on abortion or the right to marry a same-sex partner or  separate but equal, or even things like the Dred Scott decision, which  held that African-American fugitive slaves were chattel property, or in  the famous Lochner case, where the New Deal Justices struck down an  attempt by the government to regulate the working hours of bakers in  New York.   All of these involved the use of this substantive due process  doctrine as a way to cover up and hide the fact that it was judges  making the law and not the policymakers who run for office.   I am also afraid that Judge Jackson did not always adhere to her own  admonition that judges should stay in their lane. In the case Make the  Road New York v. McAleenan, the American Civil Liberties Union  challenged a regulation involving expedited removal of individuals who  illegally cross our borders and enter into the country.   The Immigration and Nationality Act gives the Department of Homeland  Security Secretary ``sole and unreviewable discretion'' to apply  expedited removal proceedings. Judge Jackson, who presided over the  case challenging that rule, ignored the law. She went beyond the  unambiguous text to deliver a political win to the people who brought  the lawsuit.  [[Page S1954]]    She barred the Department of Homeland Security from using expedited  removal proceedings to deter illegal immigration. She stopped the  administration from enacting immigration policies it had clear  authority to implement according to the black-letter law.  Unsurprisingly, that decision was appealed and ultimately overturned by  the DC Court of Appeals. But this is an example of not staying in your  lane and not deferring to Congress the authority to make the laws of  the land when the Congress has been unambiguously clear.   So, ultimately, I believe that demonstrates a willingness to engage  in judicial activism and achieve a result, notwithstanding the facts  and the black-letter law in the case, and to disregard the law in favor  of a political win for one of the parties.   But this is just exactly what I started off talking about. This is  the opposite of consent of the governed, when judges ignore the laws  passed by Congress, even when congressional intent is clear.   Unfortunately, that wasn't the only example of activism in Judge  Jackson's decisions. We have heard a lot about this, and I think it was  an entirely appropriate subject for questions and answers. Judge  Jackson is an accomplished and seasoned lawyer and judge, and she knows  how to answer hard questions.   During sentencing hearings, Judge Jackson has said she disagreed with  certain sentencing enhancements for policy reasons. That is the word  she used--for policy reasons--and she chose to disregard its  application. That is not staying in your lane.   She also used a compassionate release motion to retroactively slash a  dangerous drug dealer's criminal sentence because she didn't like that  the government brought a mandatory minimum drug charge, even though the  government had every right to do so under the applicable law.   The promise of equal justice under the law requires judges to follow  the law regardless of their own personal feelings about the policy.  Justice Scalia famously said that if a judge hasn't at one time or  another in his or her career rendered a judgment that conflicts with  their own personal preferences, then they are probably not doing their  job right.   It is absolutely critical for our Supreme Court Justice to not only  acknowledge but to respect the limited but important role that our  judges play in our constitutional Republic. They shouldn't allow  politics or policy preferences to impact their decisions from the  Bench, and they can't use their power to invalidate the will of the  American people based on invisible rights that aren't actually included  in the Constitution itself.   In 1953, Judge Robert Jackson observed that the Supreme Court is  ``not final because [it is] infallible, but [it is] infallible only  because [it is] final.''   In other words, the recourse that we the people have when judges  overstep their bounds when it comes to constitutional interpretation is  to amend the Constitution itself--something that has only happened 27  times in our Nation's history--and it is a steep hill to climb, to be  sure.   But it is important for the legitimacy of the Supreme Court itself  for the judges to be seen as staying in their lane and interpreting the  law, not making it up as they go along. I am reminded of another quote  about the scope of the Judiciary's duties and powers. In 1820, Thomas  Jefferson wrote, ``To consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of  all constitutional questions [is] a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and  one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy.''   Once again, our Founders, our Founding Fathers, had the wisdom to  establish three branches of government to share power to avoid any  single person or institution from wielding absolute power, and to  ensure that we maintain the proper balance of power, Justices need to  stay in their lane and interpret the law, not make the law,  particularly when the voters have denied consent from them for doing  so.   So to summarize, to ensure that we maintain the proper balance of  power under our Constitution, judges must only interpret the law and  they can't allow activism to bleed into their decisions and they can't  ignore black-letter law and they can't use doctrines like substantive  due process to hide the fact that they are making up new rights that  aren't contained anywhere in the written Constitution itself.   As I said before, I fear that, if confirmed, Judge Jackson will  attempt to use her vast legal skills to deliver specific results and  get outside of her lane by making judge-made laws that are not  supported by the text of the Constitution itself. As I said in the  Judiciary Committee, and I will say again, when the time comes to vote  on Judge Jackson's nomination here on the Senate floor, I will once  again vote no for the reasons I just stated.
