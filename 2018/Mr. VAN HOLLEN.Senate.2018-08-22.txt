 Mr. President, I wish to speak in order to honor the  achievements of Steven A. Hildreth, Specialist in Missile Defense,  Congressional Research Service, CRS, on the  [[Page S5829]]  occasion of his retirement from the Service on August 31, 2018.   Steve Hildreth served Congress with distinction for more than 32  years at the Library of Congress as a Specialist in U.S. and Foreign  National Security Programs for the Congressional Research Service. He  earned a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University in Provo, UT,  a master's degree in international relations from Georgetown University  in Washington, DC, graduate work at Johns Hopkins University School of  Advanced International Studies in Washington, DC, and a master's degree  in national security strategy from the National War College in  Washington, DC.   Steve is recognized throughout Congress, the military services, the  defense community, and the arms control community as an expert in U.S.  nuclear weapons and ballistic missile defense, arms control, military  space, and nonproliferation issues. He wrote extensively on missile  defense programs, from the Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s  through the current guided-missile defense and Aegis programs. He also  assisted the House Armed Services Committee, after the first gulf war,  with assessments of the effectiveness of the Patriot system in taking  down Iraqi scud missiles. In that capacity, he assisted Congress in 8  hours of testimony, leading a group of CRS researchers in providing  open source analysis of the international aftermath of the September  11, 2001, terror attacks before the 9/11 Commission. Halfway through,  the staff director for the Commission told Steve, ``I never believed in  open source analysis until today.''   Steve also exercised true leadership at CRS. For 9 years, he led the  Central Research Unit in the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade  Division of CRS, where he created and managed an extensive internship  program and oversaw many of the research experts of the Service.   Steve published many influential CRS reports on such subjects as  challenges to the United States in space, Iran's ballistic missile and  space launch programs, long-range ballistic missile defense in Europe,  ballistic missile defense in the Asia-Pacific region, ballistic missile  defense, and offensive arms reductions, cyber warfare, and the  Strategic Defense Initiative.   Long before I thought of running for office, I worked on national  security issues for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In that  capacity, I always found Steve's expertise valuable. As a Senator, I  have continued to utilize Steve's analysis and insights. I am grateful  for his service and wish him the best as he begins a new journey.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and thank  Donald Shriber for his more than 30 years of public service. In  addition to being an outstanding public servant who has dedicated his  career to government service, Donald is also a proud Marylander. At the  end of the month, Donald will retire from the Federal Government after  a distinguished career at the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention and in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.   Donald began his career with the CDC as the head of the agency's  Washington, DC, office and went on to lead policy and communications  for CDC's important work in global health. Donald leaves a legacy of  deep engagement in public health policy and a cadre of colleagues  mentored to think creatively to solve complex public health challenges.  Before starting at the CDC, Donald began his policy career on Capitol  Hill, working in the House and Senate on healthcare and public health- related legislation. He served as a senior adviser to the legendary  John Dingell, writing laws that continue to have a major impact on  public health and healthcare today.   During his tenure at CDC, Donald was awarded two prestigious  Presidential Rank Awards for his leadership. A steady hand during a  public health emergency, Donald helped advise four CDC Directors, three  Acting Directors, and countless administration officials over three  administrations through complex policy discussions during some of the  biggest public health challenges of the 21st century, including 9/11,  the anthrax attacks of 2001, SARS, Hurricane Katrina, the H1N1 flu  pandemic, and the Ebola epidemic.   Among his many contributions to the agency, the one most appreciated  by many of his colleagues has been his thoughtful mentorship to the  next generation of CDC leaders. Always a voice of wisdom, Donald is a  reliable source of thoughtful strategic advice and novel approaches to  public health policy. He challenged the agency to think about how  policies in all areas of government can affect public health, and he  made the agency stronger by working to leverage those areas across  government to improve public health.   Today, I want to recognize Donald for his career at the CDC, his  dedication to public service, and a lifetime of work that has truly  made a difference to the health of our Nation and around the world. On  behalf of the U.S. Congress, his fellow Marylanders, and a grateful  nation, I want to thank Donald for the important work he has done and  wish him the very best in his next phase of life.                            ____________________
