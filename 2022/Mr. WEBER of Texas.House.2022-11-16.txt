 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of  Jefferson County Sheriff's Officer Deputy James Lee, who tragically  passed away on July 9, leaving behind a legacy of service to Jefferson  County.   Deputy Lee was a marine who started with the Jefferson County  Sheriff's Office in 1973 and was 71 years old when he passed away.   He was known as someone who enjoyed going to work to protect his  community, who was tough but always showed compassion.   He leaves behind a wife and son, who will follow in his father's  footsteps at the sheriff's office. Though he may be gone, I know that  Deputy Lee is still watching over his beloved community and family.   Please join me in recognizing the extraordinary life and service of  Deputy James Lee.                            Honoring Pat Hallisey     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the retirement  of a local leader and dedicated public servant who I am proud to call a  friend, the  [[Page H8514]]  outgoing mayor of League City, Texas, the Honorable Pat Hallisey.    Throughout his 6 years as mayor, Pat's dedication to League City was  clear. He maintained a community with high standards of safety, health,  and prosperity. He left League City better than he found it.   As mayor, Pat led the city through recovery efforts stemming from the  damage caused by Hurricane Harvey. And I am proud to have worked with  him over the years to revitalize Galveston County's largest city.   On behalf of a grateful community, it is my privilege to honor Mayor  Pat Hallisey and his beautiful wife, Janice. Along with her and his  family, friends, and colleagues, I want to extend absolute best wishes  to Mayor Pat Hallisey in his retirement.                          Honoring Judge Mike Nelson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of  the Honorable Michael Nelson, or as his friends and family call him,  Mike. He has dedicated his life to serving the people of Galveston  County.   Judge Mike was born on June 17, 1949, in Gould, Arkansas. At 18, he  enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, served three tours in  Vietnam, and retired from service in 1976. He is married to the former  Carol Rotenberry of Santa Fe, Texas, where they raised their four  daughters: Sarah Jane, Peyton, Heather, and Michaelia; and four sons:  Doug, Michael John, Michael Jr., and Curtis.   Mr. Nelson served as a justice of the peace and a municipal court  judge since 1986 in Galveston County.   A true testament to his character, in 2017, he was awarded the Man of  the Year from the Chamber of Commerce of Hitchcock.   Mike is a man of purpose, honor, and unwavering determination for the  betterment of our community. He has left a positive impact on that very  same community.   Judge Mike is a beloved member of his community and a fearless  advocate for his constituents, whom he cares for deeply. He always had  an open-door policy for any constituent who wished to meet with him.  His accomplished record and willingness to serve are evident in his  over 35 years of public service.   On behalf of Texas' 14th Congressional District, Mr. Speaker, I am  honored to recognize his exceptional leadership and his example as a  true public servant.   I thank Mike for being an incredible leader. He will be remembered  for generations to come. He is a man of his word, he is intelligent, he  is disciplined, and he treats people with respect. It is an absolute  honor to know him.                      Celebrating the Life of Bill Neild     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life  of Bill Neild or, as described by a lifelong friend, the John Wayne of  Beaumont, Texas. He passed away at age 85 on August 24, 2022, leaving  behind a community of friends and family and a legacy of hard work,  sacrifice, and service.   Bill was an extraordinary community leader and had a true servant's  heart. He served 4 years as the mayor of Beaumont. He was chairman of  the board of the Beaumont Chamber of Commerce. He was a member of the  Board of Directors of First City Bank, and he served as chairman for  many organizations in the city.   He was a man of integrity, and his passion and service to the  community was felt, and will continue to be felt, far and wide.   I take this time to honor the life of service exemplified by Mayor  Neild. I thank him and his family for their dedication to our fellow  citizens on behalf of a very, very grateful 14th District of Texas.                            ____________________
