 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  ranking member for his extraordinary leadership and for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4712.   In the past year, the usual Republican stream of anti-woman, anti- choice policies has turned into a flood.   Today's vile bill is based on myths and lies and is designed to  intimidate doctors from providing abortions.   I would like to remind my colleagues that for 45 years, the Supreme  Court has upheld a woman's constitutional right to access a legal  abortion, and that current law already protects infants, as well it  should.   But Republicans would rather play politics with women's lives than  rely on science and the law.   This bill seeks to criminalize legal medical services and put  extreme, anti-choice ideology between a woman and her doctor.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, in what other  circumstance would we ever tolerate denying, delaying, or interfering  with legitimate and legal medical care?   This must stop.   Protect women from this political charade. Allow doctors to take care  of their patients.   Please vote ``no'' on this unfair, vile bill.
