 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Smith for including my  amendment en bloc and for allowing me to speak on it today.   Mr. Chairman, among the amendments under consideration in this en  bloc measure is one that I have authored to address various challenges  to the Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve sexual assault prevention  and response programs.   While sexual assault among our Active Duty forces has been a frequent  topic of discussion, I rise today to draw attention to the same issue  that remains just as prevalent within our Reserve component forces.   More than half a million members currently serve in the Army Guard  and Reserve. Hundreds of incidents of sexual assault are reported each  year, and it is estimated that several hundred more go unreported.   The Reserve components of the Army continue to suffer from staffing  imbalances, poor budget management, and slow investigations that delay  access to care for hundreds of sexual assault victims. My amendment  directs the Department of Defense to take steps to address these  issues.   Sexual violence is a criminal behavior, and it has no place in our  military.   We must regain the trust of the servicemembers, who have been brave  enough to come forward to report those crimes, by bettering our  military justice system.   Congress has a responsibility to protect the servicemembers who make  immeasurable sacrifices to serve and protect our country. We must  foster a system that encourages servicemembers to seek help and care,  and that protects the very people who keep our Nation safe.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment.
