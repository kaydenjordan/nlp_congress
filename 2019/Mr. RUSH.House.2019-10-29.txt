 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address two critical bills  that would mandate studies to examine, one, whether tasers are a safer  alternative to firearms and, two, how innovative technology can enhance  the safety of firearms.   My bill, H.R. 4740, the TASER Access, Safety, and Effectiveness  Review Study Act, or TASERS Act, will direct the Consumer Product  Safety Commission to coordinate a multiagency study comparing the  effectiveness and the safety of firearms and of tasers. By studying  tasers, Mr. Speaker, we can determine whether they can be a safe,  effective, and, most importantly, nonlethal weapon of self-defense.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4784 would direct the National Institute of Justice  to update its 2013 study on gun safety technologies. The 2013 NIJ study  noted that several innovative gun-locking technologies were close to  coming onto the market in our Nation.   Newer gun-locking or smart-gun technologies require fingerprints or  other advanced mechanisms to unlock the firearms. Unfortunately, Mr.  Speaker, vehement protests and inaccurate information about drastic  cost increases from the gun lobby have prevented this technology from  becoming widely available.   Mr. Speaker, smart-gun technology has the potential to stop firearms  from being used by those who shouldn't possess them. A 2019 Department  of Justice survey found that 56 percent of prisoners who possessed a  firearm during their offense obtained it through illicit channels.  Additionally, Mr. Speaker, a study in the American Journal of Public  Health concluded that over 1,500 stolen guns were recovered in  connection with violent crimes between 2010 and 2016.   Updating the Department of Justice's 2013 study would be a critical  step forward into determining how smart-gun technology can be  incorporated into the multifaceted approach needed to reduce gun  violence.   Congress must always seek to harness the power of innovation and  innovative technology to make Americans safer. The studies these bills  would mandate are a critical first step in evaluating how we can use  technology and innovation to prevent gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor both of these measures and  encourage  [[Page H8548]]  my colleagues to join me in supporting them.                            ____________________
