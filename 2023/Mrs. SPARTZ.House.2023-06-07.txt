 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our heroes who risk  their lives for our freedoms and those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.   I share with you and the American people a memorial service note that  my friend Lieutenant Colonel in Special Operations David Strysko wrote  for his fallen brother, Master Sergeant Benjamin Franklin Bitner, who  was killed in action in Afghanistan in April of 2011:         What does it mean to honor the fallen? In a word: Rise.        Rise to the occasion:        It is easy for us to conflate remembrance with honor,       because we all want to honor the ultimate sacrifices made by       our brothers, and the easiest way to do that is by       remembering them. Undoubtedly, the greatest travesty of a       free nation is when it forgets the sacrifices that keep them       free. But remembering is only the passive aspect of honor. It       is only when our suitable actions accompany our remembrances       that we truly honor their sacrifice.        But what actions truly honor? Laying wreaths, rendering       salutes, and pausing for moments of silence are all       commendable, but they fall short of true honor when       compared to the immense gravity of the ultimate sacrifice       they recognize.        The actions that speak true honor are those that pick up       where the sacrifice of our fallen brothers left off. And it       is often a rare and fleeting occasion that we get an       opportunity to honor our fallen through our own deliberate       actions.        It is to these occasions that we rise to honor.        When faced with difficult decisions, withering opposition,       physical and psychological peril, certain defeat, reprisal,       hopelessness, chaos, and terror, we rise to honor the fallen.        When the occasion calls for sacrifice, we rise to honor the       fallen.        Sacrifice can only be truly honored by sacrifice. Courage       can only be truly honored by courage.        When it is our turn to honor those who have mortally proven       their resolve, we must rise with courage to sacrifice.        It is in these moments, where courage and resolve are       tested, that we can with conviction rise to honor the fallen.        And in doing so, we will stand as living testaments to       those sacred words: `` . . . that these dead shall not have       died in vain.''        Today, we remember Benjamin Franklin Bitner, but only our       actions will honor him.    May God bless our heroes and our great Republic.                            ____________________
