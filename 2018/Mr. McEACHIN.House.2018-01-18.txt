 Mr. Speaker, my Advancing Seniors and Kids Act would  permanently reauthorize CHIP, fund community health centers, prevent  damaging cuts to our safety net hospitals, and make other changes that  protect the health of children, seniors, and our most vulnerable  friends and neighbors.   For months, Congress has failed to act on these issues, and the  result has been completely avoidable pain and suffering. Right now,  Americans wake up every day and worry: How much longer will my child,  my family members have healthcare?   Mr. Speaker, we can take that fear away right now. Extending CHIP and  funding community health centers, these are commonsense policies with  bipartisan support. We should have passed clean extensions a long time  ago, but we can make amends right now.   We know that healthcare coverage saves lives. We know that CHIP  covers almost 9 million children. It is critically important that we do  the right thing. If we let CHIP lapse, if we do not protect hospitals  and community centers, there will be horrible consequences for families  across this country.   Today more Americans have coverage than ever before. Medical  bankruptcies are a lot less common than they were in the past. We are  making progress.   I am urging my colleagues to build on that progress and not to  abandon it.  [[Page H500]]  A solution is right here in front of us. I urge all of my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on the previous question and join me in supporting quality  and affordable healthcare for all Americans.
