 Madam President, I speak in loving memory of  Barney Gottstein, a patriarch of Alaska's Jewish community, who passed  away on October 21 at the age of 91. He was buried in the Anchorage  Cemetery on October 22, in accordance with Jewish burial traditions.   I suspect that my colleagues might not be aware that Alaska is home  to a thriving Jewish community or that the origins of that community  preceded statehood by generations. One might be even more surprised to  know that Barney was not the first generation of Gottsteins to occupy a  leadership role in prestatehood Alaska, but the second generation. The  Gottstein family is up to four generations of leadership, with a  fifth--the great-grandchildren--now in place.   The first generation, Barney's father, Jacob B. Gottstein, originally  of Des Moines, IA, came to Anchorage in 1915, selling cigars and  confections out of the tent city established to construct the Alaska  railroad. Jake, as he was known, then opened a wholesale grocery and  dry goods business, known as J.B. Gottstein & Co., which made sales  calls by dog sled. You can't get more Alaskan than that. Jake passed  away in 1963.   Barney was born in Des Moines in 1925, but soon moved to Anchorage,  population 2,500, where he was raised. He enlisted in the Army and  served in the Army Air Corps. After the war, Barney went to the  University of Washington, studying to be an aeronautical engineer. That  didn't work out so well. He was told by a counselor  [[Page S217]]  that anti-Semitism would likely prevent Barney from getting a job in  his chosen field, so he switched to business and economics and came  home to work in the family business, but he didn't abandon his love for  flying. Barney was a licensed private pilot who loved to fly around  Alaska and beyond.   By the time Barney returned home, the family business was growing as  fast as the State. The focus had changed from dry goods to wholesale  groceries. Barney took it the next step. One of J.B. Gottstein's  customers was the Carr Brothers Grocery. The rest is history.   Barney partnered with Larry Carr to grow the retail grocery business  and pursue real estate ventures. Carr's Quality Centers sprung up  throughout Alaska, along with an associated chain of Eagle markets. By  the late 1980s, the Carr-Gottstein group of companies was the largest  Alaska-owned business in the State. Barney and Larry sold the grocery  side of the business in 1990 but remained in the real estate business.  Today the Carr's name remains on grocery stores in Anchorage, Eagle  River, and the Mat-Su Valley.   In 1989, Barney was inducted into the Alaska Business Hall of Fame,  and in 1991, he was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree by the  University of Alaska Fairbanks.   Barney's business success in Alaska was deeply respected, but his  community engagement even more so. He was chair of the Alaska Board of  Education and provided financial assistance that enabled hundreds of  Alaska Natives to pursue schooling. He was an inaugural member of the  Alaska State Commission on Human Rights as well.   Barney was active in Alaska's political life as well. He was chairman  of the Alaska Democratic Party, Alaska's Democratic National  Committeeman, and an Alaska delegate to the Democratic National  Conventions.   I mentioned that Barney was one of the patriarchs of Alaska's Jewish  community. An early supporter of the State of Israel, he was the face  of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, in Alaska for  many years. Today, Barney's son David leads the AIPAC group in Alaska  and, in that capacity, is a frequent visitor to my office. He provided  financial support to enable young Jewish Alaskans to participate in the  ``March of the Living,'' so that they might better understand the  legacy of the Holocaust. He visited Israel on many occasions and took  on the cause of supporting Ethiopian Jews who had made Aliyah to Israel  integrate into society and pursue advanced degrees.   Barney was not only a father figure to the Alaska Jewish community.  He was the patriarch of a large family himself. Barney is survived by  Rachel, his second wife, of 32 years, who not surprisingly he met on a  trip to Israel. Barney was father to seven children. Some of Barney's  children have followed in their father's footsteps to achieve positions  of great respect and prominence in Alaska. I am proud to count David,  Jim, Robert, and Sandy among my friends. A fourth generation of the  Gottstein family, the grandchildren, are just beginning to make their  mark, and there are great-grandchildren behind them.   On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I proudly pay my respects to  Barney Gottstein and his wonderful family. May his memory be a  blessing.                            ____________________
