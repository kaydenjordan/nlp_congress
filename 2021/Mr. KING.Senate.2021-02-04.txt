 Mr. President, this is a looming financial crisis that  everyone in this room knows is happening, and it is one that we can  prevent, but every day we delay it gets harder.   This is a very reasonable approach, putting a bipartisan group  together to bring us solutions.   I urge my colleagues to support this and hope we can pass this  amendment by voice vote.
