 Madam President, I rise to talk about a moral obligation  and a national security obligation.   We are leaving Afghanistan after 20 years, the longest war in the  country's history. During the entirety of that 20 years, there were  brave people in Afghanistan--Afghanistan people--who helped us, who  were translators, who were guides, who assisted us in the struggle  against terrorism and in the struggle against the Taliban.   And as we leave, those people are in grave danger. The Taliban has  made no secret of the fact that they are in grave danger. They have  already started killing them.   If we leave without providing for the safety of those people,  providing them a way to maintain their lives, it will be a stain on  this country that will exist for generations.   Not only is it a moral and ethical obligation, though, it is a  national security obligation because if we don't take care of the  people who took care of us, who is going to come to our aid the next  time? Who is going to come to the aid of the Americans who turn their  backs on those that risk their lives on behalf of this country? The  answer is no one.   So this is not only an ethical and moral obligation, this is a matter  of national security in terms of our standing in the world and our  ability to work with allies and others against adversaries of this  country and other countries in the world.   The average time, I am told, it now takes to process the paperwork  for one of the people whom we are trying to get out of Afghanistan  through the special visa program is 600 days. We are going to have a  military presence in Afghanistan less than 90 days. There is a mismatch  there.   We have got to take steps to protect these people. Now, maybe its  surging--we have talked about military surges; let's surge some  paperwork people to get this work done faster. But I don't believe we  are going to be able to do that.   Now, by the way, I am not saying we open the door to everyone--there  are 18,000 people on their list; that is not to mention their  families--that we just open the door and say everybody come here  because, as we know, Afghanistan has been the home to very dangerous  terrorist groups, al-Qaida, ISIS, and others.   So we do have to have some processing, but we have to be able to  process these people in a way that protects  [[Page S4756]]  us in terms of our national security but also gets them out of harm's  way. One possibility--and I am delighted that just a few hours ago, the  President mentioned that he is going to be working with other countries  to find a safe place to move these people while we are doing the  processing. I think that is exactly what we have to do. We can't just  hope that when we leave in August or September 11, as the deadline the  President has established, that we just hope that the Taliban won't  take over Kabul, that the Taliban won't take over other regions of the  country and start murdering people who helped us.   This isn't a speculative problem. This isn't something we think may  happen. They have told us it is going to happen. And I have learned all  my life, believe people when they tell you what they are going to do,  and this is one of those situations. We know what is coming. If what  ends up coming is a bloodbath, that blood is on our hands.   I have talked about the national security, but I think, more  important, this is a moral and ethical obligation to meet the safety  needs of those people who have helped us. I have friends who have  fought in Afghanistan, and they are agonized about this. They are  agonized about what is going to happen to people that they know, that  they have worked with, and that have put their lives on the line for  America. What is going to happen to those people when we leave?   This is a moment of test for this country. This is a trial for us,  and history is going to judge us as to how we meet this test. This  isn't something--we are not talking about landing a man on the Moon or  some kind of terrible technological challenge; this is just putting  resources in the right place and making the arrangements to take care  of these people. It can be done. It can be done. And if it isn't done,  shame on us.   I know that is a phrase that is often used, but it fits in this case.  If we don't protect those who protected us, shame on us.   On December 1, 1862, Abraham Lincoln came to this Capitol to talk  about the course of the Civil War and what was happening. And he was  trying to move the Congress out of the politics as usual as they dealt  with this extraordinary crisis. His final words echo over the last 100- plus years, and I think they apply exactly today. Here is what Abraham  Lincoln said:         Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this       Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite       of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance,       can spare one or the other of us. The fiery trial which we       [now] pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the       latest generation.    This is a test of the moral integrity of this country. We must--we  must--defend those who have defended us from a peril that we know is  imminent.   This fiery trial through which we pass this summer, will light us  down--we in the Congress and the administration, as Lincoln said,  ``will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.   I yield the floor.
