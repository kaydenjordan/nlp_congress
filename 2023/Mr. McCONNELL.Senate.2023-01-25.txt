 Mr. President, here on the floor yesterday, I called  on America's European allies, including Germany, to do more to equip  Ukraine with long-requested tanks, not just to resist Russian  aggression but to defeat it.   I have consistently called on the Biden administration to be more  proactive and to lead by example in delivering lethal aid, like the  long-range weapons, with a greater sense of urgency.   I was happy to learn yesterday and this morning that, indeed, both  the White House and their counterparts in Germany are finally moving  forward with these overdue steps.   Germany has announced it will supply Ukraine with an initial 14  Leopard 2 tanks, and the Biden administration is expected to send at  least 30 M1 Abrams tanks as well. Good news.   Now that Berlin has taken this step, I hope and expect that Germany  and other European countries with tanks in their inventory will move  expeditiously to send them to Ukraine.   Modern main battle tanks will provide highly maneuverable armored  firepower that will help Ukraine liberate territory and keep pressure  on the Russian aggressors, but, as I have said repeatedly, time is of  the essence.   Of course, as we rush these long-overdue capabilities to Ukraine, the  West's work is far from over. These drawdowns of Western arsenals must  also prompt serious work to expand the capacity of our defense  industrial base. The Biden administration's efforts on this front are  overdue but important, and I hope more of our allies will follow  through by moving quickly to put critical munitions and weapons systems  under contract and expanding each of their industrial capacities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, here are just a few  scenes from across our country in the last few weeks.   Thirty people were shot in Chicago this past weekend alone. That is  up from 21 the weekend before.   In Philadelphia, police are investigating a carjacking spree that is  reportedly being carried out by armed juveniles:         They put a gun to my head and they took the van. [And] I       haven't found it back again.    Out in San Francisco, just one neighborhood has seen a beating, an  attempted robbery, a 2-year-old suffering fentanyl poisoning after  playing in the park, and 17 car windows smashed--all on one street, all  on one night.   Streets, neighborhoods, and cities across our country are being  swamped--literally, swamped--by a level of crime that is unsafe,  uncivilized, and totally unacceptable.   My hometown of Louisville, KY, saw 10 homicides in just the first 10  days of 2023, and already 5 more since then--the latest additions to  the list of 500-plus homicides we have seen since the start of this  violent crime wave 3 years ago.   As Louisville's mayor said a few weeks ago, ``these are not just  numbers; these are people.''   Many of the individuals our city lost were young, just starting out  their careers and families. Far too many were children, including a 14- year-old boy we lost just 10 days ago.   Of course, for every victim who lost their life to violent crime,  there are even more who have been injured or traumatized or literally  forced to live in fear. As one resident said, ``I got to lock my doors  all the time . . . I'm worried about my children going outside. It's  not fair.''  [[Page S80]]    It is not fair. Of course, he is absolutely right. It is not fair  that once-safe neighborhoods have become war zones. It is not fair that  children are being murdered.   Or look at what is happening right here in the Nation's Capital.  Right here in Washington, law and order have been in a free fall. Over  the weekend, in broad daylight, a rideshare driver had his car stolen  by a group of men brandishing rifles. City-wide, Washington is  averaging a carjacking every day. Homicides this year are up 17  percent. Just yesterday, two 18-year-olds, fresh off a carjacking spree  in a nearby county, came right here to the capital, ran into two  separate Capitol Police vehicles, and then tried to flee on foot.  Fortunately, the Capitol Police brought them into custody.   Yet the DC City Council is so completely captured by the woke far- left, they have responded to the crime wave with a new criminal code  that--listen to this--reduces penalties even further. That is the  response of the DC City Council.   Just last week, the council overrode the mayor's veto and pushed  through a measure that shreds--shreds--the maximum punishment for gun  crimes. It eliminates almost all mandatory minimum sentences. It will  clog up the court system with massive expansions of new jury trials for  misdemeanors.   Well, the good news on this front is that the U.S. Congress gets to  have the final word over reckless local policies from the DC  government. Senate Republicans will have a lot more to say on this  subject. Stay tuned.   The American people know crime is getting worse, and they know it  hasn't happened by accident. From Los Angeles to Philadelphia, to  Chicago, the Democratic Party has backed radical district attorneys who  have tried to unilaterally take parts of the local criminal code  offline. They simply decline to prosecute serious crimes, from drug  possession to criminal threats, as a matter of principle. In some cases  these woke prosecutors are seeking early release for felons convicted  of violent crimes.   Many other Democrats have spent years fanning the dangerous flames of  the far-left's antipolice rhetoric. Of course, studies have proven that  public hostility to police leads directly to more crime, including more  homicides, in the at-risk communities that need law and order the most.   Furthermore, the Biden administration and Senate Democrats have spent  2 years working to stack the Federal judiciary with former public  defenders and others whose sympathies lie more with criminal defendants  than with innocent victims.   Nobody is arguing that criminal defenders should never become judges,  but this has been a dramatic, deliberate transformation project that is  skewed overwhelmingly in one direction. Even the New York Times has  admitted it has been ``a sea change in the world of traditional  nominations.''   The Biden administration never misses an opportunity to make crime  even worse. Deaths from cocaine have quintupled over the past decade,  but, just a few weeks ago, this President and his Attorney General took  the radical and borderline lawless step of unilaterally reducing the  penalties for dealing crack.   These liberals respond to soaring overdose fatalities by going even  softer on drugs.   Democrats are struggling with the basics. Actually, this shouldn't be  that hard. Drugs belong off the streets. Career criminals belong behind  bars, and far-left politicians who put innocent citizens last belong  far away from the levers of power.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
