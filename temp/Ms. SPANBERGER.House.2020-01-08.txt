 Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, a generation ago, very few envisioned the way wireless  technology would evolve, the way it would shape our lives and the world  [[Page H33]]  around us. With the advent of 5G, we are preparing to take another  massive leap forward, and we need to be ready for it.   Even with today's technology, we see risks posed by hostile  governments, criminal networks, and those who seek to threaten our  security, disrupt our commerce, and exploit our personal information.  With 5G, those risks are even greater, and we cannot stand on the  sidelines while China or any other power determines how this technology  will be developed and managed.   I am proud to be here today in support of the bipartisan efforts that  we have made in this body to push up against the threats and the  challenges we see. I am proud to join with my colleague Mr. McCaul. I  thank the gentleman for his leadership on this very important issue.   The bills that we are considering today, Mr. McCaul's bill in  particular, will help ensure that our government is focused on this now  as this 5G technology is taking shape. I support this measure. I urge  all of my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill,  H.R. 2881, the Secure 5G and Beyond Act.   First, I thank my fellow members of the House Committee on Foreign  Affairs for approving this legislation, and I thank the House Energy  and Commerce Committee for passing my bill out of committee on a  strongly bipartisan basis last year as well.   I also thank my colleagues, Representative Brooks, Representative  O'Halleran, Representative Rooney, Representative Slotkin, and  Representative Stefanik, for joining my effort to protect the next  generation of U.S. telecommunications systems. I am proud to have such  a strong bipartisan coalition backing my bill.   I also thank my colleagues in the Senate, Senator Cornyn and his  bipartisan colleagues, for their work in prioritizing this very  important issue.   When you turn on the TV, you might hear a lot of commercials  advertising 5G and the expansion of U.S. 5G networks. It is true: This  technology holds incredible potential for future economic growth here  in the United States, particularly in our rural communities, as they  rely on these high-speed technologies to connect to the rest of the  world.   However, the adoption of certain 5G wireless technologies present  many serious national security challenges for our country and the  American people. Chinese companies like ZTE and Huawei continue to grow  their global 5G footprint around the world, and as their equipment  becomes more integrated into the economies of the United States and our  allies, China's leverage grows, as does the threat of Chinese  exploitation.   It is difficult to overstate the long-term effects of the global  transition to 5G. An article in The Atlantic earlier this week said:  ``The rollout of speedy, new cellular networks is a geopolitical  turning point.'' And China is working hard to take advantage of this  rare moment.   Unfortunately, China's long-term strategy and ambitions extend far  beyond global commerce and communications. For example, a 2018 NATO  report warned that Huawei's close ties to the Chinese Government could  lead to Huawei's 5G technology being used to spy on adversaries,  monitor foreign companies and governments, and support Chinese military  operations, all of which could be targeted at the United States and the  American people.   The adoption of Chinese 5G could invite a deluge of foreign  influence, espionage, and interference into U.S. mobile networks and  wireless systems.   But, simultaneously, China's innovation edge is also growing through  companies like Huawei and ZTE. As of February 2019, Chinese tech  companies owned 36 percent of all key 5G patents, while U.S.-based  companies only owned 14 percent.   This makes clear to me that the United States needs a comprehensive  strategy, a strategy to respond to this growing level of economic  competition and to protect against the security risks posed by ZTE,  Huawei, and other 5G-focused companies.   From afar, we have seen how China disregards the privacy of its own  people, and we should be very wary of China's growing 5G influence in  the West. We need a game plan to defend our mobile networks.   The United States, the country responsible for so many of the  remarkable developments of the digital age, needs to strengthen our  resilience against potential cyber threats directed against American  families, companies, and consumer data. That is why I am proud to lead  the Secure 5G and Beyond Act.   Madam Speaker, my bill would require the administration to develop a  public strategy to protect U.S. consumers, companies, and Federal  agencies against potential threats posed by emerging 5G technologies.  By developing a national interagency strategy, we can better identify  where security gaps currently exist--and we can work to close them.   Additionally, my bill would help spur new 5G research and development  here at home, something that is critical for central Virginia and the  rest of the United States.   In the face of potential Chinese dominance in the 5G space, the  Secure 5G and Beyond Act would put our country and its companies on a  path toward achieving and maintaining greater security and a  competitive edge.                                time  1615    But in our interconnected world, we cannot do it alone. This  bipartisan legislation would also encourage our allies to pursue  similar strategies.   As we look ahead to future generations of wireless technology, we  need to deploy a strong, evidence-based approach toward improving our  cyber defenses.   Last year, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph  Dunford called the rise of Chinese 5G networks a critical national  security issue. This bill recognizes that fact and does something about  it.   We can continue to achieve faster internet speeds and wider  connectivity across America, but this bill makes sure that these  exciting achievements are accompanied by a smart strategy, one that can  successfully prevent foreign influence in our 5G networks and keep our  citizens safe.   Today, I call on my colleagues to pass the Secure 5G and Beyond Act  of 2020.
