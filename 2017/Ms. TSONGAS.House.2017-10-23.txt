 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2142, the  INTERDICT Act, legislation I was pleased to introduce with Congressman  Fitzpatrick.   Whenever I meet with local public safety officials in my district,  they explain the urgent need for resources and support to combat drugs  like fentanyl, which can be up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100  times stronger than morphine.   In Massachusetts, the proportion of overdose deaths attributed to  fentanyl is rising at a meteoric rate. At its lowest, in the third  quarter of 2014,  [[Page H8059]]  fentanyl was present in 18 percent of opioid-related deaths in  Massachusetts; but by 2016, fentanyl was present in a staggering 69  percent of the State's opioid-related deaths, resulting in 1,400  fentanyl-related deaths in the Commonwealth, a staggering number.   Although pharmaceutical fentanyl can be misused, most fentanyl deaths  are linked to illicitly manufactured fentanyl and illicit versions of  chemically similar compounds. The primary source of fentanyl is outside  of the United States, in Mexico or China. The drug is smuggled in  across the U.S. border or delivered via mail or express consignment  couriers.   The INTERDICT Act will provide U.S. Customs and Border Protection  with the latest in chemical screening devices to deploy across the  United States to better detect and intercept fentanyl and other  synthetic opioids.   Furthermore, this legislation will ensure that Customs and Border  Protection has the resources, personnel, and facilities--including  scientists available during all operational hours--to interpret  screening test results from the field.   These high-tech devices will also protect law enforcement officers  and their four-legged counterparts on the front lines from exposure to  the deadly narcotic, which is so powerful that coming into contact with  just a few grains can be fatal.   I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland  Security Committee for their support, and I also want to thank Mr.  Fitzpatrick for his partnership on this legislation, as well as our  colleagues in the Senate, Senators Markey, Rubio, Brown, and Capito,  for their bipartisan work on the Senate counterpart legislation.                                time  1715    The Federal Government must do its part to ensure our first  responders have the tools they need in this greatest of public health  fights. The INTERDICT Act provides important and powerful resources in  this endeavor, and I urge its adoption.
