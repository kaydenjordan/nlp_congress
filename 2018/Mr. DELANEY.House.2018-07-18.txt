 Mr. Speaker, the scientists have spoken. Climate change  is happening, human behavior is contributing to it, and it is a long- term threat to our prosperity and our national security.   But climate change is also the ultimate, very large problem that  moves very slowly, which makes it particularly poorly matched with the  political system we have today. And what causes me great concern is  when wrongheaded resolutions which I oppose--and I oppose the rule  associated with it--are put to the floor of this House to discourage  this House from proposing the most effective and most successful way of  dealing with climate change, which is to put a price on carbon.   We can take all of those revenues and return them to the American  people. We can wall them off from government spending. There is a whole  variety of approaches we could take to ensure that the revenues  generated from taxing carbon pollution are returned to the American  people.   As a Congress, wouldn't we rather tax pollution than tax hardworking  Americans? That is what a carbon tax will do. I encourage my colleagues  to reject this resolution and allow us to have the real debate the  American people deserve on this floor.
