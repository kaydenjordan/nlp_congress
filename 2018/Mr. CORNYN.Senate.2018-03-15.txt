 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 2 days ago, the President of the United  States announced his decision to replace Secretary of State Rex  Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. I respect and admire both of  these men immensely.   I just want to take a moment to talk about Secretary Tillerson's  public service. I know his entering government after his long and  illustrious career in the private sector was quite a transition, but he  provided able leadership to the Department of State during a period of  transition from one Presidency to the next and a period of diplomatic  turbulence. He worked hard to strengthen and, in some cases, repair our  global alliances.   I have known Secretary Tillerson for a long time. He is a man of  character who has led the Boy Scouts, which continues to be one of his  abiding passions--developing young men as persons of character, and I  respect that. At the same time, he advanced his own career as the head  of one of the largest businesses in the world at the pinnacle of  success, as we count success. I wish him the best, and I hope his  statesmanship, professionalism, and deep and abiding friendships  spanning the globe are remembered and maintained after he is gone from  public life.                          Nomination of Mike Pompeo    Mr. President, I also want to say a few good words about my friend  Mike Pompeo. After graduating first in his class at West Point and then  graduating from Harvard Law School, he had a successful career in law  and business before transitioning into public service. As a Member of  the House of Representatives, he represented Kansas's Fourth  Congressional District and served on the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence. Then he was named by President Trump, as we know, to lead  the Central Intelligence Agency.   Director Pompeo is a terrific guy, smart and well respected by all.  He has a keen sense of the delicate nature of global diplomacy and the  crucial role America and American intelligence agencies have to play. I  know he has a great rapport with the President, and I think he will  make an excellent Secretary of State.                          Nomination of Gina Haspel    Mr. President, finally, I want to state my utmost confidence in Gina  Haspel, Director Pompeo's Deputy, who has been nominated to take over  after he leaves as Director of the CIA. As a career intelligence  professional, she is tough, she is direct, but she is collegial, too,  and much beloved by the people who work out at the Central Intelligence  Agency.   As my colleague, the senior Senator from California, has previously  stated, Ms. Haspel has great experience acting as Deputy Director, and  she has the confidence of the Central Intelligence Agency, which is no  small feat.   I support Ms. Haspel's nomination and look forward to working hard to  ensure her confirmation.   Of course, there will be groups who will waste no time trying to  tarnish her reputation over efforts she made doing her part to keep our  Nation safe after the terrible tragedy of 9/11, but I think it is more  telling that those who know her best commend her in the strongest of  terms. Take, for example, President Obama's former Director of National  Intelligence, James Clapper, who has called her tremendous, and  President Obama's CIA Director Leon Panetta has expressed his support  and said he is glad the nominee is Ms. Haspel because she knows the CIA  inside out.   So in the days ahead, we will be discussing Ms. Haspel, but let's not  just buy into the phony narratives that other people will give about  her public service. The views of those who doubt her qualifications and  who question her experience will continue to attack and denigrate Ms.  Haspel, no doubt, in the open debate. Ultimately, their arguments, if  believed and accepted, would make the country less safe and less  secure.   We have to remember that right after the terrible events of 9/11, we  didn't have the luxury of hindsight. Our leaders were worried about  follow-on attacks following the terrible tragedy in New York and the  plane crashing into the Pentagon. Public fears regarding another attack  were at an alltime high, and tough calls had to be made. That is what  leadership is all about.   So I look forward to continuing to make the case for why Ms. Haspel  is the person the country needs to lead the Central Intelligence  Agency.                                Fix NICS Bill    Mr. President, I admit to sounding like a broken record. I am here  again to talk about the Fix NICS bill, a bill I introduced with the  junior Senator from Connecticut. Just as a refresher, Fix NICS is about  fixing the broken background check system that is used when somebody  purchases a firearm, but in the case of my constituents in Sutherland  Springs, TX, because of the failures of the Federal Government-- notably, in this case, the U.S. Air Force--to upload felony convictions  and convictions for domestic violence into the background check system,  no derogatory information was reported, and ultimately the gunman in  Sutherland Springs took the life of 26 innocent people and shot 20  more.   The reason I keep talking about this legislation is, it is just too  important to let up on. We cannot, and we never should, just move on  after another tragedy like that which occurred in Parkland, FL, and  Sutherland Springs, TX, or what happened in Las Vegas, NV, where 58  people were killed and 851 others injured by a gunman using a bump  stock, which essentially turned a semiautomatic weapon into an  automatic weapon. We can't just move on when lives hang in the balance.  We have to do our duty and do our part to save lives. We have to fix  our criminal background check system so dangerous felons do not lie  their way into obtaining firearms to use to slaughter innocent people.   To do that, we have to get this bill to the President as soon as  possible. The President will sign this legislation once it passes the  House and the Senate. I am grateful that today 72 Members of the U.S.  Senate have signed on as cosponsors to the bill.   It is not just the lawmakers here in Washington who support it; the  country is asking for it too. I have a Thursday morning coffee for my  constituents from Texas and a number of them--students--came to talk to  me about their concerns about gun violence and particularly the feeling  that not only parents have, and worry about for their children, but  that students have themselves about whether they are going to continue  to be safe in their schools.   Yesterday, a broad coalition of victims' rights advocates, law  enforcement officers, and gun violence prevention groups and  prosecutors sent me a letter, along with to the majority and minority  leaders, asking them for a clean vote on the Fix NICS legislation  before the upcoming Easter recess. They said it would improve key  elements of the background check system, particularly domestic  violence, criminal history, and protective order records.   Let me just pause there. One of the most frequent victims of  shootings are domestic violence victims--family disputes, custody  disputes, divorces, and the like. One of the purposes of the background  check system is to make sure nobody who has been convicted of a  domestic violence assault can legally purchase or possess a firearm.   These same groups call this bill bipartisan, bicameral, commonsense,  and noncontroversial. Again, they made a point to note in their letter  that the vote should be clean--in other words, not conditioned on other  controversial measures. Well, they are absolutely right, and I would  ask the minority leader to listen to the 80 percent of his conference  that backed this bill and believe in its promise to help stem the tide  of violence and help save lives.  [[Page S1759]]    I would ask those who are objecting to us considering this  legislation on a clean up-or-down vote to reconsider. Many of them say:  Well, there are other things we want to vote on. Well, I would be happy  to have that happen, but none of these ideas, at this point, have  achieved the sort of consensus the Fix NICS bill has. They are waiting  for impossible outcomes, insisting on votes on other measures, when we  know those votes will fail, but worst of all, conditioning their  willingness to vote on Fix NICS for those other votes, which we know  will not succeed and will fail.   So I implore those standing in the way of a rollcall vote on this  consensus piece of legislation to lift their objections and join us.  Their current strategy will guarantee failure, and failure on this  issue, more than others, we absolutely cannot afford.   I yield the floor.
