 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Limit, Save, Grow Act.   This legislation takes monumental steps in reining in Federal  spending by not cutting but just returning to spending levels of just a  year ago and spurring economic growth and restoring the fiscal sanity  that our Nation desperately needs.   As our national debt is at nearly $31.5 trillion or $95,000 per  person, our current fiscal trajectory is simply unsustainable.   It is immoral, and it is unfair to future generations who will be the  ones responsible for paying off this insurmountable debt.   This legislation will help restore the American economy, unleash  American energy, and reverse decades of runaway spending.   I applaud the work of Chairman Arrington, his leadership, and his  tireless efforts to help bring us to this critical moment in our  Nation's history. I am proud to support this legislation.
