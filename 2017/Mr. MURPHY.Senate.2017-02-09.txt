 Mr. President, I am going to be brief. I want to build on  some of the comments Senator Warner made. It is unclear what President  Trump's position is on repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care  Act. He has made all sorts of commitments all over the map, suggesting  that he wants to deconstruct the act in full, suggesting that he wants  to keep some elements of it, making promises that whatever comes next  will be just as good, will be better than what consumers have today.   I think what you are going to hear consistently from our side is a  willingness, a desire, an enthusiasm to engage in a conversation with  Republicans about how to strengthen our health care system, how to  repair the parts of the Affordable Care Act that are broken, but keep  the majority of that legislation, which is delivering lifesaving care  to people as we speak, and not descend into health care chaos by  repealing this legislation with no plan for what comes next.   The genesis of our opposition, of my opposition, to Tom Price's  nomination to be the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  Services is that he has been, in the House of Representatives, the face  of the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act with  absolutely no plan for what comes next.   There were many other choices that could have been made for  selections to head the Department and lead the conversation about the  Affordable Care Act and its future that could have signaled that we  were going to have an ability to come together. But when I was a Member  of the House of Representatives, I watched my colleague, Tom Price, be  the leader, the face of the campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act,  with absolutely no replacement, which would descend our entire health  care marketplace into chaos.   That is chiefly why I stand here in opposition to his nomination  today. He did offer a token plan to replace it, but it had nothing of  value to the people of Connecticut. It would have repealed Medicaid  expansion with no plan for what came next. It would have repealed the  insurance protections for people who are sick with a $3 billion high- risk pool that would never have met the needs of those who have serious  illness and disease and who cannot find insurance.   Our worry is that we are on the precipice of repealing an act which  has saved thousands of lives, which has insured 20 million people, and  the results will be health care chaos for everyone, whether they are on  the Affordable Care Act or not.   Tom Price has been the face of the repeal effort in the House of  Representatives. He has been the face of the irresponsible position of  getting rid of this law with nothing that comes next. And it simply  doesn't give us confidence that there is going to be a rational  bipartisan conversation about how to improve our health care system.   This isn't politics. I just want to underscore the point that Senator  Warner made. This isn't about scoring political points. This isn't  simply about numbers. This is about human lives that are affected if  Tom Price gets what he has been asking for during the last 6 years,  which is a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act without any plan for  what comes next.   This is a picture of Mark and his family from Westbrook. This is a  picture of his daughter Dominique. Dominique has a profound  intellectual disability. She also has cerebral palsy. She doesn't have  the use of her left arm. She walks with an unsteady gait. She also  cannot chew food, so she takes liquid nutrition. But she has an amazing  spirit. She loves school. She loves music. She loves singing to Disney  movies. She plays soccer, buddy baseball, and rides a horse for  therapy, but Mark and his wife used to spend $40,000 a year out of  their own pocket for her care. The Affordable Care Act saved this  family from potential bankruptcy. The Affordable Care Act now, through  Medicaid expansion, allows Dominique to get care that is socially  insured. And Mark asks:         After all, who are we as a people and a country if we       cannot take care of those who for no fault of their own       cannot take care of themselves? Dominique didn't do anything       wrong, she was born this way and deserves to have a       fulfilling life.    That is the whole concept of insurance: The idea that we should  socialize the cost of caring for kids and adults who, through no fault  of their own, get sick. But without the Affordable Care Act, this  family bears the burden of caring for Dominique by themselves. And  there is no replacement. There is no plan on the table today--certainly  not Tom Price's reputed replacement plan in the House of  Representatives--that offers any help to this family if the Affordable  Care Act goes away.   Let me introduce you to one more family. This is a picture of Angela.  She  [[Page S997]]  is hiding here--Angela from New Canaan. Angela is 49 years old. She was  diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer in 2015. The good news is that  Angela is winning the fight against breast cancer, but she would face  the inability to get health care insurance if not for the Affordable  Care Act because if this family ever lost continuous care, they would  be uninsurable. So the protections built into the law allow them to pay  reasonable prices. She says:         Would President Trump or any member of Congress who voted       to repeal the ACA be willing to write to my 12 and 9 year old       boys, and explain to them why they let their Mommy die? I       doubt they even give a damn.    I don't think she is right on that. I think that everybody in this  Chamber cares about this family, but it is a reminder that there are  really personal consequences for millions of Americans if Tom Price, as  the leader of the Department of Health and Human Services, leads a  campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act without any replacement.   We talked about the damage that will be done to these families, but  for the entire marketplace, there is nothing but chaos if Tom Price  gets his way. I opposed his nomination right from the start because I  knew who he was in the House of Representatives. I knew that he had led  this campaign of health care destruction for families like those that I  just described.   Frankly, his hearing just compounded my worries. These ethical lapses  that have been raised over and over again just draw even more question  as to whether he is going to use this position as the head of the  Department of Health and Human Services to protect and advance the  health care of my constituents or he is going to use that position to  enrich himself and his family.   Those are serious accusations. I get it, but these were serious  ethical lapses that were uncovered, not by us but by an independent  journalist raised as part of these hearings. I would hope this body  would consider rejecting Tom Price's nomination so we can find someone  to lead that agency and lead our conversation on the floor of the  Senate about the future of health care, so that instead of continuing  what has been a bitterly divisive issue over the last 6 years, we can  finally find a way to come together and answer Angela's concerns that  Donald Trump and the Republicans who support him don't care about her  and her family, are willing to let her die.   I don't think that is true, but by putting someone in this position  as the head of the Department who has campaigned on repealing this act,  taking away from Angela the protections that allow her to succeed and  to live and to continue to beat cancer, without any idea for what comes  next, it suggests that the division will continue and catastrophe will  be in line for families like hers.   I will oppose this nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.
