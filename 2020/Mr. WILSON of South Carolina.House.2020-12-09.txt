 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for Major  Jeremy E. Tillman, who has been serving in the Washington office of the  Second Congressional District of South Carolina from the Army for the  past year as a Defense fellow.   Major Tillman has been deployed twice: to the Republic of Korea and  to Iraq. He is the recipient of the Purple Heart, the Bronze Service  Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, the Combat Action Badge, the  Army Commendation Medal, and many other deserved awards.   Major Tillman has been essential to the office over the past year. He  has worked to solidify important legislation in the National Defense  Authorization Act, NDAA, including modification of body armor for  female troops.   I am thankful for his commitment to America. I wish him well and the  best for his future.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   I appreciate President Donald Trump as a champion for our military  for peace through strength.                            ____________________
