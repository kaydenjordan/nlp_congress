 Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 150th  anniversary of the ratification of the 15th Amendment to the  Constitution.   The right to vote freely and fairly is the foundation of our  democracy. And yet, 150 years ago, this great nation prohibited an  entire group of citizens from voting by law. 150 years seems so long  ago but at the same time so near to us now.   We know that even though, 150 years ago, our lawmakers said you  cannot deny voters based on the color of their skin, that states were  still allowed to functionally discriminate against African Americans.  Back then it was literacy tests, when they knew the people who could  not read were by and large former slaves. Poll taxes for black people.  Threats of having your house burned down, being beaten, or even  murdered if you dared to try and exercise your Constitutional right to  vote.   These practices persisted for a long time, until the Civil Rights  Movement of the 50s and 60s. The brave actions of these peaceful  protesters put them directly into harms way. Many were beaten, like our  colleague John Lewis, and tragically some were murdered, including Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.   Their leadership directly paved the way to the passage of the Voting  Rights Act of 1965. This landmark legislation finally prohibited any  voting law that intentionally or not, resulted in the discrimination  against racial minorities. Section 5 closely monitored states that had  previously used such laws in the past, so they could not slip under the  radar.   Unfortunately, Section 5 enforcement was struck down by the Supreme  Court in 2013. The rationale was this fight was so long ago that such  monitoring was not needed anymore. I can assure you it was not that  long ago to me nor anyone else who lived through it. 48 years is not  even a lifetime for most Americans, and yet it was supposed to be long  enough to correct nearly 400 years of oppression and disenfranchisement  for African Americans.   Of course, the predictable has now happened because 48 years was not  long enough to right the wrongs. We are seeing new voting laws that  will harm people of color, the poor, and the elderly  disproportionately: new photo ID requirements, registration  restrictions, and even mass purging of the voter rolls. Voter  suppression is happening in 2020 in the same states Section 5 watched  closely from 1965 to 2013.   We have indeed come a long way from codifying voter suppression  explicitly by race. We have come a long way from the physical violence  that was a real threat when heading to the polls. However, we still  have so far to go. It is too easy to get complacent--to think what we  have won cannot be taken back. But it can be, it already was in 2013.  Now we have to get back to work--protect what we have and push for what  we don't.   I rise today appreciating how far we have come in the last 150 years  and remembering how far we must go in the next 150 years.                            ____________________
