 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of David  Glass.   David was born in 1935 and grew up in Mountain View, Missouri. He  joined the U.S. Army after high school and then earned a degree at  Missouri State. He started a career in business, eventually making his  way to Arkansas.   He was hired by the famous Sam Walton in 1976 as the chief financial  officer for Walmart, a young discount retailer at the time. Nobody knew  then that his hiring would transform the company.   An entrepreneur in his own right, David helped further unleash the  potential of the organization. Under his leadership, Walmart grew  exponentially and transformed from a rural chain into the international  business we all know today.   After succeeding Sam Walton as the chief executive officer of the  company, he led the building of supercenters, introduced the sale of  grocery items, helped develop automated distribution centers, and  increased international acquisitions and operations. He advanced the  company into the future while maintaining the founding principles of  his predecessor, Sam Walton.  [[Page H574]]    He would never admit it, but much of the success of Walmart and the  growth of our region is a reflection of the work of David Glass.   His business expertise was rivaled only by his love of baseball. He  famously helped keep the Kansas City Royals franchise from leaving  Kansas City in 1993. Under his ownership, the team saw two American  League pennants and a World Series trophy in 2015. His passion for the  sport, the team, and the city helped bring success on the field.   Whether in Arkansas or Kansas City, the contributions of David Glass  will long be remembered. I had the privilege of knowing him, not only  as an accomplished businessman and a novel thinker, but as a friend.   I hope you will join me in celebrating his life, in praying for his  wife, Ruth, and his children, Dan, Don, Dayna, and their families  during the time of his passing.               Recognizing the Life and Legacy of Forrest Wood     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of a legend in Arkansas business, the founder of Ranger Boats,  the late Forrest Wood.   Forrest was born in Flippin, Arkansas, in 1932, and his life  reflected everything the Natural State has to offer. As a pioneer with  a love for the outdoors, Forrest spent his time raising cattle and  acting as a guide on Bull Shoals Lake, the White River, the Buffalo  River, and Crooked Creek.   He became known throughout the region as an elite fishing guide. He  eventually leveraged his skills on the water to create a float trip  business, and in 1968, he began building lake boats. That year, he  built six boats. Named after the Army Rangers and the Texas Rangers,  Forrest Woods' Ranger Boats quickly became a household name in America.   He soon went from producing 6 to 600, and his novel concept became  the modern bass boat that we know today. Forrest's ingenuity and vision  transformed the boating and fishing industry across our Nation.   No one I know has loved or served Arkansas' great outdoors more than  Forrest Wood. Whether as an entrepreneur, instructor, or former  chairman of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, he was committed to  ensuring people enjoy the outdoors for generations to come.   He will forever be remembered as a legend in the fishing industry,  and I believe his biggest asset was his redeeming personality. A loyal  friend, mentor, and dedicated family man, his genuine smile and caring  nature will be sorely missed.   Mr. Speaker, as he is laid to rest this week, I ask that we keep his  wife, Nina, and the entire Wood family in our prayers.                            ____________________
