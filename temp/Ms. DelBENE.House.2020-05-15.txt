 Mr. Speaker, the HEROES Act will help workers stay  connected to their employers, their paychecks, and their benefits.   This bill includes an expanded employee retention tax credit. By  building on this existing and bipartisan program, we help businesses  keep their employees on the payroll through the end of the year and  reduce unemployment.   The bill also expands the child tax credit to help families and  reduce child poverty. These policies, along with support for essential  public services, expanded testing, and contact tracing, are the reasons  why I will be voting ``yes.''
