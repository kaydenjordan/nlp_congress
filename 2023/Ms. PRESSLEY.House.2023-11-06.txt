 Mr. Chair, I oppose this legislation for the draconian  cuts and dangerous provisions included in it, but also for the critical  funding priorities that were excluded.   With this appropriations bill, Republicans callously stripped  community project funding for The Pryde, an affordable LGBTQ+ senior  housing development in the Massachusetts Seventh.   It would seem for my colleagues across the aisle that the word  ``freedom'' is selectively applied. It does not apply to my bodily  autonomy. It does not apply to intellectual freedom for women, African  Americans, or our LGBTQ siblings when it comes to our books, and it  does not apply to the freedom to love whom you love.   This project satisfies the committee's requirements and would meet a  critical need in my district at a time when mortgages are skyrocketing  and one-third of LGBTQ seniors are living in poverty, and many are  forced to recloset themselves in order to age in community in their  twilight years. Unconscionable.   Republicans are choosing homophobia over housing, profits over  people, cruelty over compassion. Their actions to target, attack, and  dehumanize our LGBTQ siblings are nothing more than a show of contempt.   While The Pryde has a pathway for other Federal funding, this act of  policy violence contributes to the physical violence that far too many  LGBTQ folks experience.   As the vice chair of the Task Force on Aging and Families, I want my  LGBTQ constituents and siblings in the movement to know they deserve  safe and affordable housing, they deserve to be seen and loved, and I  will never stop fighting for them.
