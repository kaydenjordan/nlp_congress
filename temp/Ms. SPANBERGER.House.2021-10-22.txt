 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on the House floor  about Summer Barrow.   Summer was born on July 4 and was named for the season. Her mother,  Carey Colvin, said that Summer was a firecracker, she was vivacious,  she loved to dance, she loved to sing, and she loved music. But Summer  died of a fentanyl overdose in January of 2020.   Summer's substance use disorder began after she was prescribed  oxycodone after a car accident, and when the prescription ran out, she  turned to heroin.   This vibrant young woman lost her life to a substance use disorder,  and amid her loss, her mother, Carey, has turned to advocacy.   In her honor, I was proud to introduce the bipartisan Support  Recovery for Addiction Act, legislation that would create a guaranteed  funding stream for recovery support services and community  organizations.   Of her daughter, Carey said: ``I know what she would want to say is:  `Please get help.'''   This bill would help deliver that help to others, just as Summer and  so many others that we have lost to substance use disorder would have  wanted.                            ____________________
