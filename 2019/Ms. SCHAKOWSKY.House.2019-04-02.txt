 Mr. Speaker, clearly, we have hit a nerve with the  Republicans on the Affordable Care Act, which they opposed before it  began, have been opposing it for 9 years, promising to come up with  some sort of a repeal and replace, never being able to do it, and now  standing up here and saying life was better before the Affordable Care  Act. Amazing.   People with preexisting conditions love the Affordable Care Act.   Why are we here in the majority today? Because the American people  came to understand that before the Affordable Care Act, children born  with preexisting conditions from the day of birth were not able to be  covered by healthcare, that there were limits in how much insurance  companies would pay per year or per lifetime caps, and making families  live in fear of disaster and financial chaos.   So, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the Trump administration and  their decision to support the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, not in  the Congress, but now in the courts.   They couldn't defeat it here. They tried when they had the majority  in both Houses and could not repeal it.   When I came here, being a woman was essentially a preexisting  condition. Women paid more for healthcare, sometimes 40 percent more,  just because we are women. Pregnancy was very rarely covered by  insurance, and now women are covered for those things like preventive  services, mammograms, pregnancy.   The Affordable Care Act has let people 26 years old stay on their  parents' policies.   No wonder the American people have completely turned around and  understood the sham that the Republicans were offering and support the  Affordable Care Act.
