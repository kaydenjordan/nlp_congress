 Madam Speaker, I strongly support H.R.  5376, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.   I am particularly pleased that the legislation before the House  includes major provisions of my GREEN Act, including incentives for a  vast array of clean and renewable energy sources.   This legislation represents the most sweeping and ambitious climate  policy ever to pass the Congress.   It reduces our dependence on fossil fuels while accelerating the  development of solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources.   And it incentivizes individuals to limit greenhouse gas emissions  from their homes, their businesses, and their vehicles.   I am also extremely supportive of the health care provisions in this  bill.   Allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs has  been a priority for Democrats in Congress for decades--and this bill  not only ensures that seniors don't go broke paying for their  medicines, but also saves taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.   Given the negotiations of the past 18 months, this bill could not  accommodate every single priority or proposal.   And I am hopeful that my colleagues will work with me moving forward  to ensure that the corporate minimum tax--a policy I support--does not  inadvertently burden companies, like some in my district, who suffered  severe net operating losses in previous years due to natural disaster.   This bill is a tremendous step forward for our country. It pays down  our deficit, reduces the cost of prescription drugs, extends health  insurance subsidies for low-income Americans and invests hundreds of  billions of dollars in clean and renewable energy.   I am proud to have helped author this legislation, and I strongly  support its passage.
