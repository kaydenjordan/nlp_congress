 Madam Speaker, Biden has repeatedly tried to  deflect blame for all the economic problems Americans are currently  facing.   Instead of blaming inflation on out-of-control government spending,  he claims it is the fault of greedy corporations and that profits are  bad.   Instead of realizing that his hostility toward the oil and gas  industry is decreasing investments and increasing energy costs, he  blames Russia.   Well, I can tell you that the American people are not buying it. The  American people are not stupid. People are facing the real-life  consequences of Biden's failed economic policies at the grocery store,  at the bank, and in their paychecks.   Instead of working to address these economic challenges, the White  House is trying to change the definition of a recession before abysmal  GDP numbers are released later this week.   The American people deserve a leader that offers solutions, not  semantics. In God we trust.                            ____________________
