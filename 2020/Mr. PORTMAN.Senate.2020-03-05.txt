 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up  amendment No. 1514 and ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, Senator Shaheen and I are here today to  report this amendment. This is simply language that is being reinserted  back into the Energy bill that was taken out. I will say that it is  clarifying language. We made some slight changes to clarify that there  are no mandates in this legislation, and it has to do with ensuring  that we have encouragement of energy efficiency in the single largest  use of energy in our country, which are our residential homes and  commercial buildings. So I appreciate the fact that Senator Shaheen is  here on the floor. I yield to the Senator.    I thank my colleague, and I yield back.
