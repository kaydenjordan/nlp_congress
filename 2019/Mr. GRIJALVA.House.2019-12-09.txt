 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 256) to amend the Native American Programs Act of 1974 to  provide flexibility and reauthorization to ensure the survival and  continuing vitality of Native American languages.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support S. 256,  the Esther Martinez Native American Languages Programs Reauthorization  Act.   The United States has a trust responsibility to support indigenous  peoples in this country. The survival of indigenous peoples' languages  is fundamental to the success of Native communities and the survival of  traditional Native cultures.   The history of the United States tells us about the deliberate  efforts to eliminate indigenous peoples' languages and cultures through  forced assimilation, boarding school forced attendance, treaties that  have not been honored, and promises not kept.   According to UNESCO, 74 Native languages stand to disappear within  the next decade. Scholars project that only 20 Native languages will be  spoken by the year 2050. The linguistic and cultural genocide is real  and demands action.   The Esther Martinez language program has been a tool that was created  to address this stark reality. This language program is named in honor  of a New Mexico Tewa teacher and storyteller, Esther Martinez, who is  known and honored for her dedication and efforts in revitalizing her  people's language.   The Esther Martinez Initiative funds immersion programs that are  successful in preserving and revitalizing Native languages, both to  indigenous communities, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian students.   Today, grants provided under Esther Martinez' program have empowered  Native communities to establish language immersion programs that are  successfully reviving Native languages and improving Native economies.   This grant has been used to develop curriculums rooted in Native  language based on traditional values and beliefs in subject areas that  obviously include language, mathematics, science, and social studies.   Esther Martinez grants also support children's books in Native  languages, the development of language assessment tools, and the  intergenerational programs to support regular use of Native language  with children at home.   Importantly, they also provide funding to train Native language  teachers to use the language immersion curriculum developed by the  Tribe and/or school.   The powerful link between language and identity for Native people is  essential in the development of successful students and communities.  These language immersion programs have proven to be the best model for  developing fluent speakers and successful students.   S. 256 reauthorizes the Esther Martinez program for $13 million  annually, increases the maximum duration of the grant, and reduces the  number of program enrollees needed to qualify for a grant.   The survival of Native languages is fundamental to the success of  Native communities and the survival of traditional Native cultures.   I would like to thank my colleagues Representative Lujan and Senator  Udall for leading the effort, and for the support of Representative  Haaland.   I urge my colleagues to support S. 256, the Esther Martinez Native  American Languages Programs Reauthorization Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan), a leader in this effort on  this legislation.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   My Speaker, I thank my colleagues across the aisle and, in  particular, Mr. Young, my friend from the committee.   When I first came to Congress, this is one of the first bills that he  sponsored. I was very proud to vote for it then, and I encourage all of  my colleagues today to be very proud to vote for it now.   The reauthorization is $13 million, and it is an amount of money that  goes very far in Indian Country, an amount of money that many could  argue should be more, but the point today is to reauthorize.   By reauthorization and seed money, which is so important to the  Native youth and children, I think we make a statement as a Congress  that we, too, join in reaffirming the revitalization, the preservation  of both language and culture among the first Americans in this country.  We say to them that what they bring as persons, as a Tribe, as a people  is vital, too, and enriches the fabric of this Nation of ours.   I am proud to be here. I urge all of my colleagues to support this  bill. It is a good piece of legislation that does good work and will  continue to do good work. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
