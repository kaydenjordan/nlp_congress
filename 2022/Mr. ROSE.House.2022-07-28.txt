 Mr. Speaker, last week President Biden announced a series  of executive orders to further advance his party's Green New Deal  agenda. This is further proof of an utterly out-of-touch  administration.   The average cost of a gallon of gas is $3.93 in Tennessee, almost  double the price when the President took office. Most Americans will  spend thousands more this year on filling up their tanks.   Families are also paying an average of $90 a month more for  electricity this summer. In addition, reports say our Nation faces  looming blackouts--yet this administration is doubling down on  regulating our energy producers to death.   The solution is simple: The President should be supporting policies  that ramp up domestic oil production, rather than policies that destroy  it.   Mr. Biden has blamed oil companies, gas station owners, and everyone  else for this disaster, but if he wants to assign blame, he need look  no further than the mirror.
