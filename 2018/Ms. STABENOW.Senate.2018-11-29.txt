 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, representing Michigan in the U.S.  Senate is such an honor, and one of the best parts of this job is the  work I am able to do on behalf of Michigan's over 600,000 veterans.   Our veterans have always been first in line to defend our democracy.  That is why they should never be at the back of any line--for a job,  for healthcare, for housing, or for education.   Our government has made our veterans promises--important promises-- and those promises must be kept. That is true of the Trump  administration, as well as every other administration. Unfortunately,  many of our veterans are now finding that promises the government made  to them regarding their education are being broken.   For weeks now, student veterans have spoken out about their GI bill  benefits being delayed or incorrect. One of those veterans is Brendan.  He serves his country in the Michigan National Guard, and he is a  student at Lake Superior State University in the beautiful Upper  Peninsula of Michigan.   A few months ago, Brendan's GI bill benefits didn't go through even  though he had done everything he was supposed to do. Brendan told his  local station, WWTV:         I got emails saying, you need to pay your tuition. It       stresses you out because you are wondering if you are going       to get paid, and if I can't pay tuition, then I can't enroll       in the next semester.    Bill, another student at Lake Superior State University, is a veteran  of the U.S. Marine Corps. His housing stipend was 36 days late. ``It  upsets me,'' he told WWTV. He added: ``When I was active duty, you are  expected to be anywhere in the world within 24 hours, boots on the  ground, ready to complete a mission. . . . When it comes time to pay  veterans back for their service, it takes me 35 days to get a check in  the mail.''   That is simply outrageous.   What is even more outrageous is that this week, the Department of  Veterans Affairs said it does not intend to reimburse veterans who were  paid less than they were owed. That is after the Trump administration  promised a House committee earlier this month that it would make sure  veterans are reimbursed. The Department blames computer issues and says  that going back to fix the mistakes would only delay further claims.  That is completely unacceptable. You can bet that if Brendan or Bill or  any other veteran tried to blame computer glitches for not paying their  phone bill or failing to complete an assignment, it wouldn't work.   These veterans have done everything--everything--we have asked of  them. It is our government's responsibility to provide them with  everything they have been promised, and I am committed to doing  everything in my power to make sure that happens. That is why earlier  this month I called on the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to address  this issue with the urgency it deserves--in other words, now. This  isn't the first time the VA has faced backlogs, either, but it should  be the last time--the very last time--our veterans are affected by  them.   I heard about some of these issues during a series of 13 veterans  roundtables I held around Michigan this year. I do this on a periodic  basis to find out how things are going and what more I can do to help-- as well as, of course, working with individual veterans who call our  office every week.   In response to these roundtables, which I very much appreciate people  from around the State participating in, I introduced the Student  Veterans Housing Act, which would help ensure that student veterans  have a place to live as they are pursuing their education.   Currently, the end of the semester can mean the loss of housing  benefits--when you are in between semesters and not in school--because  the VA can't pay for housing in between semesters. My legislation would  help ensure that student veterans don't have to reach into their own  pockets to pay for a benefit they have already earned and would make  sure they are not losing their housing between semesters. Our veterans  should be able to focus on their studies, not worry about keeping a  roof over their heads.   These veterans need to know their tuition payments will be there on  time, just as they were promised. It is not enough to praise our  veterans. We do that all the time, but praise doesn't pay the tuition  bills or housing costs for student veterans. Instead, we must uphold  each and every promise our country has made to them, including their GI  bill benefits.   I was very pleased when we were able to strengthen the GI bill and  was excited about the opportunities for new support for our veterans.  Now we are hearing about technical issues and glitches that make no  sense and undermine the ability of our veterans to fully benefit from  the improved GI bill.   The Trump administration must address these technical issues  immediately. The Senate must pass legislation, including my Student  Veterans Housing Act, which will ensure that veterans are receiving all  of the benefits they have earned. The VA must repay each and every  dollar our veterans are owed, period. Veterans like Brendan and Bill  and so many others have always been first in line to defend us. It is  time for us to stand up for them and get this issue fixed.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
