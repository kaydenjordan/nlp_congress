 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I offer  a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1403         Resolved, That the following named Member be, and is       hereby, elected to the following standing committee of the       House of Representatives:         Committee on Education and Labor: Mrs. Peltola, to rank       immediately after Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the House passage of  bipartisan, commonsense legislation that will expand access to  healthcare in underserved communities across the country.   I grew up in a rural farmworker community in the Coachella Valley,  and later served that same community as a doctor. I know how crucial it  is for people to have access to healthcare in their communities without  barriers,  [[Page H8291]]  and how the distance to a health center can be the difference between  whether or not someone seeks treatment.   That is why I joined Congresswoman Susie Lee in introducing the  MOBILE Health Care Act, which will help community health centers expand  their services with mobile health units. This means taking healthcare  to the people, often the hardest to reach, and often left out, and the  most medically underserved.   So I urge President Biden to sign this bill into law without delay to  improve health outcomes across the board and make a positive difference  in people's lives.                            ____________________
