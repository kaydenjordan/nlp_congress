 Mr. President, today I rise to honor the life of Charles  C. Myers, a proud American and a decorated World War II veteran.   While Charles is no longer with us, his legacy lives on. On behalf of  the U.S. Senate and all Americans, I would like extend our deepest  gratitude for his service to this Nation.   Charles was born on November 19, 1926, in Bismarck, AR. He grew up on  his family's farm in Hot Springs County, where he was raised by his  mother and father, alongside two sisters and three brothers.   Charles had an unyielding sense of adventure, spending his youth  hunting squirrels and riding horses. He quickly earned a reputation as  an avid horseback rider, watchful older brother, and dutiful son.   Like many young men during the war, the Myers boys felt a strong  obligation to defend their country. All four brothers joined the  military throughout the course of the war, including Charles, whose  determination to enlist knew no bounds. He falsified his age on his  enlistment papers, enrolling into the Army as a paramedic. For Charles,  this was a critical moment that filled him with a burgeoning sense of  loyalty and honor.   After Charles completed his training at Fort Bliss, he was sent  overseas, where he served as a highly respected combat medic in the 5th  Cavalry Regiment 1st Cavalry Division of the Army, operating in the  Pacific theater. There, the cross on the back of a combat medic  eventually served as a conspicuous target for the enemy. Charles made  the ultimate sacrifice while saving others, giving his life for our  Nation's freedom.   I now have the profound honor of presenting Charles' family with his  set of military honors. For his bravery in line of duty, Charles C.  Myers received the Purple Heart Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal,  Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with 2 Bronze Service Stars, World War  II Victory Medal, and Presidential Unit Citation, formerly  Distinguished Unit Citation. These medals serve are a small token of  our country's appreciation for Charles's service and his profound  sacrifice. He is an American hero who has made our Nation proud.                            ____________________
