 Mr. President, I will shortly ask for unanimous consent  to pass bipartisan legislation to extend the Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standards Program, also known as CFATS. This critical  counterterrorism program was created in the wake of September 11 and  the Oklahoma City bombing to ensure that common chemicals could not be  stolen or weaponized by terrorists and used in an attack.   Now the program is set to expire on July 27, tomorrow, and we simply  cannot let that happen. There are approximately 3,300 facilities across  the United States that participate in this program. These facilities  support a range of industries, from chemical manufacturing and  distribution to agriculture and food production, paint and coatings  operations, and healthcare and pharmaceuticals. In their everyday work,  these facilities use materials that, in the wrong hands, can be turned  into dangerous weapons. Because these types of industrial or  commercially available materials are common and offer a simple pathway  to weaponization, terrorists are more likely to try to use them.   By participating in the CFATS Program, facilities work with the  Department of Homeland Security to develop a plan to ensure potentially  hazardous material is secure. I introduced bipartisan legislation,  along with Senators Capito, Carper, and Lankford, to extend this  important counterterrorism program for 5 years. The 5-year extension  provides regulatory certainty and the stability for the companies and  groups that participate in the program, ensuring that they can keep  these important safeguards in place for longer.   Companies including Dow, BASF, Lubrizol, and Brenntag North America,  along with organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the  American Chemistry Council, the National Association of Chemical  Distributors, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, the  Agricultural Retailers Association, and the Fertilizer Institute--all  of them support extending this vital national security program for  another 5 years.   However, last night, the House passed a 2-year extension with  overwhelming bipartisan support. More than 400 Members of the U.S.  House voted to extend the program. And while I believe passing a longer  extension to provide more certainty for companies and for the DHS would  be better, the program will expire tomorrow, and if we do not pass  legislation to extend it, our national security could be at risk.   If this body allows this program to expire, the 3,300 facilities will  no longer be required to maintain security measures and any new high- risk facilities will not be required to invest in additional  security. The Department of Homeland Security will no longer be able to  assess whether facilities are high risk or share information about  specific terrorist threats connected to chemical facilities. The high- risk chemical facilities would no longer be able to screen individuals  who have access to sensitive areas against the Terrorist Screening  Database, which is a critical way to ensure that we are keeping these  substances from getting into the wrong hands.    Since it was created, CFATS has been extended with bipartisan support  four times. We cannot let this vital program expire. We must take  urgent action to pass this 2-year extension  [[Page S3573]]  that just passed overwhelmingly through the U.S. House and keep the  American people safe from harm.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of H.R. 4470, which was received from the  House, that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I fully appreciate Senator Paul's  commitment to making government more efficient. I was pleased that my  committee advanced his bill earlier this year, but, as I noted at the  time of our passing it out of committee, the bill requires additional  work before it is ready to be passed by the full Senate.   We have heard from several committees that have concerns about the  potential impacts of the legislation. I hope that we can continue  working over the summer to try to address those concerns and find a  path forward for this legislation.   However, the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards Program is  [[Page S3574]]  set to expire tomorrow. We urgently need to pass this bipartisan 2-year  extension now. If we do not, chemical facilities that are at risk of  being exploited by terrorists will no longer be able to implement  critical security measures, including ensuring that individuals in the  terrorist screening database do not have access to restricted areas in  these facilities, and the Department of Homeland Security will no  longer be able to assess or share information about terrorist threats  related to these facilities.   Our national security is on the line, and we cannot let this program  expire over a completely unrelated bill about the inside workings of  Congress.   I object.    Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's commitment to  oversight of taxpayer dollars spent here at home as well as abroad.  Inspectors general are key allies as we work to root out waste and  increase efficiency and make our government work better. The Special  Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has done important  work in Afghanistan.   While I certainly support the goals of this amendment, I have  concerns this provision could ultimately interfere with and divert  resources from the inspectors general at the State Department, the  Defense Department, and USAID who are already overseeing American  support to Ukraine.   While I look forward to working with my colleague to bolster our IGs  and conduct congressional oversight of government spending, I must urge  my colleagues to oppose this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 438
