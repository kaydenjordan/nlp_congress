 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Marc Lee, who was  awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart for his heroic actions on  August 2, 2006, in Ramadi, Iraq. Today, the House will pass my bill,  H.R. 6016, to rename a U.S. Post Office in his honor.   Marc's mother, Debbie Lee, from Surprise, Arizona, in my district,  had the following to say on this momentous occasion:   ``Marc Lee, the first Navy SEAL killed in Iraq, loved deeply and was  deeply loved. He selflessly sacrificed his life to save his teammates.  Naming this post office will keep his legacy alive and remind us to  live lives worthy of their sacrifices.''   It was my honor to introduce this legislation to remember the service  and sacrifice of Marc Lee.                            ____________________
