 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect upon the  career of Ken Duke, a professor in the College of Pharmacy at the  University of Georgia.   Ken has, for 37 years, served our future pharmacists invaluably as  they venture into their careers. Ken has helped develop and foster in  his students a passion for our field that is the distribution of  lifesaving medicines.   Ken graduated from the University of Georgia School of Pharmacy in  1977 and began his career at the University of Georgia in 1985. Since  that time, Ken has tirelessly and selflessly worked to educate and  mentor future pharmacists of America.   Ken's spirit and drive for this occupation is something that he has  instilled in his students for nearly four decades. In the later years  of his career, Ken served as the acting assistant dean for the Pharmacy  College's expansion campus in Savannah, which he helped found.   In his retirement, Ken is excited to be living on the coast and by  the water, as well as spending time in Athens for Georgia football  games and, hopefully, another Georgia National Championship.   Ken's service has been remarkable. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ken and wish  him a blessed retirement.                      Honoring James Mathews Blitch, Sr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Jimmy  Blitch, Sr., a veteran and a remarkable Georgian.   Jimmy was born in Savannah in 1933, the eldest of three children, and  spent most of his early life in the city, eventually moving to  Statesboro to farm Blitch Place, where he found his love for farming.   Jimmy then went on to graduate high school and attend the University  of Georgia at only 15 years old, where he graduated with honors. Most  15-year-olds can barely handle the stress of high school, let alone  college, but Jimmy was not like most people.   Upon graduating, Jimmy entered the U.S. Army as a marksman, spending  his time between Fort Jackson and Fort Benning, eventually being  honorably discharged from the service as a second lieutenant.   After returning to his hometown in Statesboro, Jimmy would meet the  love of his life, Patricia Brannen, getting married in 1958.   They built their lives on Blitch Place Farms, raising three daughters  and a son.   Thankfully, Jimmy was able to see the University of Georgia win their  third National Championship before his passing.   A loving father and husband, an outdoorsman, an honorable veteran,  and fellow Georgia sports fan, Jimmy is sure to be missed.                                time  1030               Recognizing Griff Lynch as Georgian of the Year     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Georgia  Ports Authority Executive Director Griff Lynch for being named Georgia  Trend's 2022 Georgian of the Year.   Griff is a graduate from Maritime College in New York, which led him  to work in the maritime industry for 34 years and eventually our  Georgia  [[Page H337]]  ports. Lynch took the helm of our Nation's busiest ports in Savannah  and Brunswick, and in doing so, has faced some of the hardest  challenges in his career.   With the breakout of COVID-19, the Savannah and Brunswick ports were  hit hard. But it was Lynch's steady hand that steered them through  these turbulent times. If you got your Christmas gifts on time this  year, Griff Lynch probably had something to do with it.   He has overseen multiple expansion and enhancement projects in the  area, allowing our ports to stay ahead of the increasing demand. And  through Lynch's efforts, our ports have seen a 20 percent increase in  volume, meaning nearly 900,000 additional containers are coming to the  area. This means more jobs, innovation, and growth for Georgia's First  District. His experience, guidance, and ability to push the envelope  has made him an excellent leader for our ports and a perfect recipient  of the Georgian of the Year Award.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and hosting tonight. This is extremely important, as we all  know.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to hold this administration accountable,  to hold them accountable for fueling a public health crisis, and it is  not COVID-19.   It is no secret that we are dealing with a serious problem at our  border. As apprehensions spike, so is the availability of fentanyl,  which is largely coming from South and Central America.   Fentanyl is an extremely potent and deadly chemical that is used to  cheaply enhance the highs of other drugs.   Early reports indicate that 2021 was the deadliest year on record for  overdoses in my home State of Georgia. As of April 2021, we experienced  a 110 percent increase in opioid-related deaths, and that number is  expected to climb in 2022.   The neglect at our border has only enabled drug traffickers who wish  to do our people harm and make every State a border State. The Biden  administration's refusal to act on this crisis has resulted in  thousands of lives lost, including children. As a matter of fact, one  of the only things to get cheaper during Joe Biden's term as President  is fentanyl.   I am a proud supporter of the HALT Fentanyl Act, which will  permanently schedule fentanyl and prevent future mothers, fathers,  daughters, and sons from murder at the hands of this lethal drug. The  longer we wait, the more people will die from this poison. The time to  act is now.    We must commit to those Americans whose families have been forever  altered by this administration's unwillingness to even acknowledge the  crisis at our border that is quickly becoming a public health crisis.
