 I thank the chairman for his willingness to work with me  on this important matter. I know we believe that further oversight  needs to be done; however, at this point, the Treasury Department has  been sufficiently cooperative. Accordingly, I am lifting my hold on  Treasury Department nominees.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am lifting my holds on the  nominations of Justin Muzinich, to be Deputy Secretary of the Treasury  and Michael Faulkender to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for  Economic Policy, both of which were reported favorably from the Finance  Committee. I had placed holds on these nominations until the Treasury  Department agreed to provide the Senate Finance Committee with certain  information I had requested in connection with the committee's  oversight of the Treasury Department.   Working with Chairman Hatch, I reached an agreement under which the  Treasury Department has cooperated with the Finance Committee on a  number of my requests.   For these reasons, I will no longer object to any unanimous consent  request concerning the nominations of Mr. Muzinich and Mr. Faulkender.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to  require the Director of National Intelligence to provide the Congress  and the public an assessment of who carried out, participated in,  ordered, or was otherwise complicit in, or responsible for, the murder  of Jamal Khashoggi.   This question is of enormous importance to the Congress and the  American people. Jamal Khashoggi was a journalist. He wrote for the  Washington Post, and he resided in the United States. He visited the  Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, only because he was seeking  documents to get married. But he never came out. The Saudis killed him,  and they covered it up.   Naturally, the American people want to know what happened and who  ordered this assassination. In an interview on November 18, Donald  Trump was asked whether the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Muhammad bin  Salman, lied to him when he denied knowing about Khashoggi's murder.  But Trump's response was simply ``Will anybody really know?''   Those kinds of judgments are what we have an Intelligence Community  for. So I called for CIA Director Gina Haspel and Director of National  Intelligence Dan Coats to come forward and provide a public assessment  of who was responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.  Unfortunately, that did not happen, and Donald Trump only doubled down.  Last Tuesday, he put out a sickening statement in which he made it  clear that he did not care who may have ordered the murder. In a  display of cowardice and weakness, Donald Trump let it be known that  his blind devotion to the Saudis will lead him to abandon American  values, as well as our moral standing in the world.   The reasons behind Donald Trump's embrace of the Saudi dictators at  the expense of American interests, like his affection for President  Putin, are not fully known. In both cases, there are financial  entanglements that demand aggressive and thorough investigation.   And, in both cases, Donald Trump has attempted to muddy the waters by  casting doubts on U.S. intelligence. That is why, in his statement last  Tuesday, he continued to insist that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was  an unsolvable mystery. This is what he said: ``Our intelligence  agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be  that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event--maybe he did  and maybe he didn't!''   Donald Trump no doubt hopes that will be the last word. But Congress  can make sure that it isn't. My legislation requires the Intelligence  Community to provide an unclassified, public assessment about the  killing of Jamal Khashoggi. That assessment, not the predictable  obfuscations of Donald Trump, will then provide the basis on which the  Congress and the American people can move forward after this atrocity.   This intelligence assessment is critical to the debate currently  going on in the Congress about U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia. The  Kingdom's human rights abuses go well beyond the murder of Jamal  Khashoggi. A report last week about the torture of women's rights  activists is just the latest of many years of accounts of abuses  carried out by this autocratic and brutal regime. Many Members of  Congress, including myself, are also deeply concerned about Saudi  Arabia's role in the war in Yemen, which has created almost  unimaginable suffering.   The importance of a public Intelligence Community assessment about  the Khashoggi murder extends beyond Saudi Arabia. If the world's  dictators know that they can kill journalists and American residents,  and Donald Trump will stand in the way of a public accounting, the door  may be open to future murders. Congress must not allow this to happen.  Congress must draw the line. That start with letting the Intelligence  Community speak for itself and allowing the Nation, and the world, to  know what the Intelligence Community assesses actually happened.   Finally, Mr. President, let me address the argument that the  assessments of the Intelligence Community must remain secret. In many  cases, I agree. But, as I've just explained, the questions about this  brutal murder are far too important for Congress and the American  people to accept the cloud of Donald Trump's willful ignorance. In  addition, it is simply unacceptable for Donald Trump to purport to  speak about intelligence matters and for the leaders of the  Intelligence Community to just hide under their desks. The American  taxpayer pays the Intelligence Community over $80 billion a year to  uncover the truth and arrive at objective assessments. If all the  American people get is Donald Trump telling them that everything is  unknowable, then what is the point? This problem has come up in other  contexts, especially with regard to election interference.  Unfortunately, it is not going away. So it is the job of Congress to  insist that the Intelligence Community tell us what they really think.  And, if they won't, then Congress must require it.                                  ______                                         By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Rounds, Ms. Duckworth,          Mr. Heller, and Mr. Peters):   S. 3661.
