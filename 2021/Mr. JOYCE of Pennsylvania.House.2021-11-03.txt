 Madam Speaker, as Congress debates  spending trillions of taxpayer dollars, there is a crisis on our  southern border that is being ignored.   In the past year, our Border Patrol agents have made almost 1.5  million apprehensions, yet we are still seeing that there is a massive  surge in illegal immigration.   The rise in overdose deaths that our country has seen can be directly  tied to the increase in fentanyl that is being smuggled into the United  States through Mexico. Now, at the height of the crisis, we are seeing  reports that the Biden administration wants to pay settlements to  immigrants who enter our country illegally. This is unacceptable.   Now is the time to secure our border and stop the security and  humanitarian crises that this policy has created.   Right now, Congress should be working to address the real and present  danger at our southern border, not debating yet another socialist  spending spree.                            ____________________
