 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and our ranking member,  Mr. Walz, for all the good work for all of our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I rise also in support of the Choice Act and urge my  colleagues to also protect our veterans' access to health care.   Our veterans all gave some, and many, many made the ultimate  sacrifice for our Nation. Providing our vets with the best health care  our Nation can deliver on a timely basis is the least we can do for our  veterans.   Sadly, as all of us know, in 2014, the average wait time at a VA  medical center was 115 days. The Choice Program has provided vets with  the opportunity of obtaining health care in their community on a timely  basis.   The VA, of course, is an excellent institution that takes care of  many, many of our veterans. Yet, when the VA is not available, the  Choice Program can be the best option for our heroes.   No one--no one--should have to wait 3 months to see their doctor,  especially our vets, our heroes. We must meet our commitment one way or  another. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Let's, all of us,  keep the promise this country has made to every one of our veterans.
