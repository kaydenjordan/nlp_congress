 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am a little surprised that someone from Kentucky is  sponsoring this amendment, because if this amendment were to become  law, who would be the biggest loser? It would be the Commonwealth of  Kentucky.   When the Army started developing natural gas under Fort Knox, it did  so without notifying the Department of the Interior, which is the  agency that is responsible for these resources. Now the Defense  Department has admitted that it was a mistake and says that it has  taken steps to prevent this from ever happening again. But we still  know that they are producing gas, and I am glad that they have taken  steps to prevent this in the future.   To my knowledge, that is not the critical issue. The critical issue  is that we have a real problem here. That is, the natural gas that is  under Fort Knox belongs to the American people, not the military, and  royalties are owed to the American people when that gas is sold. As we  know, half of those royalties would go to Kentucky.   For example, in 2014, the Army estimated that it effectively cheated  Kentucky out of $250,000, and now there are 4 more years of cheating  Kentucky and the American people out of their royalties. That number is  probably much larger now than the $250,000 a year.   We have no indication that the Army has paid any of these royalties,  and until we deal with that issue that they are not paying royalties  for the gas that the American people and the people of Kentucky own, we  should not be letting them off the hook.   I would ask the sponsor of the amendment to look closely at this  issue and what his home State stands to lose because of it and then to  reconsider again whether or not he wants this amendment to be adopted.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simply an attempt to waive portions  of our environmental laws for all--and I use the word ``all''--new  mines by pretending that these mines are essential for national  security.   Under this amendment, even sand and gravel--yes, sand and gravel-- would become a critical and strategic mineral. The proponents of this  amendment have argued in the past that sand and gravel are extremely  important when you need to build roads. I will agree with that; it is.  But this is a deliberate distortion of the meaning of what is a  critical mineral.   When it comes to minerals, just because something is important does  not mean that it is critical. When someone is in critical condition in  the hospital, that doesn't simply mean that their condition is  important. It has a specific meaning. The same is true for critical  minerals.   All reputable definitions of critical minerals make it clear that  there must be a risk of losing access to the mineral for it truly to be  called critical. Even the definition from an executive order signed by  President Trump just 5 months ago says that a critical mineral has to  have a supply chain that is vulnerable to disruption.                                time  1500    In the final list of critical minerals identified by the Secretary of  the Interior published just last week, the department states that it  recognizes the economic significance and indispensable nature of  minerals such as sand and gravel. But it also states: `` . . . these  minerals do not currently meet the definition of critical'' because we  are not reliant on imports and we have access here in the United States  to adequate domestic sources.   Simply put, we are not at risk of losing access to our supplies of  sand and gravel, and no foreign government is threatening to close down  our quarries.   We should not be waiving environmental laws for every single mineral  simply because it is important for something.   Supporters of the amendment say a broad definition is needed because  what is and isn't critical changes all the  [[Page H4660]]  time, so we shouldn't tie our hands. But I point out, it only took 4  months for the Interior Department of this administration to publish  their final list of critical minerals, and that is starting from  scratch.   Clearly the existing process is already very quick and very flexible.  There is no need to define everything as critical and weaken  environmental protections for all mines just so a mining company  doesn't have to wait 4 months.   Also, if this amendment looks familiar to many of my colleagues, that  is because it is language that has come out of the Natural Resources  Committee on a party line vote in each of the past four Congresses. In  the past three Congresses it passed the House, again on a party line  vote, only to go nowhere in the Senate.   The reason why it goes nowhere in the Senate is because that body  understands what the definition of a critical and strategic mineral is.  This amendment would have similar luck in the Senate, and it has no  business being added to a defense authorization bill.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
