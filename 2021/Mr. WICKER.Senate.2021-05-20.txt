 Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished  Senator from Oklahoma and the distinguished senior Senator from Alabama  for this amendment. And it seems to me that this is a national security  amendment that should get support on both sides of the aisle because  the Senator from Oklahoma is absolutely correct. It has had bipartisan  support in the past. And particularly at this moment, when we are  talking about a bill to compete with China, we need to acknowledge that  we will compete with China both in the R&D sphere, as this bill  discusses, but also in terms of military might.   And it disturbs me, and I know it is of concern to my friends on the  other side of the aisle, that the Biden administration just this week  announced that they would cut four ships from the most recent  shipbuilding plan, which was established by our military experts, by  the admirals and generals who told us what we need. To cut four ships  from the shipbuilding plan, I think, would send exactly the opposite  signal to China that we are trying to send through this bill. And I  know I have friends on the other side of the aisle, as well as on this  side of the aisle, who have signed the SHIPYARD Act, which makes the  statement, on a bipartisan basis, that we need to be preparing our Navy  for competition in the Pacific that will come from China, and I think  it is a way to preserve peace in the Asia-Pacific region by having  parity there.   So for that particular reason, on this particular week, this is a  most timely and appropriate amendment, and I do hope we can get  bipartisan support.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1523
