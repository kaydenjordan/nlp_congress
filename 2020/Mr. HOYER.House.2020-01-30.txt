 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This is not a resolution to go to war. My friend, the minority  leader, wrote me a letter and implied that it was.   These two bills are about the Constitution and about the awesome  responsibility placed upon the Congress of the United States to  determine whether or not we do go to war. It is not in Article II. It  is in Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution of the United States.   With Democrats as President of the United States and Republicans as  President of the United States, this Congress has too often ceded its  constitutional responsibility to the President of the United States.   The Founders would find that very dangerous. They wanted a cumulative  voice of the American people to make this extraordinary decision to go  to war.   It has been said that the Congresswoman from California, Barbara Lee,  stood as a lone and courageous voice in voting ``no'' when America was  attacked, not because she did not want to defend America, but because  she wanted to ensure that we did so in a thoughtful way and in a  correct way.   It has been said before that nothing in this resolution prevents  America or members of our Armed Forces from defending themselves.   This vote is about the Constitution of the United States. Both votes  are about the Constitution of the United States.   Americans have experienced a generation of war abroad to prevent  terror at home.   Madam Speaker, I was preceded by just a little bit by Mr. Gaetz from  Florida. He and I don't agree on much. We have different perspectives  on policy. But he and I agree on these two bills.   In Afghanistan and Iraq, our troops have fought courageously. Their  families have sacrificed. Their friends and neighbors have waited  anxiously for news of their safe return home. Many, tragically, did not  return. We hold  [[Page H735]]  them in our hearts today as we engage in this critical debate about the  nature of Congress' role in making consequential decisions of war and  peace.   The Founders wanted those of us, particularly in this House, to every  2 years have to go back to our constituents to renew our contract to  represent them. The Founders did that because they wanted us to be in  close touch with the American people, and they wanted the people's  views reflected before any one person took us to war.   Now, the House has already voted on both of these propositions, on  Ms. Lee's bill and on Mr. Khanna's bill. Now, they have presented us  with two amendments.   Last year, during the debate on the National Defense Authorization  Act, they were included and passed by this House.                                time  1200    These are not new propositions. They were approved with bipartisan  support. I don't mean one Republican or two Republicans, or three  Republicans--as my Republican colleagues talk about, well, the  impeachment opposition was bipartisan with one or two; one of whom, of  course, is now a Republican.   But the vote was 27 in one vote and 14 in the other. Fourteen  Republicans voted for Congresswoman Lee's proposition, and they did so  largely on the basis of what Mr. Gaetz from Florida had to say.   In Representative Khanna's amendment, the tally was 251-170. Fourteen  Republicans voted for Ms. Lee's amendment and 27 for Mr. Khanna's  amendment.   Now, Mr. Khanna's resolution is directly related to the Constitution  and Ms. Lee's is directly related to what Mr. Gaetz said. Whether you  agreed or not with what is happening in Iraq, it is over. The  bipartisan votes are a testament to the very strong public sentiment  that sending America's young men and women to war must not be the  decision of the Commander in Chief. And from my perspective, frankly,  certainly not this Commander in Chief who is so impulsive and so  inclined to avoid and deny the advice of his Secretary of Defense and  other intelligence-related personnel.   That is why, as I said earlier, our Founders enshrined in the  Constitution that only Congress can declare war. That is why we have  the War Powers Act that we adopted in 1973. That is why we are having  this debate on the floor today.   I strongly support both the Lee amendment and the Khanna amendment.  The former would repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military  Force in Iraq which was meant to enable, as Mr. Gaetz so powerfully  said, the removal of Saddam Hussein. He is gone. We are not at war with  Iraq.   Sadly, that resolution is being used some 18 years later as rationale  for doing something not against Iraq, not against Saddam Hussein--who  we all know is dead--but for something else. The something else needs  to be approved by this Congress unless it is a defensive action, again,  which is provided for.   The latter would prohibit the Trump administration from using Federal  funds without congressional authorization to strike Iran in the absence  of an imminent threat. ``In the absence of an imminent threat'' is the  key language.   This is not about retreat. This is not about exposing us to danger.  It is carrying out the strictures of the Constitution of the United  States. Let me make this point clear: Nowhere in this bill do we take  funding away from the military or say that our forces cannot defend  themselves. We include clear language to ensure that if an imminent  threat presents itself, our forces can strike and respond to that  threat.   I am proud that so many Democratic Members of the House are veterans  who know what it means to serve at the point of the spear. Mr. Brown,  my colleague from Maryland, just spoke. He was one of those. Many of  our freshmen served in the military during the Iraq and Afghanistan  conflicts and are working hard to make sure that our Democratic House  majority always keeps faith with those in uniform and our veterans.   They have been instrumental in helping to shape our policies in a way  that is smart, strategic and strengthens our national security.   Let me also say that Iran remains a dangerous enemy. I doubt that  there is a person on this floor who disagrees with that. No one is  suggesting taking our eye off Iran and its malevolent behavior, and no  one is mourning the loss of Soleimani. That is not the issue.   The issue is, as I said at the beginning, the Constitution. That is  why Congress needs to take action now to make it clear that the  President does not have the unilateral authority to take America into  another costly war in the Middle East or anywhere else.   We passed the War Powers Resolution on a bipartisan basis earlier  this month. This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue of standing  up for the Article I branch of government, the Congress of the United  States, who represent the people. We call this the people's House, and  the Founders wanted the people to make this decision.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative Lee and Representative  Khanna, as well as all of those who have been involved in this effort,  for bringing these two propositions to the floor of the House.   I urge each and every one of my colleagues to vote for these bills. I  also hope that those who voted with the Khanna amendment, 27  Republicans, stick with their principles; stick with their commitment  to the Constitution; stick with the separation of powers; stick with  the awesome responsibility of this House, representing the people, to  be the ones that make that terribly hard decision to send our people to  war.   I hope that the 14 who voted for the Lee amendment stick with their  principles to rationally say: Iraq is over. It is gone. The resolution  of authorization is 18 years old. It is time for us to look anew, think  anew, and act anew as the circumstances require.   I thank Ms. Lee and Mr. Khanna. Let us pass these two amendments.  That is what our Founders would want us to do.    Madam Speaker, there is no sham here. We have debated this  proposition. This is the second time we have debated it, and it has  passed twice. There is no sham here.   I will talk about the MTR sham that you are arguing about at a later  time. But this is on the merits of whether or not you believe the  Congress of the United States ought to be making these decisions. Don't  hide behind some sham argument about MTRs. We will get to that.
