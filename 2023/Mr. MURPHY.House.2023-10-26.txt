 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor those servicemembers  whose lives were taken in the tragic Beirut bombing 40 years ago.   On October 23, 1983, 2 suicide bombers took the lives of 220 marines,  18 sailors, and 3 soldiers at the marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon,  wounding another 128 Americans.   A few minutes later, in a coordinated attack, another suicide bomber  blew up the French barracks about 4 miles away, killing 58 French  paratroopers.   On Monday, my good friend Congressman   Greg Pence--who had been  stationed in these barracks not a week prior to the attack--and I  attended the 40th anniversary memorial service in my district, in  Jacksonville, North Carolina.   Jacksonville is home to the world renowned Camp Lejeune, for which  the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit deployed to Beirut under the direction  of President Ronald Reagan.   Their mission was a peacekeeping one. Today, etched in the stone of  the Beirut Memorial in Jacksonville is a line that reads: ``They came  in peace.''   Eastern North Carolina continues to grief today for the loss of life  and the loss of loved ones in the devastating attack 40 years ago.   Mr. Speaker, in honor of these fallen heroes, I ask that the House  observe a moment of silence.                            ____________________
