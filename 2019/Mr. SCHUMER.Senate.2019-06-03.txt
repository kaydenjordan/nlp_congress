 Mr. President, it is with great sadness that last week  we learned of the death of our friend and former colleague, Thad  Cochran from Mississippi.   In nearly 40 years in office, Thad served with a fierceness and  loyalty to Mississippi matched only by his sense of dignity and respect  for his colleagues.   When his issues were on the line, Senator Cochran fought for  Mississippi as hard as any Senator. He nurtured Mississippi's  universities, schools, farms, hospitals, ports, and fishing industry.  He was a champion of the poor and gave a voice to rural communities by  expanding assistance for southern farmers. Perhaps it is fitting that  he was first bitten by the political bug in his run for head  cheerleader at Ole Miss because throughout his career and throughout  his life, Thad never stopped being a cheerleader for Mississippi.   One thing I will never forget was Senator Cochran's graciousness  after my State was hit by Hurricane Sandy. He knew, from his experience  after Hurricane Katrina, just how devastating the damage can be and how  difficult the recovery process can seem in the aftermath of a disaster.  At a time when many of his colleagues who always voted for their  regions but opposed Sandy because it was New York, Senator Cochran not  only supported it but even made sure his team was available to give us  guidance. I will never forget that. That is the kind of gentleman and  fair-minded individual he was--something missing a lot around here.   In many ways, Thad Cochran was a model Senator. He understood this  body's preference for cooperation, compromise, and congeniality almost  intuitively. Even as the Senate has gone further away from those  values, Senator Cochran held them close. That is just who he was. It  made him a better Senator and a better man. We will miss him. I think  all of us will. Our prayers go out today to his wife, Kay, his  children, his loved ones, and his many friends.                              Background Checks    Mr. President, on background checks, last Friday, another horrible  mass shooting transformed a peaceful community in America into a place  of tragedy. In Virginia Beach, a dozen people were killed, several  others critically wounded, and thousands of Virginians left to mourn  and pick up the pieces.   Today we grieve with the people of Virginia Beach, and we send our  thanks to the brave police men and women who risked their lives to  protect their neighbors. These tragedies leave scars that never go away  on community after community that has suffered from it.   It has been less than a month since I spoke on the Senate floor after  a shooting. That is the tragedy. It is less than 1 month that I had to  come to the floor and speak on the tragedy of one shooting, and now we  have another. The list of national tragedies is already too long. The  names and places of mass  [[Page S3146]]  shootings and the victims of everyday gun violence are already too  many--far too many to count.   So it is time, long past time to bring a bill to improve gun safety  to the floor of the Senate. The House has already passed a bill to  close loopholes in our background check system. It is common sense. It  is bipartisan. More than 90 percent of Americans support closing these  loopholes, including a majority of Republicans and a majority of gun  owners. It is hard to defend the desire of felons, spousal abusers, and  those adjudicated mentally ill to get firearms. In fact, those who  oppose this kind of legislation don't defend it. They sort of slink  away and hide figuratively, if not literally, under their desks on the  Senate floor.   Why will Leader McConnell not allow background checks to get a vote  or even a debate in the Senate? Why has Leader McConnell added this  bipartisan legislation, that has already passed the House, to his  legislative graveyard?   For too long, the gun lobby has reflexively opposed any gun safety  reforms--the most benign and commonsense reforms like closing loopholes  in our background checks--and for too long the Republican majority has  marched in lockstep with them against the will of the American people  and against the safety of the American people.   It is time for that to change. Leader McConnell should call a vote on  universal background checks now. Nobody pretends it will stop every  shooting, but if it could prevent even one more from happening, it  deserves our consideration. Let's not delay any longer. Let's not cower  before the NRA. Let's do the right thing that 90 percent of Americans  want us to do.                              Election Security    Mr. President, there is no principle more essential to democracy than  the principle of free and fair elections. It is the very wellspring of  our democracy. It is what the people at Bunker Hill, the farmers, put  down their plows and took up muskets for--no taxation without  representation, voting. Over the past 3 years, we have been reminded  again and again how that very sacred wellspring of democracy, voting  and fair elections, were attacked by a foreign power.   Mr. Mueller's press conference last week was only the latest reminder  of the concerted campaign by Moscow to influence our elections in 2016.  It was also a reminder of how much we have yet to do to secure our  elections in the future. We included some--some only--but some funding  for election security in last year's budget, but we have been blocked  so far from providing much needed additional support in this year's  budget.   We have bipartisan legislation to harden election infrastructure and  sanction any foreign power that tries to interfere in our elections.  That legislation is ready to go, but, once again, Mitch McConnell,  self-described Grim Reaper, has refused to take it up--another  tombstone in his legislative graveyard.   At the very least, the Senate should be briefed by our intelligence  and law enforcement chiefs about the threat of election interference in  the 2020 election so we can all be aware of the danger that FBI  Director Wray already has pointed out.   On that front, I have some positive news. I have spoken to the  Republican leader about that request. He has assured me we will have a  briefing. We are still trying to sort out the timing of the briefing,  but I urge that it take place as soon as possible during this work  period so we can prepare new legislation that will go into effect at  least a year before election day of 2020. By no means does a briefing  replace all the other things we must do to protect our elections. It is  necessary but not nearly sufficient. I hope when people go to this  briefing, Members, Democrats and Republicans, they will see the danger  and act.   How can we sit by? We are a great power. To sit by with our arms  folded, while Russia or China or Iran or some other country, North  Korea, tries to interfere in our elections--that is not what a great  power does. It protects itself and its people, especially when it comes  to something so vital as elections.   I hope we have this briefing quickly. I hope it reignites a desire on  both sides of the aisle to move legislation, increase funding, and do  what is necessary to protect our democracy.                               Border Security    Mr. President, on the border, since the outset, the Trump  administration's policy at our southern border has been chaotic,  ineffective and, in many cases, inhumane. One of the most fundamentally  misguided elements of the Trump administration's policy is how it has  approached the root causes of the migration because, while the  President complains loudly about the number of refugees and migrants at  our border, his administration has made a few of the root causes of  this migration more severe.   One of the principal ways we could address the surge on migrants is  by helping improve conditions in their own countries. Most of them are  fleeing violence or a huge economic hardship, so they feel it is better  to travel thousands of miles of dangers, maybe in the hands of coyotes,  than stay home. By cracking down on gang violence and drug trafficking  back in their home countries, we could reduce the flow of immigrants at  our southern border.   No one can understand--so confounded--why, in late March, the  President announced he would be cutting off security assistance to  Central American countries to address these very issues. The President  cut his nose to spite his face. He made the problem worse by cutting  off these dollars.   The administration has provided virtually no information about the  rationale for these cuts--$450 million. It is a completely self- inflicted wound to our national security that makes the problem the  President complains about worse, not better. It is almost as if the  President is intentionally trying to add fuel to the fire, to fabricate  a crisis, and to create, post hoc, a justification for a baseless  emergency declaration he made months ago.   I don't think many Americans would say cutting funding to help  Central American countries stop migration is a responsible policy, and  that is why we Democrats have proposed just the opposite. We propose to  actually get at the root cause of migration by allowing asylum seekers  to apply for asylum in their home countries, not at our southern  border, by increasing the number of judges to process the cases at the  border, and by helping Central American countries crack down on gang  violence in the city's drug cartels. In fact, our bill authorizes $1.5  billion in security assistance to the Northern Triangle to do just  that, far and above what the administration has just cut.   The policies the administration pursues make no sense whatsoever.  They seem vindictive, they seem done at the moment, and they seem  totally not thought through. We are proposing policies that will  address the real issues here, and Democrats will push for them in any  legislation that deals with border policy.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
