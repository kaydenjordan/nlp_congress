 Mr. President, a little bit later this afternoon, I am  going to be offering a motion to instruct conferees in connection with  the tax bill that may be one of the most simple, straightforward  motions ever offered in this body.   I will read it in its entirety: We move that the managers on the part  of the Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two  Houses on the bill, H.R. 1, be instructed to insist that the final  conference report not increase the Federal budget deficit for the  period of the fiscal years 2018 through 2027.   It could not be more straightforward: Don't increase the budget  deficit. Why? This chart basically tells the story.   We are headed, literally, into uncharted territory with regard to our  national debt. It is a threat to this country. It is a threat to our  national security. It is a threat to every man, woman, and, especially,  to every child, because they are the people who are going to have to  pay this debt.   This is the history of our debt, in constant dollars, going all the  way back to the Revolutionary War, and it tells a very powerful story.   At the very beginning of our country, in 1790, we incurred a big  piece of debt to pay for the Revolutionary War. They paid it off. There  was another mountain of debt to pay for the Civil War. It was paid off.  The debt goes up again to pay for World War I, and it was paid off.  Then it goes up for the Great Depression and then to a peak in World  War II.   What happened after World War II?   As we all know, World War II was fought--our country was defended,  and victory was achieved--by something that has been called the  ``greatest generation,'' and the ``greatest generation'' paid its  bills. It paid off the debt from World War II. It went down in the  seventies and then back up again in the eighties. Here is where we are  today. The bill that was passed in the dead of night, early on Saturday  morning, adds $1.5 trillion to that debt--$1.5 trillion.   We are adding to the debt at a time of low unemployment, enormous  growth in the stock market, and a relatively strong economy. It is not  perfect, by any means, but compared to where we were 5 or 6 years ago,  we are in positive territory on the economy. That is when you should  pay down debt, not add to it unnecessarily.   If we were in a crisis, if we were in a recession, if we were in a  conflict that required immediate mobilization, that is when you would  want to add to the debt. That is what you borrow for. We are borrowing  to pay park rangers' salaries, and we are borrowing to pay for the  ordinary operation of government. Now we are borrowing to give major  tax cuts during a time of relatively positive economic growth. I know  that it is not as high as it should be and as high as we want it to be,  but this bill we passed, which is going to add to the debt, is not  going to do much of anything to assist us with growth.   The analysis of the Joint Committee on Taxation is that it will add  eight-tenths of 1 percent to GDP growth in 10 years. That is almost  immeasurable. It doesn't come close, by the way, for paying for itself.  It doesn't come close--maybe 15 or 20 percent. By the way, that is an  interesting number because all of the studies that I have seen about  tax cuts and their effects on economic growth indicate that they do  about 20 percent of their cost. The other 80 percent is eaten by our  kids.   It is unethical what we are doing. If 5-year-olds knew what we were  doing and could vote, we would all be out of a job because they are the  ones who are going to have to pay this bill. You see this mountain  climbing, and it doesn't take a lot of imagination to see that we are  going to be higher than at World War II in a matter of a few years,  added to by this bill that we just passed the other night. It is  unconscionable. It is unnecessary.   If, indeed, we were going to expand the economy by 3 or 4 percent a  year and everybody were to say that that was what we were going for,  then, maybe--OK?--3 percent a year times 10 is 30 percent growth. We  are talking about eight-tenths of 1 percent over 10 years--not per  year, over 10 years. My motion is very, very simple: Don't come back  with a bill that adds to the deficit.   There are lots of ways that we can do tax reform. There are lots of  ways that we can cut corporate taxes and make ourselves more  competitive. We can do offshore tax cuts. There is a lot of ability to  do this without hammering the deficit. In fact, I understand that, as  of this morning, we improved the finances of this bill by mistake to  the tune of $389 billion--a mistake in the bill that we passed--because  we did it so fast that nobody knew what was in it. I have a new rule.  The faster a bill goes through the Congress, the worse it is, and I  think that is what we have seen in this case.   We can deal with tax reform. We can increase our competitiveness. We  can get our taxes aligned, particularly our business taxes, with the  rest of the world without loading this debt onto our children. A tax  cut, when all you are doing is borrowing to fill the hole, is not a  cut. It is a shift of the tax from you to your kids.   You are on your deathbed. You are lying there, and you say to your  children: Come on over. I will give you my last words.   They go over, and they are listening. They want wisdom.   What you say is this: Here is the credit card. We had a great trip to  Acapulco. You can pay for it.   That is not responsible. Nobody would do that. Yet that is exactly  what we are doing in this bill. It is wrong, and it is not necessary.   I think one of the questions that we are going to have to ask and  answer and that we are going to see--it is going to play out--is what  companies are going to do with this newfound income when the taxes are  cut dramatically from 35 percent to 20 percent. Is that money going to  go into new plants and equipment? Is it going to go into wages? Is it  going to increase people's wages and productivity? Is it going to go  into stock buybacks, which raise the values of the stocks? That is  great for the owners, but it doesn't do a thing for the workers, and it  doesn't do much for the U.S. economy.   Again, my motion could not be more straightforward and simple: Work  on the tax bill in conference, but I think that you are going to have a  hard time making a good bill out of it. Whatever you do, come back with  something that is deficit-neutral. By the way, that is where this  discussion started.   Last January, the leadership in both Houses and in both parties was  talking about deficit-neutral tax reform. Somewhere along the way, it  became: Let's break the bank; let's add new debt for our kids; let's  create a situation in which we are not going to have any slack when we  need it. No business would run this way, and it is wrong for us to try  to run the country this way.   I am going to make this motion. Many of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle have been talking to me and to the country for years about  the dangers of the deficit. Suddenly, I predict, if this bill becomes  law, at about the time the ink is dry, they are going to say: Oh, my  Lord. We have a deficit. Look at that. I didn't know that. We are going  to have to cut spending. We are going to have to cut Medicare,  Medicaid, and Social Security because we have this huge deficit.   We don't have to add to it and make it worse in this tax bill.   That is what is really bothering me, because the very people who have  been talking to me and to whom I have been listening for 20 years about  how serious the deficit is, I was fool enough to believe. I think it is  a serious problem, and I think we need to address it, but this is the  opposite of addressing it. We are making it worse at the very time that  we should be talking about paying down the debt, not adding to it.   We can do better. The American people expect more of us. We can do  better, and I believe and deeply hope that we will come to our senses  and do better in connection with this bill.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.  [[Page S7878]]         Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Maine [Mr. KING] moves that the managers       on the part of the Senate at the conference on the       disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the bill H.R. 1 be       instructed to insist that the final conference report not       increase the Federal budget deficit for the period of fiscal       years 2018 through 2027.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2  minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on the motion.   The Senator from Maine.    Mr. President, this could not be a more simple motion. It  simply says to the conferees to bring us back a tax bill that is  deficit-neutral. It can be done. It should be done.   We are in a period now where we have no business adding to the  Federal deficit. We know this bill will add at least $1 trillion to the  deficit--probably more--if the middle-class tax cuts are extended, as  everyone expects they will be. This is a burden we are placing on our  children and our grandchildren. We are giving ourselves a tax cut and  letting them pay for it. I believe that is wrong. It is bad policy.   We are also utilizing whatever slack we have, as far as debt goes,  now, when we are in relatively good times, and we will not have it  available when we have a problem, such as a recession or some kind of-- heaven forbid--attack on our country.   The motion is very simple. This is a time when we should be paying  down debt and not adding to it. If our children--if our 5-year-olds-- knew what we were doing in this bill and could vote, we would be out of  a job.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.   The Senator from Texas.  [[Page S7879]]
