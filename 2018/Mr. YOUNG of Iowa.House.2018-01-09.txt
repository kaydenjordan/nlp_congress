 Madam Speaker, I rise today again to call on my  colleagues to quickly pass a 5-year extension of the Children's Health  Insurance Program. Around 85,000 Iowa children rely on CHIP for their  health. If we don't act, families and children will suffer.   This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue, and we must pass  a solution together. Families should not be worried about losing  coverage for their children.   And the fact that this Congress cannot muster the ability to pass a  long-term extension of CHIP is confounding, to say the least.   We must quickly set aside any political games, come to the table, and  work together to pass a long-term CHIP funding bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to set aside any political games  or partisan brinksmanship and come together and fully fund CHIP. The  health of our children is at stake.                            ____________________
