 Mr. President, I am informed that it is necessary for me to  insert into the Record of the proceedings the resignation letter that I  sent to Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona on December 12, 2018; therefore,  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at  this point.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                                  December 12, 2018.       Hon. Doug Ducey,       Governor of the State of Arizona,       Phoenix, Arizona.         Dear Governor Ducey: Thank you again for appointing me to       the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy created by John McCain's       death. It has been an honor and a privilege to again serve       the people of Arizona.         When I accepted your appointment, I agreed to complete the       work of the 115th Congress and then reevaluate continuing to       serve. I have concluded that it would be best if I resign so       that your new appointee can begin the new term with all other       Senators in January 2019 and can serve a full two       (potentially four) years.         Therefore, I will resign from the U.S. Senate effective       11:59 pm EST December 31, 2018.            Respectfully,                                                           Jon Kyl,      United States Senator.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the other thing I would like to do this  afternoon is to very briefly report to my colleagues and to  constituents back home on some things which my predecessor, Senator  McCain, was working on at the time of his untimely death and which his  staff and I have continued to work on and, in several cases, have  brought to successful conclusion. I want people to know about these  items and what we have been able to accomplish.   I first want to thank the members of his staff who wanted to stay in  the service of the government and the State of Arizona and were willing  to take a position in my office, as a result of which, we were able to  really have a seamless transition from some of the things Senator  McCain was working on and my ability to continue to do so.   One of the first things of which I was aware but not really aware of  the depth that he had taken it is a new relationship in the State of  Arizona among the three pillars representing the defense establishment  in our country and specifically in the State of Arizona. These are,  first of all, our military installations--Arizona is blessed to have a  lot of military installations; secondly, the defense industries--again,  Arizona is the home to many important defense industries serving all of  our branches of the military; and finally, the communities that support  both of those elements of our establishment.   As a result, I had the opportunity to meet throughout the State with  the groups that Senator McCain had helped to nurture and to create--in  particular, a group in Tucson and Southern Arizona, including Yuma,  called the Southern Arizona Defense Alliance; in Flagstaff and Northern  Arizona, the Northern Arizona Military Affairs Council; and in Central  Arizona, Maricopa County and the Phoenix environs, the Mesa Industry  and Defense Council.   Meeting with the representatives of all three components of our  military society and hearing about the successes they had in working  with each other and in providing a real synergy that benefited them all  just reminded me again of how important Senator McCain's leadership was  to the State of Arizona and to our national security.   I wanted to mention that today and to let everyone know that I will  be passing on to my successor the advice that these councils continue  to need to be supported and nurtured by the Senators from the State of  Arizona, as well as the Members of the House of Representatives.   A second thing that John McCain was involved in as part of his  activities as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee was the  creation--a couple years ago--in the Defense authorization bill of a  national commission to advise the Secretary of Defense on the strategy  for the United States and to report back to Congress--and specifically  the Armed Services Committee--on their conclusions.   This bill created the National Defense Strategy Commission, comprised  of 12 members, 3 of whom were appointed by the chairman and the ranking  member--each--of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House  Armed Services Committee.   I was privileged to have been appointed by Senator McCain to serve on  that Commission, and I did for approximately a year. My service there  ended as we finished our report. Before it was signed, while it was  still being edited, he passed away, and I was appointed to serve in his  stead. So I have had the unique opportunity to both help write the  report and then be a member of the Armed Services Committee, on which  he sat, to receive the report and to question the cochairmen of that  Commission, Ambassador Eric Edelman and ADM Gary Roughead, Retired.   I think the importance of this Commission report reflects what  Senator McCain hoped to achieve, and that is a bipartisan consensus, a  unanimous report which provides advice to the Secretary of Defense and  will provide advice to both the House and the Senate.   As I said, there has already been a hearing before the Senate Armed  Services Committee, and I know the House  [[Page S7853]]  committee is going to invite members of the Commission to brief it as  well.   It is my hope that the recommendations of this bipartisan Commission  will be followed by the Congress and by the President and the Secretary  of Defense because I think they represent some very strong conclusions  about what is necessary to enhance our national security.   A third thing Senator McCain wanted to do as chairman of the Armed  Services Committee was to hold a series of hearings or briefings before  the committee that focused on the advances in technology that were  having and can have an important impact on our national security--in  many cases, on the kinds of things that we acquire in support of our  military superiority, things like hypersonics and artificial  intelligence, super-advanced computing, cyber technology, and the like.   After speaking with the chairman of the Senate Armed Services  Committee now, Senator Inhofe, it is my understanding that he, in fact,  has a plan to carry out this legacy of Senator McCain and hold a series  of briefings early next year on all of these technological issues so  that our Members will be better able to evaluate the kinds of things  that will help our military have superiority in the future. I am happy  to have had some small part to play in advancing that.   There were a couple of other more specific things that Senator McCain  didn't work on but which bear his name that I wanted to mention.   One, I cosponsored and helped secure passage of S. 2827, which was a  bill to reauthorize the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation  at the University of Arizona. This was something that Senator McCain  helped to create and to foster throughout his career. But I am also  pleased to announce that this legislation names the foundation's  environmental conflict resolution center after the late Senator John  McCain. I am pleased to make that announcement here.   There is one other item that we are continuing to try to accomplish  in Senator McCain's name. We are not across the finish line yet, but we  hope to get there. That is something called the 21st Century  Conservation Service Corps Act, S. 1403. This bill carries the name of  Senator McCain, and it was one of his favorite projects. It expands  volunteerism in our national parks and public lands.   I can tell you that while John McCain came to Arizona having lived in  many other places of the world and in the United States, primarily as a  result of his service in the Navy, he acquired a love for the State of  Arizona which is unequalled among all of us who have been there for a  very long time. He loved the beauty of the State, the ruggedness of it,  the incredible variety in the flora and fauna. When I would visit John  and Cindy's home in the Sedona area, I could always count on being  taken on a hike around the perimeter of the property to show me all of  the interesting things he had discovered over the last several months,  including where the hawks live and where the owls live and where they  found the rattlesnakes and all of the other things that pleased him to  be a part of that environment.   So we are hopeful that we can get this Service Corps Act passed, if  not in the latter part of this session, at least perhaps early next  year.   I want my colleagues to know that although Senator McCain passed away  in the early part of his Senate term, he was working on a lot of things  that his staff and I wanted to continue to move forward, and I am just  pleased we have been able to move these items forward and wanted my  colleagues to appreciate that, as well as his friends and constituents  in the State of Arizona.   I thank my colleagues here who helped to make some of these things  possible and urge that they continue to focus on the one item of  unfinished business that can perhaps be accomplished next year.   I conclude by thanking the Governor of the State of Arizona for  appointing me to serve for part of the remainder of Senator McCain's  term. It has been a great honor and privilege for me to again serve the  people of the State of Arizona, particularly to succeed my friend and  colleague John McCain.   I yield the floor.
