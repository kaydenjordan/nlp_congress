 Mr. President, this week, the Democrats are forcing yet  another show vote on the so-called voting rights legislation. They  claim the right to vote is under attack by the States, and there is  nothing that could be further from the truth.   Ahead of the 2020 elections, everyone from Vice President Kamala  Harris to Eric Holder to Stacey Abrams claimed that they were  experiencing a wave of voter suppression. Now, that is very  significant--a wave of voter suppression, as if they have to do  something to change our system.  [[Page S186]]    And the facts are so clear on that. You know, people lie around here,  but the facts don't lie. The Census Bureau reported that the turnout in  last year's election was 66.8 percent. Now, that was the highest voter  turnout of the 21st century, and that turnout was higher across all  demographics, as well as including minorities.   More than 90 percent of Americans think it is easy to vote. More than  a third of them think the rules should be more stringent than they are  today, and there is a good argument for that. But that argument is  prevailing right now.   So once you see that the Democrats' Big Lie of rampant voter  suppression is clearly false, why are they pushing this election  takeover bill? They want to nationalize elections, putting the Federal  Government in charge of something that the Constitution clearly says  belongs to the State.   And just a few examples of what the bill would do: It would line the  pockets of candidates with taxpayer dollars in order to run for office.  It would restrict commonsense voter ID, supported by over 75 percent of  the Americans, and mandate mail-in ballots and allow ballot  trafficking--trafficking, that is when the unsupervised political  operatives collect and submit absentee ballots--and it would make  election day a Federal holiday, costing somewhere close to $1 billion  each time that it would be used.   Now, you don't have to take my word for it on how radical this is.  Oklahoma's election board secretary--keep in mind, as in most States,  it is nonpolitical, nonpartisan in any way, and the guy's name is Paul  Ziriax. He has called Schumer's legislation a ``recipe for chaos.''   Democrats can feel the American people turning against their agenda.  And so they are desperate to rig elections in their favor, and they  will do so by whatever means necessary--even killing rules that make  the Senate the Senate.   This would poison bipartisan compromise in the Senate forever. My  Democratic colleagues want you to forget that they were for the  filibuster before they were against it. Just 5 years ago, 33 Senate  Democrats, including then-Senator Harris, penned a letter demanding  that we defend and retain it forever. So they were demanding that we  retain the filibuster. But now they changed their mind, which means  that they either have amnesia or that they see an opportunity to force  their radical agenda on the American families.   If Democrats get their way on the filibuster, they won't stop taking  over our elections. They will also pass their Green New Deal, their  abortion on demand, amnesty, and pack the Supreme Court with activists  to uphold their unconstitutional agenda.   I want to close by sharing a comment on the filibuster. The quote is  this:         Getting rid of the filibuster has long-term consequences.       If there's one thing that I have learned in my years here,       once you change the rules and surrender the Senate's       institutional power, you never get it back.    Now, I didn't say that. That was said by President Joe Biden. He said  it just in those words, and that might be the first time that we agree  on something.   Likewise, Senator Schumer also said that getting rid of the  legislative filibuster would be ``doomsday for democracy.'' And I  happen to agree with him on that, too.   I have served the people of Oklahoma in the Senate longer than anyone  in history, and I feel strongly that the one thing that has protected  our democratic Republic and ensured bipartisanship more than any other  single thing is the Senate's protection of the voice of the minority.   That is what we are famous for. There is no one else that has that as  a function to do it, and yet I am seeing some of the things that are  going on right now.   President Biden said--keep this in mind--back in 2005: We have got to  keep the filibuster.   Then in 2021, just the other day, he said: We have got to kill the  filibuster.   He said that yesterday.   Senator Schumer, back in 2005, said killing the filibuster will be  ``doomsday for democracy,'' and now Schumer wants to kill the  filibuster.   Senator Coons said, back in 2018: ``I am committed to never voting to  change the legislative filibuster.'' And now he is supporting killing  the filibuster.   Senator Klobuchar, back in 2017, said: ``Let's keep that 60-vote  threshold in place,'' which is the filibuster.   And now she said, just a few days ago: ``I would personally get rid  of the filibuster.''   So here is what we are faced with: We know what is right, and we know  what is wrong. It is very clear. Yet they are desperately trying to  take a position that they have had for a long period of time. So we  will continue to protect it. Both the President and Senator Schumer are  trying to kill the filibuster, and we are not going to let that happen.
