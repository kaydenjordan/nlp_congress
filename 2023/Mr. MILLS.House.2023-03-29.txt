 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower  Energy Costs Act.   Under the Biden administration, American families are facing  skyrocketing bills and rising costs of everyday goods.   I see this and experience this every day as I talk to the  constituents of Florida's Seventh District. By no fault of their own,  they are struggling to put food on the table, gas in their cars, and to  pay their bills.   I thank our leadership and I thank Speaker McCarthy for bringing this  important piece of legislation to the floor to help ease the burden  many Americans feel by lowering costs.   Not only will H.R. 1 lower energy costs, but it will also streamline  our energy infrastructure and make us more competitive on the global  stage as we are losing and being outpaced by adversarial nations, such  as China and Russia.   President Biden has waged a war, but not on our adversaries, on  American energy, and he has made us more reliant on the adversarial  nations I mentioned before, Russia and China.   This administration has made us dependent upon our aggressors and  weaker than ever, but no more. This legislation will get us one step  closer to becoming energy independent and then dominant by increasing  exports of American energy. It is time to restore our position on the  world stage and ease the burden on every American family.   I thank you so much for this opportunity. I am in strong, strong  support of this.
