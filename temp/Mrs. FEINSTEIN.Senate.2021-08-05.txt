 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  ``Preventing Harmful Exposure to Phthalates Act.'' This bill would ban  harmful chemicals known as phthalates from products used in food  processing and packaging and would require the Food and Drug  Administration to review other products under its purview that might  also expose Americans to harmful phthalates.   The harm associated with phthalate exposure is well-documented, with  studies showing that prenatal exposure to these chemicals can have  lasting consequences to child brain development and increase children's  risks for learning, attention, and behavioral disorders.   We also know that women are disproportionately affected by phthalates  through higher exposure to these harmful chemicals in personal care  products, like nail polish, fragrances, and hair products, as compared  to men.   Pregnant women's exposure to phthalates has been shown to decrease  fetal testosterone and harm reproductive development in male babies.  Black and Latina women are also disproportionately affected,  experiencing higher exposure to certain phthalates compared to white  women.   Studies have demonstrated that Americans are exposed to phthalates  through our diet. Phthalates from production materials involved in food  processing and packaging are able to leach into our food. These  materials include plastic equipment such as tubing used in commercial  dairy operations, lid gaskets, food preparation gloves, conveyor belts,  and food packaging materials.   People are also exposed to phthalates found in medical devices,  flooring, and other home furnishing and building materials. The fact  that phthalate exposure often comes from multiple sources  simultaneously further emphasizes the unknown collective health risk  that these harmful chemicals pose.   We must remove these harmful chemicals from consumer products with  the utmost urgency. Congress has already banned them from children's  toys and child care products due to the serious long-term health  effects that they pose. We now need to remove them from our food  packaging and the other remaining consumer products that are slowly  poisoning us.   The ``Preventing Harmful Exposure to Phthalates Act'' would  specifically ban phthalates from being used in materials that touch  food and ensure that any substance used as a replacement is safe.   The bill would also require a review of other products to determine  whether they lead to phthalate exposure. This review would need to  include consideration of whether communities of color are  disproportionately exposed to these harmful products as well as the  health effects caused by exposure and any increased risk of preterm  birth, low birth weight, or other risks to children's health.   I want to thank Senator Gillibrand for joining me in introducing this  important legislation, as well as Representatives Lieu and Porter, who  are sponsoring companion legislation in the House.   I also want to thank the health and consumer safety organizations for  their support for this bill, including the American Academy of  Pediatrics, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Breast  Cancer Prevention Partners, Earthjustice, Endocrine Society,  Environmental Working Group, Healthy Babies Bright Futures, and Project  TENDR.   Families deserve to know that the products they're consuming aren't  exposing them to unnecessary harm. I look forward to working with my  colleagues on this important issue, and I urge my fellow Senators to  cosponsor the ``Preventing Harmful Exposure to Phthalates Act.''   Thank you Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER:   S. 2670. A bill to provide for redistricting reform, and for other  purposes.
