 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to call out the mischaracterization of  H.R. 986. The misleading title of this bill confirms the Democratic  majority's position to score political points instead of governing.  They claim their agenda is ``for the people.'' Well, this bill is ``for  the politics.''   So let me be clear. This bill has nothing to do with protecting  Americans with preexisting conditions. This bill has everything to do  with eliminating healthcare options that would be affordable for  Americans who can't afford health insurance today and choices for  States.   Section 1332 waivers were first enacted under ObamaCare to provide  States the opportunity to innovate and to provide their residents with  affordable health insurance options. The Trump administration has  simply updated the guidance for these 1332 ObamaCare waivers to make it  easier for a State's plan to be approved.   This guidance does not--I repeat, does not--permit the Secretary to  waive preexisting condition protections.   But, don't take my word for it alone. CMS Administrator Seema Verma  confirmed it yesterday, in writing. ``To be very clear, the 2018  guidance does nothing to erode PPACA's preexisting condition  provisions, which cannot be waived under section 1332,'' wrote  Administrator Verma.                                time  1415    She went on to explain: ``Section 1332 does not permit States to  waive Public Health Service Act requirements such as guaranteed  availability and renewability of health insurance, the prohibition on  using health status to vary premiums, and the prohibition on  preexisting conditions exclusions. Furthermore, a section 1332 waiver  cannot  [[Page H3521]]  be approved that might otherwise undermine these requirements. This  administration stands committed to protecting people with preexisting  conditions.'' Seema Verma, she is the Administrator.   It is not just Administrator Verma. I want to quote from the Trump  administration statement of policy. ``If H.R. 986 were presented to the  President, his advisers would recommend that he veto it,'' wrote the  Trump administration in its ``Statement of Administration Policy.''   It goes on to say: ``The President has repeatedly made clear that  this administration will protect people with preexisting conditions.  The 2018 guidance in no way alters the guardrails in place for those  with preexisting conditions, and it would not allow the administration  to waive the requirements in place around preexisting conditions. The  title of this legislation gives the misleading impression that it will  enhance healthcare protections for Americans with preexisting  conditions.''   Put simply, Mr. Chair, this cynically titled messaging bill is all  about scoring political points and not legislating, which is what we  should be doing.   You see, if Democratic Members actually cared about protecting  individuals living with preexisting conditions, they would govern and  lock in these important safeguards. Since Democratic leaders chose to  put politics first, I offered an amendment to protect patients with  preexisting conditions, to lock that into law.   Mr. Chair, this amendment wasn't presented to the House for a vote.  In fact, it was never allowed out of the Rules Committee. That is a  shame because we could be voting on it today. I have tried to bring  that vote to the floor on numerous occasions, and I have been denied by  the Democratic majority.   My bill is simple. It provides guaranteed issue and renewability, a  ban on health status underwriting, and a ban on benefits exclusions,  real preexisting condition protections Democratic Members say they  support.   Guess what? It is titled the ``Pre-existing Conditions Protection  Act.'' How ironic, except my bill does what the title says.   Let's vote on that bill, Mr. Chair.   Here is what it comes down to. The status quo is not working for many  Americans. Healthcare costs are out of control. Patients and families  are struggling to pay ever-increasing premiums, deductibles, and out- of-pocket costs.   There is work that we are doing. I just came from a meeting with the  President of the United States in the Roosevelt Room talking about  surprise billing. We are going to work together, Mr. Pallone and I and  others, to draft legislation to prevent that, to protect consumers.   We could do more here today than what this bill alleges to do.  Republicans want to work toward healthcare solutions that will decrease  costs, increase access, protect individuals with preexisting  conditions, make the healthcare system work better for families and for  patients, and actually be affordable.   We want to let our States innovate. These section 1332 waivers-- originally, again, put forward under President Obama--known as State  innovation waivers, they are working, Mr. Chair. Premiums have gone  down in seven States by an average of 20 percent, down 20 percent.   In my home State of Oregon, we have been a real innovator for decades  in the space of healthcare coverage and access and trying to get prices  down. Our premiums, under this 1332 waiver that Oregon has, have gone  down 6 percent in 2018, down 6 percent thanks to a State innovation  waiver.   These waivers could work. States want to innovate. They care about  their people and want to bring down costs. Instead of allowing more and  more States to innovate and lower their healthcare costs,  unfortunately, Democrats are of the mindset that Washington knows best,  not our States. States can't be trusted, apparently. They want to limit  the ability of States to innovate on behalf of their citizens.   This type of top-down, command-and-control, government-knows-best  approach is what leads to policies like the Democrats' ultimate goal of  a one-size-fits-all government takeover of healthcare.   A vote in support of their bill is a vote against innovation,  lowering costs, my colleagues' constituents, State legislatures,  Governors, State insurance commissioners, on and on and on. That is  what my colleagues are doing if they vote for this.   A vote against the bill is actually a vote for the people.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to oppose this partisan gimmick,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg), a very important member of our Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), our pharmacist on the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington) to speak on this matter.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to make a couple of comments to my friend from Maryland, and he  is my friend. He is always quite poignant and eloquent in his remarks.   What we are debating here today is a bill that is misnamed that  doesn't do what it says it is going to do. What we do know is that 1332  waivers work. My State took advantage of that 1332 waiver and reduced  insurance premiums by 6 percent. The great State of Maryland--I was  just looking at some data, Mr. Chairman--has about 181,500 in the  enrollment year. They used a 1332 waiver. This year in the individual  market their costs for premiums in the individual market percent  decreased 43.4 percent.    Mr. Chair, I bet he would. But we know, overall, 19.9  percent across the country, because we are able to take some of this  money, put it together, and have a reinsurance program. Maine has done  it, Maryland has done it, and Oregon has done it. These are things that  work.   The complaint I get, Mr. Chairman, is people at home say, I may have  access to coverage now, but I can't afford the premium, or, if I can  afford the premium, I can't afford to get sick because the out-of- pocket costs are so high. They are now falling off. Later in the  debate, I will share some data that has been published this week  showing people who literally walk away from healthcare because they  can't afford it. That should be our common mission and goal.   When it comes to protecting people with preexisting conditions, I  introduced legislation--and tried to get a vote on it every chance I  have had--that would lock into law preexisting condition protections,  regardless of what this Federal lawsuit's outcome is in Texas. We  should do that. That would be an easy vote. We could all vote for it.  But Democrats won't let us bring it to the floor.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Kevin Hern).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Chairman, I would just say to my friend, the biggest  assault on Medicare is the Democrats' proposal to do Medicare for All.   We know it will cost $32 trillion, double personal and corporate  income taxes. I met with our hospitals yesterday: 40 percent reduction  in their payments. They are not sure how they would survive. They told  me most hospitals in America will go bankrupt under the Democrats'  proposal.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Reed), a member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time each side  has remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time remains on each side?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, let me address a few issues. First of all, my friend my  New Jersey--and he is my friend--referenced my amendment.   It is unfortunate that we can't debate my amendment on the floor,  because the Democrats who control the Rules Committee wouldn't allow my  amendment to be considered, nor would they allow us to bring a bill to  the floor that I have authored that has more than 100 cosponsors that  would make sure that preexisting conditions are protected in case the  court decision in Texas goes against the ACA and wipes out those  protections.   This would be an insurance policy in public law for people with a  preexisting condition. We can do that today. If it has some  shortcomings, then let's have a markup on this bill and work that out.   I care deeply about preexisting condition protection. I fought for it  as a legislator. I helped create the high-risk pools in Oregon back in  the late eighties and early nineties. I have supported it every step of  the way.   Let me again quote from the Department of Health and Human Services.  We asked them, and they wrote back to me, about protection for  preexisting conditions. Seema Verma, the Administrator, said in her  letter to me: ``To be very clear, the 2018 guidance does nothing to  erode PPACA's preexisting condition provisions, which cannot be waived  under section 1332.''   So they cannot do that. They cannot waive those protections under  1332.   ``Section 1332 does not permit States to waive Public Health Service  Act requirements, such as guaranteed availability and renewability of  health insurance, the prohibition on using health status to vary  premiums, and the prohibition on preexisting conditions exclusions.  Furthermore, a section 1332 waiver cannot be approved that might  otherwise undermine these requirements. This administration stands  committed to protecting people with preexisting conditions.''   That is the head of CMS. It is her agency that approves 1332 waivers.   There have been no waivers so far approved under this guidance, and  that is what she tells us in writing, period, because of the  information that is being sent around.   We do know that seven States have taken advantage of the prior 1332  process, and it has yielded more affordable insurance premiums for  American citizens.   Now, I find it curious. My State has been very progressive in these  areas. When I was in the State legislature, I helped try to expand  access to affordable healthcare. We had to come to Washington to get a  waiver for the Oregon health plan and Medicaid, and we looked at all  kinds of different ways to get access to affordable healthcare, and I  have never let up on that.   I believe strongly in helping people with preexisting conditions.  Like my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, my wife and I had a  son who did not survive because of a heart condition. We dealt with all  of these issues leading up to his birth and eventual death. So I am  fully committed to protecting people with preexisting conditions.   What we are arguing about here is: Is health insurance affordable for  Americans and are there better ways, using States as laboratories, to  innovate and bring down costs of care and costs of insurance, because  more of us are paying more out of our pocket than at any time in our  history.   There was a very interesting story which I will put in the Record for  everyone to read, data from the Kaiser Foundation this week that ran in  a publication called Axios. I just want to share some of what they  found about what is really going on if you get outside of the beltway  here in Washington and talk to real people.   They evaluated people who had coverage under their employer, in this  case, and had a chronic condition of some sort. It is not a small  group.   About half of Americans who have employer coverage--so that is half  of 158 million--report that 6 in 10 in that group report they or a  family member skipped or postponed medical care or prescription drugs  they needed because of the costs, or, in some cases, they tried a home  remedy.   High deductibles make things worse. Among those with chronic  conditions whose deductibles were at least $3,000 for an individual or  $5,000 for a family, three-quarters, Mr. Chairman, 75 percent, report  skipping or postponing some type of care; and about half, 49 percent,  say they or a family member had problems paying medical bills or  difficulty affording their premiums, deductibles, or copays in the last  year.    So what States--including mine, including New Jersey, including  Maryland, and including Maine and Alaska--did was say: Hey, Washington,  D.C., give us just a little flexibility here. Let us come with up with  plans that may be more affordable.   They did that under the prior rules, and rates went down, on average,  19.9 percent--some States more, some less.   Now, what happens when people can't afford to use their own  insurance? Because that is happening with these deductibles and with  these high levels, let alone the premiums.   The ripple effect on family budgets, according to the story in Axios,  is a substantial share of people reported taking measures such as  increasing credit card debt, 28 percent; using up most of their  savings, 26 percent; getting an extra job, 19 percent; borrowing money  from family or friends, 14 percent.   This is what we are trying to argue could be better taken care of.  This is the issue that is being ignored by a Washington one size fits  all.   So we protect people with preexisting conditions, 1332 waivers--that  law  [[Page H3529]]  stays in effect--but we want to give States a little more flexibility  to go after this to bring down the cost.   Now, my friend from New Jersey and I, Mr. Chairman, are working  together on some of these drug reforms so we can get drug costs down.   I was at the White House today with the President on surprise  billing, and I think we are going to work together on that issue, Mr.  Chairman, so that no American consumer who follows the rules gets stuck  with a surprise bill. What are you supposed to do, wake up in the  middle of the operation and say: Hey, is everybody in this room still  on my plan? If you play by the rules, you shouldn't get stuck unfairly  with a surprise bill. We are going to find a solution.   My State came up with a way to do that already and other States have  other ideas, but we are going to protect consumers there as well. We  are going to drive down the cost of drugs, and we should continue to go  after this issue of the high cost of healthcare because that is what  Americans in my 20 townhalls--and I don't think anybody in the House  has done more.   I have done 20 townhalls this year. In almost every one of them, they  are asking: How do you get the costs down?   Mr. Chairman, 1332 waivers gave my State the opportunity to get costs  down, and we should not impede that process.   We are going to debate a lot about these policies going forward, and  if there are junk plans, then let's expose them for what they are, and  let's pass Ms. Eshoo's bill from, I think, last Congress, which  required more transparency and accountability so you don't have fraud  and deception. Count me all in on that.   There is a lot more we can do to drive down costs.   My legislation--again, Democrats refused to bring up in committee or  have on the floor--would make sure, regardless of any lawsuit, people  with preexisting conditions can continue to get covered. So  irrespective of the court decisions, they would get covered.   If my bill were allowed to be voted on in the House, I guarantee you,  we might have some issues we need to work out. I am happy to do that.  If it passed, it would become law. This President is firmly committed  to protecting people with preexisting conditions, so we should do that.   We should also have a hearing on the Medicare for All bill that some  on the other side are promoting. I have asked for that.   I know there was one in the Rules Committee, but Energy and Commerce  is the committee of jurisdiction for most of that. We have not seen  that hearing yet. I hope, in the future, we will, because we should  know the impact of wiping out Medicare Advantage plans and Medigap  plans.   I have been told TRICARE would go away, all private insurance would  go away, and it would be a one-size-fits-all, government-run system. I  am worried about the delay in access to care. I am worried about the  access to the great, new innovative drugs and procedures that we would  lose in America.   So, Mr. Chairman, I must oppose this underlying legislation. I remain  committed to protecting people with preexisting conditions, as do my  colleagues on the Republican side. Then we ought to focus together, Mr.  Chairman, as a Congress to do the best thing for our constituents,  which is to bring the greatest leverage possible to reduce unnecessary  costs in the healthcare system in America.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I would just say that section 1332 does not  permit States to waive preexisting condition protections, period. And I  would,  [[Page H3532]]  again, cite the guidance from the CMS director, Ms. Seema Verma, where  she states that. And that will be in the Record.   Again, I think what we are trying to do here is give States more  flexibility to bring down the cost of health insurance, while following  these guidelines as outlined.   As I mentioned earlier in the debate, high deductibles are pricing  people out of coverage, and by that, I mean they are walking away from  getting the care that they need because they can't pay for it; or they  are driving up their credit card debt, wiping out their savings, they  are having to take another job, they are borrowing money from others.   So, what the Trump administration is trying to do is build on what  the Obama administration created, 1332 waivers, that have, frankly,  been very successful in many, many States.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I am not necessarily opposed to his  amendment, but I do think it is important to talk about the issues that  really matter when it comes to affordable healthcare.   Again, when we talked about giving States the authority to innovate  and to protect their citizens, we are for that. I come from a State  that pioneered the Oregon Health Plan.   I was there. I created a select committee when I was the Republican  majority leader of the Oregon House, when we finally got the waiver  from the Federal Government after a couple of years to actually  implement the Oregon Health Plan. It was very creative about how to  hold down healthcare costs and expand coverage and do all those things.  We have worked on a lot of different issues over the years.   What we did with the President today, I think, is really important  and, that is, looked at this issue of surprise billing: If you follow  all the rules, you go to a hospital that is in your network, and let's  say some provider gets sick in the night and they substitute somebody  else who doesn't turn out to be in your network and then, weeks later,  you get an astronomical bill through no fault of your own.   There was a parent down there whose daughter had had, I think, some  sort of  [[Page H3533]]  surgery, and the physician, on the way out, said: Oh, by the way, I  want you to do just a little urine test here. We are going to run an  analysis.   So she did, left, and, a period of time later, got a bill for  $17,000.   Her dad is a doctor and said: How did this happen?   Well, it turned out whoever did the test was not in the network of  her insurance. She didn't know.    What are you going to do? You have had whatever surgery she had, and  on the way out the doctor says: Hey, by the way, give us a little  sample. I just want to run a test because I have got you on this drug,  and I want to make sure it is all working right.   Then a $17,000 bill arrives a couple of months later.   They were there with the President today in the Roosevelt Room at  this bipartisan event. And her dad negotiated. He couldn't say what  level, but it was certainly not what the insurer would have paid.   Do you know what the insurer would have paid for that, in network? A  hundred bucks. He said you can probably get the test done now for $25.   A $17,000 bill arrives.   This is what is happening to Americans who have insurance, and that  is why we have got to deal with the surprise billing issue. It is why  we have to squeeze the juice out of the middle of the healthcare  delivery system.   We do all these great innovations. And Republicans led the effort on  the 21st Century Cures Act.   We met with Dr. Francis Collins yesterday, the extraordinary leader  of NIH; the longest-serving President-appointed--under Obama--NIH  director in the history of our country.   Because of what we put forward to dramatically increase investment in  NIH--Republicans led that effort, Fred Upton, but joined with Diana  DeGette, a Democrat out of Colorado, and a bunch of us--they are now  finding cures.   Dr. Collins said yesterday they have identified now 6,500 genetic  diseases where they now can figure out, I'll say, the misspelling of  the DNA code.   Some of my colleagues may have seen on ``60 Minutes'' Dr. Collins  talking about that they think they found a cure for sickle cell anemia.  They found a misspelling--one letter misspelled in that big chain of  DNA--that they were able to go in with our new technology--some of it  is a result of what we have done collaboratively here--and change,  alter, that letter.   And they have these people now that there is no evidence of sickle  cell in their blood platelets.   There are 6,500 diseases that they now know the misspelling. Now they  have got to figure out how to train your body, using immuno technology,  to have your own cells turned on in a little different way and go after  these diseases.   These are remarkable advances in lifesaving medicines and treatments.                                time  1545    We, I think, as a country, have to figure out how we pay for that, if  each one of these is individualized.   Our system is antiquated and doesn't deal with this effectively. We  are going to have to figure that out because a lifesaving cure isn't  going to cure a life if people can't afford to get the medicine.   We also need to drill down on telehealth and telemedicine.   One of our colleagues today was talking about mental health services.  My district is bigger than any State east of the Mississippi, unless  you have to count Lake Michigan with Michigan, which, of course, you  do. So telehealth really matters, and we are getting great results for  our veterans and for our citizens using telehealth. But our providers  don't often get paid for the service they provide over telehealth. Why?  That is something we have to address.   You go one thing after another after another here, where we should be  spending our valuable legislative time solving the problems that real  Americans run into every day of the week: How do I pay the bill? You  tell me I have insurance, and I do, and I pay a record--I don't know  whose premium under ObamaCare went down $2,500 a month, but I will talk  about this more.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am  not necessarily opposed to the gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments and  her amendment. I don't intend to oppose her amendment, but I do want to  pick up on something she said that is really important.   The gentlewoman mentioned opioids. In the last Congress, when I  chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee, I helped lead the bipartisan  effort to produce 60 pieces of legislation dealing with the opioid  crisis, to help those who were addicted get the assistance they need,  to get resources into our communities to help medical advancements to  find non-opioid-related medical treatments, and to stop fentanyl from  coming into our country.   I didn't get the opportunity, but I hope the President and his team  will continue to raise this issue with the Chinese leadership when they  come because a lot of this illicit fentanyl is being produced in China  and then coming to the United States.   Dr. Burgess, who was our chair of the Subcommittee on Health and is  now the top Republican, I think went up to the chairman's district in  New Jersey and viewed one of the international mail processing  facilities. At least, it was in New Jersey. I don't know its precise  location.   Together we said, working with the Trump administration's FDA  Commissioner, we have to do more at these mail processing facilities to  stop fentanyl from coming in.   By the way, fentanyl is like 100 times more potent than morphine. If  you had a salt shaker and put out, I don't know, 10, 15 grains of salt  and ingested that, if it was fentanyl, it would kill you.   We said let's put more resources toward stopping illegal fentanyl  from coming into the United States, and we are doing that now. We are  beefing that up.   It comes in through Mexico as well. It is both China and Mexico. It  is creating pockets of death in our communities. Especially in some of  our urban areas, we have seen where it gets mixed in with heroin to  give even a higher high or whatever. Then you see groups of people who  take this, not knowing it has been jacked up with fentanyl, and you  have a whole group that dies.   The most insidious discussion or incident I heard about was a parent  who I got to know a little bit, whose daughter, he told me, self- medicated occasionally with heroin, and she died in college.   When they did the autopsy, they figured out she had been given 100  percent fentanyl. It wasn't a mix with heroin, Mr. Chair.   The tragedy of that was, he felt that her supplier knew she was an  occasional user so had low tolerance and, basically, probably killed  her to prove to his other buyers that he had the most potent stuff on  the street.   A colleague of ours, Mr. Katko, who was a prosecutor before he came  to the Congress, he and I were having a discussion on this matter. He  said he prosecuted a case just like that. That is how evil this stuff  is.   As we look at the whole panoply of issues about healthcare, mental  health services, addiction services, stopping these things from coming  in, we can find a lot of common ground.   Republicans supported protections for preexisting conditions before  the ACA, during the ACA, after the ACA today. We did. Same with putting  kids on your policies at 26. We agreed with those principles.   But the ObamaCare act was rammed through this House and the Senate,  and we weren't even allowed to bring any of the 90-some amendments we  offered to the floor. We were completely shut out of that process. It  was a horrible process, and it shouldn't be repeated.   I hear a lot about how we voted to repeal it a bazillion times. Well,  you know what? If you go through and dissect those votes, there were a  whole bunch of Democrats that voted with us. The President at the time,  President Obama, signed some of that legislation because even he  admitted there were problems in the ACA.   Going forward, I hope we can address the big problem in America,  which is high-cost insurance, high deductibles, but, moreover, the high  cost of healthcare itself because it is pretty hard to go home and  explain why things cost what they do today.   We have to get around the high cost issue. The access issue, that is  where earlier I talked about telehealth and telemedicine. There is a  lot of work we will do together.   Unfortunately, this is a mislabeled bill today. The laws governing  1332 waivers prohibit what the majority is concerned about. But I don't  have opposition to this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's amendment.   Look, we all care deeply about getting mental health services into  our community. In fact, under Republican leadership on the Energy and  Commerce Committee a few years ago, we  [[Page H3535]]  rewrote America's mental health laws for the first time since John  Kennedy signed the last bill into law before he was tragically  assassinated in Texas. It was a lot of work, but it was bipartisan  work.   Not only did we look at those mental health laws that were on the  books, because what happens around here is somebody comes up with a new  idea, so you put a new program in place, and you give an authorization.  Maybe it gets funded, maybe it doesn't. A year goes by. Somebody has a  new idea. Put another one on the books. Nobody ever goes back and looks  at what worked and what didn't.   So our colleague, Dr. Murphy, at the time, who is a psychologist and  a terrific leader in this area, really drove this review and said,  look, we have to help kids with mental illness, and we need to help  adults.   We could deal with a lot of the violence in America if you got people  care. It is not that everybody with mental illness goes violent, but we  do know that mental health services help people in every way and that  the programs we had--we had a lot of them--weren't funded, weren't  funded properly, or didn't work. Some worked better than others.   We had this comprehensive review in the Energy and Commerce Committee  of these different programs the Federal Government has. Then we said,  going forward--kind of what you are trying to do with this GAO report  in a little different way--let's measure the efficacy of the programs  we do have.                                time  1600    Let's find out what is working in our communities, and then let's get  aid into our communities directly. Let's cut out the middle bureaucracy  and get assistance, financial assistance into our communities.   So we passed that. That is now the law of the land. And I think last  year we were able to get money into that, finally, and I hope we can do  more going forward, because we know that--I am being a little sarcastic  here, but it is an extraordinary finding. Guess what? Your brain and  your physical body are connected. Who knew, right? And we have all  known that.   So I supported the effort to get the same treatment under insurance  for mental health as physical health because they are completely  connected. So going forward, we have got to make sure that that bond is  strengthened, not weakened, and that people continue to get help for  mental health.   I am a big believer in that. I know it works. It is fascinating to  see, with the whole genome project, now they can do a genetic test and  figure out which mental health drug will work in your body or my body.  We didn't know that before, and now they can figure out which one will  actually work for you or me or whomever.   I hope we have lifted the stigma on people needing mental health  services. We are just a big bag of chemicals, and things get out of  balance. So I hope that we have lifted that as we did, I believe, on  addiction.   There are a lot of people, and over time people evolve their views  and get better understandings, and I think over time we realized that  people with drug addictions--especially this came out through our  opioids work--weren't necessarily criminals. They weren't to be shunned  from society.   What we learned in the course of our work on opioids was, when I  talked to parents whose kids had a high school football injury or  something and the doctor gave them a painkiller, all of a sudden, this  stuff is so addictive, a few treatments and they are hooked, and then  they need more and more and more and more.   I always remember my friend Mr. Rush from the Chicago area, when we  were talking about treatment for opioids, said: That is great you are  doing that. When the people I represented had issues in terms of crack  cocaine and all, you just called them druggies and you put them in  prison.   That affected what we wrote and how we legislated, and we moved away  from calling it treatment for opioids to people with substance abuse  because we realized we needed to think broader as a country and as a  Congress, and we did that and we changed the law. All that now is law  to deal with opioids and mental health services.   So, Mr. Chairman, I don't have an objection to this amendment, but  there is a lot we have done and a lot more we need to do, and I will  talk about some of the things we need to do going forward.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. I believe  it is No. 5, printed in House Report 116-51.    Mr. Chairman, I would just say, in terms of this  amendment, it is just trying to make the point that the bill we have  before us today is not as described or labeled. In our opinion, it is  more about politics and gotcha politics than it is about the underlying  issue.   We know from the Department of Health and Human Services, they have  made it clear in the letter from the Director who would approve these  waivers that she believes that the underlying law protects people with  preexisting conditions and all the other things I talked about earlier,  that they can't waive that law--they cannot.   So I would enter into the Record again, Mr. Chairman, as part of my  remarks, her comments about the guidance, the 2018 guidance, and where  she says it does not erode ObamaCare's preexisting condition  provisions. She is the one in charge of this. That is what she is  saying.   But I want to talk about something else she says in this letter about  premiums and the costs to people getting their insurance. She says:  ``Under the PPACA''--or ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act, however  you want to describe it--``we have seen dramatically higher premiums  and decreased options for millions of consumers, in large part due to  the law's overly prescriptive mandates and excessive Federal Government  takeover of areas traditionally left under State oversight.''   She points out: ``In 2019, the average monthly premium for a  benchmark plan for a family of four on HealthCare.gov is now over  $1,500, which can easily exceed a family's mortgage.''   Continuing with her letter to me, she said: ``There are many areas of  the country with far higher monthly premiums. For example, a of 60- year-old couple living in Grand Island, Nebraska, making $70,000 a  year, will need to pay over $3,000 per month for the lowest cost silver  plan available. That is almost $38,000 per year for a plan with an  $11,100 deductible.''   Now, think about that, Mr. Chair. This is a couple that is making  $70,000 a year. They are 60 years old. They live in Nebraska, and  $3,000 a month in premiums, over $3,000, and an $11,000 deductible.  That is over $48,000, and they only make $70,000 a year.   This is happening in America today. Heck, it is happening in Nebraska  right now. So what we are saying is people are walking away.   She goes on to say: ``For millions of Americans, coverage this  expensive is not a realistic option, and many choose to go without  coverage at all. In fact, after average premiums rose by 21 percent,  1.3 million unsubsidized people walked away from the market in 2017.''   Those are the people we need to be helping. There is a lot more we  need to be doing. I will put the rest of this in the Record. But I  think everybody knows we are just trying make a point with this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.    Mr. Chairman, just to clarify, from a parliamentary  standpoint, I was just going to withdraw the amendment, but if the  gentleman wants to speak on it, I can ask unanimous consent to withdraw  it after he speaks.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just suggest that it was Seema  Verma who is the head of CMS who issued the guidance, so I think she is  in a position to have a say about what she believes the guidance allows  or doesn't.   To be clear, to quote her letter again: ``The 2018 guidance does  nothing to erode the PPACA's preexisting condition provisions.'' That  is what she is saying.   So I think that letter is important. She put it in writing. She has  said that repeatedly, and so I take her at her word. I do. I include  her letter in the Record.                                             Centers for Medicare &                                               Medicaid Services,                                        Washington, DC, May 7, 2019.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Walden: Thank you for your continued       interest in new state flexibility available under guidance       recently issued interpreting section 1332 of the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) (the 2018       guidance). Working within the limitations of the PPACA, this       2018 guidance is an important element of the Administration's       actions to expand options and lower costs for patients around       the country. I wanted to take this opportunity to set the       record straight and reaffirm this Administration's commitment       to lowering healthcare costs, increasing consumer choices,       and protecting our most vulnerable citizens, including those       who have pre-existing conditions.        To be very clear, the 2018 guidance does nothing to erode       the PPACA's pre-existing condition provisions, which cannot       be waived under section 1332. Section 1332 does not permit       states to waive Public Health Service Act requirements such       as guaranteed availability and renewability of health       insurance, the prohibition on using health status to vary       premiums, and the prohibition on pre-existing conditions       exclusions. Furthermore, a section 1332 waiver cannot be       approved that might otherwise undermine these requirements.       This Administration stands committed to protecting people       with pre-existing conditions.        Under the PPACA, we have seen dramatically higher premiums       and decreased options for millions of consumers, in large       part due to the law's overly prescriptive mandates and       excessive Federal government takeover of areas traditionally       under state oversight. In 2019, the average monthly premium       for a benchmark plan for a family of four on HealthCare.gov       is now over $1,500, which can easily exceed a family's       mortgage. There are many areas of the country with far higher       monthly premiums. For example, a 60-year-old couple living in       Grand Island, Nebraska, making $70,000 a year, will need to       pay over $3,000 per month for the lowest cost silver plan       available. That's almost $38,000 per year for a plan with an       $11,100 deductible. That's over half their income.        For millions of Americans, coverage this expensive is not a       realistic option, and many choose to go without coverage at       all. In fact, after average premiums rose by 21 percent, 1.3       million unsubsidized people walked away from the market in       2017, the last year the prior administration oversaw open       enrollment. While these higher premiums force some people to       go uninsured, coverage is generally not optional for people       with a pre-existing condition and so, without a subsidy,       someone with a pre-existing condition must face the full       burden of the PPACA's skyhigh premiums. This Administration       has not forgotten the people facing this hardship.        Section 1332 of the PPACA provides the discretion to       approve a section 1332 state waiver plan if the following       four statutory guardrails are met: affordability,       comprehensiveness, coverage, and federal deficit neutrality.       Section 1332 allows states to develop new healthcare programs       and solutions that would be not permissible without a section       1332 waiver.        Unfortunately, guidance issued under the prior       Administration in December 2015 (the 2015 guidance) regarding       section 1332 waivers had the effect of significantly       restricting the innovation states could pursue. The prior       Administration imposed a one-size-fits-all approach to these       waivers, making it difficult for states to address the       specific needs of their residents.        In October, the Administration issued guidance under       section 1332 of the PPACA to provide states with significant       opportunities to chart a different course for their markets       through expanded flexibility. Section 1332 and the 2018       guidance ensure that consumers who wish to retain coverage       similar to that provided under the PPACA can do so, but they       empower states to take steps to stabilize their markets and       allow more affordable coverage options that may be more       attractive to individuals and families priced out of the       current market, including people with pre-existing       conditions.        Over the past two years, this Administration has approved       seven section 1332 waivers authorizing reinsurance programs       to help fund claims for people with high healthcare costs.       These reinsurance programs provide much needed premium relief       for people in the market and, in particular, for people with       pre-existing conditions without other coverage options. These       section 1332 waivers were all approved under the prior, more       restrictive 2015 guidance. I believe, given the expanded       flexibility discussed in the 2018 guidance, states will be       able to develop additional healthcare programs and solutions       that work for their residents.        As you know, some have criticized the state flexibility       offered under the 2018 guidance, claiming that states will       pursue section 1332 waivers that undermine their own       individual market risk pools and make coverage more expensive       for their own residents with pre-existing conditions. Again,       I want to make clear that a section 1332 waiver cannot       undermine coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.       Moreover, any section 1332 waiver will need to carefully       account for any impact on the individual market risk pool and       guarantee that access to coverage is at least as       comprehensive and affordable as would exist without the       waiver.        So, if a state seeks to pursue the use of more affordable       options, such as catastrophic plans or short-term limited       duration plans, under a section 1332 state waiver plan, the       state must ensure access to coverage that is overall as       affordable and comprehensive for people who remain in the       individual market risk pool.  [[Page H3537]]         Thank you again for your shared interest in bringing down       healthcare costs and protecting our fellow Americans with       pre-existing conditions. We remain focused on improving our       nation's health care system by empowering states to innovate       and develop new solutions to expand access to affordable and       high value coverage options, and we look forward to working       with you to achieve these goals. Should you have questions,       please contact the CMS Office of Legislation.            Sincerely,                                                       Seema Verma.     Now, Mr. Chair, I was willing to withdraw the amendment.  That takes unanimous consent, and I just would attempt to do that  again. I don't know if my colleague cares about that or not.    Mr. Chairman, so we can move on to the other amendments,  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Chair, I just want to say that I, too, wish we were debating my  legislation that I tried to offer the first of the Congress and was  refused the opportunity to bring it to the floor. That would lock into  statute preexisting protections for people who have preexisting  conditions.   This court case is pending. We could get a ruling tomorrow. Somewhere  in the last couple of months, Congress could have acted to put in  statute a separate law that would be there, irrespective of the  decision of the judge, or judges as it goes through its process, that  could wipe out all of the ACA and could wipe out preexisting condition  protections. We could do that, except their Committee on Rules put  these amendments in order to debate on the floor, but not the amendment  that actually protects people with preexisting conditions. So it is not  my fault--we don't control of the Rules Committee--that my serious  amendment about protecting people with preexisting conditions was not  made in order. I don't control the Rules Committee. The Speaker does,  and others.   When we talk about affordability, remember the example that Seema  Verma points out, in Grand Island, Nebraska, a couple making $60,000 a  year, 60 years old, $38,000 for the plan, and $11,000 deductible. How  is that affordable? It is not.   I want our States to innovate. Do you know what, if a State doesn't  want to innovate, it doesn't have to. And if they violate the rules,  they are not going to get their waiver.   But what we do know is that when States have innovated, like mine,  like the gentlemen from Wisconsin and Alaska, they have seen reductions  in premiums and full-throated coverage. I want innovation. I don't want  to price people out of the market.    Madam Chair, I seek time in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.    Madam Chair, I would like to point out a couple of  things.   One, I have introduced legislation to protect people with preexisting  conditions. I did that because I knew this lawsuit is pending. We can  argue about the ACA and the lawsuit and all that, but the long and  short of it is that if the court rules the ACA gets thrown out as  unconstitutional, which may happen, people with preexisting conditions  would be exposed, and I don't want that to happen. That is why I  introduced legislation.   I would be honored if we could take that up in the Energy and  Commerce Committee that I used to chair and put it on the House floor.  I tried to bring it here as an amendment and it was denied by the  Democrat majority, so we can't even have a debate here about it. If it  is not everything it should be, then I am happy to work with people to  try and make it as durable and robust as it needs to be. So that is  one.   When we talk about insurance--and there is kind of silence on the  other side--2.5 million Americans since President Trump have gotten  healthcare insurance through their employer. We have one of the most  robust economies most Americans have ever seen: 3.2 percent, I think,  GDP growth the first quarter. Some have said, you need fairy dust to do  that. Well, that is not true. You need good economic policy. We have  that in America: the lowest unemployment for African Americans,  Hispanic Americans, all Americans. Incredible numbers, incredible  growth. As a result, people are getting off government subsidized  healthcare, or fully funded healthcare, onto private health insurance,  which Democrats want to wipe out. One hundred and fifty-eight million  Americans get their health insurance through their employer or through  their union.   And when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, that is what put in  place the big cuts that are coming to our hospitals, the DSH cuts, that  I held off as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. We passed  legislation to prevent the DSH cuts from hitting our disproportionate  share of hospitals, those that deal with more lower income folks. We  are going to have to do that again. Because ObamaCare says you got to  hit your hospital with a big cost increase, if you will, or take away a  subsidy.   The Cadillac tax. I met with building trade folks in my State. These  people bargained away, potentially, wages for better benefits. And then  along comes ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, that says: Oh, by the  way, if you have got too generous a plan, according to the government,  you are going to have to pay a 40 percent tax on that plan. And, by the  way, it was never indexed for inflation. And guess what, healthcare  costs continue to go up and premiums go up.   More and more Americans' health insurance is going to fall into this  so-called Cadillac tax. There will be a 40 percent tax on those plans.  The working men and women, who are part of a union or in the private  sector and who have good, generous healthcare benefits, the Federal  Government, the Democrat-driven plan that is totally partisan passed,  it says, we are going to whack you with a 40 percent tax. How fair is  that, Madam Chair? I don't think it is. We have kept that tax from  taking effect as Republicans. We will see what this Congress does.   But, moreover, we fully funded our community health centers. We,  under Republicans, funded the children's health insurance program, a  Republican creation, for a decade. I led that  [[Page H3539]]  effort. Most Democrats consistently voted against funding children's  health insurance time and time again. It had never been funded for more  than 5 years ever in its history. One hundred and twenty-two thousand,  seven hundred Oregonian kids and pregnant moms get their health  insurance through CHIP. It is a marvelous program. Republicans led the  effort, because I did it. We first tried to get 5, then 6, and then  eventually we got 10 years funded. That is locked into law.    We need to go back and fund our community health centers. I told  people that if I were chairman, my palms would be getting a little  sweaty now at the list of things we need to get done--I am looking at  my friends.   In Oregon, in my district, I think we had 63 delivery sites and 12  community health centers. We fully funded those centers at a record  level in the last Congress, because I believe fully in that network of  the delivery of healthcare. It is extraordinarily important. We should  be doing that today, but we are not.   We have got the National Health Service Corps, special diabetes  programs for Indians, special diabetes programs for type I diabetes,  teaching health centers, personal responsibility education programs,  sexual risk avoidance education grants, and family-to-family health  information centers. We have demo programs, increased access to dental  healthcare services, and delay in authority to terminate contracts for  Medicare Advantage plans. We have protection for recipients of HCBS  against spousal impoverishment. We have demonstration of approved  community behavioral health clinics, Medicaid funding for territories,  delay in effective date for Medicaid amendments related to beneficiary  liability settlements, DSH allotment, and money follows the person. All  those expire at the end of this fiscal year. We have real work we need  to get done, Madam Chair.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Madam Chair, I seek time in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Actually, I believe I get to close, don't I?    That is what I thought.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Section 1332 already requires that the State plan will provide  coverage that is at least as comprehensive as the essential health  benefits, including mental health and substance use disorder services.  That is already required, including behavioral health treatment, and  would provide coverage to at least a comparable number of its  residents. That is already in the 1332 requirements.   I appreciate the gentleman's passion for dealing with the opioid  epidemic. I led the effort that brought together Republicans and  Democrats. We passed 60 different pieces of legislation. I think 57 of  them, by the time we were done working together, passed unanimously in  this House.   We bundled them up into H.R. 6 because we all know the Senate can't  handle 57 or 60 different pieces of legislation, but they could handle  one. The work we did here and the work they did there ended up in, I  would argue, the Nation's most comprehensive legislation to address a  drug problem our country has ever had. And that is our law.   The President of the United States, who was just disparaged here on  the House floor, helped lead this effort because he passionately cares  about the issue of addiction. He lost a brother, I believe, to  alcoholism.   He was a leader, and his team were leaders, in this effort we put  together on opioids. He invited Republicans and Democrats to the White  House for the bill signing. Mrs. Trump helped organize all of that.   This legislation is comprehensive on opioids. It wasn't part of the  ACA. You see, we can work together and improve underlying laws. We can  address major problems facing the country when majorities want to do  that. We did it last Congress under my leadership, and it was  Republicans and Democrats. We didn't start out agreeing on some of  these matters, but we ended up there, with just a couple of exceptions.   I sent my friend, Madam Chair, the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee today, a comprehensive list of kind of what we  learned in the final phase of our investigation into how America ended  up in the place it was with opioids. There are some additional  recommendations that I hope and assume we will get to out of that  investigative report that we concluded at the end of the year.  Hopefully, we will get there.   I believe we need to do oversight on the legislation we passed. I  have always felt that about bills we passed. We need to go take a  second look.                                time  1645    What is working? What is not? We are not going to get it right the  first time, and we always know there is more to do, and we need to do  more on what was H.R. 6 in the last Congress, our opioids legislation.   Madam Chair, I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment, and you  have to say you are in order to get the time, I guess, but I am not.   I am fully committed to making sure that people with substance abuse  disorders continue to get the help they need in our communities. That  is what our whole legislative thrust was about last Congress and will  remain there. As I say, section 1332 already requires that in these  plans.   Again, remember what we are talking about here is States coming to  the Federal Government saying: We have a  [[Page H3541]]  better idea to fill a gap, so people have affordable insurance. That is  what a waiver is under 1332. And, I guess, I have more confidence in my  State than others must have in theirs, but I think from my own  experience, Republicans and Democrats work together in Oregon to get  health insurance out, and coverage out, and expand access to care. I  have always continued to try to do that.   I have faith that my State would do this. These plans we will hear  more about next week, but they are regulated by State insurance  commissioners. I am not in the school that says all of those people are  bad and we are the only ones with a great idea. I want innovation. I  want it from the States, and I want to drive down costs of healthcare  while improving access and delivery of services.   So I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. I do hope we can  address these issues of fully funding our community health centers, our  National Health Service Corps, and these diabetes programs which we  reauthorized and funded in the last Congress, and which we need to do  again. They are called the Special Diabetes Program for Indians and  Special Diabetes Program for type 1 diabetes.   We have got to get after that, too, Madam Chair. We have to find the  money to do it. It is not easy. I know we have a lot of other things. I  just wish we were doing those sorts of the things today because these  programs expire in September, and we don't have that many legislative  days left.   Hopefully, we can move on to the things I know we can agree on and  find solutions for, and that we do it sooner rather than later.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I seek time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Madam Chair, I am not opposed to the gentleman's  amendment, but I am happy to speak on it.   Again, section 1332 already requires that the State plan, the one  they submit, will provide coverage that is at least as comprehensive as  the essential health benefits, including mental health and substance  use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment, and will  provide coverage to at least a comparable number of its residents.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I just want to go back to what is going on in America's  healthcare costs and look at some of what is going on elsewhere around  the world.   First of all, I would draw the Member's attention to the Kaiser  Foundation report that Axios reported on about people who have health  insurance and still can't afford to use it. They talked about just over  half of those with employer coverage have some sort of chronic disease,  so they have health insurance. But the deductibles which are at $3,000  to $5,000 are so high that three-quarters of the people reported  skipping or postponing some type of care. Half, 49 percent, said that a  family member had a problem paying medical bills or difficulty  affording their premiums, deductibles, or copays in the last year.   What we are trying to do is help those people in the individual  market, and we would love to help those people in the market that  employer-provided health insurance is in as well, and put downward  pressure on pricing, and go after the cost of healthcare from one end  to the other.  [[Page H3542]]    Now, the gentleman from California, I believe, has talked about going  to a, I guess, government-run, single-payer system. I have got two  veterans that work virtually full time helping veterans in Oregon's  Second District get access to a similar sort of system. You know of it  as the VA. Think about the problems we have with that government-run,  single, sort of, payer-operated system.   If you get in, I have veterans saying: It is great. I have got  coverage. But it is people who have to wait 6 months to get eyeglasses  at one point, or they can't get in to get their surgery done. And we  are working with thousands of veterans that have to come to  their Member of Congress to be able to get access to the healthcare  they were promised when they put on the Nation's uniform.    We have that system in place, and it has incredible problems in wait  time, so I had to create the Choice Program and everything else.   Then I was intrigued by a story about a woman in Nova Scotia who is  33 years old. She is under one of those systems my friend wants for us,  I guess. After three trips to the emergency room, they just never would  believe her and her problem and see her, and she couldn't get access to  doctors. When she finally did, her anal cancer had progressed to stage  III.   Now, at 33, she is in menopause, she writes. She had a Facebook post  recently wanting to meet with the Premier to explain how broken their  healthcare system is.   We all know stories about Canadians who come across the border who  can afford to get their healthcare done here because they can get it  done sooner. We all know of stories in other countries where they have  global budgets, and when they run out, you are done. I have had people  tell me the little secret is: Get sick before June because they are  going to run out and you won't get in. That is what is going on around  the world.   And I think, in many measures, when people are especially sick, if  they have the money, they come to the United States for care. They go  to MD Anderson Cancer Center, and they go to the Mayo Clinic.   Those are the folks who come to America. What I want is the MD  Andersons and the Mayo Clinics, and the Oregon and Health & Science  Universities to be affordable and available to all Americans.   We had a hearing today--I think it was pretty good--on drug pricing,  following up on what I did 2 years ago looking at the manufacturers,  the PBMs, the distributors, and the insurers. Everybody wants a piece  of this. Everybody is getting a chunk. The result is, we have a  healthcare system that costs too much. So let's go figure that out.   That is what innovation is about, and that is what our States can do  in their wonderful laboratories. Some of them will do really good  things, and some of them will make mistakes and learn from it. We  should pick the best from among the States. That is what we are looking  for here in these 1332 waivers is some flexibility for our States to  innovate.   I believe our States and my colleagues--and by the way, Oregon is  completely Democrat controlled--but they care about citizens of the  State of Oregon, and so does the insurance commissioner, and they are  only going to ask for permission for a plan that will be better than  what the Federal Government is trying to jam down their throat in a  one-size-fits-all.   So I don't object to the gentleman's amendment. I think we can do  better by harnessing great innovation. We do it in medicine, and we do  it everywhere else. We have competitive insurance products for a lot of  other things we buy, and I would like to see more options, more choice,  more transparency in healthcare, and more consumer involvement.   Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I do not oppose this amendment because this amendment  does not do anything the law already, I think, requires.   Section 1332 does not permit States to waive preexisting condition  protections. Section 1332 already requires that the State plan will  provide coverage that is at least as comprehensive as the essential  health benefits and will provide coverage and cost-sharing protections  against excessive out-of-pocket spending. That is what the underlying  law already does.   We have the assurance from the CMS Administrator saying, once again,  to be clear: ``The 2018 guidance does nothing to erode the PPACA's  preexisting condition provisions, which cannot be waived under section  1332.''   She is the one who makes the decision.   By the way, I would just point out that no State has come to the  Trump administration under this new authority that we are aware of and  said: ``Please approve our plan.''   Junk plans--and we will hear more about that term of art. By the way,  those junk plans were allowed for under the Obama administration and  under the ACA. At that time, they were only allowed for 3 months. There  seemed to be a lot of interest in a variety of options for citizens to  take advantage of that covered their needs.   So the Trump administration said, well, if they are good for 3  months, what if we extend them to 12 months or just at 12 months? That  is what they did. They were junk plans under Trump; they were wonderful  options under Obama. It is the same set of plans.   You can always go on the exchange, and you can always find other  coverage that fits your need. We are trying to not have just one plan  that nobody can afford. That is what you are seeing in this situation  that Ms. Seema Verma put forward, Madam Chair, the head of the CMS, the  Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.   She uses, as an example, this situation in Grand Island, Nebraska. It  is not Oregon; it is Nebraska. A $70,000-a-year, 60-year-old couple are  paying $38,000 a year for their insurance with an $11,100 deductible.  Now, how is that affordable? Does anybody in here think that is a great  idea?   That is what you are saying: Don't innovate. We have got it covered.  The ACA has it covered. There is no need for innovation here, nothing  to see. The plan works great.   Then we know, from the Kaiser Foundation study, people are saying: I  can't afford it. So I will jack up my credit card, and I will wipe out  my savings.   All this is going on. The ACA did not solve every problem. It  expanded coverage. You can't help but do that, spend that much money.  States like mine took full advantage of it. But we are left with these  pockets and problems in America that I think States could assist us in  if we gave them expanded authority under 1332 waivers to say: Hey,  guess what, Washington? We have a better idea here. Here it is. Take a  look at it, and make sure it fits the Federal guidelines and law, but  let us innovate.   Oregon did that. Under the prior 1332 approval process, insurance  rates went down 6 percent; Wisconsin down 10.6; New Jersey, 15;  Maryland, 43; Maine, 9.4; Minnesota, 20; Alaska, 34.7. Using this sort  of ``Mother May I'' approval, that is what you have to do.    I remember when Oregon did the Oregon health plan. I was in the State  legislature then, and we had to plead and beg with the administration  at the time to get approval to try and experiment on Medicaid coverage  to expand coverage and improve access to care. We couldn't do it  without Mother Washington, Father Washington, or Brother Washington,  whoever, back here, saying: Yeah, okay. We will let you try that.   We should be in partnerships with our States.   By the way, States can pass a law and say: We are not going down this  path. They have every right to do it. New Jersey has done it, and  California has done it: None of these short-term duration plans, we are  not going to be a part of that.   Every State has that right. But there are a lot of States that look  at their citizens and say: $38,000 a year for your insurance and  $11,000 for your deductible; you are making $70,000; you are 60 years  old. That is not working real well either. So maybe we can find a  product that would work for you and help you out.   So we are talking about a range of options and choices. America has  always done well and markets do better when we have more choices. That  is what we are talking about here.   The gentleman's amendment I don't object to at all. I think it is the  underlying law as described by the head of the Department who would  have to approve all these 1332 waivers.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, let's talk about this amendment.   I have talked earlier about all the things that need to be  reauthorized--community health centers, special diabetes programs, all  of that which I know the committee is aware of and I hope we begin  marking. I wish we were dealing with that today.   I heard from the gentlewoman about Republicans and preexisting  conditions and ``Where is your plan?'' It is sitting up in the Rules  Committee because your party would not allow my amendment to do that  and to be brought to the floor for debate today. I don't control the  Rules Committee. It is 2 to 1 by the majority. It is just the way it  works around here, and I respect that.   But you allowed my amendments that were more in jest about the false  nature of the title of the bill to be debated but not the substantive  amendment I offered which does protect people with preexisting  conditions in case the lawsuit were to prevail and ObamaCare is thrown  out. But, no, we couldn't have that debate.   I have asked for my bill to be considered in the committee of  jurisdiction. That hasn't happened either.   I have also asked for the Democrats' one-size-fits-all takeover of  healthcare, Medicare for All, however you want to describe it, that we  have a hearing in Energy and Commerce. That hasn't happened either. We  are the committee of jurisdiction.   You talk about working people. It is ObamaCare that puts a 40 percent  tax on union plans and employer plans that exceed a certain level of  costs, and they don't index it. Now, I don't know where the gentlewoman  is on the Cadillac tax, but I want to repeal it. I never voted for it.                                time  1715    So, if they want to enshrine the Affordable Care Act in its entirety  and make no changes, then I guess they are for a 40 percent tax on the  kind of insurance plans that my building tradespeople negotiated to  get--and other unions--instead of getting wage increases.   We have delayed that.   And when we look at the cuts in the Affordable Care Act coming at our  hospitals in rural areas that serve lower-income areas, the DSH  payments, we put off those cuts to our hospitals--last cycle--under  Republican leadership. And we are going to face that question in this  Congress under Democrat leadership.   So, a vote to delay those DSH cuts again--if one does that--is voting  to repeal or delay part of ObamaCare.   I hear 60, 70 votes to do these things to ObamaCare--repeal the CLASS  Act, which was a long-term health insurance program that was destined  for failure, and even President Obama signed its repeal.   I can go through a whole list of things that got repealed. We are the  only ones who ever get tagged with voting to repeal.   As far as our commitment to preexisting conditions protection: It is  real, it is robust, and it was always in everything we did.   Yeah, I know what the political rhetoric was. I have run campaigns. I  have been around that. I know how you can nuance around. But we always  protected people with preexisting conditions--always, period, hard  stop. Protected people with preexisting conditions, in what came out of  my committee and came across this House floor, they were always  covered--always.   So I hear the political rhetoric, but I know the facts. See, I am an  old journalism major, and I believe in facts.   The facts of the matter are that 1332 waivers have given our States  an opportunity to give our citizens an affordable health insurance  plan, not one that I guess they will defend--$38,000 a year in  premiums, $11,000 a year in deductibles, copays, out-of-pocket costs.   How is that working for anybody?   And shouldn't that 60-year-old couple in Nebraska have a chance to  have a better plan option? Nope, guess not. Washington is going to  decide it all for you. Write your check: 38 grand. That is for the  premiums. And $11,000 in out-of-pocket costs, your deductibles. Then  maybe you can get something covered, right?   Well, what is left? We know from this Kaiser study I have cited  earlier that was in Axios: People wipe out their savings. They put it  on their credit cards. They borrow from their friends. Or they simply  don't get coverage.   That is the world they want to freeze-frame and leave in place. That  is not what the Republicans are for. We want innovation. We want  choice. We believe in our States having the opportunity to innovate and  do it even better, not to go back to the old ways. No. That is not what  we are for. I know that is what Democrats want to label us as being  for, but it is not true.   And we have proven results in opioids; Community Health Centers; the  longest funding for Children's Health Insurance Program in the history  of the United States of America, under Republican leadership--10 years.   We are the ones, Republicans, who led the effort to invest in medical  research at unprecedented rates under  [[Page H3545]]  what Fred Upton put forward and what Newt Gingrich put forward.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.  [[Page H3548]]     Oh, yes, I am, Madam Speaker, in its current form.    Madam Speaker, this bill is blatantly political in its  title. The misleading title of the bill confirms the Democratic  majority's passion to score political points instead of governing.  Madam Speaker, they claim the agenda is ``for the people.'' This bill  is ``for the politics'' and the TV ads.   This motion to recommit is simple, Madam Speaker. First, it strikes  the Democrats' misleading title, and it includes findings to make clear  that, under current law, Health and Human Services cannot waive  protections for individuals with preexisting conditions, period. They  are protected.   Second, Madam Speaker, the motion to recommit would prohibit the  Secretaries of HHS and Treasury from reissuing substantially similar  guidance, including guidance that allows the State to waive guaranteed  availability and renewability of health insurance, the prohibition on  using health status to vary premiums, and the prohibition on  preexisting conditions exclusions.   Madam Speaker, the Trump administration guidance does not amend  section 1332. It does not permit the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to waive protections for individuals with preexisting  conditions, like guaranteed availability and renewability of health  insurance, like the prohibition on using health status to vary  premiums, and the prohibition on preexisting conditions exclusions.   Moreover, the President's guidance stipulates that any section 1332  waiver will need to carefully account for any impact on the individual  market risk pool and guarantee--guarantee--that access to coverage is  at least as comprehensive and as affordable as would exist without the  waiver.   Now, this is fully explained, Madam Speaker, in the letter I have  here from the head of CMS, Seema Verma, and I want to quote directly  from it because I think it is important for our Members to understand  the facts of the matter here, because facts matter.   ``To be very clear, the 2018 guidance does nothing to erode,'' I am  going to say ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act's ``preexisting  condition provisions''--nothing--``which cannot be waived under section  1332. Section 1332 does not permit States to waive Public Health  Service Act requirements such as guaranteed availability and  renewability of health insurance, the prohibition on using health  status to vary premiums, and the prohibition on preexisting conditions  exclusions.''   Now why are we here? Why are we having this discussion? Because  people at home can't afford the health insurance they are being  peddled, and we want States to be able to innovate and cut costs for  consumers. That is why we are here. That is what we are for.   Democrats don't want that. Democrats are opposed to letting States  innovate, apparently. And let's look at what happens.   Madam Speaker, according to Health and Human Services Administrator  Seema Verma, Grand Island, Nebraska, a 60-year-old couple making  $70,000 a year is paying about $38,000 for their insurance premiums,  and that plan, under ObamaCare, gets them an $11,100 deductible.   $38,000 in premiums, $11,000 in deductibles, and they call that  coverage. I call that unaffordable.   Now, meanwhile, we have seven States that have used the authority  under the last administration. See, ObamaCare allows this 1332; Trump  expands it. They have been able to drive down premiums by 19.9 percent.  My State, it is 6 percent; other States have been more. Alaska, New  Jersey, other States have taken advantage of this.   Republicans and Democrats agree we will always protect people with  preexisting conditions. We will always do that. They can run their ads;  they can deceive people; they can mislead people, Madam Speaker; but we  will always fight to protect people with preexisting conditions-- always. Our plan last year did it. Our plan this year does it.   I will tell you what, Madam Speaker. We would have a vote today on  the House floor to do that, to actually enshrine in statute,  irrespective of the lawsuit, protections for Americans with preexisting  conditions, except the Democrats and the Rules Committee refuse to  allow that amendment to be considered on the House floor. They would  not do that, because it was my amendment; it is my bill.   I have been pleading to have this bill considered so we can lock into  statute protections for Americans' preexisting conditions. They want  the argument. They want the politics. They don't want the policy.   We are for innovation; we are for lower premiums; we are for more  consumer choice; and we are for driving down the cost of healthcare in  America so people have coverage they can afford, Madam Chair. That is  what our motion to recommit will do, and I urge our support.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
