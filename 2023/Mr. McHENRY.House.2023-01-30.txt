 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 500) to amend the Investment Company Act of 1940 to postpone  the date of payment or satisfaction upon redemption of certain  securities in the case of the financial exploitation of specified  adults, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 500         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Financial Exploitation       Prevention Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. REDEMPTION OF CERTAIN SECURITIES POSTPONED.         (a) In General.--Section 22 of the Investment Company Act       of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-22) is amended by adding at the end       the following:        ``(h) Requirements With Respect to Non-Institutional Direct       At-Fund Accounts.--        ``(1) Election.--        ``(A) In general.--A registered open-end investment company       and a transfer agent described under paragraph (2) may elect       to comply with the requirements under paragraph (2) and       subsection (i) by notifying the Commission of such election.        ``(B) Effect of election.--Paragraph (2) and subsection (i)       shall only apply to a registered open-end investment company       and a transfer agent that have made the election under       subparagraph (A).        ``(2) Requirements.--In the case of a customer who is a       holder of a non-institutional account held directly with a       registered open-end investment company and serviced by a       transfer agent (a `direct-at-fund account'), the company and       transfer agent shall--        ``(A) request from such customer the name and contact       information of at least one individual who--        ``(i) is at the time of such request an adult;

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 500, the Financial  Exploitation Prevention Act, a bipartisan bill that will help combat  the financial exploitation of our seniors and other vulnerable adults.   I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the new chair of  the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, for her work on this bill.   Financial exploitation, particularly of seniors and other vulnerable  adults, is a serious and growing issue. Consider this: The number of  Americans age 65 and older is projected to nearly double from 52  million in 2018 to 95 million by 2060. At the same time, the 65 and  older age group's share of the total population is predicted to rise  from 16 percent to 23 percent. Right now, approximately 44 percent of  households are headed by a baby boomer, and 30 percent of Silent  Generation and GI Generation households own mutual funds.   As more and more investors transition into retirement, the risk of  financial exploitation for older households will only increase. Right  now, roughly one in five senior investors already fall prey to  fraudsters, losing an estimated $2.9 billion annually. Those are just  the cases we know about. Unfortunately, there is research that shows  only 1 in 44 cases of financial abuse is ever reported.   This bill provides a tool to fight against this type of elder abuse.   Some mutual fund shareholder accounts are held directly with the  mutual fund and serviced by the fund's transfer agent, otherwise known  as direct-at-fund accounts. The transfer agent is typically responsible  for opening and servicing the accounts, managing account records, and  serving as the fund's point of contact with those shareholders.   Under current law, when a funds transfer agent suspects financial  exploitation in a direct-at-fund account, it cannot lawfully delay the  disbursement or redemption proceeds while an investigation occurs. This  bill would codify a 2018 Securities and Exchange Commission-issued no- action letter that permits a mutual fund and its transfer agent to  delay the redemption period of a security if it is reasonably believed  that a request was made by exploited seniors or other vulnerable  adults.   In many cases, this work is done by financial firms using technology.  That technology is widely available across financial platforms, and  this is enabling that technology to flag a question and give pause to  the movement of funds, thereby protecting a senior's accounts.   Codifying this Securities and Exchange Commission no-action letter  will provide our potentially at-risk investors with the protection they  need to make sure they can receive the hard-earned savings that they  have built up over the years.   This is an important bill. It takes the existing practice from the  Securities and Exchange Commission and makes it law, giving it a  stronger force of protection for our seniors.   It is a bipartisan bill. I am very proud that this is the first bill  reported out of the House Financial Services Committee and that it has  bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption and support of this bill. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Capital Markets.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Lawler), the newest member of the House Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I said to the ranking member that I was prepared to  close. We have a Member that just arrived, and I am going to allow her  to have a closing statement here.   I thank the ranking member, Mr. Speaker, and her staff working with  the Republican staff of the House Financial Services Committee for  being able to move these first pieces of legislation. We have three  bills that are on the suspension calendar this evening that are  bipartisan bills. One has a primary sponsor by a Democrat, and two have  primary sponsors by Republicans, but all are bipartisan. I thank the  ranking member for her willingness to work across the aisle to move  bipartisan legislation.   In doing this, I recall the beginning of last Congress 2 years ago,  and 2 years before that, when she reached out to Republicans in the  then-minority and offered us the same thing. I am grateful for that  outreach 2 and 4 years ago.   I have extended the same hand to the gentlewoman from California, and  she has likewise extended the same hand to me. Mr. Speaker, I am very  grateful for the leadership of the ranking member and her willingness  to work with us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Houchin), a new member of the House Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 582) to amend the Federal Credit Union Act to modify the  frequency of board of directors meetings, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 582         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Credit Union Board       Modernization Act''.       SEC. 2. FREQUENCY OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETINGS.         Section 113 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C.       1761b) is amended--        (1) by striking ``monthly'' each place such term appears;        (2) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking       ``The board of directors'' and inserting the following:        ``(a) In General.--The board of directors'';        (3) in subsection (a) (as so designated), by striking       ``shall meet at least once a month and''; and        (4) by adding at the end the following:        ``(b) Meetings.--The board of directors of a Federal credit       union shall meet as follows:        ``(1) With respect to a de novo Federal credit union, not       less frequently than monthly during each of the first five       years of the existence of such Federal credit union.        ``(2) Not less than six times annually, with at least one       meeting held during each fiscal quarter, with respect to a       Federal credit union--        ``(A) with composite rating of either 1 or 2 under the       Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (or an       equivalent rating under a comparable rating system); and        ``(B) with a capability of management rating under such       composite rating of either 1 or 2.        ``(3) Not less frequently than once a month, with respect       to a Federal credit union--        ``(A) with composite rating of either 3, 4, or 5 under the       Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (or an       equivalent rating under a comparable rating system); or        ``(B) with a capability of management rating under such       composite rating of either 3, 4, or 5.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 582, the Credit Union Board Modernization  Act.   Every day, consumers in each of our districts rely on their local  credit union to help them with things like securing a loan to buy a  home, saving for retirement, or even financing tuition. This means that  credit unions need to spend their time working with their members, not  wasting valuable resources and staff time checking the box on monthly  meetings that may not be necessary.   This bill allows credit unions to do that important work. By updating  the Federal Credit Union Act to reduce the frequency of required board  meetings, certain Federal credit unions will have greater flexibility  in meeting requirements. At the same time, the safety and soundness of  the financial system will be protected.   Currently, Federal credit union boards are required to meet at least  once per month. Under the bill's new requirements, Federal credit  unions with a composite CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 will be required to  meet at least six times annually, with at least one meeting held during  each fiscal quarter.   What does that mean? It means entities with the strongest performance  and risk management practices will be rewarded. That means, instead of  checking the box on those monthly meetings, if they have high-quality  performance and risk management, they will be relieved of some of those  burdens.   To be clear, this is not a one-size-fits-all mandate. There is  nothing in the bill that prevents those credit union boards from  meeting each month or even more often, if needed, and they do. In times  of financial stress, these boards meet quite frequently to assess risks  and to protect their members' nest eggs.   This bill also acknowledges that new or poor-performing credit unions  may require more regular meetings to ensure that they can provide the  level of service their communities deserve. This legislation continues  to require monthly meetings for new Federal credit unions during the  first 5 years of existence.   In addition, credit unions with a composite CAMELS rating of 3, 4, or  5 must continue to meet once a month. These are the credit unions that  need to improve performance and risk management practices to ensure the  safety and soundness of our financial system.   Mr. Speaker, I will finish with this: This bill is a good  illustration of how Members can come together to create bipartisan  legislation to modernize outdated practices and policies for the  benefit of our communities' financial institutions and for their  members.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Huizenga), the chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations, for his good work last Congress and this Congress on  this bill, and a bipartisan bill indeed this is.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I urge my  colleagues' adoption and support of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the chair of the Financial  Services Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   This is the case on the House Financial Services Committee, when we  see a challenge that has a commonsense solution, we try to tackle it  and we try to tackle it in a bipartisan way.   I want to concur with Mr. Huizenga in his praise of Mr. Vargas. This  was a bipartisan bill between Mr. Vargas and Mr. Huizenga last  Congress, and it continues to be a bipartisan bill this Congress.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Vargas, for offering it, and I thank the  ranking member for working with me and with my team to bring these  three bipartisan bills before the full House in the opening month of  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this bill's adoption, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 298) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to expand  access to capital for rural-area small businesses, and for other  purposes.  [[Page H503]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 298         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Access to Capital       for Rural Job Creators Act''.       SEC. 2. ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR RURAL-AREA SMALL BUSINESSES.         Section 4(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15       U.S.C. 78d(j)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (4)(C), by inserting ``rural-area small       businesses,'' after ``women-owned small businesses,''; and        (2) in paragraph (6)(B)(iii), by inserting ``rural-area       small businesses,'' after ``women-owned small businesses,''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 298, the Expanding  Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators Act.   I thank Congressman Mooney and my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle for their work on this issue last Congress and this Congress.   In the Financial Services Committee, we continually highlight the  importance of capital formation for entrepreneurs and job creators in  underbanked rural communities. That means their ability to get a loan,  their ability to get investment capital. We want to enhance every  American's ability to get access to capital to take their ideas to  market.   I can speak from experience about the struggles emerging  entrepreneurs face when starting or growing their own small business.   My father started a business in our backyard, mowing grass for other  people. He and his buddy both had five kids. I am the youngest of five  kids. My dad's business partner had five kids. They had plenty of free  labor. What they didn't have access to was capital or investment  capital. So his first piece of lending was done because he had a Toro,  which was the best lawnmower you could get at the time. A Toro  salesperson so wanted to make the sale that he let him use the  equipment until my father and his business partner could get paid from  the hospital where they were mowing the grass. That was the first piece  of equipment they got, because the sales guy wanted to make the sale.   The second piece of equipment they got was a truck, to put that lawn  mower in the back of, that they got using a Master Charge, which is now  Mastercard. They used a credit card to buy a truck. They put a rope  around this very expensive riding lawnmower in the back of this beat-up  pickup truck.   That was the dream for both families that put five kids through  college. Both families, five kids. Ten kids total put through college.  Now, my brother runs that business that my father started in our  backyard.   The question of access to capital, if you don't have friends that  have personal wealth, it is very difficult in this country. It is in  rural communities. It is in urban communities. We have areas of this  country that are underbanked and resource starved. It doesn't mean that  they have less good ideas because of where they are born. They don't.  That is not connected with this. They are starved for capital.   What we need to do, in a bipartisan way, and what we have had  conversations on in a bipartisan way on our committee, is how to fix  that problem. We are trying because we have communities across this  country that are being left behind. That is completely unacceptable.   This is a bipartisan bill that tries to get at that and help small  businesses that are vulnerable in rural communities.   Research shows that after the last financial crisis, small businesses  and startups were less likely to form in rural areas than in urban  areas. Now, these same small businesses are facing record inflation and  supply chain disruptions.   In recent years, the SEC's Small Business Advocate found that rural  businesses that seek investor capital are raising higher amounts.  However, rural businesses are still raising less capital than their  urban counterparts relative to the size of the affected population.   But even the urban numbers misrepresent what is happening in urban  areas in this country. Just because a big business is headquartered in  an urban area doesn't mean they are serving the urban area or that they  are employing in that urban area. So we have got huge challenges.   In rural areas, which this bill deals with, every small business and  entrepreneur counts. They are the lifeblood of the local economy, and  their success is critical to the success of their community. This bill  is just one example of how Congress can help solve one of the issues  that rural small businesses face: access to capital.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Mooney for his work on this bill. I  urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with the words of the ranking  member.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the vice chair of the Financial Services  Committee and the chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for her words and comments  here. It is true we have worked together on capital formation  initiatives in previous Congresses and I would hope that we will be  able to do the same.   I know of her upbringing in Missouri and her career in California.  She has both rural and urban experiences that she can bring to this and  I, likewise, have mainly rural upbringing to bring to this, but I think  together we can craft a smart agenda, address the needs of the American  people, and that is my intention with a focus on capital formation  across the country, with the needs of a modern economy to digitize so  many of our processes in the world of financial services, and the need  to give architecture to a new range of assets that are in the financial  services world around cryptocurrency and digital assets.   There is a lot that is happening here that we have to embrace and  allow that prosperity to be spread across the country. Working  together, I think we can do that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this piece of legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
