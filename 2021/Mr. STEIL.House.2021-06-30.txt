 Madam Speaker, bolstering our infrastructure against  cyberattacks and ransomware attacks is an issue that concerns every  American. It is not Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative.   As we have seen from the recent Colonial Pipeline hack and the  shutdown of the world's largest beef supplier, JBS, there are alarming  cybersecurity weaknesses in America's critical infrastructure.   Immediate action must be taken to protect America's infrastructure  against our adversaries. That is why we must pass my amendment to the  surface transportation bill.   My proposal is simple. It is focused. It does not grow the size of  the Federal Government.   My amendment requires the GAO, the Government Accountability Office,  to study the vulnerabilities within our transportation system to combat  cyberattacks.   This study will show us and accurately allow us to plan, invest, and  put forth policies that address our susceptibilities to future threats.   I thank my colleagues from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania for joining  me in this effort, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  amendment.                            ____________________
