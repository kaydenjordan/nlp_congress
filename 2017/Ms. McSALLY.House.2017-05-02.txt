 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague. And yes, I  just came over from a hearing on the Armed Services Committee; first  panel with some victims, and second panel with the superintendents of  the different military academies.                                time  1845    As the only female veteran on my side of the aisle, and having been  an academy graduate myself, I thought it was very important for me to  be there and continue to help to lead on these issues that are near and  dear to my heart. I know there has been much discussion. I want to say  thank-you for helping to organize this and manage it and all the people  who came down to speak on this very important issue.   As was likely mentioned before, we came upon this issue on Saturday,  March 4. The Marines United Facebook page discovered individuals linked  with this private group were posting nude, intimate photos of women, as  well as personal information, their names, and duty stations, without  their consent or their knowledge.   The next day, the NCIS started to launch an investigation and, 1 week  [[Page H3058]]  later, discovered, unfortunately, this was not an isolated activity.  Sharing intimate photos without a consent is a problem that now we are  seeing in the other branches of the military.   Such degrading behavior from troops in uniform is disgusting. As a  veteran and a former commander myself, it is infuriating. In some ways  it is not surprising, but it is intolerable, and we rise on both sides  of the aisle today to say that we are standing together to help on our  part, in our appropriate role to stop this.   Our servicemembers enlist to serve this country and protect it from  our enemies. They should not have to watch their backs among  individuals who are to be their teammates. Sharing explicit photos of  fellow servicemembers undermines women and destroys trust and morale.  It decreases effectiveness of our Armed Forces, and it embarrasses  America. United States troops must be warriors. What it means to be a  warrior is to embody courage, commitment, honor, trust, and respect. In  all the services we have our core values. They are on and off duty.  That is what it means to stand up. We stand in the gap for others. We  are not the perpetrators. We are supposed to be the protecters. We are  supposed to be the ones who are embodying and leading in those values  that we hold dear.   The unearthing of this widespread problem has highlighted the  difficulty in prosecuting Active Duty military members, though, who do  this, who share private, intimate photos of their teammates without  consent. This action is harmful, and it destroys the bonds of trust in  the unit that are so critical for our warfighting capabilities.   So to look at the UCMJ, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, again,  I am pretty familiar with this having been a commander and a retired  colonel. We have a couple of articles, article 133 and article 134.  Article 133 is conduct unbecoming of an officer. Article 134 is what we  call anything that is prejudicial to good order and discipline. This is  one I would say as a commander we often use as the catchall article.  When we could not prosecute someone under another article, we go to  article 134 because we knew their behavior was degrading good order and  discipline.   Civilian law faces challenges in prosecuting this crime. Thirty-five  States and the District of Columbia have statutes against sharing  private, intimate digital media without consent, but the State laws  vary in their proof, the elements, and the punishment.   The Marines recently created a regulation where they can charge these  Neanderthals who commit these violations, but creating regulation isn't  the same thing as strengthening the law. That is why I introduced the  PRIVATE Act. Again, this is a bipartisan bill. My bill provides clear,  unambiguous charge that gives commanders a sharper tool in the UCMJ for  targeting and prosecuting this behavior. It clearly defines this  behavior as a crime, and it also addresses the issues of intent and  free speech.   These actions are a symptom of a larger issue: why we must change the  culture that promotes this behavior. While these blatant, disrespectful  actions have been committed by a specific subset of our military, this  is indicative of a larger cultural problem. I just came from speaking  about that in our Air Force Academy hearings--I'm sorry, not just Air  Force, all the academies.   This is not the first time that behavior like this or culture like  this has really been addressed, nor will it be the last. Myself, as the  first woman in the U.S. to fly in combat in a fighter aircraft and to  command a squadron, I have personally experienced, confronted, and  overcome sexist behavior in the military. I have been there, I have  seen it, I have lived it, and, quite frankly, I am sick of it.   We need to do what we can together to stop it. We must confront the  underlying issues that inculcate resentment toward women in our  services. We need to address the topic now and send a clear message  this behavior has no place in our military. The issue is developing at  the speed of broadband, but our solutions are often stuck at the speed  of bureaucracy.   I have met with the commandant of the Marine Corps, General Neller,  immediately after this news broke. We had a very productive  conversation, and I look forward to continuing work with him and the  other service chiefs to address this issue.   We also can't allow this to turn into victim blaming, though.  According to one victim who tried to have a video removed:   ``I went to the police to get them to take it down, and they told me,  because I didn't live in North Carolina, they couldn't do anything. I  then went to his command, and they said: Why don't you stop making sex  tapes?''   This is not a matter of free speech on the internet. This is a matter  of military members who have infringed on the rights, the duty, and the  basic respect of others. We can't afford to let another military member  become a victim of this crime.   I appreciate everyone stepping up for this Special Order today. I  appreciate the bipartisan support of the PRIVATE Act. It is not going  to solve it by itself, but it is going to give the commanders another  tool. I promise I am going to tirelessly be working and leading on this  issue to protect our troops and make sure we have the best, most  respected, and most trusted warfighting force.   I want to thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to speak.
