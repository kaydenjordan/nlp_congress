 Mr. Speaker, Barton College in Wilson,  North Carolina, hosted Military Appreciation Day this past weekend.   The Bulldogs brought the community together to honor our veterans and  for a good, hard-hitting football game.   We celebrated a true American hero, Brigadier General Norman ``Snap''  Gaddis. General Gaddis is a World War II fighter pilot who turned 100  years old this past September. He flew 72 combat missions before being  listed missing in action, a prisoner of war held by the North  Vietnamese for nearly 6 years and holds a Purple Heart.   The Bulldogs also recognized marine veteran and State representative  Ken Fontenot.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Barton president Doug Searcy, first lady  Beth Searcy, the board chair Eric Sellers, and the entire Bulldog  family for honoring our veterans and their families.                            ____________________
