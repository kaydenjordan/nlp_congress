 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the aid  that we will deliver today.   My small State of Connecticut will soon pass 2,000 fatalities. These  are our neighbors. These are people we know and love.   Madam Speaker, I celebrate the bipartisanship that will be  demonstrated today. It will save lives.   Our small businesses are critical to our economy and to opportunity,  but so are our hospitals and the heroes who work in those hospitals. So  are our EMTs and our paramedics and our police officers and our  firefighters. I say that not to make a political point, but to say that  they will need our help in the coming days, and we need to tease out  more bipartisanship to get that done quickly.
