 Mr. Speaker, it is with a mixture of some sadness, but  mostly appreciation, that I come to the floor today to recognize the  contributions of my staff director at the Small Business Committee,  Kevin Fitzpatrick, who is retiring at the end of this Congress. Kevin  and I have worked together for a quarter century now, and he is the  last remaining member of my original staff when I was first sworn into  Congress back in 1995.   While I am happy for Kevin that he will soon have more time to spend  with his lovely wife, Pam, and his wonderful children, Spike, Katie,  and Elizabeth, he will be impossible to replace. Over the years, Kevin  has played an integral role in nearly every legislative accomplishment  we have achieved for Ohio's First Congressional District and for the  American people.   Kevin Fitzpatrick is the kind of person who can build an instant  rapport with anyone, a skill that is extremely valuable in politics.  Whether it is a family here from back home in Cincinnati, a foreign  dignitary, or even a political opponent, Kevin is always ready with a  disarming story that puts others at ease.   Although he has worked on the Hill for a long time, Kevin's roots are  back in Ohio. He grew up with his loving family in Shelby, Ohio, and  graduated from Miami University back in the days when not only the  Washington professional football team but also Miami were known as the  Redskins.   Kevin nearly became a candidate for office himself when he was asked  to consider running against a then young Ohio State Representative  named Sherrod Brown. Had he not decided against it, Kevin might well be  serving with me here in the House, rather than having this speech given  in his honor today.   I am actually the third Congressman Kevin has worked for. His first  job in Washington was for legendary Ohio conservative Congressman John  Ashbrook, who interestingly ran against Richard Nixon in the Republican  Presidential primary in 1972.   Later, Kevin worked for Congressman Duncan Hunter, Sr. on the  Republican Research Committee, which was part of leadership at the  time.   When I ran and won my seat in Congress in 1994 in the Republican  revolution, I was a Washington outsider and so were most of my  supporters. I desperately needed someone who knew not  [[Page H7058]]  only Ohio, but also had the experience and understood how to get things  done here in Washington. And that made Kevin Fitzpatrick a natural fit  as my legislative director.    I have served on three committees during my 25 years here in  Congress: Foreign Affairs, Judiciary, and Small Business. Kevin has had  a profound impact on my policy agenda on all three committees over the  years.   On Foreign Affairs, we have worked on more issues than I could  possibly relate here, but some of our most significant accomplishments  have been in advancing the relationship between the United States and  our democratic ally, Taiwan, in the face of the existential threat  posed by communist China. Kevin was instrumental in helping me create  the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, along with former Congressmen Robert  Wexler, Dana Rohrabacher, and then-Representative, now Senator Sherrod  Brown.   Over the years, we have pushed many pro-democracy and pro-Taiwan  initiatives, one of the most significant being the Taiwan Travel Act,  which will now allow diplomatic visits between top U.S. and Taiwanese  officials.   Judiciary. Throughout his life, Kevin has been a warrior for the  unborn. He has played a significant role in the promotion of pro-life  legislative initiatives. Those efforts ultimately led to the most  significant Federal pro-life legislation enacted since the infamous Roe  v. Wade decision, the Federal ban on partial birth abortion signed into  law by President Bush back in 2003 and ultimately upheld to be  constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. Kevin was front and center in  those efforts, and I know he is as proud of that accomplishment as I  am.   In recent years, Kevin has led the Small Business Committee as my  staff director. In that role, Kevin has put together what I believe to  be the best committee staff on the Hill: Jan Oliver, Joe Hartz, Rob  Yavor, Delia Barr, Allison Kerman, Vivian Ling, and Rachel Emmons.   Perhaps the greatest testament to Kevin's leadership occurred earlier  this year with the creation and implementation of the Paycheck  Protection Program, or PPP. This critical program saved millions of  small businesses across America that would otherwise have gone under  during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most importantly saved over 50  million jobs.   Finally, during the course of Kevin Fitzpatrick's career, he has  hired, trained, and mentored so many people currently working both on  and off the Hill. He has shared his knowledge, his experience, and his  commitment to improving our country with each and every one of them.   It will now be their turn to teach new staff members how to make the  people's House truly work for the people.   They couldn't have had a better teacher, a better mentor, or a better  example than Kevin Fitzpatrick.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Kevin for his service, his dedication, and his  friendship. He will be missed.                            ____________________
