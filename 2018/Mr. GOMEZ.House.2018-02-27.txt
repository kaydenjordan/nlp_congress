 Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about something that gives me  hope in the wake of the senseless tragedies and attacks on our  communities: the power of students to change the course of history.   Fifty years ago this week, 15,000 students in East Los Angeles rose  up in solidarity to demand culturally relevant education, better  facilities, and diverse teachers. I rise in honor of those students  from Wilson, Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Belmont High Schools, who started  a movement that would be known as the East Los Angeles walkouts.   I also rise in honor of current student activists everywhere. Student  activism has always been a powerful response to social injustice, that  when those in power fail to listen or to act in the interests of all  people, it is time for a new generation of Americans to speak up, walk  out, and organize.   Whether you were in East Los Angeles in 1968 or in Parkland, Florida,  in 2018, you will be heard, you will be remembered, and you will become  the change that we all seek.                            ____________________
