 I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to reintroduce a  bill that didn't get passed last Congress, a bill that deals with  safety in our schools, a bill aimed at the disasters that come when  schoolchildren are killed by shooters and to deal with this problem  through a program that the Secret Service has had for decades and  asking the Secret Service to see what they can do to apply the  principles of that program to stop mass killings at our schools.   Three years ago, on February 14, 2018, an unspeakable tragedy  occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL. In  less than 4 minutes, 14 students and 3 staff members were killed, and,  consequently, their families' and friends' lives were shattered forever  by such a senseless act.   Today, along with my colleagues Senators Rubio and Scott of Florida,  Senators Cortez Masto, Collins, Manchin, and Hassan, I am proud to  reintroduce legislation that will proactively mitigate threats of  violence on school campuses by reauthorizing and expanding the U.S.  Secret Service's program called the National Threat Assessment Center.   The National Threat Assessment Center studies targeted violence and  [[Page S825]]  develops best practices and training to identify and manage threats  before they result in violence like we saw at that school 3 years ago.   The bill establishes a Safe School Initiative, a national program on  school violence prevention, that will include expanded research on  school violence. Most importantly, this legislation allows the Secret  Service to directly equip communities and schools with training and  best practices on recognizing and preventing school violence.   This bill, which I hope will help us to recognize the signs of a  potential attack way long before such an attack occurs, carries the  namesake of those it couldn't save, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School mascot, so this bill is called the EAGLES Act because that is  the mascot of that school.   Two years ago, the Secret Service conducted a review of school  shootings and made a very pivotal finding: All attackers exhibited  concerning behaviors prior to engaging in an act of violence. In other  words, it should be easy to identify these people, and, if identified,  intervention is possible. So had these signs been recognized at an  early enough stage, these attacks could have been stopped.   In the wake of the Parkland shooting in 2018, Congress took steps to  protect schools and to prevent gun violence, including the passage of  the Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing School Violence Act,  which provided funding to schools to strengthen their infrastructure to  make it more difficult for shooters to enter schools.   At that same time, we passed the Fix NICS Act, a law which penalizes  Federal agencies that fail to comply with legal requirements to report  dangerous individuals and violent criminals to the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System so that if they are so reported, then  they won't be able to purchase a gun. However, by passing the EAGLES  Act, we are entering a vital third step in addition to those other two  bills to protect our schools.   I would like to encourage all of my Senate colleagues to support this  bipartisan and, I think, a very commonsense bill. I hope that we can  focus on productive measures like these rather than unfocused efforts  to undermine lawful gun ownership                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor to reintroduce a  bill that didn't get passed last Congress, a bill that deals with  safety in our schools, a bill aimed at the disasters that come when  schoolchildren are killed by shooters and to deal with this problem  through a program that the Secret Service has had for decades and  asking the Secret Service to see what they can do to apply the  principles of that program to stop mass killings at our schools.
