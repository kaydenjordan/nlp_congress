 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in  permitting me to speak on this bill.   I never served in theater, but I have worked on this issue for 14  years. We started with Senator John McCain and Senator Kennedy, and it  moved forward on a bipartisan basis, both the House and the Senate,  with the special immigrant visa. But, sadly, it always was too slow,  too bureaucratic, and there really wasn't the sense of urgency that was  necessary to make sure that the people who put their lives on the line  to help Americans in these difficult circumstances were dealt with.   Something has changed. First of all, President Biden has made an  extraordinarily difficult call that we are going to wind down that  presence of the United States in terms of military. It is a difficult  call. It was one that needed to be made because the circumstances were  not going to change. If it was 5 years, 10 years, it would just be more  billions of dollars and more lives; putting off the day of reckoning.   I admire the President for doing so, but I hope he brings that same  sense of urgency to deal with these people who we can't afford to leave  behind.   Another thing that has changed is the energy of new Members of  Congress who served in the theater; my colleague, Jason Crow. We just  heard from Peter Meijer. They have added a sense of urgency on a  bipartisan basis that has helped us craft this legislation, that will  solve the problems if we are willing to implement it in full force.   I call upon the administration to expedite the transition. I call on  all of us to continue to make sure that we provide the resources, the  attention, and the urgency to make the program successful. But make no  mistake, we have a lot of work to do to protect people who helped us.  Being a friend should not be fatal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge approval of this legislation as an important next  step and urge that we redouble our efforts to make it successful.
