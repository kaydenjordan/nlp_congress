 HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  highlight the importance of participation in the upcoming 2020 Census,  and specifically the critical importance of getting a full count of  Tribal Nation citizens.   Census results affect our communities every day. As the official  count of how many people live in our communities, the Census determines  everything from plans for highways, to funding for special education,  and support for our firefighters.   The results of the 2020 Census will help determine how hundreds of  billions of dollars in Federal funding flow into communities every year  for the next decade.   Think of our local schools: Census counts help determine how money is  allocated for Head Start early education programs and for grants that  support college access and education programs for children with  disabilities.   But that is not all. The Census determines Federal funding for  SoonerCare, foster care programs, housing assistance, infrastructure  investments, and so much more. We have to make sure that every  Oklahoman is counted so that our communities receive the support they  need.   This past week, I was proud to introduce bipartisan legislation  encouraging Federal, State, local governments, and Tribal Nations to  work together as partners to encourage participation in the 2020 Census  among American Indians and Alaskan natives.   Today, Oklahoma is home to 39 Tribes. The Census ensures we make a  strong investment in Oklahoma and provide resources to Tribal Nations  that fulfill the Federal-Indian trust responsibility. Funding for  critical healthcare programs, housing initiatives, and education is at  stake.   For too long, Tribal Nations have been shortchanged in Federal  funding  [[Page H1443]]  due to a Census that has historically undercounted Native American  populations.                                time  1015    In the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau estimates that American Indians  and Alaska Natives were undercounted by approximately 4.9 percent, more  than double the undercount rate of the next closest population group.   The negative consequences of undercounting cannot be quickly  corrected. The Census occurs only once every 10 years, and as a result,  undercounting Tribal nations can significantly reduce Federal funding  levels for important programs for an entire decade.   Over 300 Federal programs rely on data derived from the Census, and  Tribal nations rely on many of them. They include Native American  schools and education programs; Native American workforce programs;  Tribal health programs; Tribal housing programs; water and sewage  projects; and transit, infrastructure, and economic development  programs.   We must ensure Native voices are heard and counted. The Census is an  opportunity, not a threat.   Responses to the 2020 Census are confidential, protected by law.  Personal information is never shared by the Census Bureau with any  other government agencies or law enforcement, and responses cannot be  used against individuals by government agencies or in court in any way.   All households will receive official Census mail by April 1, and  individuals and families can respond online, by mail, by phone, or in  person.   It is critically important that all Oklahomans participate in this  Census.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from the Native American Caucus,  including co-chairs Congressman   Tom Cole from Oklahoma and  Congresswoman Deb Haaland from New Mexico, who have helped to highlight  the importance of getting a full Census count among Tribal nations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and communities to work together as  partners with Tribal nations to encourage participation in the 2020  Census and to inform the public that the 2020 Census is safe, easy, and  important.                            ____________________
