 Mr. Speaker, the horrifying reality is that, in a  matter of weeks, we could live in a post-Roe country, a country where  women no longer have the fundamental right to make decisions about  their own bodies; a country where women no longer have control over  when and how to start a family; a country where women will suddenly  face government interference in their personal lives, their privacy,  and their freedom.   Overturning Roe will not eliminate the need for abortion; it will  simply eliminate access to safe, legal abortion care. And it will take  the worst toll on poor women, women of color, and others who already  face countless barriers to healthcare.   Decisions about a woman's body are deeply personal. They should not  be controlled by politicians. Every person, no matter where they live,  how much money they make, or what they look like, deserves the right to  make their own decisions about their health, life, and future.                            ____________________
