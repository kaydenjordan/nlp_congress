 Mr. Speaker, Texas is home to many gun owners.   Growing up, my family owned guns for hunting. It was part of how we  fed our family. Thus, I don't want to infringe on Second Amendment  rights of Americans.   I do, however, want to stop the killing of innocent lives because  someone was at risk to themselves or others who bought or accessed a  firearm. Too many loopholes allow people to purchase, procure, or  access a firearm.   Too many Texans have already died in mass shootings--so this is very  personal to me--most recently, of course, in west Texas.   The House has already passed two bills that would prevent mass  shootings. Last night, three more bills were marked up and will be  ready for a floor vote.   Senate Republicans must allow a vote on gun control legislation. I am  tired of people being killed because they won't act. I end by asking  them, Mr. Speaker: What will you do to save lives? What are you afraid  of?                            ____________________
