Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3578.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill makes technical corrections to statutory  references to title 34 of the United States Code.   The title contains law pertaining to crime control and law  enforcement.   The bill was submitted to the Judiciary Committee by the nonpartisan  Office of Law Revision Counsel. The OLRC is the office that helps the  Committee with its responsibility to oversee and maintain the United  States Code.   As laws passed by Congress are incorporated into the Code, statutory  references may no longer be accurate. This bill does not substantively  change any law in the books. It simply makes technical corrections to  ensure that statutory references are kept up-to-date.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3571) to make technical amendments to update statutory references  to certain provisions classified to title 2, United States Code, title  50, United States Code, and title 52, United States Code, and to  correct related technical errors.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3571.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3571 makes technical corrections to statutory  references to title 2, title 50, and title 52 of the United States  Code.   These titles are where laws relating to Congress, war and national  defense, and voting and elections are classified.   This bill was submitted to the Judiciary Committee by the Office of  Law Revision Counsel.   These titles have been editorially reorganized to make them more  clear and accessible.   When titles of the Code are reorganized, statutory references may no  longer be accurate.   This bill does not substantively change any law on the books. It  simply updates statutory references in the Code to ensure that they are  correct.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 786) to amend title 28, United States Code, to provide an  additional place for holding court for the Pecos Division of the  Western District of Texas, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 786         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ADDITIONAL PLACES FOR HOLDING COURT.         (a) Pecos Division of the Western District of Texas.--      Section 124(d)(6) of title 28, United States Code, is       amended, in the matter preceding paragraph (7), by inserting       ``and Alpine'' after ``Pecos''.        (b) Western District of Washington.--Section 128(b) of       title 28, United States Code, is amended by inserting ``Mount       Vernon,'' after ``Tacoma,''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 786.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, our courts and judicial system are the envy of the  world.   Americans rely on the Federal courts every day to protect their  rights and obtain relief when those rights are violated.   They also are the means by which we adjudicate claims that someone  has violated our criminal laws.   That is why improving and ensuring accessibility to the courts for  our citizens is so important.   This important bill adds just four words to the United States Code to  save thousands of Americans in Texas and Washington lengthy and  burdensome trips just to reach the nearest Federal courthouse.   This bill authorizes the Federal courts in the Western District of  Texas and the Western District of Washington to hold court in Alpine,  Texas, and Mount Vernon, Washington, respectively.   Both locations already have existing facilities necessary to hold  court, so the cost of this bill is minimal.   By authorizing these courts to utilize these locations, Congress will  reduce administrative burdens on the court system and logistical  burdens on those with business before these courts.   For example, the Judicial Conference of the United States has noted  that Americans in the Western District of Texas must drive as far as  100 miles to reach the courthouse in Pecos, Texas.   The Judicial Conference has identified similar hardships for  Americans in the Western District of Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I support this commonsense, bipartisan bill, and I urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
