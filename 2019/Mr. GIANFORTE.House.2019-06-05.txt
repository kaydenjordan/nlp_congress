 Madam Speaker, 75 years ago, courageous Americans  stormed the beaches of Normandy and parachuted behind enemy lines.  Facing what Supreme Allied Commander Eisenhower described as the German  war machine, they fought for the cause of freedom.   Many Montanans were there:   Ed Seifert of Polson parachuted into Normandy. He would go on to jump  into Holland during the Battle of the Bulge;   Bud Olson of Choteau came under fire in a glider. He was the only  survivor of 28 aboard, and he would go on to liberate a concentration  camp;   Corky Apple of Lewistown came off a landing craft on Utah Beach. He  would go on to earn five Bronze Stars during the war;   John Nelson of Lolo also landed on Utah Beach. He was with Patton's  army when it liberated a concentration camp near the Czech border.   As we mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day, remember the brave  Americans who destroyed the German war machine, liberated a continent,  and saved the world from tyranny.                            ____________________
