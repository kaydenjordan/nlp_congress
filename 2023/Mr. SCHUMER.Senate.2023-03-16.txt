 Madam President, now, almost 20 years to the day that  U.S. military operations began in Iraq, the U.S. Senate begins the  process of repealing the Iraq AUMFs--the ones of 2002 and 1991--putting  the final remnants of those conflicts squarely behind us.   The United States, the Nation of Iraq, and the entire world have  changed dramatically since 2002, and it is time the laws on the books  catch up with these changes. The Iraq war has itself been long over.  This AUMF has outlived its purpose, and we can no longer justify  keeping it in effect.   While the Iraq war was the cause of so much bitterness in the past, I  am glad that repealing these AUMFs has been a genuinely bipartisan  effort. I expect we will have a number of amendment votes on the floor  once this amendment is before us, and I want to thank Senators Kaine  and Young, Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, and all the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee and the cosponsors of this legislation.   Again, this is a bipartisan process. Both parties in this Chamber  have voiced support for repeal. President Biden has voiced support for  repealing this AUMF, and in June of 2021, our House colleagues voted  268 to 168 to repeal, with 49 Republicans in support.   I hope this year, on the 20th anniversary of the start of the Iraq  war, both Chambers will finally speak in one voice and send an AUMF  repeal to the President's desk.   Americans are tired of endless wars in the Middle East. Many  Americans have come of age without even remembering the early years of  the Iraq war. Every year we leave these AUMFs on the books is another  year that a future administration can abuse them, and Congress--the  rightful dispenser of war powers--cannot allow this to continue.   I want to make this clear: Repealing this AUMF will not in any way  hinder our national defense, nor will it hurt the efforts of our troops  deployed overseas. In fact, the repeal is an important step for  strengthening our relationship with Iraq.   So once again, thank you to all my colleagues for their good work on  this resolution, and I urge everyone on both sides to vote ``yes'' on  cloture on the motion to proceed in a few hours.  [[Page S810]]         Mr. President, almost 20 years to the day since the  start of the Iraq war, the U.S. Senate is beginning the bipartisan  process of repealing the Iraq AUMF of 2002.   Repealing this AUMF is a necessary step toward putting the final  remnants of the Iraq war squarely behind us.   Every year we leave this AUMF on the books is another year a future  administration can abuse it. Congress, the rightful dispenser of war  powers, cannot allow this to continue.   Repealing the AUMF and the AUMF of 1991, as well, will not hinder our  national defense, nor will it hurt the efforts of our troops deployed  overseas.   Americans are tired of endless wars in the Middle East. I hope this  year, on the 20th anniversary of the start of the Iraq war, both  parties in both Chambers will speak with one voice.   And I want to certainly thank Senators Kaine and Young, as well as  our chair and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, who  have done such a good job on this issue, bringing it to where we are  today.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
