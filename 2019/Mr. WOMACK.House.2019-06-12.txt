 I claim the time in opposition to the gentlewoman's  amendment, Madam Chair.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentlewoman's  amendment, and count me as one who stands in support of the Trump  administration's proposals for short-term, limited duration health  plans and association health insurance plans.   With all due respect to my friend on the other side of the aisle,  this has everything to do with giving our citizens options. These plans  serve as an affordable alternative to ObamaCare health insurance plans,  particularly for individuals and families not eligible for ObamaCare  tax subsidies.   I have heard from countless small businesses in my district that say  they  [[Page H4570]]  can't afford health insurance for their employees. These alternative  plans, Madam Chair, can and often do have lower premiums and  deductibles and provide access to the same healthcare providers as some  of the ObamaCare plans.   I believe that this amendment needs to be defeated, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I will finish by saying that all through  this healthcare debate that we have had over the last 10 years--and I  have been here 8\1/2\ years of that--it has all been about access to  healthcare. This gentlewoman's amendment, Madam Chair, limits access to  healthcare.   Either they want more access to healthcare or they don't. I think if  my colleagues pass this amendment, Madam Chair, they are limiting  access to healthcare. It is for that reason that I believe we should  defeat the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
