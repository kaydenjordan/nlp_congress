 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.                       American Rescue Plan Act of 2021     Mr. President, it doesn't seem like that long ago--it  wasn't; it was only January 20 of this year--that we heard President  Biden talk about healing the divisions in our country and promoting  unity. He promised to restore respectful, bipartisan communication and  cooperation. He spoke eloquently, saying:         Without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.        No progress, only exhausting outrage.        No nation, only a state of chaos.    It really was a fine speech. But here we are, 7 weeks into the Biden  administration with a lot of bitterness and fury and outrage over the  President's first big, broken promise. On Saturday afternoon, following  an all-night voting marathon, our Democratic colleagues passed, by  themselves, their so-called COVID-19 relief bill.   Sadly, the lack of bipartisan support was not a surprise. After all,  our Democratic colleagues decided to abuse the reconciliation process  for this very reason. They wanted to pass a bill they knew would not  generate any support among Republicans because it really is a Trojan  horse for their liberal wish list. And the only way they could make  that happen would be to exclude Republicans, turn down offers of  bipartisanship, as the President did when 10 Republicans visited him at  the White House just a few weeks ago and decided to go it alone, which  is what our Democratic colleagues did.   Since Republicans had no say in the drafting of the bill and because  our Democratic friends chose to skip the normal committee  consideration, our only opportunity to make any changes to the bill  came through the amendment process on the floor. From roughly 11 a.m.  on Friday until 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, the Senate voted on more than  30 amendments, largely from folks on our side of the aisle, almost all  of which were rejected in a party-line vote.   Outside of Washington, DC, not many people stay up for 24 hours  straight to watch Congress vote on budget amendments, so I think it is  important that we recap what the American people missed while they were  sleeping.   The first amendment vote last Friday was a good barometer of what was  happening on the other side of the aisle. The first vote, teed up by  the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Sanders, would have more  than doubled the minimum wage at $15 an hour. The Congressional Budget  Office said that this would kill 1.4 million jobs, and then the Senate  Parliamentarian said that this was an improper use of the budget  reconciliation process.   But our Democratic colleagues wanted to take this shot anyway, so  they voted to waive a budget point of order, but it did not go well.  Eight Democrats voted alongside all Republicans to prevent this abuse  of the budget reconciliation process and prevent this job-killing  minimum wage mandate from becoming part of this bill.   As it turns out, there is bipartisan opposition to killing jobs at a  time when our economy is already on a fragile footing. Who would have  thought otherwise?   And once Senators cast their votes, our Democratic friends held the  vote open for a recordbreaking 12 hours as they tried to whip their  caucus into shape on the most critical amendment, which was next in  line.   I am not one to tell our friends across the aisle how to do their  job, but normally, when you have a vote, you know ahead of time how  that vote is going to come out. That is just legislation 101. But when  you are trying to rush, at warp speed, a nearly $2 trillion wish list  to the President's desk, I guess you don't have the time to do things  the right way, and you certainly don't have an interest in getting them  done in a bipartisan fashion.   But on the rest of the votes we held, over and over again, our  Democratic colleagues held together and blocked commonsense amendments  offered by this side of the aisle. For example, there were amendments  to stop blue States from receiving more than their fair share of the  State and local funding. The Democratic proposal includes a jaw- dropping $350 billion for State and local aid--more than double what  was spent in the CARES Act last March when the economic picture was far  more dire.   Unlike the CARES Act funding that was distributed based on  population, this proposal separated the funds into two pots of money-- one to be distributed based on a population formula while the second is  based on the unemployment rate.   Senator Graham from South Carolina offered an amendment which would  have required this funding to follow the same formula that we did in  March, in a bipartisan way, rather than this new formula that favors  blue States.   Since the primary argument for the bill was that States needed this  funding because of lost tax revenues, it made sense that the largest  population States should receive the most funding, a per capita  formula. This would eliminate a big windfall for blue States that have  largely kept their economies on ice and shuttered, even as COVID-19  cases decreased.   Then there was an amendment from the Senator from Utah, Senator  Romney, which would have ensured State and local funding was only going  to those States that actually need it. What a concept. His amendment  would require States to apply for aid through the Treasury Department.  They could then receive funds to help recover pandemic-related  expenses, revenue losses, or unexpected Medicaid costs. But, of course,  in a party-line vote, our Democratic colleagues blocked that amendment  as well.   And it is not just State and local funding that folks on my side of  the aisle wanted us to use more responsibly. I offered an amendment to  improve the quality of care for unaccompanied migrant children who  arrived along the U.S.-Mexico border. We know that these children are  especially vulnerable and their health and safety should have been  addressed in this COVID package.   Well, President Biden's border crisis is shaping up to be one of epic  proportions. Border agents reportedly detained nearly 100,000 migrants  along the southern border last month alone. That marks the highest  total for the month of February since 2006. The numbers have now  climbed so high that the administration is allowing facilities to house  children to operate at 100 percent capacity, when our kids aren't even  going back to school in many school districts around the country  because of concerns for their safety. Forget that. The Biden  administration is now allowing these facilities that house children to  operate at 100 percent despite the COVID risk.   An amendment I offered would redirect unnecessary funding for the  National Endowment for the Humanities and instead send it to the Office  of Refugee Resettlement. This office is part of the Department of  Health and Human Services, and this extra funding would help keep these  children safe and healthy. Unfortunately, for these children, many of  whom have endured long and dangerous journeys in the hands of human  smugglers, our Democratic colleagues chose the National Endowment for  the Humanities instead of these children in distress.   Well, the list of rejected amendments goes on and on.   Senator Scott of South Carolina offered an amendment to ensure States  weren't fudging on the nursing home death count totals, like the  disastrous situation developing in New York that we are just now  learning about the magnitude of nursing home deaths that were covered  up by the Cuomo administration. This amendment would have required  States to certify the accuracy of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes in  order to assess funding for nursing home facility strike teams. Once  again, a party-line vote blocked that amendment.   One of the highlights of this long and drawn-out process, which just  left me scratching my head, was an amendment from Senator Cassidy, the  Senator from Louisiana, that would have prevented stimulus checks being  sent  [[Page S1419]]  to people in prison and one from Senator Cruz, my colleague from Texas,  that would have stopped payments from going to people who are not even  legally present in the United States. Both amendments were blocked in a  party-line vote by Democrats.   Our colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, offered an amendment to  incentivize a safe return to in-person learning at our Nation's  schools. The crux of it was simple: If schools wanted Federal funding,  they should actually educate children in the classroom and do so  safely, according to CDC guidelines; otherwise, why do they need this  huge amount of extra money if they are not actually going to use it to  educate our children? Well, our Democratic colleagues blocked that  amendment too.   While Americans were sleeping, Senate Democrats stood in the way of  numerous commonsense reforms to this behemoth of a partisan bill. They  have proven, once again, this so-called COVID-19 relief bill has next  to nothing to do with what is best for the country and everything to do  with what is best for their liberal partisan agenda.   This bill includes a long list of liberal priorities that are  completely unrelated to the crisis at hand. I think roughly 90 percent  of it is unrelated to COVID-19. Blank checks for mismanaged union  pension funds, funding for climate justice--whatever that is--backdoor  money for Planned Parenthood, an exclusive paid leave program for  bureaucrats, those are just some of the greatest hits in the vote- arama.   Even the portions of the bill that are related to the pandemic are  completely out of proportion. The legislation provides $130 billion for  schools when tens of billions of dollars that we have already  appropriated last December remain to be spent.   According to the Congressional Budget Office, only $6.4 billion will  be distributed through September of this year. The remaining $122  billion would trickle out the door through not just 2021 but through  2028.   Of course, there is the blue State bailout. Despite the fact that tax  revenues have largely rebounded and many States are still sitting on  piles of cash from previous COVID-19 relief bills, our Democratic  friends want to send another $350 billion to State and local  governments but not just on an equitable population-based formula. They  rigged the formula to make sure blue States reap the biggest cash  benefits.   We know this wasn't the only path forward. We worked, time and time  again, this last year on five different occasions to show we can unite  to provide COVID-19 relief to the American people.   We could have built on that record this year, which after listening  to President Biden's inaugural speech, I had hoped we might do. The  first legislation to pass during the Biden administration could have  been a bipartisan pandemic relief bill with overwhelming support. We  wouldn't have needed to go through the vote-arama or the abuse of the  budget reconciliation process. We could have had a bill that supported  the hardest hit families, got kids back at school, and helped expedite  vaccination.   But those types of policies, obviously, weren't top of mind for our  Democratic friends. They wanted to have a payday for the most radical  element of their party at an absurdly high pricetag, which our children  and grandchildren are going to be saddled with.   They assembled a laundry list of unrelated wasteful and downright  partisan provisions and rejected even the most commonsense amendments  offered by this side of the aisle.    Sadly, this legislation passed the House without a single Republican  vote. It passed the Senate without a single Republican vote. And now,  our Democratic friends are on track to write a $2 trillion check  completely funded by deficit spending without even a trace of  bipartisanship.   They don't have a figleaf to hide behind. This was a partisan bill  intentionally. Either the President sold snake oil on Inauguration Day  or he has already caved into the most radical elements of his own  political party. Either way, it is bad news for the American people.
