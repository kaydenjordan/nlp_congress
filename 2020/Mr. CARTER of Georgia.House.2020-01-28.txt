 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Jamie Durrence who has been selected to serve as the 2020 chair of the  Georgia Restaurant Association Board of Directors.   I can't think of someone more deserving of this responsibility. In  his more than 20 years managing restaurants in Savannah, he has  rejuvenated Savannah's restaurant scene with four restaurants that  serve fresh ingredients, unique menus, quality service, and overall  exceptional dining experiences.   Much of Mr. Durrence's penchant for the restaurant industry stems  from his youth when he was raised on a working farm just outside of  Savannah.   As chairman of the Georgia Restaurant Association Board of Directors,  Mr. Durrence will be tasked as the chief spokesperson for the industry  and will be an integral part of the statewide events.   I know that the Georgia restaurant industry is in good hands with Mr.  Durrence.   Congratulations, Mr. Durrence. Keep up the good work.                            ____________________
