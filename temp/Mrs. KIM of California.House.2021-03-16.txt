 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Luetkemeyer for yielding. I thank Representative Luetkemeyer and  Chairwoman Velazquez for their leadership on the Small Business  Committee. I look forward to working with all of them to strengthen  small businesses across the country.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1799, the Paycheck Protection  Program Extension Act of 2021. I was proud to introduce this bipartisan  bill with Representative Carolyn Bourdeaux, Ranking Member Luetkemeyer,  and Chairwoman Velazquez to extend the PPP deadline for new  applications from March 31 to May 31, and to provide the Small Business  Administration an additional 30 days to process PPP applications.   Much of the importance of why this bipartisan legislation is needed  was already spoken about, but I think it is important, so I am going to  say a few words about the State of California that I represent.   Forty thousand small businesses have closed in California during the  COVID-19 pandemic, and half of those closures are permanent. The  Paycheck Protection Program has been a lifeline for small businesses to  keep their doors open as we safely reopen our communities.   As the Biden administration announced five changes to PPP on February  22, the looming March 31 deadline does not give our small businesses  the time to adjust to the new guidance listed by the SBA. This bill  provides small businesses and lenders with the time needed to process  PPP loans and adjust to the recent changes.   As a small business owner myself, I understand the challenges that  small businesses face each day. Our bipartisan bill provides Main  Street with the opportunity to overcome the pandemic and thrive.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1799 and put Main  Street on a path to recovery.
