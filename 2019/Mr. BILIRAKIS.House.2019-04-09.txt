 Madam Speaker, I will tell the gentleman this: He has  been a great model for me serving on the Energy and Commerce Committee.  It is always good to go to the physician to hear firsthand what the  patients need and want. So I thank the gentleman for healing his  constituents over the years, and now serving them in the United States  Congress.   Madam Speaker, I cannot stress enough the devastation that hurricanes  over the last few years have inflicted not only on the State of  Florida, but all over the country, as you can see, Georgia, North  Carolina, Texas, what have you. And folks, we need to get--come  together. We need to come together and get this done for the American  people.   This should be a no-brainer. We have waited too long for this to  happen, and it needs to be a bipartisan bill out of the Senate. Get it  on the floor of the House as soon as possible so we can help our  constituents.   One particular case, in the city of Tarpon Springs alone, Hurricane  Irma exacerbated shallowing problems at its port. This puts at risk the  livelihood of our marine and tourism business owners and impacts $250  million in yearly commerce a year.    A remedy known as the Anclote River Dredge Project was set to be  funded under the previously-passed emergency supplemental bill. We were  given assurances--I understand we have a lot of disasters that need to  be taken care of--but we need to take care of our constituents, and  this is a good example.   And we did this right. We have county matching funds, State matching  funds that are at risk right now. The city has put up money. We have  got to get this project through.   The seafood industry is suffering. Again, commerce, the sponge  industry is suffering because of the lack of dredging of this beautiful  Anclote River.   Unfortunately, the sheer number of areas in need of repair from  disasters force the already-allocated funding to be moved to other  projects, and I understand that. But these projects are important as  well.   We need to ensure projects like Anclote are quickly and adequately  fixed after a hurricane or other disaster; and, therefore, I support  the immediate consideration of a disaster supplemental bill.   I thank my colleague, Neal Dunn, for this Special Order. He is doing  an outstanding job.   We have got to get this done quickly for our constituents.                                time  1815
