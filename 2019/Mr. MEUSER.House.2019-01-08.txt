 Madam Speaker, it is with a great sense of honor,  respect, and patriotism I make my first address on this floor.   This government shutdown needs to be resolved. The people know it is  up to this Congress to do it and to do so in short order.   Despite the high level of political morass we must wade through in  these first days of the 116th Congress, I continue to believe that this  Congress can do things better and actually work together to get things  done for the American people.   The need exists to advance and improve our border security, as well  as correct aspects of our illegal immigration laws.   The problem-solving, however, starts with securing our borders. Our  borders are a serious problem. We all know this. The data is  indisputable by anyone who seriously reviews the information.   We have hundreds of thousands entering our country illegally every  year, and our Border Patrol agents cannot manage the situation with the  resources and tools Congress has appropriated.   There is a cost and a plan to make our borders properly secure.  Congress has the responsibility to provide the right level of funding  so border security staff can, in fact, do their job and so our country  has lawful immigration.   The experts at Homeland Security say this cost is $5.7 billion. There  are many in this Congress who will not vote for this, but less than 7  years ago, these same Members voted for border security funding which  did, in fact, include a physical barrier.   Politics has no place in this serious matter. The border agents,  including Chris Cabrera of the National Border Patrol Council,  emphasizes that a wall, or a barrier, is an essential tool. We here in  Congress must provide the means so Border Patrol can do their job.   I, myself, do believe in a policy of high fences and wide legal  gates, but before we can talk about legal gates and deal with the  issues such as DACA  [[Page H280]]  and extended work visas for agricultural workers, we must secure the  border.   The people want us to work together for our country, not for  ourselves or our political parties. Let's not continue to let the  people down. Let's show that this Congress can do things better.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
