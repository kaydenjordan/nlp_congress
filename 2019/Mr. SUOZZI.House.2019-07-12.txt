 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for yielding.   Madam Speaker, this is what the American people are hungering for:  Democrats and Republicans working together to solve real problems in  real people's lives.   The Victim Compensation Fund is so important to so many people, real  suffering that is going on in real families after people have dedicated  their lives trying to serve other people and are now paying the  consequences for us.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues. I want to thank  Chairman Nadler, Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman King. I want to  thank all the Democrats and all the Republicans who cosponsored this  bill, and those who will vote for it today.   I have so many friends, personal friends who volunteered days, months  at the pile who are now suffering the consequences of having done that  volunteer work on the pile. This is an important day for those  families.   I want to thank the advocates that helped to focu our attention. I  want to thank everyone who worked together to solve a very real problem  in real people's lives.    This is what the United States Congress needs to be doing, and I am  so happy to be a part of it.
