 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for  yielding me time.   Earlier this year, I introduced H.R. 5952, a bill that honors the  life of Jon Glawe, of Vergas, Minnesota. He was a mail carrier for 36  years, who left a remarkable impact on his community.   Born in 1949, Jon grew up in the Vergas area. He was a wrestling  champion, which took him to college in California. After being drafted  into the Army in 1970 and faithfully serving his country, he returned  home and married his high school sweetheart, Darla Olson.   As a boy, Jon would join his father on the mail route, shoveling the  car out of the snow, and many Minnesotans know that feeling. After his  father passed away, Jon took up the reins, taking on a second full-time  job as a mail carrier while also running the family dairy farm.   Over the years, he became a beloved staple of the community,  regularly going above and beyond to help his neighbors.   This bill appropriately names the post office after Jon to honor his  service to his neighbors and to the local area. In a letter, his family  noted that since the bill's introduction, the outpouring of support  from those who live in the Vergas area has been overwhelming. I agree  with their words that there is no better way to honor his decades of  service than this.   Jon passed away in 2016 and left behind a loving family and many,  many friends. I urge my colleagues to hear the voices of those Jon  impacted every day and support this bill.
