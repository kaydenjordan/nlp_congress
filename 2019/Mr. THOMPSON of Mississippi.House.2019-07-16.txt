 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise to offer an amendment to title VI of H.R. 3494  titled Federal Efforts Against Domestic Terrorism. I am pleased to see  that this title was significantly informed by my bill, H.R. 3106, the  Domestic Terrorism DATA Act which the Homeland Security Committee will  be considering tomorrow.   I am glad to have the opportunity to work with Chairman Schiff and  the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on this text.   My legislation, which requires the government to produce an annual  domestic terrorism report, was the product of more than 5 months of  engagement with outside stakeholders and experts. As a result of that  consultation process, I included protections for civil rights, civil  liberties, privacy, and data quality in my bill. These provisions made  my bill stronger. My amendment to H.R. 3494 would require that these  very protections are included.   Madam Chair, my amendment also requires additional information be  included in the government's domestic terrorism report. Requiring the  date and location of each incident of terrorism or investigation of  terrorism will help Congress and the public better understand the  landscape of domestic terrorism.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff).    Yes.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff).  [[Page H5891]]         Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of  my time.
