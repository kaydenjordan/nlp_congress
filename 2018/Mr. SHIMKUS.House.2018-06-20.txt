 Mr. Speaker, it is good to be on the floor with my good  friend and colleague, the ranking member, Congressman Pallone. I know  his heart is solid and I know he believes that we are challenging some  privacy concerns, and I take that in the spirit intended.   As a Republican, I was an early supporter of one of our former  colleague's--Sue Myrick's--Mental Health Parity Act. And the whole  intent of that, for many of us, was to say mental health illness is an  illness and should be accepted as an illness. But what we have done  under the Federal code is to separate it. So I think the intent of what  we are trying to do is not separate it and make it part of the health  records.   We have heard the debate on both sides, but that is the basic premise  from which I come. And we have heard the testimony of people for whom  the information was not shared with the regular doctor versus the  mental health, and then prescriptions occurring and then catastrophic  events.   The intent of this legislation is to help patients and to help  providers better take care of their patients. This is not about taking  away privacy but taking care of people. It is about making sure people  have the appropriate level of privacy for the services they are  seeking.   We don't create extra privacy barriers so that people with heart  disease, HIV, or diabetes can keep their doctors in the dark and  withhold critical information relevant to the insurer benefits that  they are using. This goes back to, as we have heard today, a 1970-era  mandate.   Gary Mendell, the founder of Shatterproof, lost his son Brian, who  was recovering from substance use disorder, after he tragically took  his own life. Gary said the following about aligning part 2 with HIPAA:         The solution is not to keep this information out of       electronic health records and not available. The solution is       to end the stigma and to bring this disease and mental       illness into the healthcare system, just like diabetes,       cancer, or any other disease.    And I couldn't agree more with Gary.   He also said:         If there's an issue related to unintended consequences,       let's fix that.    I think in this piece of legislation, Congressman Mullin and  Congressman Blumenauer intended to do that.   Gary also said:         Let's not keep this out of the healthcare system, unlike       diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, because then we just       perpetuate the situation that is causing it in the first       place.    I will continue. Individuals with opioid use disorder die, on  average, a decade sooner than other Americans. This is largely because  of the strikingly high incidence of poorly managed, co-occurring  chronic diseases, including HIV/AIDS, cardiac conditions, lung disease,  and cirrhosis.   Whatever we as a nation are doing to coordinate care for this highly  vulnerable population is failing by any reasonable measure.    Mr. Speaker, an extraordinary array of organizations,  hospitals, physicians, patient advocates, and substance use treatment  providers have approached this committee to clearly state that existing  Federal addiction privacy law is actively interfering with case  management and care coordination efforts. Arguing against this  legislation preserved a fatal and deadly status quo.   I support this piece of legislation, and I thank my colleague for the  time.    Mr. Speaker, it is great to be here tonight to talk  about something that we have talked about quite a bit. I am glad to see  the gentleman has, obviously, the LNG terminal and the Lithuanian- flagged Independence. I also brought it down.   I don't have to be as complete in my comments, because I have heard  the comments of easing and helping Europeans be independent of imported  Russian natural gas.   Lithuania is on the Baltic Sea. I am the chairman of the Baltic  Caucus. We have Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. I have spent a lot of  time watching them and encouraging them in their actual leadership of  Eastern Europe. They set out in 2014 to become independent of Russian  gas. So they went through the process of getting the LNG terminal.   I love the name. It is called the Independence so they can be  independent and free. They have a history of being extorted by the  Russians in the crude oil department. There is a refinery there called  Mazeikiu Nafta, which a U.S. company bought and then the Russians  turned off the oil.   So those are the extortions and the concerns. Now what they have is  the ability to compete in the open market. They had their first LNG gas  come from the United States earlier in 2017. They now have an ability  to negotiate for the best price, which helps a lot.   First of all, it helps their citizens. It helps, obviously, their  businesses. It also helps the allies in surrounding countries. What  they have now been able to do is negotiate through the Baltic region of  pipelines and storage, and we have had talks, as you know, on smaller  export LNG vessels to be able to get to smaller communities.   We are a party of all-of-the-above technology. We believe in having  the energy resources compete for lower prices. I am glad the gentleman  from Texas came down here and is expounding the virtues of freedom it  has provided for the Baltic countries, and I look forward to continuing  shipping U.S. liquefied natural gas, which helps our balance of trades  and creates jobs in America, to our allies and friends around the  globe.
