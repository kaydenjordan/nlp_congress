 Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Blunt  in reintroducing the Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future  Act.   According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, by 2030,  there will be a shortage of up to 120,000 physicians. Over one third of  the shortage, up to 49,300, will be in primary care. Individuals and  families living in underserved areas--urban and rural--will continue to  be those most disadvantaged by this shortage.   The passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 ushered in an  expansion of access to health insurance for millions of Americans.  While we fight to protect these gains and work to improve the system  further, many Americans are going to the doctor for preventive health  care for the first time. In order for this to be successful, we must  expand our health care workforce to ensure that we have enough health  care professionals to seamlessly accommodate the newly insured as they  join the ranks of those who already have coverage. In addition, as the  baby boomers age, we will need health care professionals to care for  them as well. According to the Pew Research Center, roughly 10,000 baby  boomers will become eligible for Medicare every day through 2030.   The Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act would  authorize programs that would grow the overall number of health care  providers, as well as encourage providers to pursue careers in  geographic and practice areas of highest need.   Building on the success of the National Health Service Corp (NHSC)  Scholarship and Loan Repayment Program and the State Loan Repayment  Program, our legislation would establish a State scholarship program.  Like the NHSC State Loan Repayment Program, States would be able to  receive a dollar-for-dollar match to support individuals that commit to  practicing in the state in which the scholarship was issued after  completing their education and training. At least 50 percent of the  funding would be required to support individuals committed to pursuing  careers in primary care. The States would have the flexibility to use  the remaining 50 percent to fund scholarships to educate students in  other health care professions with documented shortages with the  approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.   The Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act would also  authorize grants to medical schools to develop primary care mentors on  faculty and in the community. According to the Association of American  Medical Colleges, graduating medical students consistently say that one  of the most important factors affecting the career path they choose is  role models. Building a network of primary care mentors in the  classroom and in a variety of clinical settings will help guide more  medical students into careers in primary care.   The legislation would couple these mentorship grants with an  initiative to improve the education and training offered by medical  schools in competencies most critical to primary care, including  patient-centered medical homes, primary and behavioral health  integration, and team-based care.   It would also direct the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to study and  make recommendations about ways to limit the administrative burden on  providers in documenting cognitive services delivered to patients.  Primary care providers treat patients in need of these services almost  exclusively, and as such, spend a significant percentage of their day  documenting care. That is not the case for providers who perform  procedures, such as surgeries. This IOM study would help uncover ways  to simplify documentation requirements, particularly for delivering  cognitive services, in order to eliminate one of the potential factors  that may discourage medical students from pursuing careers in primary  care.   Providers across the spectrum of care recognize that this bipartisan  legislation is part of the solution to addressing the looming health  care workforce shortage and have lent their support, including: the  Alliance for Specialty Medicine, the American Association of Child and  Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Association of Colleges of  Osteopathic Medicine, the American Association for Marriage and Family  Therapy, the American Osteopathic Association, the Association of  American Medical Colleges, and the Society of General Internal  Medicine.   I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders as well  as Senator Blunt and our colleagues to pass the Building a Health Care  Workforce for the Future Act in order to help ensure patients have  access to the health care they need.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Blunt  in reintroducing the Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future  Act.
