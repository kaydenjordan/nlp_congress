 Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to my good friend, Al  Glick, who recently passed away at the age of 95. Very few have meant  as much to the Jackson, Michigan, community as Al Glick.   Alro Steel, a company founded nearly 75 years ago, embodies the  hardworking ethos of his hometown. Over the years, under Al's  leadership, the company grew to 3,000 employees in over a dozen States.  Al always exhibited a tireless work ethic but spent the time to talk to  and to know each of his employees. When asked about his retirement, he  said: ``I have slowed down to working part-time, I only work 12 hours a  day.'' Even still, he always found time to get involved in just about  every effort under the sun.   Al supported skilled education programs, nonprofits, and C.S. Mott  Children's Hospital, just to name a few. Name a sport and Al likely  sponsored a team or league in the Jackson area. Al's generosity was  felt throughout the Jackson community, often taking shape through his  unwavering support of Jackson High School.   A Michigan man through and through, Al got to see his beloved  Wolverines take down Ohio State on a snowy day this past November and  then win the Big Ten Championship.   Al wasn't just a staple of the Jackson community; he was a steel  pillar.   While we mourn Al's passing, we celebrate his remarkable life and the  legacy that will live on for generations to come. We wish his family  great joy in that legacy and thank them for sharing Al with us.  [[Page H1214]]                                ____________________
