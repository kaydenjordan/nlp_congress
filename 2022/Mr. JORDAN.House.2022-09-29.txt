 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' While  parts of this bill have some support, the package before us today does  nothing but empower the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade  Commission.   Why would we support more funding for unaccountable officials in the  Biden administration, particularly these two agencies, the Department  of Justice, in light of what we have seen from them over the past  several months?   Time and time again, they have weaponized that agency to go after the  American people.   Now, some are asserting that oh, no, this wouldn't give more money to  the bureaucracy. But this is the kind of Washington budget gimmick that  the swamp uses to grow government all the time.   In the majority's own committee report on the bill they acknowledge  ``the updated fee structure would provide the U.S. Department of  Justice and the Federal Trade Commission with additional resources to  review mergers and enforce the antitrust laws; more money for Merrick  Garland and the DOJ to harass the American people.                                time  1230    Even proponents of the bill are talking about how this would get  resources to the agencies while saying it doesn't include an  appropriation. This logic is laughable.   We know where this money is going. In fact, the chairman of the  committee said in his opening remarks that the DOJ and FTC are ``in  desperate need of more resources.'' We know where this money is going,  $280 million, $140 million to each agency, every single year.   Congress has already appropriated money to hire 87,000 new IRS  agents, and now we are going to give hundreds of millions of dollars to  the DOJ and the FTC. Such a deal for the taxpayer. Where does it stop?   If you want to do something about Big Tech, this bill is not the  vehicle. A bill that empowers these two agencies to, I think, collude  with Big Tech to come after conservatives is not the way to go. I hope  we can vote this down.   Mr. Speaker, as I said before, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I will respond to the gentlewoman from California. I appreciate the  fact that she is a ``no'' on this bill, but I think her logic is all  wrong. This bill would actually give $140 million to the DOJ so they  can continue to do what they are already doing, work with Big Tech to  censor certain information from getting to we the people.   Why do I say that? Because we know it happened. Just a month ago,  Mark Zuckerberg said the FBI came and told him not to allow the story  about Hunter Biden's laptop to be on their platform. They gave him the  old wink-wink, oh, we think this is Russian disinformation, which we  know it wasn't. Now, we are going to give that agency $140 million more  to go collude with Big Tech to keep we the people from getting valuable  information before the most important election that we have, the  election of the Commander in Chief of our country?   That is why this thing is so scary and why we should be against it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock), a distinguished member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Buck), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  respond to comments made by my friend from Colorado. He used the term  ``overcooked theory.'' Let me tell you what is not theory.   The Department of Justice's raid on a former President's home. Not  theory.   The Department of Justice taking the phone of a sitting Member of  this body. Not theory.   Fourteen whistleblowers coming to our office talking about the  political nature of the Justice Department. Not theory.   Those are facts. That is scary stuff.   Now this bill, if passed, will give that agency $140 million each  year for the next 5 years.   That is what we want to do? For that reason alone, we should be  against this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Issa), my good friend, a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Bentz), a distinguished member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I would just point out that I find it  interesting. First, we had Mr. Cicilline, the chair of the subcommittee  say that DOJ and FTC don't get the money. It has to be appropriated  next year. But then the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Nadler,  said we know how the money is going to be spent. It is going to be  spent on antitrust enforcement. It can't be both.                                time  1315    So it can't be both. We know what is going to happen. This money is  going to wind up in DOJ and FTC, and we know their track record in how  they have been treating the American citizen.   But I find it interesting that the Democrats can't even get their  argument straight which just reinforces why this bill should not pass,  because in the end it is more money for the Department of Justice--the  same Department of Justice that has done their egregious actions over  the last several months.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert) who is a former judge, a great member of the Judiciary  Committee, and a friend of mine.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, concentrated political power: that is what the  Department of Justice is doing right now. They are weaponizing the  Department of Justice against the American people.   The most concentrated political power--awesome power--you can have is  the Federal Government. And I would argue the agency within the Federal  Government that is the most dangerous is the Department of Justice, and  we are going to give them $140 million more over the next 5 years.   It is amazing. Again, Mr. Cicilline can say what he wants, Madam  Speaker, but that is not consistent with what the chairman said. The  chairman said that this is going to give more resources to antitrust  enforcement.   Here is what the Democrats' own committee report says: ``The upgraded  fee structure would provide the U.S. Department of Justice and the  Federal Trade Commission with additional resources.''   So either Mr. Cicilline is completely wrong, or the majority report  is wrong, or the chairman is wrong. Somebody is wrong.   We know what is going to happen. This is the same old game we hear  all the time: Oh, it is not really appropriated, but we are charging  more money.   It will result in more money coming to the concentrated political  power at the Justice Department, but it is really not going to go  there.   Give me break. We know where it is going. They have even said it in  their own darn committee report.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I just point out that I didn't say that Congress  shouldn't appropriate dollars to Federal agencies. What I said is that  we shouldn't give more money to the Department of Justice in light of  what we have seen them do and in light of what 14 whistleblowers have  told us over the last several months what they are up to. That is a  completely different point.   I am all for looking for ways to cut certain agencies and reduce  Government and the power that they have, but I didn't say that. I just  said that we shouldn't be giving them more money, for goodness' sake,  in light of what they have been doing. I think that is a pretty  reasonable position, and, frankly, I think it is the position the vast  majority of the country would have when they look at the actions they  have seen from their Department of Justice and the tax money that  supports that agency.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I would just add I have talked a lot about my concerns  with the DOJ in light of what we have seen from that agency, and I  think that is the main reason why this bill is so wrong and it should  not be supported.   But the FTC is also engaged in all kinds of things that I just think  are interesting.   One commissioner said that she supports prioritizing FTC  investigations related to ``systemic racism and rulemaking for racist  practices.'' A senior FTC adviser who called Kay James, the former head  of the Heritage Foundation, she called her a bigot and criticized  viewpoint diversity. She is the one who developed FTC policy on AI and  discrimination.   Republican Commissioner Wilson described Democrat goals as ``rooted  in unified world view that draws heavily on Marxism.''   This is an agency controlled by people who have a radical belief  system, radical opinions, and radical political views. Again, not only  is the Department of Justice getting $140 million more a year, so is  the FTC which is run by people with those kinds of positions.   So, again, I think we don't want to be giving more money to agencies  with this kind of track record, particularly, I think, now when the  American people are about to speak on whom they want to control their  Congress. That is why I think we should vote ``no'' on this  legislation, hopefully it goes down, and do the oversight that needs to  be done of these two agencies so we can point out the facts and the  truth and get that to the American people.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
