 Madam President, let's look at the reality of what we  face at this moment in this country in this Chamber. The Republicans  are in majority control of the Senate. The Republicans are in majority  control of the House of Representatives. The Republicans are in control  of the White House. The Republicans, through their appointees, have a  pretty decisive edge when it comes to the U.S. Supreme Court. In other  words, when you look across the spectrum of the three branches of  government, the Republicans are in control.   What are they offering us? The fourth CR. Now, CR is Washington talk.  It is a continuing resolution. What does it mean? It means that the  Republican majority has failed in 119 days to produce a budget for the  United States of America. The Republican majority in the House and  Senate--with their President--has failed to come up with a blueprint  for spending for this great Nation that we serve and are proud to be  part of.    Their fourth failure to produce a budget in this fiscal year, which  began October 1, is before us now. Was it negotiated between the  Republicans and Democrats? No. It was produced in the House of  Representatives and with the Senate. It was passed there by the  Republicans and a handful of Democrats who supported it, and it was  sent over here on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.   Well, you say, at least we are going to keep the lights on. And that  is all a continuing resolution does--keeps the lights on. It doesn't  allow agencies to make important decisions that invest taxpayers'  dollars wisely and save taxpayers' dollars.   Last night, the Department of Defense reported to us. They are sick  and tired of the continuing resolutions that they have faced for 3  years--note that I said 3 years--because we have failed, even on the  Democratic side, to come up with appropriations and budgets in the  past. So I am being very honest about it.   If we are going to change this mentality of never producing a budget,  never producing appropriations bills--kind of stumbling into the fiscal  year for month after weary month--if that is the new norm around here,  shame on us. And shame on the majority party, the Republicans, for  saying that is the best they can do. We can do better.   We need to get beyond this world of continuing resolutions, and we  need to get into a world where we actually make a decision that is good  for the taxpayers, as well as the security of the United States of  America. The best the Republican leader in the Senate can offer us is  another bandaid, another 4 weeks of temporary funding--a wasteful  gesture, a wasteful exercise, and he knows it.   There is more to this issue. Senator McConnell brings it up  regularly. Last night he did and again today. He glories in saying that  this is all about illegal immigrants. Let's be honest about what we are  talking about here. We are talking about those who were protected and  allowed to live in the United States legally under an Executive order  of President Obama's until September 5 of last year when President  [[Page S317]]  Donald Trump announced he was eliminating this program. As that  protection is eliminated, as their 2-year protection expires, yes, they  move into illegal categories. So are they illegal technically after  they have lost DACA? Yes. What caused it? President Donald Trump caused  it by his announcement on September 5 that this program is finished by  March 5. That is the reality.   Do you know what he also told us? I am going to end this program. Now  I challenge you in Congress to pass a law to replace it.   So what has the Republican majority in the House and Senate done in  the 4\1/2\ months since we received that challenge from President  Trump? Nothing.   Then I hear Senator McConnell say: We haven't even seen a written  proposal from the Democrats on this.   The Senator knows better. A group of us--six of us, three Democrats  and three Republicans--accepted President Trump's challenge and  produced a bipartisan solution. We have described it to everyone,  Democrat and Republican alike. It was a good-faith effort, real  compromise and pain on both sides. It is ready. It is ready to be  brought to the floor of the Senate. It is ready to be passed into law.  For Senator McConnell to say he doesn't know anything about it--I am  sorry, but we have been very open about what is included in there. He  knows it is a product of long and hard bipartisan work.   I would like to address another aspect of what he has said about  these so-called illegal immigrants. Late last night, after using that  term, I noticed the Gallery was filled over here with young people who  appeared to be, at first glance, here to watch the debate on the Dream  Act, the debate on DACA. After the meeting of the Senate, I invited  them into my office. There were about 40 of them. They are from all  across the United States but primarily from the State of Oregon. They  came all the way out here to try to see if this Senate was going to  meet President Trump's challenge and produce an alternative. It turns  out that most of them were protected by DACA, the Executive order that  is being abolished by President Trump.   One of them said to me: I am skipping my first week of classes at the  University of Texas.   I said: What is your major?   She said: Neuroscience.   I said: Don't skip too many classes.   That has to be a tough thing to do, but she came here because what is  at stake in this Chamber, what is at stake in this debate, will decide  whether she can continue to live in the United States of America.   For Senator McConnell to dismiss this issue and say that we will get  around to it later is to ignore the obvious. For many of these young  people, this debate, this moment, may decide their future. It may  decide the future of their families. Are they worried? To say the  least--half of them were crying as they came into my office.   At a point when I was talking to them, I said: We are going to do  everything we can to help your parents.   They all broke down crying. That is what this is about. This is about  a heart-wrenching issue that is before us because President Trump made  a decision on September 5 to end a program that allowed these young  people to go to school and to work in the United States of America. It  was President Trump who challenged us to do something about it, and we  have done nothing--nothing. And that is the challenge we face. To say  we are in no hurry--well, we may not be as Senators and Congressmen,  but these young people are in a hurry to find out whether they have a  life. That is what it comes down to.   There was an announcement just a few minutes ago from the House side.  The Republican leadership in the House of Representatives--despite the  fact that we do not have an agreement moving forward--is going to  leave. They are going to leave Washington. I don't know for how long,  and I don't know what they are going to do when they leave, but I would  beg them: Don't turn your backs on your responsibility right here in  Washington to work with us, to find a way to move forward.   We have come up with a proposal. It is a short-term, last-step  continuing resolution of just a few days. I have been around here for a  while. If you give the Senate and House a couple of weeks, it turns  into a couple of months. If we do this in a matter of 3 or 4 days to  reach an agreement on these key issues--everything included in the CR  that we have before us and everything that should be--I think we will  roll up our sleeves, get down to work, and do it. We don't want to shut  down this government. We want to solve the problems facing this  government and this Nation. That means working together--something  Senator McConnell is not engaged in when it comes to this CR.   It is time for us as Democrats and Republicans to sit down in a room  together and think about this great Nation and the frustration they  have with our political system and those of us in political life. Nine  out of ten--maybe even more--would say to us: For goodness' sake, will  you stop your fighting? Will you stop your bickering? Will you stop  your debating? Will you go into a room and act like grownups and do  something together for the good of this Nation?   That is what we are proposing--to sit down together for the good of  this Nation and to move forward.   When he was asked just a few days ago, Senator McConnell said his  biggest problem was that he didn't know what President Trump wants. I  can understand that. I have been in meetings with the President where  he said one thing on a Tuesday and a different thing on a Thursday, and  then he tweeted something entirely different the next morning. He is a  moving target when it comes to the policies and direction and  leadership of this administration. We need to do our job, and I hope he  will be part of it. I hope the President will join us. If he will, we  can solve this problem. If he stands on the sidelines, we cannot.   I think we can find common ground. That is what the American people  expect. We should give them nothing less. And of course we should solve  the problems involving the Children's Health Insurance Program,  community clinics, helping our veterans, the opioid crisis, defense  spending, and a sane approach, a reasonable approach when it comes to  these young people who have become illegal because of the decision by  President Trump on September 5 of last year.   Together, we can get this done but not if the House Republicans leave  town. We need to continue to be here in Washington doing our job and  making sure that we spend every waking moment serving the people who  elected us.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
