 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule.   Over the last week, we have heard calls from both parties' leaders,  past and present, about the need for unity in our Nation. We have heard  President-elect Biden and other members of the Democratic Party call  for unity, a path forward for our Nation full of mutual consideration  and respect.   Yet here we are today with Democrats charging in the opposite  direction, further dividing our Nation by calling for the invocation of  the 25th Amendment by the Vice President.   Let's consider this for a moment. My Democratic colleagues are  demanding Vice President Pence invoke the 25th Amendment and take over  as President. With these calls, it is clear they have full faith in the  Vice President and his ability to act in a manner that is consistent  with his constitutional responsibility. Simply put, they trust him to  do the job.   Yet the very demand they are making insinuates that Vice President  Pence cannot be trusted to make the decision to invoke the 25th  Amendment on his own. It calls into question the core of his judgment.   If you trust someone to lead our Nation and be the acting President,  shouldn't you also trust that same person to take the steps necessary  to safeguard it if needed?   With that, I urge opposition to the rule.
