 Mr. President, I would like to commend my colleague from  Alaska. Closer to the Poles, you see the effect of climate change more  starkly. I am glad that she spoke on this issue. She is a real champion  for her State, which means recognizing that climate change is having an  effect on the Arctic and on those villages up there. It will have a lot  of consequences going forward.   I say thank you to Senator Murkowski.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the House  Republican healthcare bill and the devastating effect that it would  have on people with mental illness and those affected by the Nation's  opioid epidemic.   Nationwide, more than 52,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in  2015, the most recent year for which data are available, with 63  percent of those deaths involving an opioid. This means that drug  overdose deaths now surpass the number of people who die each year from  automobile accidents or from firearms.   That same year in Minnesota, we lost more than 570 people to drug  overdoses. About half of those deaths were tied to prescription  medication--particularly, opiate pain relievers--and another 20 percent  of those deaths were associated with heroin. We saw drug overdose  deaths jump 11 percentage points in Minnesota from 2014 to 2015.   The opioid epidemic knows no boundaries. It has touched people and  families of all incomes, of all races, and of all ages. Some  communities in Minnesota have been hit particularly hard by this  crisis, including our Native American population. Not long ago, I  visited the Bois Forte Indian Reservation. Bois Forte is a small,  beautiful reservation up in northern Minnesota, a community where  people know each other and trust each other. In fact, historically, the  trust has run so deep that folks in Bois Forte didn't even lock their  doors at night. But the opioid epidemic--I was told this by the Tribe  chairman--and the impact it has had on the people in the reservation  has changed that. Opioids are changing and destroying families and  communities, and one clear sign of this is that people now are locking  their doors, the chairman told me.   Right now, we need to be doing all we can to help people, families,  and communities that have been devastated by opioid addiction. We must  provide support for treatments and other necessary interventions, and  we need to be focusing on prevention. That is why we passed the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act just last year, and why we  followed it up with the behavioral health provisions in the 21st  Century Cures Act--again, just at the end of last Congress.   Now these important advances are under threat. The so-called  healthcare bill that Republicans pushed out of the House of  Representatives would undermine the very programs that help people with  opioid addiction. For instance, as the CBO confirmed yesterday, the  bill guts Medicaid, cutting the program's budget by more than $830  billion over 10 years. These losses are compounded by the additional  $610 billion in cuts to Medicaid proposed in President Trump's budget  yesterday. In total, these cuts would amount to close to a 50-percent  reduction in the funding for the Medicaid Program, causing at least 14  million people to lose Medicaid coverage over the next decade. Medicaid  is the No. 1 payer for behavioral health services in the Nation. It  covers both prevention and treatment for people at risk for or actively  battling opioid addiction.   For example, Medicaid pays for about one-quarter of medication- assisted treatment for opioid and heroin addictions. Because of the  Medicaid expansion, 1.3 million additional people gained access to  behavioral health services, which reduced the number of low-income  adults needing substance use treatment but not receiving it by 18  percent.   To further undermine coverage, the House bill would also allow States  to eliminate essential health benefits. The essential health benefits  are 10 key benefits that plans exchanges must offer, including  maternity care, prescription drugs, and mental health and substance use  disorder services. What we know is that before the ACA was passed, many  people with private insurance did not have coverage for the mental  health services they needed. One in three did not have coverage for  substance use disorder treatment, and close to one in five did not have  coverage for mental healthcare.   Now is not the time to be cutting back on those benefits. In fact,  last year, the Surgeon General issued a report on addiction, which  found that there are more people with substance use disorders than  people with cancer. What the CBO score confirmed yesterday was that  people who live in States that rollback essential health benefits, who  still need the services that are no longer included in the essential  health benefits would ``experience substantial increases in out-of- pocket spending on health care or would choose to forgo the services.''   The report goes on to call out the fact that out-of-pocket costs for  these patients could increase by thousands of dollars a year, and the  benefits would again be subject to annual and lifetime limits.  Substance use disorder services are highlighted as specific benefits  that CBO anticipates States will exclude first.   I want to make this clear to my colleagues and to the American  people: You cannot say that you want to address our country's opioid  epidemic and at the same time support this bill. Those things are in  direct opposition to one another. So, to all of my colleagues who  supported CARA and supported the 21st Century Cures Act, I urge you to  work with us to build on the ACA so that we can effectively address the  opioid epidemic ravaging our country.   My colleague on the other side of the aisle, Senator Corker from  Tennessee,  [[Page S3183]]  had it right when he remarked on the secret partisan process currently  underway in the Senate. Earlier this week he said:         It's a very awkward process, at best. There are no experts.       There's no actuaries. . . . Typically, in a hearing, you'd       have people coming in and you'd also have the media opining       about if a hearing took place, and X came in and made       comments.    Senator Corker is spot-on. The American people deserve an open and  transparent discussion on how we can best improve healthcare in our  Nation. Many Americans are struggling just to keep their heads above  water, paying their bills, raising their kids, caring for their  parents, and coping with health problems.   Families in Minnesota and in all of our States have been or are  currently being ripped apart by opioid addiction. They need our help.  They don't need a bill or a budget, for that matter, that is hastily  put together for ideological reasons. They don't need policies that  undercut their care and their livelihood.   Ninety-one people die every day in the United States from an opioid  overdose. Only one in five people who currently need treatment for  opioid use disorders is actually getting it.   American lives hang in the balance. People are counting on us to do  the right thing. So let's do it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Katie  Wright, a fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the year.
