 Mr. Speaker, our times are this: the  President is abusing his authority. He is stacking the courts with  incompetent and ideological judges. He is usurping the powers of the  Justice Department and the FBI. He is turning them into political  animals.   At the same time as he is doing this, we are considering this  legislation, which leaves the door wide open for the abuse of Fourth  Amendment rights of Americans.   This is a bad bill for a particularly bad time. I am asking my  colleagues to vote ``no.'' We can do better than this. I am asking my  colleagues to vote in favor of the USA RIGHTS amendment. If that  amendment is not passed, then I ask Members to vote ``no'' on this  overall bill. We can't afford to let this happen.    Madam Speaker, I rise to set the record  straight about the Trump-Republican tax scam recently signed into law.   Middle-income and working people in Georgia would see a minimal gain,  and eventually they will see their taxes go up, while the richest 1  percent of Georgians will get an annual tax cut of $83,000.   In fact, Georgia millionaires could receive a cut of more than  $130,000 a year. In fact, the Trump-Republican tax cut bestows 83  percent of the $5.5 trillion tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent who  don't even need it, while blowing a $1.5 trillion hole in the Nation's  debt.   That is obscene, and that is why I am holding a tax teach this  Saturday in my district to communicate with my constituents about what  this tax scam means to them, what it means for their families, and what  it means for jobs and economic growth.                            ____________________
