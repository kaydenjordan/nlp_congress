 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1695, the Register of  Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act. As lead Democratic  cosponsor of this bipartisan, bicameral legislation, I am pleased that  this bill passed out of our Judiciary Committee--thanks to Chairman  Goodlatte and many others--by a vote of 27-1.   This legislation represents sound public policy that will strengthen  the copyright system. To begin with, it has evolved directly from the  bipartisan copyright review process that Chairman Goodlatte initiated  way back in 2013. Over the course of that highly deliberative process,  the Judiciary Committee held no less than 20 hearings and heard from  over 100 witnesses on how to update the copyright laws for the 21st  century.   H.R. 1695 is the product of more than 4 years of outreach efforts  with a wide range of interested parties who very much want to see, like  all of us, a Copyright Office that is responsible to all stakeholders  in the copyright ecosystem.   This bill is also the product of bicameral collaboration with our  Senate colleagues, including the Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley,  the Ranking Member Feinstein, and Senator Leahy. As a result of this  inclusive process, the strong bipartisan consensus emerged from the  Copyright Office that needs to be more accountable to Congress, and  that it should have greater independence.   That Office has a long and distinguished history of serving as an  adviser to Congress on copyright measures, and it is only reasonable  that Congress play a significant role in deciding who leads that  important agency.   H.R. 1695 also elevates the stature of the Register and makes the  position directly accountable to Congress, which will help ensure a  strong and vibrant copyright system that fuels our economy, creates  jobs, and promotes a diverse range of views.   Today, core copyright businesses annually contribute more than $1.2  trillion to our Nation's economy and generate foreign sales of almost  $180 billion. These businesses are also tremendous job creators,  creating more than 5 million workers.   That is why the bill is strongly supported by several unions,  including the AFL-CIO, the Screen Actors Guild, the American Federation  of Television and Radio Artists, as well as the Directors Guild of  America.   H.R. 1695 is also supported by a broad range of other stakeholders,  including: the American Intellectual Property Law Association; the  Intellectual Property Owners Association; and various coalitions of  creators, such as the Content Creators Coalition (c3), CreativeFuture,  and the Copyright Alliance.   Individual creators like Jeff Friday, the founder and CEO of Film  Life and the producer of the American Black Film Festival also are in  strong support of the bill.   Finally, H.R. 1695 will enable Congress to ensure that the Copyright  Office is led by a well-qualified individual by requiring the Register  to be confirmed by the Senate. This individual must be responsive to  the Congress and the public, as well as all the stakeholders in the  copyright community.   In fact, an amendment offered by our distinguished colleague from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), that was accepted during the Judiciary  Committee markup of the bill, will further strengthen the selection  process by establishing an even larger role for Congress in choosing  candidates for the position.   Accordingly, I urge total support for H.R. 1695, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the committee who has done an  amazing job.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brady), ranking member of the House Administration  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.                                time  1415     Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a distinguished member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Chair, this is a bill that is  critical for us to pass. It is the result of more than 3 years of  hearings, listening tours, and dozens of conversations with a wide  range of stakeholders.   Under the leadership of Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Ranking Member  John Conyers, the Judiciary Committee members sat through hours of  hearings and even traveled to different cities around the country to  hear from all the stakeholders that are impacted by our copyright  policies.   It is clear that we need a change in the Copyright Office. We need to  protect our Copyright Office. We can do that with a Presidential  appointee of the Register. That is why this bill is supported by a wide  range of stakeholders, including the AFL-CIO; the Screen Actors Guild- American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, SAG-AFTRA; the  Directors Guild; the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage  Employees, or IATSE; the American Federation of Musicians; the Motion  Picture Association of America; the Recording Industry Association of  America; the GRAMMYs; the National Association of Broadcasters;  Software and Information Industry Association; the American  Intellectual Property Law Association; and the Intellectual Property  Owners Association, amongst many.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues, for the sake of our future and the  protection of copyright, to support this bill.    Mr. Chair, it is my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), one of the most influential  members of the Judiciary Committee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, let me thank the gentleman from Michigan  and all of my colleagues that have spoken on this job-creating  legislation and recognition of how great America is with all of the  creative talent that  [[Page H2872]]  we have mustered, the music that you enjoy, the songwriters and others  who created both the visual and musical arts. This is what this is  about.    Now, I have listened to some of my colleagues from California. I am  not from California. I am from Houston, Texas. But we know that  creative artists and writers and those who invent and those who write  wonderful stories are all part of the arena of what America is great  about. They generate genius and they create jobs. The Copyright Office  is that protector that ensures that those jobs will be protected.   We, over a series of years in the Judiciary Committee, have looked at  reforming the copyright system. We have had hearings even with the  former Copyright Register, who indicated that putting her position in a  Senate confirmation would be the right thing to do. But it has taken 4  years.   So today we have come not to be out of order and not doing other  major aspects of reform. In fact, I want to congratulate the Librarian  of Congress who, now, is engaged in modernization. I applaud her. Her  appointment has been significant. She is innovative and is already  working to make sure that the Library and the creative arts and assets  and property of those of great talent is protected.                                time  1430    Today we address an aspect of that work, and that is we want to  continue to see the progress that our Librarian has made. We want to be  able to make on an equal status that individual that is dealing with  copyright just as the director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  status as a Presidential appointee does not compromise that person's  ability to execute their duties as head of the USPTO, nor should it  compromise or interfere with the responsibilities of cooperation,  collaboration, jurisdictional compromise, and work between the  Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights.   To the Librarian of Congress, my view is keep working, keep doing the  modernization work. I believe that as we move forward, regardless of  who at this point is in the Office of President, that we can ensure  that Congress has insight and oversight over this important position.   Let me also suggest to my colleagues that the Library of Congress is  an important part of the work of Congress, and I think all of us should  be interested stakeholders in the work that it does and should be  supporters of that.   We encourage the Library of Congress to work with America's  constituency by having programs and letting them know of the wonderful  artifacts that are there, that are held, that tell the history of this  great Nation. It is always important to be able to do research there  and to see the storied history.   Now, we come to this bill that does nothing to undermine that storied  history or the Librarian of Congress. What it does, as I have  indicated, is it helps us create jobs.   Now, in order to recognize the importance of the Librarian of  Congress, in this instance, Dr. Carla Hayden, I am very grateful that  my colleagues accepted an amendment that I have that, in fact, does do  something, and it does a very important action. It respects and  recognizes the value of Congress' insight on putting forth nominees or  names that will be selected from to become the Register of Copyrights,  not to have limited input, but to actually produce the names.   Ultimately, I hope that an amendment going forward after this bill,  working with the Senate, can be that there is a limit to the names  being put forward and that those names are the names that are put  forward to the President of the United States. I think that is an  element that should be included.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Fortenberry). The time of the gentlewoman has  expired.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. In the amendment, it has that the Speaker of the  House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the  majority leader of the House of Representatives, the majority leader of  the Senate, minority leader of the House of Representatives, and the  Librarian of Congress will be, in fact, the deciders of who gets  nominated to be the Register of Copyrights.   As we well know, the AFL-CIO has provided a letter of support, along  with the American Federation of Musicians, the Authors Guild, the  Directors Guild of America, the Graphic Artists Guild, the  International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, and Screen Actors  Guild. All of these create jobs and all of these unions have  representatives all around the Nation.   Finally, I would say it is extremely important that the musicians and  artists of color have indicated that they see no bias in this  particular legislation against the present Librarian and have written a  letter indicating that they believe that there is no bias.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has again expired.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. So I ask my colleagues to work together and to pass  H.R. 1695 to continue the process of modernization of the Copyright  Office and continue the collaborative work between the Librarian of  Congress and the Register of Copyrights. There is no difference in the  cooperation of decades before and, as well, there is no indication that  that will not occur in the future. Both of them will have 10-year  terms, and I believe that we will move forward on behalf of the  American people.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the rule under consideration for H.R.  1695, the ``Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act of  2017,'' as amended to include the Jackson Lee Amendment.   H.R. 1695, the ``Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability  Act of 2017,'' if enacted, would change the selection process for the  Register of Copyrights, who is the Director of the United States  Copyright Office, which is housed in the Library of Congress.   The Librarian of Congress, an appointed position subject to Senate  confirmation since 1987, is currently tasked with modernizing the  Library of Congress.   This legislation is not about taking power away from any individual.   In fact, Dr. Carla Hayden, the current Librarian of Congress, is by  all accounts serving the various needs of the Library of Congress very  well.   This legislation and the Jackson Lee Amendment only further the  Library's efforts to effectively modernize its copyright selection and  approval process.   Just as the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's status  as a Presidential appointee does not compromise her ability execute her  duties as head of the USPTO, the Copyright Register will not be  compromised by the fact he or she is a Presidential appointee.   Dr. Hayden is an exceptional administrator and the bill before us in  no way reflects adversely upon her.   The Jackson Lee Amendment, accepted during markup with bipartisan  support by the members of the Judiciary Committee to improve the bill,  recognizes the dual role of the Library of Congress as both a  legislative and a national institution, militating against giving  President carte blanche in nominating the Register of Copyrights.   Specifically, the bill's amended provision establishes a 7-person  panel to recommend a list of at least three (3) individuals to the  President for appointment as the Register of Copyrights.   The amendment provides that the panel membership shall be as follows:   1. Speaker of the House of Representatives;   2. President pro tempore of the Senate;   3. Majority Leader of the House of Representatives;   4. Majority Leader of the Senate;   5. Minority Leader of the House of Representatives;   6. Minority Leader of the Senate; and the   7. Librarian of Congress.   This bill is the product of years of bipartisan deliberation, and  reflects the collective and considered judgment of Members of Congress  that the Copyright Office would be strengthened as an institution were  the Register to be selected through the advise and consent process,  regardless of which political party occupied the Oval Office or  controlled majorities in Congress.   The essential role of government is to protect life, liberty and  property.   That is why a fundamental bulwark of the core values demonstrated by  our constitution is property rights--a notion understood by the  Founders at the dawn of the Republic.   For precisely that reason, the Founding Fathers recognized the  importance of IP in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution: ``To  promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.''  [[Page H2873]]    This clause, articulated by the Founders, is rooted in the notion  that the best way to encourage creation and dissemination of new  inventions and creative works to the benefit of both the public good  and individual liberty is to recognize one's right to his or her  intellectual property.   On November 12, 1975, at the investiture of Daniel J. Boorstin as the  12th Librarian of Congress, Congressman Lucien N. Nedzi of Michigan,  the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, stated:         As its name reveals, the Library is the Library of       Congress--a fact in which the Congress of the United States       takes great pride--and, of equal importance, if not more so,       it is a national library that serves all of the people of the       United States.    H.R. 1695, balanced by the Jackson Lee Amendment, strikes the proper  balance and harmonizes these dual interests.   The national interest and character of the institution is preserved  by elevating the office of the Register of Copyrights and vesting in  the President the authority to nominate the Register of Copyrights.   The legislative interest is protected by constraining the President  to select for appointment 1 of 3 persons recommended by panel that  represents the institutional interests of Congress in the Library and  its subdivisions--the joint congressional leadership and the Librarian  of Congress.   The panel only possesses the power to recommend candidates to the  President; it cannot dictate the President's choice.   Moreover, this arrangement complies with Article II, Section 2,  Clause 2 of the Constitution, which provides:         [The President] shall . . . nominate, and by and with the       advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors,       other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme       Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose       appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which       shall be established by law[.]    The Founder's wisdom is manifest in today's creative economy, which  contributes more than $1.2 trillion to GDP and supports 5.5 million  jobs.   Yet in a quirk of history, without this legislation, Congress has no  role in the selection of the Register of Copyrights, even though the  Register is Congress' statutorily designated expert advisor on  copyright policy and the head of the Copyright Office.   What is no accident is that Congress can fix this problem by passing  H.R. 1695, on World IP Day, Wednesday, April 26, 2017.   This would increase accountability to Congress as well as  transparency by giving all Americans a voice in the selection of the  Register through their elected representatives.   We can think of no better way to recognize the contributions of  copyright to the economy than by finally ascribing to the position of  Register an importance commensurate with the sector it oversees.   I urge my support for the rule, as well as the underlying legislation  as amended.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Ladies and gentlemen, in closing, I want to point out that it is  particularly appropriate that we are considering H.R. 1695 on World  Intellectual Property Day, a day dedicated to acknowledging the  critical role that intellectual property rights play in encouraging  creativity and innovation.   First established in 2001, World Intellectual Property Day encourages  engagement among governments, private industry, and the public about  the importance of intellectual property promotion and protection.   H.R. 1695 goes a long way in achieving those goals. Accordingly, I  thank my colleagues for their support, and I urge that this bill be  passed.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from the  Content Creators Coalition, dated April 25, 2017, in support of this  legislation.                                                     April 25, 2017.        Congressional Black Caucus Member: On behalf of the Content       Creators Coalition, we write in support of H.R. 1695, the       Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act,       which would modernize and provide greater transparency to the       process of selecting the Register of the Copyright Office.        This is vital legislation that will strengthen the       Copyright Office. We believe this selection process should be       granted a similar import, rigor, and transparency as the       processes of selecting other organizations, such as the U.S.       Patent and Trademark office, that oversee large industries:       Presidential nomination and Senate confirmation. In light of       the specialized knowledge required to lead this office, we       also support the appointment of an advisory group to suggest       candidates for consideration.        This legislation would place the Copyright Office on equal       footing as other economically and culturally vital agencies.       It has wide bipartisan support and was passed out of the       typically polarized House Judiciary Committee on a vote of       27-1.        As artists of color, we find it deeply offensive that       opponents of this bill have attempted to recast their anti-      creators' rights goals into a smear campaign against its       sponsors and supporters, insinuating that the legislation is       about the race and gender of the current Librarian of       Congress. The Register of Copyrights Selection and       Accountability Act is co-authored by the Dean of the House       and the Congressional Black Caucus, Judiciary Ranking Member       John Conyers, and supported by Congressman John Lewis. Their       lifelong and unshakeable commitment to civil rights is a       historical fact and should be honored and respected, not       opportunistically and baselessly questioned just to score a       few empty political points.        We would be the first to speak out against prejudice or       bias anywhere--in business, culture, the arts, or politics.       But here, we know these charges are false. The bill has       nothing to do with the current Librarian at all--in fact,       these reform proposals pre-date her appointment.        Nor does this bill have anything to do with the former       Register of Copyrights. We are grateful for her tireless       efforts and advocacy on behalf of working musicians and find       it appalling that some have engaged in efforts to drag her       record through the mud to defeat these reforms.        And certainly the bill has nothing to do with the current       President--once again, these proposals to modernize the       Copyright Office long pre-date his election. It is the height       of cynicism for bill opponents to attempt to ride on the       powerful coattails of the ``RESIST'' movement by falsely       wrapping this bipartisan pro-artist, pro-creator legislation       in the controversies surrounding the President, especially in       light of his proposal for massive cuts to funding for the       arts. In our view, misleading the President's critics by       leveraging fear into opposition for a non-controversial       proposal like this ultimately undermines and disrespects our       movement.        The need for this legislation is plain. The current system       in which the Librarian of Congress selects the Register is       the result of a unique moment in history and outdated       concerns: in 1870, the Librarian of Congress asked Congress       to give him the authority to appoint the Register in order to       deal with a massive influx of new works and the need to       quickly grow the Library's collection.        Nearly 150 years later, the functions of the Copyright       Office have changed. It is no mere registry of creative       works, but has become the most trusted advisor on Copyright       law and its interpretation for the United States Congress.       The process of selecting a leader to this office should       reflect the importance of copyright to the U.S. economy.        Congress is reviewing and revising copyright laws to ensure       they continue to protect all music creators in a time of       rapid transition online. It deserves the best advice it can       get, and reform of the Register selection process is long       overdue.        Thank you for consideration of our views,      Melvin Gibbs.      Nona Hendryx.      Ernie Isley.      Ramsey Jones.      Darrell McNeill.      V Jeffery Smith.     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I just want everyone to know that I rise  in support of this amendment. As we discovered through the Judiciary  Committee's comprehensive copyright review process, the Copyright  Office needs significant upgrades to its technology; so the gentleman's  amendment would ensure that the Register has someone on her staff with  the knowledge and skills necessary to bring the Copyright Office  information technology system into the 21st century.   It is a useful amendment. It will help modernize the Copyright  Office, and I appreciate the gentleman from Florida for offering it. I  urge total support for the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   This amendment makes clear that nothing in the bill would impact the  Library of Congress' mandatory deposit requirement. For over 100 years,  the Library has built its world-class collection, in large part,  through the mandatory deposit requirement.   So H.R. 1695 is a very narrow bill that only changes how the Register  of Copyrights is selected. I think it is helpful, and I congratulate  the gentlewoman for this very creative amendment. I urge my colleagues  to support it.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of  my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Deutch    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, the unfinished  business is the demand for a recorded vote on the amendment offered by  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) on which further proceedings  were postponed and on which the ayes prevailed by voice vote.   The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.   The Clerk redesignated the amendment.                                Recorded Vote    The Acting CHAIR. A recorded vote has been demanded.

Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Hultgren) having assumed the chair, Mr. Carter of Georgia, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  1695) to amend title 17, United States Code, to provide  [[Page H2877]]  additional responsibilities for the Register of Copyrights, and for  other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 275, he reported the  bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of  the Whole.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment  reported from the Committee of the Whole?   If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute, as amended.   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Clay for his discussion  here. I think it is courageous and necessary. To begin with, the  painting's removal by the Architect of the Capitol was an infringement  on the free speech rights of the artist and on the Congressman,  yourself, Mr. Clay, from Missouri.   The First Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that:  ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech. . .  . '' And it is undisputed that the First Amendment's free speech  guarantee extends to artistic expression, including visual arts. This  is true even when such expression may be offensive to many people or to  some people.   While Members who removed the artist's painting may have acted based  on their belief that the artwork's viewpoint was offensive, that belief  cannot trump the free-speech rights of the artist and of you, yourself,  Congressman Clay. I congratulate you for putting this discussion into  the Record.   Mr. Speaker. This past January within the very confines of the  Capitol complex, we witnessed a direct assault against the First  Amendment when several Republican Members of Congress unilaterally  removed a painting by high school senior David Pulphus from the 2016.  Congressional Art Competition display in the Cannon Tunnel.   The painting, sponsored by our colleague--Representative William Lacy  Clay--had been displayed in the Cannon Tunnel along with more than 400  winners of the Art Competition for nearly 7 months without incident or  comment.   And, rather than upholding the artist's right to free expression and  Representative Clay's prerogative to sponsor student artwork from his  district, the Architect of the Capitol capitulated to political  pressure generated by the right-wing media outlets and ratified these  Members' acts of vigilante censorship by having the painting  permanently removed from the Congressional Art Competition display in  the Cannon Tunnel.   This artwork, seemingly inspired by the events in Ferguson, Missouri  in 2014 and other incidents that sparked tension between police and  minority communities, depicts a protest, with two police officers and a  young man facing each other in a standoff, all of three which have  animalistic features.   In the background, protesters look on and a young man of color  appears to be depicted in a crucifixion tableau.   Whatever message one draws from this painting, several things are  quite clear.   To begin with, the painting's removal by the Architect of the Capitol  was an infringement on the free speech rights of Mr. Pulphus and  Representative Clay.   The First Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that  ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.''   And, it is undisputed that the First Amendment's free speech  guarantee extends to artistic expression, including visual art.   This is true even when such expression may be deeply offensive to  many people.   As the Supreme Court recognized in F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, the  ``fact that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient  reason for suppressing it. Indeed, if it is the speaker's opinion that  gives offense, that consequence is a reason for according it  constitutional protection.''   While the Members who removed Mr. Pulphus's painting may have acted  based on their belief that the artwork's viewpoint was offensive, that  belief cannot trump the free speech rights of the artist and  Representative Clay.   Nor does it justify the Architect's removal of the painting in  response to pressure from these and other Members who found the  painting offensive.   Once the House established the Congressional Art Competition and  opened the Cannon Tunnel to display artwork sponsored by each  individual Member office, it created a limited public forum.   Having created such a forum, individual House Members and the  Architect cannot then constitutionally discriminate against expression  within that forum based on the viewpoint expressed.   Yet, that is precisely what happened here.   Unfortunately, the painting's removal was part of a broader pattern  of behavior by the Majority to undermine the fundamental right of free  expression in the House.   For instance, in January the House adopted an unconstitutional gag  rule that would allow the imposition of fines of up to $2,500 on a  Member for using an electronic device to record, post, or live-stream  activity on the House floor.   This rule was a thinly-veiled response to the protest undertaken last  year by Democratic Members on the House floor with regard to the  Majority's failure to consider comprehensive gun reform.   The rule is a direct attack against the Minority's right to political  expression and it is clearly intended to stifle the American public's  ability to access that expression.   While it is easy to think that these matters concern only one young  artist or a group of House Members, every American should be deeply  concerned about such kinds of censorship.   Tyranny starts in small ways. Censor a painting here, a poem there.  Ban photos in some instances, videos in others.   When such seemingly minor acts go unanswered, it invites more  oppressive conduct in the future.   Ensuring freedom requires vigilance and a willingness to push back  vigorously against every instance of censorship.   This is why I applaud the federal lawsuit filed by Mr. Pulphus and  Representative Clay seeking to vindicate their free speech rights  though it is shameful that they were forced to go to court at all.   And, while the trial court incorrectly concluded that the First  Amendment does not protect Mr. Pulphus and Representative Clay, I am  confident this conclusion will be overturned on appeal.   All Americans must be free to speak truth to power.   Therefore, it is imperative that we draw a line in the sand now, lest  we encourage further and even more troubling acts of censorship in the  future.
