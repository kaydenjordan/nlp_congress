 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Pallone for  yielding and thank both Chairman Walden and Chairman Burgess for their  leadership in bringing this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, H.R. 5002, the ACE  Research Act, which I am proud to author with my dear friend and  colleague from Michigan, Fred Upton.   I have lived on all sides of the opioid epidemic. My father was  addicted to opioids before anyone knew what it was or before anybody  talked about it. My sister died of a drug overdose. My husband lives in  chronic pain, and because there are no alternative drugs that are safe  for him to take, he requires opioids for his debilitating pain.   We cannot let the pendulum swing too far in either direction, and we  need to find medication for those who need it. Mr. Speaker, 25 million  Americans suffer from pain every single day. While pain may not be the  fifth vital sign, it is still a major issue that needs to be addressed  in modern medicine.   We cannot stigmatize people who legitimately suffer from real pain.  That will only make the opioid epidemic worse.   If you have lived with someone in chronic pain like I have, you know  how complicated this is. People in chronic pain are being stigmatized  now for seeking treatment that will allow them to live a decent  life. People are coming up to me with metastatic cancer, concerned that  they are not going to be able to get medicine to take care of their  pain.    Unfortunately, here is a reality none of us talk about: Nonopioid  pain medicines, like Tylenol or Motrin, come with serious side effects,  especially for those who take them every day.   One thing on which we can all agree is that we need more alternatives  to opioids in this country. This way, we can give people the relief  that they need from crippling pain while not subjecting them to the  risk of addiction.   This is going to require a lot of work and a lot of research to  accomplish, which is why it is so essential that this work begin now.  The ACE Research Act accomplishes this goal by spurring innovative  research into nonopioid pain medications at NIH, which will ultimately  lead to the next big breakthrough and bring benefits to patients.   This bill gives the NIH director what is known as Other Transaction  Authority, so the NIH will be able to more easily partner with  innovative companies who are working with cutting-edge technology to  address the opioid drug crisis and other public health threats.   In congressional testimony earlier this year, NIH Director Francis  Collins said that giving the agency this authority would improve their  ability to do the research into nonopioid drug alternatives. We heard  that, and that is what we are trying to do today. It is what we are  delivering on.   There are so many people focused on the opioid epidemic these days,  but many small startup companies are hesitant to partner with the  Federal Government on research because the terms of a grant or a  contract are too rigid and no other options are available to them.   The ACE Research Act will ensure that NIH is able to partner with  real innovators on research. You never know where that next  breakthrough might lie, and this bill will ensure that we leave no  stone uncovered. By funding research on new treatments quicker, we are  ensuring that we are going to reach patients faster.   A future with more effective nonopioid, nonaddictive drugs is a  future that we all want. That is something on which we all agree.   I want to thank my friend and colleague, Fred Upton, for working with  me on this. This is a first step toward ensuring we are doing the best  research in the country on alternatives to  [[Page H5040]]  opioids for pain medication. I also want to thank our chairman and our  ranking member, and all the members, for making today the first step.   I know too well what the pain is across this country, and what we are  doing today is a beginning. We need to work together in a bipartisan  way to address what is hurting families across this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5002.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Pallone for  yielding to me, and I again want to thank Chairman Walden for bringing  this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5009, Jessie's Law, and I am  very proud of the work that I have done with my colleague, Tim Walberg,  from Michigan. In Michigan, we are really trying to address this  problem together.   This story is personal to me, as it is to Congressman Walberg and my  colleagues who have gotten to know Jessie's story. It has been a moving  experience to be part of a process to pass this legislation in her  honor.   In March 2016, we lost a brave, young woman named Jessie Grubb. She  was a great student, a loving daughter, a sister, and an avid runner.  She was, as has been noted, recovering from an opioid addiction issue.  She moved to Michigan hoping for a reset and a better future.   When she had surgery for an infection related to a running injury,  her parents came to take care of her and made it clear to the doctors  at the hospital that she was a recovering addict and should not be  prescribed opioids. As you have heard, she was discharged from the  hospital with 50 oxycodone pills. Very soon after, she suffered from a  fatal overdose.   The story of Jessie breaks your heart, mostly because this death was  preventable. We must ensure that doctors are notified when a patient  has consented to sharing information related to an addiction.   Jessie's Law would require that the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services establish best practices for ensuring that medical  professionals have full knowledge of their patient's opioid addiction  if that patient gives consent.   This is absolutely essential. If a patient has given their consent  that their history of substance abuse can be part of their medical  record, then it should be displayed prominently. We don't know all of  the facts of this case, but we do know that Jessie's parents did tell  her doctor that she had a history of substance abuse, and yet they were  prescribed anyway. We can't have this kind of information lost in the  jumble of a medical record. If a patient consents, it needs to be  prominently displayed.   Our legislation convenes a panel of stakeholders to make  recommendations as to how to best achieve this change, including a  patient with a history of opioid use disorder, an expert in electronic  health records, an expert in the confidentiality of patient health  information and records, and a healthcare provider.   Jessie's death was 100 percent preventable. And today, the House of  Representatives is sending a strong message that her loss was not in  vain and that no other family should ever have to go through what the  Grubb family has gone through. This story is a real tragedy. Hopefully,  passing Jessie's Law will bring hope to the Grubbs and others  throughout this country.   This legislation represents a commonsense step that deserves our  support, and I urge my colleagues to support Jessie's Law.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Pallone for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is a good bipartisan day for Michigan right now. It  shows you that when we want to work together, we can and do and are  going to make a difference.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5041, the Safe Disposal of  Unused Medication Act, which I am proud to sponsor with my colleague  from Michigan (Mr. Walberg). I thank him for all of his good, hard work  on this issue as we have learned together about things that are  happening.   Hospices perform an essential role in our healthcare system and we  need to make every effort to support hospice employees, who do  incredible work providing care and comfort in those final days of life.  We need to make their jobs as easy as possible.   We also need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to stop  opportunities for the diversion of opioids. This is essential if we are  going to make a real impact in ending this epidemic, which is so  devastating to families in every corner of our country.   This is an important bill, which achieves both goals of supporting  hospices and stopping opportunities for diversion. The Safe Disposal of  Unused Medication Act closes a critical gap in our laws that prohibits  hospice employees from disposing of unused opioids after a patient has,  unfortunately, passed away.   Right now, the way the law is, if a patient dies in hospice care and  they  [[Page H5045]]  have a large vial of unused opioids, the family cannot get any help  from the hospice staff to dispose of them. For the family, these are  very difficult moments. They have just lost a loved one and they don't  need any additional problems, like trying to figure out how to dispose  of the unneeded opioids.   This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to permit hospice  employees to handle controlled substances in a patient's residence in  order to assist in drug disposal upon a patient's death. This  commonsense fix is a win for patients and their families, a win for  hospice employees, and a win for public health efforts to crack down on  this diversion.   If we continue to improve our efforts to dispose of unused opioids,  like what we are doing in this legislation, then we will continue to  ensure there are fewer opportunities for those pills to end up in the  hands of those who abuse them. By passing this legislation, we can  provide for the safe destruction of thousands, literally hundreds of  thousands, of unused opioids that might end up otherwise on the street  and feed the addiction of too many.   I am pleased, as has been noted, that it has the support of both the  National Association for Home Care and Hospice, as well as the National  Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I, again, thank my friend and colleague, Mr.  Walberg, for his bipartisan work on this bill and other opioid issues,  and I urge all Members to vote in favor of H.R. 5041.
