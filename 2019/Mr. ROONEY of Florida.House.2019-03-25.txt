 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Venezuela Arms  Restriction Act introduced by my colleagues from Florida, Congresswoman  Shalala and Congressman Diaz-Balart, to whom we are deeply grateful. I  would also like to thank Chairman Sires for his support and leadership  both of our committee and of this bill.   The criminal socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro is  systematically violating the human rights of the Venezuelan people  through violence, intimidation, torture, and murder. According to local  NGO Foro Penal, there are more than 850 political prisoners in  Venezuela today.   Just last week, Maduro's intelligence services arrested Roberto  Marrero, the chief of staff for the interim President and  constitutional leader of Venezuela, Juan Guaido. The regime has made  ludicrous claims that Marrero was leading a terrorist cell and it  reportedly planted weapons and cash to try to frame him.   The Congress and the people of the United States must stand united  with the people of Venezuela to help ensure that all individuals who  violate their human rights are held accountable.   This bill supports these efforts by identifying and holding  accountable any U.S. entities providing defense articles to Maduro's  security forces, and it restricts all U.S. sales of defense articles to  his socialist criminal dictatorship.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in demonstrating our  commitment to defending the security and human rights of the Venezuelan  people by supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.   In closing, I thank the authors of the bill. Congresswoman Shalala  just spoke about the depth and breadth of the horrible humanitarian  crisis that we see on our doorstep in Venezuela. I would like to  comment that the average Venezuelan has lost over 20 kilos of weight in  the last 2 years and they haven't had protein, so the whole country is  starving to death, worse than any Warsaw Pact dictatorship has ever  done.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank Congressman Diaz-Balart and  certainly Chairman Sires for their leadership on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I call on all of my colleagues to enthusiastically  support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Humanitarian Assistance  to the Venezuelan People Act introduced by my colleague from Florida  (Ms. Mucarsel-Powell) and supported enthusiastically by our chairman,  Albio Sires.   The humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is unprecedented in our  hemisphere and is affecting the entire region. So far, more than 3  million Venezuelans have fled the criminal socialistic dictatorship of  Maduro, whose mismanagement and repression are creating immense  challenges for neighboring communities.   As Chairman Sires said, there are millions of refugees in Colombia,  the United States, and around the world who fled from Venezuelan  oppression.   This bill will ensure that we have a long-term strategy for U.S.-led  humanitarian assistance to address the crisis so that it is coordinated  effectively with local partners to meet the needs of its beneficiaries.   It condemns violent actions by the Maduro regime to block  humanitarian aid from entering the country, and it authorizes funding  necessary for future humanitarian assistance.   The administration has courageously led the humanitarian effort for  the people of Venezuela and has received invaluable support from the  Governments of Colombia and Brazil; and, more recently, the Government  of the Netherlands has agreed to allow the nearby island of Curacao to  be used as a hub to support future humanitarian aid.   The United States and this Congress must remain united in our support  for the people of Venezuela in their struggle for freedom and  democracy, especially as they struggle to survive without adequate food  and basic medicines.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we have no additional speakers.   I would like to thank the author once again, my colleague, Ms.  Mucarsel-Powell, and my neighbor in the Cannon Building.   I would like to also thank, once again, Chairman Sires for his  leadership in this area, and I enthusiastically encourage everyone in  this Congress to support this bill and prepare for the day when we can  get aid to the people of Venezuela.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the European Energy Security  and Diversification Act, which the Foreign Affairs Committee adopted  unanimously earlier this month.   This bill, sponsored by Mr. Keating and Mr. Kinzinger, for whom we  are deeply thankful, will help European and Eurasian countries reduce  their reliance on Russian energy by providing diplomatic, political,  technical, and financial support to projects that diversify energy  sources and supply routes, enhance energy market integration across the  region, and increase competition within the energy markets.   Europe imports nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia. Some  EU countries source as much as 100 percent of their gas from Moscow,  which has weaponized its energy dominance in the region to coerce,  intimidate, and influence the political decisions of countries that  depend on it for their energy.   In 2006, 2009, and 2014, Vladimir Putin cut off gas to Ukraine, a  country he has tried to dismember through his illegal annexation of  Crimea and his continued aggression in the East.   Putin is now trying to build a massive new pipeline to Germany, the  Nord Stream 2. This pipeline will increase Russian influence over  Berlin, a key NATO ally and the largest economy in the EU, and also  reduce Russia's reliance on Ukraine as a vital pipeline transit route  to other European markets. This will deprive Ukraine of its critical  transit fees, the proceeds of which are roughly equal to what it spends  on its military.   It is not hard to see that this is a strategic play by Putin to  increase pressure on Ukraine, where he continues to wage a war, and  also get closer to Germany and dominate their energy.   This bill isn't just about helping Europe. This bill advances U.S.  foreign policy and economic interests by strengthening our alliances  with countries in the region and promoting U.S. energy as an  appropriate alternative to the bondage of Russia.   The shale revolution and the repeal of the 1970s-era ban on crude oil  sales in 2015 have unlocked America's abundant oil and natural gas  reserves. These have enabled us to become the world's largest producer  of oil and gas--some 13 million barrels a day now--giving our partners  and allies a reliable alternative to unstable sources of energy.   We also lead the world in cutting-edge clean energy technologies, one  of which, carbon sequester, is very important for the environment as  well. Others are like nuclear and renewables, which this bill promotes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would once again like to thank the authors of this  important bill, Mr. Kinzinger and Mr. Keating, as well as Chairman  Sires for his support, and I am glad to know that Senator Murphy is on  the case as well.   One more time, I would just like to say, if I might, what a terrible  idea the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is, and I appreciate the strong  comments that Congressman Keating just made. We should be opposing  that, and we should be supporting the Trans-Caucasus pipeline to get  more oil into Eastern Europe, away from Russia, and out of the bondage  of their control of the pipelines.   So, I would like to thank the authors one more time and encourage all  our colleagues to support this important bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Russian-Venezuelan Threat  Mitigation Act introduced by our colleagues from Florida, Congresswoman  Wasserman Schultz and Congressman Diaz-Balart. I also want to thank  Congressman Malinowski for his leadership in bringing this to the floor  right now.   I am also deeply concerned about Russia's continued support for the  Socialist and criminal dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro and the threat  that this relationship poses to the national security of the United  States and the rest of the countries in the Western Hemisphere.   Russia has invested over $16 billion in Venezuela and has provided  billions in military equipment to that murderous regime.   In December of last year Russia sent two nuclear-capable bombers to  conduct joint exercises with the Venezuelan military. In January of  this year, he sent mercenaries to help protect Maduro--this is Mr.  Putin doing that. Just this last weekend, as Congressman Malinowski  referred to, we saw a report of about 100 additional Russian troops  landing in Venezuela.   Russia continues to finance the regime through billions of dollars in  investments and is directly aiding the Maduro regime's efforts to  bypass U.S. sanctions. There is also a great concern over the potential  acquisition of a U.S.-based oil company, CITGO, which has refineries in  Corpus Christi and Lake Charles by the Russian oil company, Rosneft,  which has a collateral position of about half of its equity.   The bill requires that the State Department provide Congress with an  assessment of the threat that the Russia-Venezuela relationship poses  to U.S. national security and a strategy to combat that threat.   The bill also requires the specific assessment of the threat posed by  a potential acquisition of the oil infrastructure I referred to, CITGO,  by their debtor, Russian state oil company Rosneft.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I urge all of our colleagues to  join us in standing against Russia's continued support for the Maduro  regime and the threat it poses to U.S. national security.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1915     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would once again like to thank my  colleagues for the three bipartisan bills on Venezuela that have been  considered by this House today.   This is one issue where all Members of Congress, regardless of party  or background, should stand together with the people of Venezuela and  support interim President Guaido's efforts to bring free and fair  elections to the country.   The criminal socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has driven  Venezuela to ruin. He is clinging to power by repressing the people of  Venezuela while surrounding himself with foreign forces from Cuba and  Russia.   Millions of Venezuelans have fled the dangerous and deteriorating  circumstances at home, as Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz mentioned  about Weston. We also know about other places in west Miami where the  Venezuelans, fortunately, are adding value to our economy now.   They have created burdens and instability far beyond Venezuela's  border. The average Venezuelan has lost 20 kilos in the last 2 years.  These people are starving to death under a repression that hasn't been  seen since Ceausescu's Romania or Stalin's Russia.   Congress should support the administration's efforts to bring  democracy and prosperity back to Venezuela, and these bills demonstrate  our support for the values of freedom and liberty that the Venezuelan  people desire and deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 1477, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
