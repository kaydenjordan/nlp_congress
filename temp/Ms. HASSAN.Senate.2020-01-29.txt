 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from New Hampshire.    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   I send a question to the desk for the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Hassan's question is for the House  managers:         Did acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney waive executive       privilege in his October 17 press conference in which he       stated that there was ``political influence'' in the Trump       administration's decision to withhold aid to Ukraine?    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of the  Senate, I thank you for that question.   Mick Mulvaney has absolutely waived executive privilege. He has never  asserted executive privilege. In fact, as President's counsel has  acknowledged, they have not asserted executive privilege once.  President's counsel has said, when we made that point during our  opening arguments, that that was technically true. No, it is true. It  is not an alternate fact; it is a fact. You have never asserted  executive privilege in connection with Mick Mulvaney's testimony or  anyone else. It was not asserted as it relates to any of the 17  witnesses who testified, 12 of whom testified publicly.   The other phony arguments that have been articulated, respectfully,  are that the House needed to vote in order for the subpoenas to be  valid. There is nothing in the Constitution that required the full  House to vote, nothing  [[Page S667]]  in Supreme Court precedent, nothing under Federal law, nothing under  the House rules. It was a phony argument. Yet the House, after the  initial stages of the investigation, did fully vote and fully voted on  October 31.   Interestingly enough, Mick Mulvaney was subpoenaed thereafter--not  before, thereafter--after the House had voted, subpoenaed on November  7. Here it is. The next day, the White House responded. They responded  with a two-page letter dated November 8. There is no mention of  executive privilege in the November 8 letter, but here is what it does  say: ``The Department of Justice (the ``Department'') has advised me  that Mr. Mulvaney is absolutely immune from compelled congressional  testimony with respect to matters related to his service as a senior  adviser to the President.''    What is interesting about this letter from Mr. Cipollone is that it  doesn't cite a single legal case for that outrageous proposition--a  single legal case for the proposition that Mick Mulvaney is absolutely  immune. Why? Because there is no law to support it. The President tried  to cheat, he got caught, and then he worked hard to cover it up.   The Senate can get to the truth. You can get to the truth by calling  witnesses who can testify. Any privilege issues can be worked out by  the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The American people deserve a  fair trial. The President deserves a fair trial. The Constitution  deserves a fair trial. That includes Mulvaney. That includes Bolton.  That includes other relevant witnesses.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Alaska.
