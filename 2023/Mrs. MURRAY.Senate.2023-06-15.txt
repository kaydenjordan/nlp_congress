 If I could, I just wanted to also take this opportunity  to thank Trish and echo the majority leader's words. All of us are  grateful for her tremendous service to each and every one of us.   As one of the few Senators who were here when she first started who  are still here, I just want to tell you the Senate will not be the  Senate without Trish. Her smile, her ability to work with us, her  knowledge of the rules, being at our back, helping us understand the  process, have really helped laws pass, changed lives, and made a  difference for all of us.   Trish, we are going to miss you, and I just personally want to share  my thanks with your family for sacrificing you for so many years to be  with us, and I wish you all the best.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in  morning business.    Mr. President, I am thrilled to join people across  Washington State and across the country in recognizing Pride Month.   Pride is an opportunity every year for people across our country and  across the world to mark the progress we have made and the work left to  do and celebrate the LGBTQ community. It is a joyful, beautiful thing,  and it stands in stark contrast to the bigotry some voices on the far  right have been fanning.   It is impossible to watch a Pride parade today without seeing just  how far we have come as a nation; and, unfortunately, it is also  impossible to follow the news without seeing a reminder of how far we  still have to go and how hard a bigoted minority of people is fighting  to pull us back.   Some far-right provocateurs have been twisting the most basic mundane  gestures of inclusion into so-called controversies through blatant  distortions and demonization. I mean, imagine calling for an  investigation into a private company because they just sent their  product to a trans person with a massive online audience.   Imagine being outraged because a company cares about having a  diverse, equitable, inclusive workplace.   Imagine getting worked up because of rainbow logos or a Pride sale or  an adorable little rainbow baby onesie.  [[Page S2119]]    I have a news flash for everyone who is trying to act like companies  selling their products to every community they can is something new or  some new nefarious conspiracy. Get this: Gay and trans people drink  beverages; they eat food; they buy things. And for suddenly everyone to  be outraged over some cute baby clothes? You know what? LGBTQ have  families, too. They are parents and aunts and uncles and grandparents.  Where have you been?   They are queer; they are here; and they have been for years. Get used  to it. They are not going anywhere.   And let's be clear: These attacks on the LGBTQ community are not just  ridiculous, they are dangerous, because we are not just talking about a  handful of far-right voices complaining about companies. There is a  truly insidious and ugly effort to demonize and ostracize and erase the  LGBTQ community and our trans friends, neighbors, and loved ones in  particular.   Far-right lawmakers across our Nation and across different levels of  government are spewing some of the most hateful rhetoric, peddling some  of the most bigoted conspiracies, and passing some of the most hateful  LGBTQ laws I have seen in a long while.   Over the past few years, these far-right politicians have taken books  with LGBTQ characters off the shelves. They have demonized drag  performers with dangerous rhetoric. They have investigated parents for  helping their kids get the care they need and blocked kids from that  care. It is extreme, cynical, and hateful to a degree that is even hard  to believe.   Far-right legislators are happy to ignore the First Amendment to ban  books and keep kids away from their entirely made-up danger of drag  shows; but they are nowhere to be found when it comes to a serious  discussion of the Second Amendment and protecting kids from gun  violence--an actual public health threat and the leading cause of death  for children in the United States.   One Republican Presidential candidate is shamelessly and falsely  suggesting that trans kids participating in youth sports might be to  blame for the teen mental health crisis and insidiously ignoring the  reality that the same kids they are using as a political punching bag  face some of the highest rates of depression and suicide of anyone.   Another Republican Presidential candidate championed a bill that is  silencing and erasing LGBTQ kids and parents and teachers from schools  by banning discussion about gender identity and sexual orientation and  banning books with the slightest acknowledgment that LGBTQ people even  exist. One school district in Florida even banned a kids' book about a  penguin--a penguin--with two dads. Seriously?    Then there is the wave of laws we are seeing that are meant to cut  kids off from age-appropriate, gender-affirming healthcare that they  rely on, like the law that passed in Idaho, right across the border  from my State, that criminalizes doctors for providing kids with  gender-affirming care that they need--care that is overwhelmingly  recommended by medical experts as safe and even lifesaving--or the vile  effort to falsely accuse loving parents whose kids are getting this  care they need as child abuse.   I said it before. It truly feels like far-right Republican lawmakers  are in a race to the bottom in pursuit of the most extreme, hateful  agenda they can think of. And their attacks have been especially cruel  to the trans community and to trans kids.   There are real consequences to this hateful rhetoric. We know the  trans community is more likely to face suicide and homelessness and  violence, and yet far-right lawmakers are using their megaphone and  their positions of power to bully kids.   That is what it comes down to. They are attacking people--attacking  kids--for being different, for being themselves.   I said it last year on the Senate floor. I am here again because I  still have to say it: We--we--all have a responsibility to stand up and  make clear that this is not right. Trans people are our friends. They  are our neighbors. They are our families. They deserve to be kids--just  kids--to play sports and go to school and see a doctor and get  healthcare. They should be able to get the same opportunities as any  other kid to learn and grow and play and thrive, free from fear and  discrimination. And parents deserve to be able to make their own  parenting decisions with their medical providers to do what is best for  their kids' health. They should not have to worry about what a right- wing politician thinks is best for their child, and they definitely  should not live in fear that a State legislature is going to intervene  in their parenting decisions and hurt their child.   We have got to push back against these attacks on trans kids every  way we can--in the courts, with legislation, through Executive action,  and by speaking out and speaking up--which is why I am here today, to  tell everyone facing these hateful attacks: You are not alone. You have  so many people in your community and in your corner.   I am proud to stand with these kids, their families, and the whole  LGBTQ community. This Pride Month, we commit ourselves to making sure  that these kids are not just safe in our country, not just welcome in  our country, but allowed to be themselves here; allowed to be joyful  and confident about who they are in every part of our country.   And in that spirit, I want to share some wisdom from Stella. She is a  young trans activist in Washington State who spoke with me last year  about the dangerous laws targeting trans communities.   I will quote her:         Opinions cannot stop us from existing. They cannot stop me       from living my dream to the fullest and following all of my       dreams . . . And opinions do not change who we are as       transgender and nonbinary people.    I certainly am proud to be a voice for young people like Stella here  in the United States Senate. Stella, I hope you are having a great  Pride Month.   My message today to everyone who has been encouraging or complicit in  the attacks on the LGBTQ community is simple: First, leave kids and  families alone. You are not their doctor. You are not their parents.  You have no idea what they are going through, what they have gone  through, or what is best for them. It is not your say, and it is not  your business.   Second: Be kind. Be kind. You do not have to bully people because  they are different. You do not have to champion hatred and fear or  anger. You can make a different choice. It is really not that hard to  listen, to learn, to respect, and accept people for who they are, to  have compassion. And I promise it will make your world brighter, and  your heart will be lighter.   Finally, if you do continue down this dangerous path--bullying kids,  erasing LGBTQ people, and demonizing them with dangerous rhetoric, I  will rise against you every step of the way, and I will do so with  pride.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
