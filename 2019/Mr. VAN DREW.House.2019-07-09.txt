 Mr. Speaker, when Joe Dietterick was told by his  guidance counselor that he should join the Vineland High School crew  team, the Fighting Clan, he wasn't interested at first. But Joe, a 16- year-old with cerebral palsy, isn't one to back down from a challenge.  All he needed was one practice on the lake, pushing his boat through  the water with his doubles partner, Jason Wheeler, to immediately fall  in love with rowing.   Joe and Jason went on to become Vineland High School's first adaptive  boat to row in the Atlantic County rowing championships, and they also  went on to compete in the Stotesbury Cup Regatta.   Joe's perseverance and willingness to challenge himself is an  inspiration to  [[Page H5292]]  his teammates; to his coach, Paul Myers; and to all who gave him the  Most Courageous award at their team's award banquet. Joe says that the  comradery and friendship that he has found with his teammates is what  means the most to him.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Dietterick for being an important part of  our community. He is an inspiration and he is a hero.                            ____________________
