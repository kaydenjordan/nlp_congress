 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, July 24, 2017, I was  unavoidably detained attending to a funeral in my home state. Thus, I  was not present for the rollcall votes that were cast. Had I been  present, I would have voted as follows:   1. H.R. 3180--Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018--I  would have voted ``no.''   2. S. 114--A bill to authorize appropriations for the Veterans Choice  Program--I would have voted ``no.''   3. H.R. 3218--Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act--I  would have voted ``yes.''                            ____________________
