 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4547, the Strengthening  Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2018, which the  distinguished chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson) and  I have introduced and on which the committee has held several hearings.  [[Page H747]]    Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge our distinguished  chairman. We on the Committee on Ways and Means are fortunate that we,  in our midst, get to work daily with two iconic American heroes: John  Lewis of Georgia and Sam Johnson of Texas. It has been my high honor to  serve as the ranking member with this great American hero and dedicated  public servant.   We all know that Mr. Johnson is indicating that he will not be  seeking reelection again. That is a great loss to the Congress and a  great homecoming for people in Plano, Texas, and his family, who richly  deserve this great American hero. He demonstrates that heroism daily in  the committee by his compassion and concern for his fellow Americans.  Much as he defended them in his service to the military, he defends  them daily here in the United States Congress.   As Chairman Brady pointed out, there is a great need within the payee  system to address a number of the concerns, as the hearings which Mr.  Johnson conducted revealed many of the inadequacies that existed. There  are currently 8 million Social Security beneficiaries who have a  representative payee to help manage their benefits, nearly half of whom  are children. In many cases, we are talking about the most vulnerable  of our citizens, many of whom cannot advocate for themselves.   That is why our bill strengthens the number of quality-of-performance  reviews by entrusting them to protection and advocacy organizations in  each State. These organizations are embedded in the communities they  serve and will be best equipped to flag and investigate instances where  payees may be abusing their beneficiaries.   Many of the State organizations have written letters of support for  H.R. 4547, including Disability Rights Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I  include that letter in the Record.                                  Disability Rights Connecticut,                                    Hartford, CT, December 13, 2017.      Representative Sam Johnson,      Chairman, Social Security Subcommittee, Committee on Ways and           Means, Washington, DC.      Representative John B. Larson,      Ranking Member, Social Security Subcommittee, Committee on           Ways and Means, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Larson: Thank you       for introducing the Strengthening Protections for Social       Security Beneficiaries Act of 2017 (H.R. 4547), bipartisan       legislation to improve and strengthen the Social Security       Administration's (SSA) representative payee program. This       legislation is necessary to create a permanent, independent       system of oversight to protect Social Security beneficiaries       from fraud and exploitation. It also addresses issues of       choice by beneficiaries and decreases reporting burdens on       families.        As an employee of the Connecticut protection and advocacy       system during the previous iteration of Representative Payee       reviews, I experienced how important it was to conduct on       site reviews of financial accounts but even more invaluable       to meet Social Security recipients, interview them and see       where they live. The reviews also informed other areas of       advocacy conducted by the agency and would be an asset to       Disability Rights Connecticut, the new protection and       advocacy system for Connecticut.        Disability Rights Connecticut's mission is to advocate,       educate, investigate and litigate to advance and protect the       civil rights of people with disabilities to participate,       equally and fully in the social and economic life of       Connecticut. As a protection and advocacy system we do this       through information and referral, technical assistance,       investigation, monitoring and advocacy. We also provide       training, education and outreach to empower individuals to       advocate for themselves and others.        Again, thank you for your sponsorship of H.R. 4547. Please       do not hesitate to contact me or refer your Connecticut       inquiries to Disability Rights Connecticut.            Sincerely,                                                   Gretchen Knauff,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, aside from that and because  of Mr. Johnson's leadership, the bill before us today has the support  of many advocacy groups, including the AARP, the National Committee to  Preserve Social Security & Medicare, the National Disability Rights  Network, the Association of Mature American Citizens, and the National  Alliance on Mental Illness. I therefore urge my colleagues on both  sides, as Chairman Brady has indicated, to join us in voting ``yes'' on  this very important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo).    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank the distinguished chairman from  Texas for the very bipartisan nature of which this bill has come  together, and that doesn't happen by accident. It happens because of  the hard bipartisan work across the aisle of the staffs whom we work so  closely with.   It also means that we want to recognize Amy Shuart, Lara Rosner, Matt  Russell, Anne DeCesaro; and from my staff, Kathryn Olson, Jason Kanter,  Morna Miller; and Jill Hunter-Williams, who is with Danny Davis' staff;  and the irreplaceable Sylvia Lee from my office as well.   It is always an honor and pleasure to work with Mr. Johnson. He is,  first and foremost, a gentleman. I look forward, later in this year, to  traveling to Plano, Texas, where I hope we can have a hearing on  Social Security in general.    Mr. Johnson has a bill and I have a bill that both have the same  goals in mind, and while there may be different approaches, I know that  his great bipartisan spirit and his gentleman nature will provide the  kind of debate and dialogue that is necessary around an issue so  vitally important to all Americans as Social Security.   This is America's greatest program and one that has never missed a  payment and is often confused as being an entitlement when, in fact, it  is the insurance that people have paid for and richly deserve. It  hasn't been changed or modified significantly since Ronald Reagan and  Tip O'Neill sat down and did that back in the early 1980s.   It is long overdue, and what better person who epitomizes the values  and virtues of Ronald Reagan and who comes from Texas and who also has  a heart as big as that great State, and I know that we will be able to  come to a resolution about this very important issue that we face.   Mr. Speaker, I close by saying that it is not often, or perhaps more  often than people would surmise, that we see this bipartisan  cooperation. But it was Hubert Humphrey who said:         The ultimate moral test of any government is the way it       treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those       who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who       are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the       handicapped.    What Mr. Johnson has done today is to epitomize those very comments  of then-Vice President Humphrey, and the Congress is responding. I  encourage everyone to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4547, the Strengthening  Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   You know, without agreement from both sides, you can't get anything  done; and without Mr. Larson, I think we would have been in deep,  serious trouble in Social Security, but he and I think alike. We are  for the people, and everything we do is trying to improve the system  over what it is today, and I thank him for his help.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge all Members of the House to vote ``yes''  and pass the Strengthening Protections for Social Security  Beneficiaries Act today so that the Senate can take action soon and  that the President can sign it into law without delay.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 4547, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
