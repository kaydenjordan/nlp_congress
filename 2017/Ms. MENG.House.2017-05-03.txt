 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the  legislation before us. Of course, this bill might not look like what it  might if we had written it by our individual selves, but I think it is  a good example of what genuine and honest compromise looks like. I  thank Ranking Member Lowey, Chairman Frelinghuysen, and their  respective staffs for their months of hard work in producing this  omnibus.    Because of their joint efforts, the NIH will receive $2 billion in  increased funding, America's coal miners will continue to receive the  health benefits they have earned, an additional $600 million is  provided to combat the opioid epidemic, needy students will be able to  receive year-round Pell grants, $3.4 billion in LIHEAP funding will be  distributed to our seniors, and $838 million will be made available for  seniors' nutrition programs.   This is what responsible governing looks like. As a member of the  House Committee on Appropriations, I look forward to working together  in this manner in the future.   Thank you again, Ranking Member Lowey and Chairman Frelinghuysen, for  your hard work in crafting this bill. I support it, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
