 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   I would simply say to my colleague from New York, if you don't want a  shutdown, if you are trying to prevent a shutdown, prove it.   There is a simple way to prove it, Madam Speaker. Defeat the previous  question so we can consider a simple amendment, an amendment that does  one thing, that let's this body take an up or down vote on the  bipartisan Republican and Democratic Senate continuing resolution that  is being negotiated as we speak. That is it. It gives that resolution  privilege so that this House can consider it, can take that up or down  vote and ensure that the government stays funded, Madam Speaker.   If you are not prepared to do that, if my colleagues aren't prepared  to do that, then please spare us these supposed concerns for a  government shutdown that you have engineered from the start.   You want to talk about blame, Madam Speaker, here is a quote, and  this is not my quote.         This is not conservatism. This is stupidity. The idea that       we are going to shut the government down when we don't       control the Senate, when we don't control the White House.       These people can't define a win. They don't know how to take       yes for an answer. It is a clown show. You keep running       lunatics, this is what you are going to have.    These are not my words, Madam Speaker. These are the words of the  gentleman from New York. If he doesn't want to be a part of this clown  show--I don't disagree with him, by the way. I don't think the American  people disagree with him either.   Clearly, the House Republican Caucus is in dysfunction and chaos, but  there is an easy way for him to leave this clown show and govern with  Republican Senators, Democratic Senators, with your colleagues on this  side of the aisle, defeat the previous question and support the  amendment and let's have the debate on a bipartisan CR that keeps our  government funded.   I don't know how a Member can vote for the previous question and  deprive this body of an opportunity to vote on that bipartisan CR. I  don't know how you go back and tell the tens of thousands, hundreds of  thousands of troops and law enforcement officers and Border Patrol  agents who will be forced to work without pay that you decided that  this body shouldn't vote on a stopgap measure to keep the government  running. I don't know how you do that.   I can tell you this: The American people well understand the  Republican plan that they have brought to the floor. You do not get to  have it both ways. You don't get to say that you support law  enforcement and fentanyl interdiction and then put a bill on the floor  that cuts the DEA, that cuts the FBI, that will harm State and local  law enforcement officers.   You do not get to say you care about public safety and then put a  bill on the floor that cuts, by more than 50 percent, wildland fire  suppression in States like Colorado, the State that I happen to be  honored to represent in the United States Congress. You do not get to  have it both ways.   The time for political games is over.   We have 24 hours to go, Madam Speaker. Let's defeat the previous  question and let's pass this amendment to keep the government up and  running.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his  indulgence, and I would be remiss to come back to the floor to simply  say only in Washington can you have Members who claim they want to  avoid a shutdown while they take every step to shut down the  government.   Only in Washington can you have Members who claim to support law  enforcement while they promote a bill that cuts funding for law  enforcement.   Only in Washington can you claim that you want to secure the border  while engineering a shutdown that will force Border Patrol agents to  work without pay.   Only in Washington can you claim that this so-called debt commission  that they have designed will not harm programs like Social Security  months after rolling out a plan--the Republican Study Committee in  June--rolling out a plan that guts Social Security.   My colleague from Pennsylvania is a member of that group. The  gentleman from Michigan who spoke earlier, who apparently has proposed  this amendment, is a member of that group. Why don't they be honest  with the American people about their plans? Because they know the plan  to cut Social Security is deeply unpopular, and, yet, they soldier on.   Mr. Speaker, 24 hours, that is how much time we have. Defeat the  previous question. Let's support the amendment to give an up-or-down  vote on the bipartisan deal that Republicans and Senate Democrats have  been working on. Let's keep the government up and running. Let's avert  this extreme Republican government shutdown.                                time  1115
