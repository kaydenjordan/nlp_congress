 Mr. President, this may be one of the most important  votes in this new session of the Senate relative to the Trump  administration. It is a Cabinet position most people are not aware of,  except if you work here. It is the Director of the Office of Management  and Budget.   This individual has the authority to write the President's budget, to  establish priorities, and to review Federal spending governmentwide. It  is a big job. It is an awesome responsibility. The way it is executed  will not only lead to an accounting of our Federal expenditures, but it  will have a direct impact on America's economy.   The choice of Congressman Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina for this  job is wrong. It is wrong based on his record in the House of  Representatives. He was a founding member of the Freedom Caucus in the  House of Representatives. That is a group which led to the resignation  of Speaker Boehner and continues to tie the House of Representatives  into knots. Why? Because they have certain tactics they believe are  credible tactics, which Congressman Mulvaney signed up for. Let me give  one of them.   They think closing down the government is a good way to get people's  attention. Well, they are right. It sure gets attention. But it does it  at the expense of innocent people across America--taxpayers, those who  are receiving critical programs, and Federal employees who are waiting  for their paychecks. Congressman Mulvaney signed up for that.   Once every year or so we have to decide to lift what is called the  debt ceiling, which is the indebtedness of the United States, the full  faith and credit of our government--really, the credibility of our  government when it comes to financing. Congressman Mulvaney, who wants  to head the Office of Management and Budget, has said we can default on  our national debt, and it really won't cause that great of a problem.  That is just the beginning of some of his bizarre views.   He said he wants to end the Medicare program as we know it. He calls  Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He has called for a 25-percent  reduction in reimbursement for Medicaid; that is health insurance for  children, the disabled, and the elderly in America. He also has  questioned whether the United States as a government should continue to  invest in medical research.   I am not making this up. This man who wants to set the priorities for  the Trump administration and deliver the budget for America's future  questions whether our Federal Government should invest in medical  research.   When it came to paying for natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy-- and it happens to every State--he decided that instead of coming to the  rescue of people in an emergency, we would have to cut entitlement  programs--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--as well as military  spending, in order to pay for disasters. That is how shortsighted he  has been, and President Trump has chosen him to write the budget for  America.   I just have to say that his priorities as a founding member of the  Freedom Caucus disqualify him for this job, in my consideration. The  fact that he would repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement  and leave some 30 million insured Americans without the promise of  healthcare security for their families is another indication of an  extreme point of view which should not be defining our government in  Washington.   I have no doubt Republicans are going to march in lockstep, with  maybe one exception. Senator McCain has said he is going to vote  against him. I think they will end up giving President Trump his man as  head of the Office of Management and Budget. But we are in for a battle  royal over the values in America. You can judge that values of a nation  not by political speeches but by our budget.   Congressman Mulvaney will cut some of the most basic and fundamental  programs of our government, would endanger our economy by questioning  the full faith and credit of the  [[Page S1227]]  United States, and is prepared to shut down the government to get his  way. That is not a responsible course when it comes to budgetmaking in  a great nation like America.   I will be opposing the nomination of Mick Mulvaney to be head of the  Office of Management and Budget.    Mr. President, I rise again to speak about the epidemic  of gun violence in the city of Chicago and across America.   The American Medical Association has declared gun violence as a  public health crisis in America. Every day, almost 300 men, women, and  children are shot in this Nation. Gun violence touches every American  community, but no community has suffered more than the city of Chicago.   I am honored to represent that city. I love it, and I think it is a  great city. I spend a lot of time there to get to know the people who  were born there and live their lives there and call it home. It is a  great honor to call it part of my State that I am honored to represent.   The stories that are coming out of the city of Chicago are  heartbreaking stories--and none worse than this week. This week there  was a slaughter of the innocents. In a 4-day period earlier this week,  three beautiful children under the age of 12 were fatally shot.   On Saturday night, 11-year-old Takiya Holmes, sitting in her mom's  car, was shot in the head and killed. A 19-year-old suspect in custody  has been charged. He reported that he was shooting from across the  street at rival gang members, and a stray bullet hit Takiya. She died  on Tuesday morning.   On Saturday, 12-year-old Kanari Gentry-Bowers was shot while playing  basketball in the West Englewood neighborhood. She passed away just  yesterday.   On Tuesday at 1:30 in the afternoon, 2-year-old Lavontay White was  shot and killed while sitting in the car with his pregnant aunt and  uncle. Lavontay's uncle was also killed. His aunt was wounded.   These shootings are senseless, devastating, and heartbreaking.  Already this year there have been over 400 shootings in Chicago--so far  this year. That is after there were more than 4,300 shootings last  year.   My thoughts and prayers, of course, go to the victims and their  families. I have attended so many marches and parades, funerals, and  memorial services. But thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need to  do something to reduce this epidemic of gun violence. There have been  too many funerals, too many families who have lost that baby they  loved, too many children who suffered the physical and mental trauma of  gunshot wounds and witnessing violence. Many of these shootings could  have been prevented, but it is going to take changes in our laws and  changes in our attitude for that to happen.   We have absurd loopholes in our gun laws that make it easy for  dangerous people to get their hands on guns. We have obvious gaps in  our gun background check system. We have inadequate Federal laws to  stop gun trafficking and straw purchases of guns. These factors allow a  flood of illicit guns to come into Chicago from other towns and States,  from gun shows in neighboring States where there is no background  check. These drug gangs drive over to these locations and fill up the  trunks of their cars with guns to take them and sell them in the  neighborhoods to kids who shoot and kill one another day in and day  out.   We have gun dealers--federally licensed gun dealers--who look the  other way when someone comes in to make a straw purchase. That is the  purchase of a gun that the purchaser is not going to use but is going  to give it to somebody who is prohibited from buying a gun.   In light of the epidemic of gun violence in our country, Congress  should be working around the clock to fix these gaps in our Federal  law. But the Republican-controlled Senate is doing nothing to address  gun violence in Chicago or anywhere else. Instead, look at what we just  did yesterday. Just yesterday, this Senate, on this floor, voted to  weaken the gun background check system instead of strengthening it. It  is hard to understand how the Republican Party can have its priorities  so wrong when it comes to gun violence.   We can respect Second Amendment rights of individuals. We can respect  the rights of people to own a gun for self-defense, for sporting and  hunting purposes. I have gone hunting. I have used a firearm. I  complied with every law in the books, all of them. The hunters who were  with me did too.   Why is it so hard to ask before we sell a gun to someone whether they  have a criminal record, whether they are buying it for another person  who might have a criminal record, or whether they have a history of  mental instability, which would disqualify them from owning a gun?   We are facing a crisis in Chicago and across the Nation because of  this violence. We in Congress have a responsibility to do everything we  can at the Federal level to protect our constituents, our neighbors,  from getting shot. We can't ignore this responsibility, and we  certainly shouldn't be weakening gun laws as the Senate did yesterday.   We also need the Federal Government to be an engaged partner with  cities like Chicago to help reduce violence and expand economic options  in depressed neighborhoods. You can pick out three neighborhoods in the  city of Chicago that account for almost 50 percent of gun violence-- three neighborhoods. I visited some of them. They warned me: Don't get  out of the car. They are right. Random gunfire is a reality of life in  those neighborhoods. We know where they are. We know where the shooters  live. We know where the victims are. We can do more.   President Trump sends out a lot of tweets. He likes to tweet about  Chicago, and I am not quite sure why. Tweeting doesn't save lives.  Saying that you are going to send in the Feds may be one of those short  tweets that is catchy, but it doesn't mean a damned thing to the people  who are being shot and are dying in the city of Chicago.   Last week I joined my colleague Senator Tammy Duckworth, and we sent  a letter to the President asking him to do more than tweet when it  comes to Chicago.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                           United States Senate,                                  Washington, DC, February 10, 2017.      President Donald J. Trump,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Trump: During the 2016 presidential campaign       and in numerous tweets and comments since the election, you       have lamented the recent surge of gun violence in Chicago and       said the federal government could help stop the violence.       While the level of shootings and homicides is clearly       unacceptable, tweeting alone will not fix it. Tweeting does       not break cycles of violence; tweeting does not help lift       people out of poverty; tweeting does not save lives. We urge       you instead to provide a surge in federal support and       resources for Chicago to reduce violence and expand economic       opportunities for neglected communities.        Public safety is primarily a local responsibility, but the       federal government must be an engaged partner in public       safety efforts alongside local officials, law enforcement,       and community stakeholders. There is much the federal       government can do to help.        Instead of tweeting, you could begin by directing your       Administration to enhance U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)       programs that improve community policing, such as the COPS       Hiring Program to help local police departments put more cops       on the beat, and the Byrne-JAG grant program to enable local       law enforcement to purchase or upgrade equipment. We note       that in his first year in office, President Obama pushed for       a surge in COPS and Byrne-JAG funding through the Recovery       Act and the appropriations process that provided Chicago with       $13.256 million in COPS Hiring funding and $35.637 million in       Byrne-JAG finding. This is more than four times the amount of       COPS funding and 15 times the amount of Byrne-JAG funding       that the City received last year. You could push for a       similar funding surge.        We also urge you to direct DOJ to promote mentoring and job       training programs for youth and the formerly incarcerated. We       are ready to work with you to strengthen the Office of       Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to improve       mentoring and violence prevention initiatives and to boost       funding for recidivism reduction programs under the federal       Second Chance Act. We urge you to direct DOJ to abide by its       commitment to help implement policing reforms  [[Page S1239]]       recommended by the Department's Civil Rights Division. We       also request your support for legislation to close gaps in       the FBI gun background check system and in federal firearm       laws that enable straw purchasers and gun traffickers to       flood Chicago's streets with illicit guns.        Federal efforts must also transcend law enforcement and       criminal justice programs to focus on causal factors,       including the lack of economic opportunity. We urge the U.S.       Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Labor to       prioritize important career and youth training programs that,       if properly funded and expanded, would address the role that       poverty plays in the violence epidemic facing Chicago and       other communities around the country.        Before you send your next tweet, you could request a surge       in additional federal resources for these public safety and       economic development efforts in Chicago. But so far, your       Administration has refused to commit to spend any additional       resources to combat Chicago's violence and has actually       threatened to cut federal funds for the City. Now is not the       time for the federal government to abandon its support for       Chicago and its people.        This week, you reportedly attributed Chicago's crime       situation to the presence of undocumented immigrants. This       coincides with your January 25 executive order that makes up       to eight million immigrants priorities for deportation and       seeks to create a mass deportation force by tripling the       number of immigration agents. The vast majority of immigrants       in our country are peaceful and have strong family values,       and studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to       commit serious crimes than native-born individuals. We are       aware of no evidence that undocumented immigrants are       responsible for any significant proportion of the murders in       Chicago, and claims otherwise do nothing but distract from       efforts to meaningfully reduce the City's recent increase in       violence.        We note that you have urged Congress to fund the       construction of a wall on the Southern border that would       reportedly cost at least $21.6 billion, even though the wall       would not fix our broken immigration system and even though       Republican Congressman Will Hurd, whose district covers 800       miles of the border, has said ``building a wall is the most       expensive and least effective way to secure the border.'' If       your Administration were to take even one percent of this       funding and devote the resources instead to help Chicago's       public safety efforts, it would make a dramatic difference in       reducing Chicago's violence. We urge you to reprioritize       federal resources that you would request for wall       construction and commit those resources instead to reducing       gun violence in Chicago and other violence-prevention efforts       around the nation. Doing so could save many more lives than       tweeting.        Thank you for your consideration on this important issue.            Sincerely,      Richard J. Durbin,        U.S. Senator.      Tammy Duckworth,        U.S. Senator.     We asked the President to put his twitter account down  for a few minutes and instead direct his Department of Justice to  enhance programs that improve community policing, such as COPS and the  Byrne-JAG grants. We asked him to provide a surge in these programs,  just like President Obama did in his first year through the Recovery  Act and the appropriations process.   We also asked the President to direct the Justice Department to  promote mentoring and job training programs. I want peace on the  streets of Chicago and every American city, and I know that one of the  keys to this is the belief that there is a chance in this economy for  you and your family.   We need to have mentoring and job training programs for young people  through the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and  for former incarcerated persons through the Federal Second Chance Act.   We asked the President to support policing reforms recommended by the  Justice Department in Washington. We asked him to support our efforts  to close the gaps in Federal gun laws.   There is no denying that poverty plays a role in fueling violence and  in violating justice. We asked the President, also, to prioritize  funding for jobs programs under the Departments of Labor and Education.  These are concrete steps that would help reduce violence in Chicago.   So far, President Trump's administration has not committed any  additional resources to combatting Chicago's violence. Mayor Emanuel  was here a few days ago to meet with the Department of Justice and to  make the same plea. The administration instead is threatening to cut  funding, on top of the devastating funding cuts we have already seen in  Illinois under our current Governor.   Now is not the time for the Federal Government to abandon support for  the families living in this great city. I urge the President and his  administration to reprioritize Federal resources to reduce gun violence  in Chicago and around the Nation. It is going to save a lot more lives  than tweeting.   If you will not do it for two Democratic Senators, do it for these  families. Do it for the moms and the relatives who are now planning the  funeral services of these babies who were gunned down in the city of  Chicago this week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, before I make a statement on Scott Pruitt,  to my colleague and friend from Colorado, I couldn't agree with you  more. What happened in Colorado was an environmental tragedy, and we  saw the photos. It is horrible. I don't know who is responsible for it,  but it appears to be a government agency, and they should be held  accountable. I will join you in that effort. I don't think there is any  Member who wouldn't join you in saying there ought to be justice done  here.  [[Page S1358]]  We shouldn't let them off the hook because they are EPA employees or  employees of the Federal government.   But I don't understand the leap in logic from that position to Scott  Pruitt. Scott Pruitt is a man who, as attorney general of Oklahoma, has  filed more than 14 lawsuits to restrict the authority of the EPA to  clean up rivers.    I am happy to yield for the purpose of a question.    I said to the Senator from Colorado that I will join you.  If the EPA is responsible for this spill, then I will stand with you.  Justice should be done.   The point I am making to you is that this leap of logic then--to put  Scott Pruitt in charge of the EPA--is really taking away the power of  this Agency to avoid that kind of environmental disaster.    I will be glad to yield for a question.    I reclaim my time and just say this. I do not know the  particulars. I understand that what you said is what I read, that it  was the fault of some government employee--perhaps of the EPA. I don't  dispute that fact. If that is the case, then we have a responsibility  to your State to make it whole again. And whoever the EPA Administrator  is should face that responsibility. I will join you in that effort.   But to go from there to say Scott Pruitt is the man to head the EPA  because he is going to acknowledge this one fact, is to ignore his  record, to ignore his position on the environment.   The Senator from Colorado, I know has to leave the floor, but I want  to continue on this vein. Yesterday, the President of the United States  decided to sign a resolution. He had a big gathering. He had Senator  McConnell, the Republican leader and other Members of the Senate and  the House. It was a big celebration. Representatives of mining  companies, coal companies, even mine workers were there celebrating the  repeal of an EPA rule. What was the repeal of that rule? The repeal of  that rule related to what the mining companies could dump into rivers  and streams from their mining operations. What was the fear? The debris  in toxic waste that they would dump in the rivers would end up killing  rivers, just like the river that the Senator from Colorado has given a  speech on.   I might add that he voted to repeal that rule. So now we have the  President of the United States saying we are going to revitalize the  mining economy by eliminating a rule that restricts mining companies  from dumping debris and toxic waste into rivers and streams. Now, that  doesn't follow.   If you are dedicated to keeping our rivers and streams healthy and  pure and reliable sources for safe drinking water, you don't do what  President Trump did yesterday. You don't do what the Republicans in the  Senate did just a few days ago and remove this rule. I struggled to  understand.   I see my friend from Delaware is here. The Senator and I have been in  this business for a long time together. I won't say how many years.   He knows, I know, and some others know, but most people would be  surprised of the following: Which President of the United States  created the Environmental Protection Agency? Richard Milhous Nixon,  1970. A Republican President created this Agency which has become the  bete noire for the Republicans--the most hated Federal agency, created  by a Republican President.   Why? Because at that moment in time, America was awakening to Rachel  Carson's ``Silent Spring'' and to so many other factors, when we  finally concluded there was something we were doing to the environment  that was harmful, not just to the environment but to the Earth, which  we hoped to leave our children.   We joined together on a bipartisan basis--this is before I was in  Congress--to create this Agency which Scott Pruitt seeks to lead. Now,  what has happened? What has happened is there has been a role reversal  here. The Republicans, who used to be part of environmental protection  and safety, have now abandoned it.   In fact, that is the drum they beat on most often, when they talk  about overregulation, the Environmental Protection Agency. Yesterday,  this President--28 days into his Presidency--could not wait to sign a  rule that allows mining companies to dump toxic waste and debris into  rivers and streams. You know the argument: It is just too expensive not  to. If we are going to make a profit, if we are going to employ people,  then you have to let us dump this into the rivers and streams.   I don't buy it. The reason I don't buy it is that I can remember many  years ago, the first time I went across my State of Illinois and took a  look at abandoned mine lands. These were lands that were strip mined,  which means they brought in bulldozers and really just found the coal  deposits, not just that for below the surface of the land. They ripped  out the coal and left the mess behind for future generations.   It was horrible--a horrible environmental disaster. They walked away  from them after they made the money. They went out of business and left  that mess behind for the next generation or the one beyond it.   I am all in favor of mining. Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong  with it at all. But responsible mining means that you are responsible  when it comes to the environment. You just don't make your money and  leave, you accept the responsibility to leave behind something that is  as good as or better than the way you found it. It is known as  stewardship. It is Biblical.   This is kind of a moral responsibility which we accept on this Earth  that we live on, to leave it better than we found it. The Environmental  Protection Agency is there for that purpose.   I would say to the Senator from Delaware, they did a survey in  Chicago a few years ago. They asked the people of Chicago: What is the  one thing unique and defining about that city? Overwhelmingly, the  response was Lake Michigan, as it should be--this magnificent great  lake which borders the city of Chicago.   It is a source of so much fun and joy and aesthetic beauty. We look  at it and thank the good Lord that we have the good fortune of living,  as many of us do, part time, full time, right there on the banks of  Lake Michigan.   It was about 5 or 6 years ago that I heard a story about a ship on  Lake Michigan. It was an auto ferry. It took passengers and automobiles  across that beautiful great lake. It moved them from Wisconsin to  Michigan. The name of the ship was the SS Badger. It had been around  for decades. It was kind of an institution.   Come the summer months when people would cross that lake to head over  to Michigan or back over to Wisconsin, they would pile on and bring on  their automobiles and families. It was a great excursion. But we came  to learn that there was another side to the story. The SS Badger was  the last coal-fired auto ferry on the Great Lakes. It burned coal to  run the engine to move the ship across Lake Michigan.   That, in and of itself, raises some interesting questions about  pollution coming off the smokestack of the SS Badger. It turned out  that wasn't the worst part. The worst part is that for decades, as the  SS Badger trekked across Lake Michigan, it not only burned coal, it  dumped the coal ash overboard while it was going across the lake.   This potentially dangerous and toxic coal ash was being dumped into  Lake Michigan day after day after day. The Environmental Protection  Agency came in and gave us the facts. It turned out that the auto  ferry, that one ship, was the dirtiest ship on the Great Lakes. It  created more pollution, more damage to the Great Lakes and  [[Page S1359]]  its environment, than any other ship. Believe me, there are plenty of  ships that traverse the Great Lakes. This was the filthiest, dirtiest  ship.   The EPA said to the SS Badger: We know you employ people. We know you  perform an important function. But clean up your act. So what did the  SS Badger do, in light of this EPA finding? Well, they fought them all  the way. They came to Congress and asked that Congress designate the SS  Badger as a historical monument. A historical monument? Well, it was an  old ship. There is no doubt about it. But the notion that came from the  Congressmen from Michigan and Wisconsin was, by designating it a  historical monument, it would be exempt from environmental protection  laws.   So the dirtiest ship--the SS Badger--on the Great Lakes would somehow  have historical status and continue to pollute Lake Michigan. I thought  it was outrageous. A number of us joined in stopping that effort.  Instead, we said to the EPA: You have given them years to clean it up.  Now do something about it.   Next thing, surprisingly, the owner of the SS Badger asked to meet  with me in my office. I said sure. He came in and he said: Senator, we  employ 100 people. We have been doing this for years. We cannot  technologically clean up the SS Badger. It just can't be done. We would  lose too much money.   I said: I am sorry, but that is unacceptable. You cannot tell me that  because of profitability you need to continue to create a bigger mess  in the Great Lakes than any other ship on the Great Lakes.   So he went back and lawyered up and decided he would fight the EPA. I  stood with the EPA, the regional office out of Chicago. We had a battle  on our hands. A rule was issued by the EPA.   I hear so many Republicans come to the floor bemoaning rules and  regulations. Let me join that chorus. Are there too many rules and regs  in some areas? Yes. Are there some rules and regs which I could never  explain or even try to defend? Certainly.   But the rules and regulations of the EPA many times are critically  important. In this case, that was exactly what we found. So the EPA  issued a rule and regulation that said to the SS Badger: You have been  given years to clean up, and you will not do it. So now the clock is  ticking. There will come a moment when you will be subject to a  substantial fine if you don't clean up your act.   Do you know what happened because of this onerous EPA regulation? Do  you know what happened to the SS Badger, whose owner said that it was  technologically impossible for them to clean up this mess? They came up  with the most basic, simple solution. You wonder why they waited so  long. They now hold the coal ash on the SS Badger as they go back and  forth across Lake Michigan. They remove it once they get to shore and  put it into an environmentally acceptable waste disposal.   This was an obvious answer for decades, but they would not do it. It  took the Environmental Protection Agency to step up and threaten it  with a rule and a fine. Now they are finally doing it.   So I say to those who loathe government rules and regulations: This  was a good one. For the health of the Great lakes, for God's gift to us  of that beautiful body of water, we did the right thing and the EPA was  there to do it.   Yesterday, when President Trump signed this new resolution that  repealed the rule, he was reversing what I just described to you. He  was saying to mining companies across the United States: Be my guest.  Dump toxic waste and debris in our rivers and streams.   He did it in the name of job creation. We all want to create jobs,  but if we are creating jobs at the expense of the health of rivers and  lakes, if we are creating jobs at the expense of safe drinking water,  that is a bargain I will not be part of.   Many times I have had a conversation with my wife and friends. I  guess it reflects the fact that we have been on this Earth a little  longer than some. You wonder out loud. You say: Why in the world do we  have more autism today than we once had? Why do we have more cancers  than we once had? People have a lot of theories. Some of them are wild  and unfounded. But many times people say: Could it possibly be the  chemicals in our drinking water? I do not know.   I am a liberal arts lawyer. Don't get me near a laboratory; I would  not know what to do with it. But it is a legitimate question, whether  there is some contamination in our drinking water, which has a public  health impact. Someday we may discover that.   Isn't it best for us to err on the side of keeping our drinking water  as safe and clean as possible? I think so. I don't want to turn on the  tap and drink the water and think that I am making myself sicker or  more susceptible to a disease. I sure as heck don't want to do it for  my kids and grandkids. What Agency is responsible for that? It turns  out to be the Environmental Protection Agency. That is the Agency that  Scott Pruitt seeks to head.   He is a terrible choice. I am sorry to say that. I shook hands with  him once. I don't know him very well. But when you look at what he has  done--I think of a letter I received from Dale Bryson in Illinois. I  don't know him personally. He wrote to me and he said:         Having served under both Republican and Democratic       Presidents, we recognize each new administration's right to       pursue different policies or ask that Congress change the       laws that protect our environment. But EPA's administrator       must act in the public's interest and not simply advance the       agenda of any specific industry that EPA regulates.    Mr. Bryson goes on to say:         The agency is lucky to have had EPA administrators,       Republicans and Democrats, with the patience, skill and       commitment to public service that is needed to steer through       these challenges and deliver the clean and healthy       environment that Americans want at a price they are willing       to pay. We do not believe Scott Pruitt has demonstrated that       he has the qualities needed to lead the Environmental       Protection Agency.    He was not the only one who wrote to me. I have heard from  constituents who believe that sensible environmental regulation is  critical for us to have a clean planet to live on and leave to our  kids. Tim Hoellein, a professor at Loyola University in Chicago,  conducts research on water pollution in city environments. He wrote to  me and said:         I note our city, State and county have made some major       advances toward better infrastructure and policy for clean       water. However, we are still not meeting our obligations to       our neighbors and future generations by rising to the best       standards of water stewardship. Those gains are at eminent       risk with the appointment of Mr. Pruitt to the EPA.    Finally, I want to read a letter from a Chicago resident, Ms. Maureen  Keane. She wrote to me and she said:         I love my country. I love our beautiful environment and my       family. We need a strong advocate for our land and people to       head the EPA. That person is not Scott Pruitt. Hundreds of       former employees of the EPA agree with me. That must mean       something. Pruitt has a record of doing everything he can to       shut down and dismantle the EPA. We need a strong advocate       who has the ability to create a balance between business and       our land and people resources, one who can create strong laws       for which businesses can agree on and adhere to while       protecting our most precious assets, people, wildlife, and       our land.    She says:         As someone who grew up surrounded by dirty water in the       Little Calumet River, next to a train yard, and surrounded by       onion fields with pesticides, I have seen first hand family       and neighbors die young from cancer. Please oppose Pruitt if       you love America and your family. This is a decision that can       be costly for future generations.    These letters really are just a handful of those that I have received  on the subject. Scott Pruitt has alarming conflicts of interest with  the oil and gas industry.   My friend and colleague, Senator Carper of Delaware, has taken on  this nomination professionally and in the right way. He has helped us  reach a point now where we have to say to our friends on the Republican  side of the aisle: Be careful about the vote that you cast at 1 o'clock  today, because by 1 o'clock on Tuesday or Wednesday, in the following  week, you may regret that vote.   The reason I say it is that Senator Carper has been working with  groups trying to get a disclosure of the emails that Scott Pruitt,  attorney general of Oklahoma, had during the course of serving as  attorney general, while he was filing some 14 different lawsuits  against the Environmental Protection Agency. He was caught red-handed  taking a letter written by one of these energy companies and changing  the letterhead and calling it an official statement from his own  attorney general's office. So he clearly has a comfortable,  [[Page S1360]]  if not cozy, relationship with the energy companies. That, in and of  itself, is not condemning or damning, but if it ends up that he is  seeking this position to advocate their political position, rather than  to protect America's environment, that is a relevant issue.    Senator Carper has been working with groups night and day to get  disclosure of emails that were sent to Scott Pruitt and sent by him  between oil and gas companies and other energy companies to determine  whether there are any conflicts we should know about before giving him  this job.   I understand that late this morning, our Senator from Oregon, Mr.  Merkley, may be coming and asking for us to postpone this vote until  these emails are publicly disclosed. Is it 5, 6, 10 emails? I think it  is thousands, isn't it? Some 3,000 emails.   The Republican Senators and Senator McConnell have said: We don't  want to read them. We don't care what is in them. It doesn't make any  difference if there is a conflict of interest. This is Scott Pruitt. He  is our man. President Trump wanted him. We don't want to read the  facts. We don't want to know the evidence. We just want to give a good,  loyal vote to our President.   I don't think that is the way we should meet our responsibilities in  the Senate. This thoughtful and sensible thing to do is to postpone  this vote until we return. We are going to be gone next week because of  the President's recess. Scott Pruitt can wait 10 days, and we can wait  for the truth, can't we?   The Environmental Protection Agency will continue to do its business  with its professionals, but before we put him in the job--which we may  come to regret in just a few days--shouldn't we take the time to do  this and do it thoughtfully?   As Oklahoma attorney general, he sued the EPA 14 times. He was often  partnering with the very industries he is now being called on to  regulate. Though some of these lawsuits are still ongoing, he will not  even commit to recuse himself.   He was asked during the course of his hearing: As attorney general of  Oklahoma, you sued the EPA. The EPA, as an Agency, has the first level  of administrative hearing on those lawsuits. Will you, if you become  Administrator and Secretary of the EPA, commit to recuse yourself from  those lawsuits you filed?   He said: No.   That means he could have a very interesting position when those  lawsuits come up for consideration. He will be the petitioner and the  plaintiff; Scott Pruitt, attorney general of Oklahoma. He will be the  defendant; Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt,  Administrator, and Secretary. He will also be the jury; the  Environmental Protection Agency, headed up by Scott Pruitt in his  administrative capacity.   What a sweetheart deal. I used to be a trial lawyer. This would be  the answer to a prayer. I get to be the plaintiff and the defendant and  the judge?   Scott Pruitt wants to protect his right to do that so he can continue  to protect the special interests he represented as attorney general of  Oklahoma.   Common sense suggests to any lawyer licensed to practice in America  that this is a conflict of interest which needs to be avoided, but  Scott Pruitt says: No, they have to go forward, and I have to win this  lawsuit.   You know what, I think he is going to win the lawsuit if he doesn't  recuses himself.   We need to ensure that the EPA has strong leadership, that it is  dedicated not to energy companies, not to oil companies, not to gas  companies but to protecting all Americans. Literally, lives depend on  it.   President Donald Trump has chosen not just a man with an  extraordinary amount of conflicts of interest but a person who is a  climate-denier. He said some things that are nothing short of amazing.   Look at this quote by Scott Pruitt, candidate for Administrator of  the EPA:         The debate about climate change is just that, a debate.       There are scientists that agree, there are scientists that       don't agree, to the extent of man's contribution and whether       it is even harmful at this point.    Really? So 98 percent of scientists--98 percent--have said that  something is happening to this world, and human activity is the reason,  98 percent of them. Greenhouse gas emissions, carbon in our atmosphere,  obvious changes, glacial melts, the rising of the oceans, extreme  weather conditions that we are facing--just a casual observer would  understand that is a reality, but not this man, not the man who seeks  to head the Environmental Protection Agency. To him, it is still being  debated.   He is in this rarified group with blinders. You see him here with his  glasses. He wants to put on blinders when it comes to climate change.  And this is the man President Trump has chosen to head up the  Environmental Protection Agency?   The Chicago Sun Times, on December 8, had an editorial entitled ``Foe  of EPA is wrong person to lead it.'' Here is what they said:         Unfortunately, President-elect Donald Trump has appointed       Scott Pruitt, an open foe of environmental initiatives, to       head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. That       demonstrates a callous disregard for the health of our nation       and planet just as rapid technological advances hold out hope       for avoiding the worst effects of climate change.        The U.S. Senate should reject Pruitt.    They go on to say:         During his campaign, Trump said he would dismantle       President Barack Obama's environmental policies and pull the       United States out of the 195-nation Paris accord to reduce       greenhouse gases and climate change. After the election,       Trump moderated his tone, saying he has an open mind about       climate change. His appointment of Pruitt, however, suggests       that if he's open to anything, it's strictly more pollution.    They go on to say:         The EPA is all about science. Someone who doesn't believe       in science can't do the job.    His appointment would send a message to the rest of the world that  the United States is not a partner in efforts to reduce emissions of  greenhouse gases. The damage could be incalculable.   If a house divided against itself could not stand, neither can a  government agency.   When you listen to what Scott Pruitt has said about science, you  realize this man has no business heading up the Environmental  Protection Agency.   Listen to what he said in February 2012: The amount of human exposure  to mercury from U.S. powerplants is small. ``Human exposure to  methylmercury resulting from coal fired EGUs is exceedingly small.''   Here is what the scientists say:         As a result of these long-term mercury inputs [from coal-      fired electric utilities], there are hotspots and whole       regions, such as the Adirondacks of New York, the Great Lakes       region of the Midwest and large portions of the Southeast       where the fishery is contaminated with mercury. . . . There       are more fish consumption advisories in the U.S. for mercury       than all other contaminants combined.    The source of this scientific statement: Dr. Charles Driscoll from  Syracuse University.   Here is what Mr. Pruitt said about mercury and air toxic emissions  from power plants: ``Finally, the record does not support EPA's  findings that mercury, non-mercury HAP metals, and acid gas HAPs pose  public health hazards.''   Here is what the scientists say: ``There is no evidence demonstrating  a `safe' level of mercury exposure.'' Source of that statement: Dr.  Jerome Paulson from the Council on Environmental Health, American  Academy of Pediatrics, before the Senate EPW Committee.   Scott Pruitt isn't quite sure if mercury is really that dangerous.  Scientists disagree.   Mr. Pruitt, when talking about the benefits from cleaning up  powerplant mercury emissions: The benefits of cleaning up powerplant  mercury are ``too speculative,'' said Mr. Pruitt, and ``not supported  by the scientific literature.'' Concluding, ``EPA cannot properly  conclude that it is `appropriate and necessary' to regulate hazardous  air pollutants under section 112.''   That is a statement from Scott Pruitt's legal brief in Murray Energy  Corporation v. EPA, November 2016.   What do the scientists say about Mr. Pruitt's observations? ``U.S.  efforts to reduce mercury emissions, including from power plants, are  benefiting public health much faster than could have been predicted in  1990.'' Source of that  [[Page S1361]]  statement: Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of Milken Institute School of Public  Health, George Washington University, January of this year.   Here is what Mr. Pruitt had to say about the debate over whether  climate change is real:         Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates       of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists       continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global       warming and its connection to the actions of mankind. That       debate should be encouraged--in classrooms, public forums,       and the halls of Congress.    That quote is from an article in the National Review, May of 2016.   What do scientists say about Mr. Pruitt's observation? ``The  scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to  justify taking steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the  atmosphere.''   That was a statement from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in  2005--12 years ago. Twelve years later, Scott Pruitt is still wrestling  with whether this is a problem.   How about Mr. Pruitt, when it comes to the extent of the human  activity on climate change? He said:         We've had ebb and flow, we've had obviously climate       conditions change throughout our history, and that is       scientific fact. It gets cooler. It gets hotter. And we do       not know the trajectory is on an unsustainable course. Nor do       we know, the extent by which the burning of fossil fuels, and       man's contribution to that, is making it far worse than it       is.    That was a statement he made on the ``Exploring Energy'' radio  program in May of 2016.   What do the scientists say about that? ``The scientific evidence is  clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring  now, and it is a growing threat to society.'' Source: American  Association for the Advancement of Science, 2006--11 years ago.   They said this unequivocally. Scott Pruitt still doesn't buy it.   What did he say about climate change being a natural occurrence? I  will quote him.         Is it truly man-made and is this simply just another period       of time when the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat, I mean       is it just typical natural type of occurrences as opposed to       what the (Obama) Administration says?    Again, this is from that radio program ``Exploring Energy.'' This was  in October of 2016.   What do the scientists say about Mr. Pruitt's observation?         Human-induced climate change requires urgent action.       Humanity is the major influence on the global climate change       observed over the past 50 years. Rapid societal responses can       significantly lessen negative outcomes.    The source: The American Geophysical Union; the date, 2003--14 years  ago.   Here is Scott Pruitt, this man who wants to head up our Environmental  Protection Agency, still at war with scientific fact. What has he said  about the debate over climate change? He said:         The debate about climate change is just that, a debate.       There are scientists that agree, there are scientists that       don't agree, to the extent of man's contribution and whether       it is even harmful at this point.    Again, this is from the ``Exploring Energy'' radio program show in  May of 2016.   What do the scientists have to say about that?         It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the       dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past       half century is human-induced increases in the amount of       atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide       (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous       oxide.    The source of that statement: The American Meteorological Society,  2012--5 years ago.   What Mr. Pruitt says about how reasonable minds can disagree on  climate:         How [climate change] is happening, if it is, clearly is       subject for reasonable minds to disagree. Whether man is       contributing to it or not.    Again, this is from his ``Exploring Energy'' radio program, April  2016. I am sorry I missed that one too.   Here is what the scientists say in response:         The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is       occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant       disruptions in the Earth's physical and ecological systems,       social systems, security and human health are likely to       occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning       now.    The source of that scientific statement: The American Physical  Society, 2007--10 years ago.   Now we know what this man is all about. He denies science. He is an  advocate for those special interest groups who make money off of  pollution. He doesn't believe the Environmental Protection Agency  should have the authority it has today. He has challenged it 14 times  in court. He won't recuse himself from even the petitions he has  personally filed as attorney general of Oklahoma, and he is anxious to  be approved by the Senate before we get a chance next Tuesday or  Wednesday to read 3,000 emails he received and sent as attorney general  of Oklahoma, including emails between Mr. Pruitt and energy, gas, and  oil companies.   I think it is pretty clear what this is all about. This is an effort  by special interests in America to put their best friend on the job at  the Environmental Protection Agency. They want to make sure he is there  to look the other way when we should be regulating to keep this planet  we live on safe and in good shape for future generations. That makes it  a clear choice for all of us. I am going to vote against Scott Pruitt.   I am sorry, I say to Donald Trump. You have a right to have your  point of view, but you don't have a right to put a man in this job who  denies basic science that has been agreed upon for over a decade. You  certainly don't have a right in this circumstance to put a man in  charge of the EPA who is going to add to the climate change problem in  our world, who is going to diminish the reputation in the United States  on fighting this on an international basis, and who is going to kowtow  to special interest groups, which has been shown over and over again  when it comes to his service as the attorney general in the State of  Oklahoma.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 5 minutes to make a  statement on a separate topic.    Mr. President, yesterday the President of the United  States had a long and eventful press conference--77 minutes--talking  about the issues before us in this country and his administration. He  referred to his administration as ``a fine tuned machine.'' That was  his 28th day in office.   I will observe the following: This so-called fine-tuned machine was  forced to dismiss the Acting Attorney General of the United States in  the first 3 weeks. This fine-tuned machine was reprimanded by three  different Federal courts for an Executive order on immigration and  refugees which they found to be inconsistent with the law and the  Constitution of the United States. This so-called fine-tuned machine  had to accept the resignation in the first 24 days of the National  Security Advisor to the President of the United States. Mr. Trump is  making history. No President has been through those experiences. None.  I wouldn't say it is a fine-tuned machine; I would say it is a history- making machine. And sadly this fine-tuned machine, as he calls it, has  had some rough spots. That is not all.   This issue about the Russian connection in President Trump's campaign  is not going away. Seventeen different intelligence agencies have  verified the fact that Vladimir Putin and the Russians expressly tried  to invade on a cyber basis the United States of America and to  influence the outcome of an election. And it wasn't an equal  opportunity effort--they were there to elect Donald Trump and defeat  Hillary Clinton.   To make the record perfectly clear, as they say, there is no evidence  that the Russians had any actual impact on the actual casting or  counting of votes, but they did everything else they could dream of.  They tried to invade and hack sources of files and information and to  disclose and release them in a timely fashion.   There was that horrible episode involving ``Entertainment Weekly,''  or whatever the name of that operation was, where they had a recording  of then-candidate Donald Trump saying some awful things. It was no  coincidence that 2 hours after that recording was released, they  started releasing John Podesta's emails and files--the Russians did--to  try to resurrect the Trump campaign that hit some pretty  [[Page S1362]]  rocky shoals. So we know that happened.   We also know there was contact with General Flynn, the National  Security Advisor to Donald Trump, prior to the President being sworn  in. The extent of the contact, we don't know. The number of people in  the Trump campaign who may or may not have had contact with the  Russians, we don't know, but we do know this: The Federal Bureau of  Investigation has an investigation underway into this very question  because it raises some big issues.   This is the first time we know in the history of the United States  that a foreign power has tried to invade our electoral process. And it  isn't just a benign invasion; this is one of our major enemies when it  comes to national security, and the reason is obvious. Travel to the  Baltics, travel to Poland, travel to Ukraine, and talk to them about  Vladimir Putin. He isn't this great hero, as President Trump has  characterized him, from their point of view; he is a threat to their  existence. They know what happened when the Soviet Union had the power.  It controlled the Baltics. It controlled Poland. It controlled Ukraine.  They don't want to see that day return. They want the United States and  NATO to stand up and help make sure they have a way to continue their  democracy and continue making their own sovereign decisions. Meanwhile,  our President of the United States, Donald Trump, is tossing political  bouquets and sweet little kisses to Vladimir Putin and his Russian  regime. Is this worth looking into? You bet it is.   This week we made a leap of faith right here in the Senate. We have  decided to give to the Intelligence Committee of the Senate the  authority to move forward on this investigation. I reluctantly agreed  to that approach. I am skeptical. I will tell you why I am skeptical. I  served on the Intelligence Committee. It is a critically important  committee, but the Intelligence Committee, 95 percent of the time,  meets behind closed doors in a secret space without a sign on the door,  and the proceedings of the Intelligence Committee necessarily are  secret. This is not an issue that should be kept secret. We need to  make sure the American public understands in an independent and  transparent way exactly what happened when it came to the Russian  involvement in America's election, who was involved in the Trump  campaign, if anyone. We need names, and we need people to be held  responsible.   The second thing is, the Intelligence Committee--if and when it  finally issues a report, that report is going to be classified to some  extent. We have seen pages, I am sure, of redacted materials, big black  lines and maybe one or two words emerging from a single page. Who  decides to take away the black lines and tell the American people  exactly what they found? The ultimate decision on declassifying  documents in the Intelligence Committee is made by the White House.   So here is the White House, President Trump and his people under  investigation by the Intelligence Committee, and they have the last  word about what the American people will see. Isn't it interesting-- when it came to the investigation of Benghazi with Hillary Clinton,  when it came to the investigation of emails with Hillary Clinton, the  Republicans couldn't wait to have week after week and month after month  of public hearings. Now they want a secret hearing in the Senate  Intelligence Committee and no hearing in the House Intelligence  Committee. It is a big ``shrug your shoulders; boys will be boys''  moment for the Republicans in control of the Congress. It shouldn't be  for the American people. The American people have a right to know what  the Russians did, and they have a right to know if and when members of  the Trump campaign or his close associates were engaged and involved in  what he has dismissed as a ruse. Seventeen intelligence agencies don't  dismiss it.   We need an independent, transparent investigation of what happened.  The American people have a right to know. And we ought to say to this  President: You may conceal your income tax returns, unlike any other  Presidential candidate in modern memory, but you cannot conceal from  the American people the facts as to whether the Russians were  attempting a cyber attack on the United States during the course of our  last election. That is too critical a question to ignore.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Madam President, every politician alive should aspire for  that moment, like Bob Michel, when the last words of tribute to his  public service are: ``He was the face of decency in public service.''   This morning, Bob Michel, who served as the leader of the U.S. House  of Representatives for the Republican Party, passed away at age 93.   His replacement as Republican leader in the House marked the end of  an era of civility--Congress has never been the same--but his life as  the son of an immigrant, as a decorated veteran of World War II, and as  a person who was first a staffer, then elected to Congress, and rose to  leadership is a testament to his talent and his commitment to America.   I had known Bob Michel for 35 years. We had adjoining congressional  districts downstate. When he was elected in 1982, in the Reagan off- year election, it was a tough year for Republicans. Bob Michel barely  survived. Attorney Doug Stevens, of Peoria, had about 48 percent, and  Bob had 52 percent. Lane Evans, of the Quad Cities, was elected to  Congress, and I was as well.   For 14 years, we were neighboring Congressmen. Bob Michel came in and  campaigned for my opponents. I went into his district to campaign for  his opponents. You would think that would have created a negative  relationship, but it didn't. Despite that--despite our differences on  political issues--we were always friends, and we were always  respectful.   You could not help but be a friend of Bob Michel's. What an amazing  personality--a smile that would light up a room and a man who was  determined to fight like crazy, day in and day out, for the things he  believed in on the floor of the U.S. House and then, after adjournment,  joined with Tip O'Neill for dinner--a dinner that usually ended up with  a lot of people singing songs over a few drinks and great memories.   The codels in those days--the congressional delegation trips--were  often bipartisan and had both Speaker O'Neill and the Republican  leader, Bob Michel, hosting them as they went to important places in  the world.   There was a time when Bob Michel was a Congressman and wanted to get  home to Peoria every weekend but couldn't afford the airfare. Do you  know what he did? He shared a station wagon with Congressman Dan  Rostenkowski of Chicago. They would take off and drive back to Chicago  and Peoria and then back to Washington on a regular basis. They were  buddies and didn't think twice about the fact that they were of  different political parties and had different political philosophies.   That was Bob Michel.   His passing really does mark the end of an era, but every one of us  currently in public service should remember the quality he brought to  his career and the quality he brought to Congress. He left a great  legacy--many important issues, many great things for Peoria and Central  Illinois. Possibly, his greatest legacy was his chief of staff--his  protege--Ray LaHood, who, to this day, embodies the great values that  Bob Michel brought to public service.   I stand in tribute to my friend and my Republican neighboring  Congressman who served this Nation so well for so many years.   Madam President, I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Donnelly)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Donnelly)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Donnelly)  is necessarily absent.

Their job involved double-checking the accuracy of intricate  calculations made by NASA's computers. And they carried the weight of  awesome responsibility. Fifty-five years ago this week, their  calculations helped launch Lt. Col. John Glenn into the heavens and  return him safely after he had orbited the Earth three times.   Coming in the midst of cold war tensions and the real fear that the  Soviet Union was winning the space race, that historic flight was a  source of intense pride and relief to Americans. It made John Glenn a  national hero and an international symbol of American ingenuity and  ambition.   But the brains behind that flight remained largely unknown--until  now. Why? It is because those formidable mathematicians--those ``human  computers''--were three African-American women. They served this Nation  at a time when racial segregation was the law of the land and gender- based discrimination was almost as common as air.   As America marks Black History Month, this month seems a good time to  say thank you to Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Katherine G.  Johnson.   America's history is filled with the stories of men and women whose  contributions have been minimized or overlooked entirely for the same  reason the ``Hidden Figures'' of NASA remained unknown for so long-- because our Nation's tortured history with race blinded us to large  parts of our own national story.   Ninety years ago, an historian and scholar by the name of Carter G.  Woodson suggested a way to overcome this historical myopia. Dr. Woodson  and other prominent African Americans proposed that 1 week each  February be designated Black History Week.   This is the first Black History Month since the opening last fall of  the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture on the  National Mall in Washington, DC. This remarkable new museum represents  America's first official attempt to tell the African-American story. In  the not quite 5 months since the museum opened, more than 900,000  people have visited. My wife and I toured the museum over the  Thanksgiving holiday. We spent hours there--what a moving experience.   The history of African Americans is a story that stretches back 600  years. It is a story of brutal subjugation, racial violence, and  discrimination. It is also story of a resilient people who survived  those horrors and created a rich and vibrant culture and who have  enriched our Nation by their contributions in every walk of life.   In a speech a few months ago, then-First Lady Michelle Obama alluded  to the vast and inspiring sweep of that history when she said, ``I wake  up every morning in a house that was built by slaves and I watch my  daughters--two beautiful, intelligent, black young women--playing with  their dogs on the White House lawn.'' It was a simple but powerful  image that captured how far we have come on questions of race since our  founding.   As America's 44th President, Barack Obama grappled honestly with  complex challenges facing America and the world and delivered solutions  that has improved the lives of millions. He and Michelle served our  Nation with uncommon dignity, wisdom, and compassion. I am proud to  call them both friends.   The Obamas' story is just one of the stories told in the new African- American History Museum. Other famous African Americans are featured as  well, from Crispus Attucks, the first patriot to give his life in the  American Revolution; to the great abolitionists and women's suffrage  champions, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman;  from Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in  Berlin and singlehandedly shattered the racist myth of Aryan  superiority; to the Tuskegee Airmen, who helped democracy defeat  fascist tyranny in World War II.   The museum tells the stories of other prominent men and women,  including Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King; Malcolm X;  Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Justice of the U.S.  Supreme Court; Congressman John Lewis, my friend, an icon of the civil  rights movement; and Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman  ever elected to Congress--in 1968. Some of the best advice I have ever  heard about making a difference came from Shirley Chisholm. She said,  ``If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.''  I think Shirley Chisholm would have loved to see the way the women of  America are making their voices heard today and changing the debate in  this country.   The new African-American History Museum and Black History Month give  us a fuller, truer picture of our past. They also give us hope and  guidance for today. Here are just a few quick examples of what I mean.   Ida B. Wells, born into slavery in 1862, was a journalist, activist,  and feminist who led an antilynching crusade in the 1890s, speaking  throughout the United States and Europe. She reminds us that brave  journalists, armed with the First Amendment, can shine a light on  wrongdoing and change history.   Garrett Morgan had only a sixth-grade education, but he also had a  natural mechanical genius and an entrepreneurial bent. In 1914, he  invented a ``safety hood'' that protected wearers from smoke, gases and  other pollutants. It became the prototype in World War I for gas masks  and for the breathing devices that firefighters wear today. His  inventions have saved untold millions of lives.   While some argue that we should cut funding to public schools that  serve low-income children, Garrett Morris reminds us that American  genius and ingenuity isn't limited by race, or gender, or family  income. Our future prosperity depends on our willingness to invest in  the potential all of America's children.   Finally, A. Philip Randolph organized and led the Brotherhood of  Sleeping Car Porters, the first predominantly African-American labor  union. In 1941, he was part of a group that convinced President  Roosevelt to ban discrimination in the defense industries during World  War II. In 1948, that same group persuaded President Truman to issue an  Executive order ending segregation in America's Armed Services. And in  1963, A. Philip Randolph helped led the March on Washington. If you  want to know how to raise the wages of working people and mobilize  ordinary Americans to create a more perfect union, study the life of A.  Philip Randolph.   Black History Month actually started as Black History Week 90 years  ago. The choice of the week had special significance; it included the  birthdays of both Abraham Lincoln and the mighty abolitionist,  Frederick Douglass.  [[Page S1393]]    President Lincoln once predicted that, if history remembered him for  anything, it would be for issuing the Emancipation Proclamation. With  that great promissory note of freedom, President Lincoln declared that  the 3 million persons living in bondage in the rebellious states  ``shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.''   The Emancipation Proclamation marked a turning point in America's  Civil War; it transformed the fight to preserve the Union into  something even larger and nobler: a battle for human freedom.   But without Frederick Douglass, the ``Great Agitator,'' there might  never have been a ``Great Emancipator.'' Frederick Douglass was one of  the best-known men in America. He was a powerful and respected speaker  and journalist. He criticized Lincoln frequently and publicly for what  he viewed as the President's timidity in denouncing slavery. But rather  than denouncing Douglass, Abraham Lincoln sought his counsel, and their  respectful relationship changed history.   Without Frederick Douglass's prodding, Lincoln might not have issued  the Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln might not have agreed to allow  free men of color to serve in the U.S. Army. Without Frederick  Douglass, it might have been harder for Lincoln to see that the Civil  War could not end until slavery had ended, that only ``a new birth of  freedom'' could redeem the carnage of Civil War.   The relationship between Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass shows  us the good that can be achieved when patriotic citizens dare to speak  truth to power and leaders are secure enough to listen. That is a  lesson worth pondering during this Black History Month and beyond.                            ____________________
