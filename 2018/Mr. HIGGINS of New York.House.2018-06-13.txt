 Mr. Speaker, the Justice Department last  week said to a Federal court that it will not defend against efforts to  dismantle the individual market and protections for preexisting  conditions of the healthcare law.   Mr. Speaker, the 50 to 64 demographic in America that buys health  insurance on the exchanges is about to get clobbered with 30 to 40  percent premium increases and no protection against denial for  preexisting conditions. The 60 million people between the ages of 50  and 64 need the protection of Medicare now by allowing them to buy into  the program to give them medical coverage.   Medicare is fully compliant with the Affordable Care Act, and  Medicare always covers preexisting conditions. Medicare is the best  health care insurance, and it is the best public option that already  exists. Let's make that accessible to the people who are age 50 to 64.                            ____________________
