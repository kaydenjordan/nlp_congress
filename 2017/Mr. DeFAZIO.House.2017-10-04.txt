 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove my name  from H.R. 367.    Mr. Speaker, in light of the tragic and horrific events  this Sunday, I believe our focus should be on bipartisan efforts to  investigate the causes and lessen the potential for gun violence in  America. That is why I am calling on Speaker Ryan to name a select  committee to address these issues.   Additionally, I believe the Republican leadership should formally  withdraw their so-called sportsman's package, which has many  objectionable provisions.  [[Page H7764]]    Furthermore, we need to bring to the floor a vote on comprehensive  background check legislation that includes closing the gun show  loophole and individual internet sale loophole. There is overwhelming  support in the public and this Congress for those actions.   I would like to see what the investigation reveals and whether a  suppressor would have allowed this monster to create more carnage.  However, we do know he used something called a bump stock, which I  never heard of before.   Anything that converts a semiautomatic weapon into something that is  virtually a fully automatic weapon, which is outlawed, should not be  sold. The bump stocks and any other devices like that should be banned.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong opposition to the Republican budget proposal.   As the ranking member on the Transportation Committee, I want to  focus in a little bit on what they do to transportation.   We heard great promises from President Trump of a trillion dollars in  new investment. Nothing has come from the White House. The first  substantive action on transportation in this Congress is going to be  the Republicans in the House of Representatives cutting transportation  funding by $254 billion.   That is right. No trillion dollars of new spending. We are going to  spend $254 billion less.   They are going to eliminate all long-route trains, isolating rural  America. They are going to lose essential air service in rural America.  And, by the way, the Republicans want to toll your interstate. So if  you live in rural America, you can get in your car to go somewhere, but  now you are going to have to pay to use the highway you already paid  for.   Secondly, it eliminates critical funding for our urban areas, the  economic engines of this country. It eliminates TIGER grants for  freight and multimodal projects. It eliminates new investment in  transit, new start projects. It eliminates all investments in high- speed rail and eliminates specific funding for bicycle and pedestrian  projects. The Republicans just hate bicycles.   It also goes on--and this is totally amazing--seriously, you are  going to cut funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency?  Haven't you been watching television? I think they are already out of  money. You are going to cut funding?   We want to do away with those programs that might mitigate the  disaster of future floods and hurricanes. You are going to cut grants  for firefighters.   Then, that is not enough. We are going to roll back Davis-Bacon  protections for people who work on federally funded projects. We are  going to roll back Buy American? Really? So it is ``Buy Chinese'' in  the Republican budget. Buy Chinese.   They want to devolve the obligation to fund Federal highways to the  States. I have got news for you: we have tried that.    This is Kansas and Oklahoma. This is Kansas before we  had the Eisenhower--by the way, a Republican--National Highway Program.  They built their turnpike. Oklahoma said they would build theirs. They  didn't. They were out of money. They didn't build it until they got an  80 percent Federal match.   So let's go back to the good, old days. We are going to devolve the  obligations of putting together a 21st century transportation system in  this country, knitting our country together, getting rid of congestion,  moving people and goods more efficiently, but we are going to do it on  a State-by-State basis. That is nuts. I just can't believe this.   Then, there is another little trick. The chairman of my committee  wants to privatize the airspace in the United States and reduce the  ticket tax that  [[Page H7800]]  pays for air traffic control. That would be a $10 billion windfall to  the airline industry, because they will raise prices. Then they are  going to charge you a head fee to get on the plane.   Even better, it creates $100 billion of new deficit. So this nifty  little thing here contains a reserve fund of $100 billion to try and  make up for the fact and hide the fact that they are cutting $100  billion of taxes that pay for the current system.    How are you going to pay for the next system?   The airlines will determine that, not Congress.
