 Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to add my strongest,  deepest sympathies and condolences to Ray Baum's family on his passing.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4986, the RAY BAUM'S  Act, to reauthorize the FCC for the first time in 28 years. This  important legislation also provides transparency and efficiency  reforms, including language from my bill, H.R. 2636, to create an  independent inspector general for the FCC.   Currently, the IG is not only appointed by the chairman, but also  reports to and is under general supervision of the Chairman of the  Commission. This legislation would require the President, with the  advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint the inspector general. It  is simply good governance and a matter of transparency and  accountability to have an independent IG.   Importantly, this legislation also creates and authorizes a broadcast  repack fund to address the anticipated shortfall in funding available  to relocate broadcasters who are displaced from the most recent  spectrum auction. It is important that we provide the funding necessary  to successfully relocate these broadcasters and ensure an efficient and  timely transition.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to  reauthorize the FCC.
