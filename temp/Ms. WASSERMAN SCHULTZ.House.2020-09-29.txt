 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise today to support my bill, the Breast Cancer Education and  Awareness Requires Learning Young Act Reauthorization, or the EARLY  Act.   I do want to start by thanking Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member  Walden, as well as my Republican co-lead, Congresswoman Susan Brooks. I  deeply appreciate their advocacy and assistance shepherding this bill  through the Energy and Commerce Committee. I also thank Senators  Klobuchar and Crapo for sponsoring the Senate version of this important  bipartisan reauthorization bill.   The EARLY Act, which I first introduced in 2009, became law in 2010  as part of the Affordable Care Act.   The inspiration for this bill was born from my own battle against  breast cancer at the age of 41. That was 13 years ago. It is hard to  believe.   I was a young woman at high risk, but I didn't know it. I was aware  enough to know the right questions to ask and to understand the steps  that were necessary in my treatment.   But many young women, Madam Speaker, are not aware that they possess  genetic or other factors that expose them to higher risk of getting  breast cancer. And when it strikes them, they and even their doctors  are often unprepared to deal with this terrible diagnosis.   But knowledge is power, and it can also be lifesaving, too.   The earlier that breast cancer cases are identified, the better the  chances are of survival. That is exactly why, after surviving 15 months  of surgeries and treatment, I introduced the EARLY Act--in order to  fill this major gap in our healthcare system.   We could not then and cannot now afford to be silent about these  specific risks and how they impact certain communities, not when so  many lives are on the line.   Breast cancer is a disease that knows no boundaries. It strikes women  from all backgrounds, races and ethnicities, the rich and the poor, the  old and the young. About one in eight women, as the ranking member and  the chairman have said, will get breast cancer in their lifetime.   About 11 percent of all new cases of breast cancer in the United  States are found in women younger than 45 years of age.    Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in women under 40  and breast cancer in younger women tends to be more aggressive.   Each year, approximately 70,000 women age 15 to 39 are diagnosed with  cancer in the United States. Breast cancer is the most common cancer  for women in this age group.   Nearly 80 percent of young women diagnosed with breast cancer find  their breast abnormality themselves.   Additionally, certain ethnic groups, including Ashkenazi Jews--my  ethnic origin--and African-American young women have an increased risk  of breast cancer. Black women are exposed to a greater risk because  systemic racism has limited their access to preventive care.   I am proud that the bill before us today not only reauthorizes the  program, but also increases the authorized funding level for breast  cancer education and awareness programs.   The bill allows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to  continue administering its crucial education and outreach campaign that  highlights breast cancer risks facing young women, including campaigns  specifically for African-American and Jewish women.   The EARLY Act is designed to help educate healthcare providers on the  specific threats and warning signs of breast cancer in younger women.  This education can often lead to early detection, diagnosis, and  survival.   The bill also aids organizations that support young women diagnosed  with breast cancer and, further, helps them overcome the unique  challenges that we face, including dealing with the social and  psychological stress that comes with a cancer diagnosis for far longer  in our lifetimes.   The EARLY Act has already benefited women. Mortality rates from  breast cancer have dropped in the past 10 years, in large part due to  early detection.   After 10 years of successful implementation, it is now time to again  reauthorize the EARLY Act and increase funding to ensure we can reach  more young women and healthcare providers across the country.   At a time when people with preexisting conditions across the country  are at greater risk, prevention and awareness can be the difference  between life and death.   Not knowing can kill you.   Not being aware of the importance of paying attention to your breast  health can be life ending and life altering.   As a public servant and a cancer survivor, it has become my life's  mission to help women, especially younger women and women at higher  risk, like I was without knowing it, to better advocate on behalf of  themselves and their breast health.   Madam Speaker, I thank and encourage my colleagues to support this  urgent and lifesaving legislation.                                time  1430
