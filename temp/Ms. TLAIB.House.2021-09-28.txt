 Mr. Speaker, as someone who grew up in a community on the  front line of the racist so-called war on drugs, I am proud to stand  here today in support of the EQUAL Act to eliminate racial disparities  in crack and powder cocaine possession.   The war on drugs was designed as a racist project to target Black and  Brown Americans--my neighbors--and the obvious racial disparities in  enforcement show us that it still is at its core a racist effort  targeting communities of color through over-policing, criminalization,  and mass incarceration.   Simply put, addiction is a health condition not a crime. Giving  incarcerated people an opportunity to be resentenced will transform  lives immediately. We need to be doing more to make reparations to  those impacted by the so-called war on drugs. While this bill is a  great step on the road to comprehensive drug and criminal justice  reform, we must go further. Our goal must be to end this country's  militarized ``jail first, ask questions later'' approach to addiction  and stop trying to solve social problems with policing.    Mr. Speaker, I look forward to supporting the future  legislation aimed at comprehensive decriminalization of possession for  personal use of these substances and strongly encourage my colleagues  to support this commonsense bill.    Lastly, it is a personal honor to support and uplift Kandia Milton  who approached me about this bill and who is with Dreams Corps JUSTICE  in Detroit.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for Kandia's work. It allows me to also  fight for all of us today.
