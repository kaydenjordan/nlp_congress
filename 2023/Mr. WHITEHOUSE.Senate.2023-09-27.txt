 Mr. President, last week, I spoke about the scheme of  corruption by rightwing billionaires out to capture the Supreme Court.  I mentioned their lawyers' blockade of our investigation into this  corruption and described how little sense their lawyers' arguments  made.   That brings us to this speech today. The connection is that those, in  my view, nonsense lawyers' arguments badly needed propping up. And who  should come to the rescue but U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sam Alito.  Alito's actions propping up that argument caused me to write this  ethics complaint against him.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my full letter  to Chief Justice Roberts and a portion of the letter from Mr. Rivkin at  the end of my remarks.   Mr. President, this complaint highlights some of the Supreme Court's  current legitimacy problems, which are legion. One is that the Court  has no procedure for an ethics complaint. I had to write to Chief  Justice Roberts, both in his capacity as Chief Justice and in his  capacity as Chair of the Judicial Conference, because, unlike in every  other Federal court, there is no clarity about process.   The Supreme Court has no formal process for receiving or  investigating such complaints, so they go there to die. Complaints  about Supreme Court Justices have sometimes been referred to the  Judicial Conference, and there, they have mostly disappeared. So it is  a mess.   The Supreme Court--the body with the highest responsibility to police  proper procedure and fair factfinding throughout the rest of  government--has no clear and proper procedure for itself. That is  weird, and that is wrong.   Nothing prohibits the Court or the Judicial Conference from adopting  procedures to address complaints of misconduct by the Justices. They  just haven't bothered to. The most basic modicum of any due process is  fair factfinding, but they have no process at all to find out even what  the facts are. That is simply not defensible. That has to change, and  my complaint presents the Court and the conference that opportunity.   Now let's move from procedure to the substance of my complaint about  Justice Alito. At one level, it is an obvious slam-dunk ethics  violation. At another, it will take a lot more digging. Let me explain.   My complaint relates to a so-called ``interview'' published on the  Wall Street Journal's editorial page July 28 of this year. How it is  both an interview and on the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, I am  not going to explore.   Justice Alito was the person ``interviewed.'' His ``interviewers''  were David Rivkin and James Taranto. In this interview, Justice Alito  offered his legal opinion that ``[n]o provision in the Constitution  gives [Congress] the authority to regulate the Supreme Court--period.''  That is the end of his quote.   That comment wasn't just floating in the ether; it was related to my  Supreme Court ethics bill, the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and  Transparency Act, which the Senate Judiciary Committee had advanced  just 1 week before, and it also related to an array of congressional  oversight information requests from the Senate Judiciary Committee and  from the Senate Finance Committee.   More on that later. Back to the slam-dunk part. I sit on the Senate  Judiciary Committee, where we hear in every Supreme Court confirmation  hearing that it would be improper, that it would be wrong even in a  confirmation hearing to express opinions on matters that might come  before the Court. Well, obviously, Alito's interview comments--his Wall  Street Journal editorial page ``opining''--touched on a matter that  might come before the Court. That is the slam dunk.   Look at what other Justices have testified about this opining  problem, but let's start with Alito himself, who testified in his  confirmation hearing that it would be ``improper'' and a ``disservice  to the judicial process'' for a Supreme Court nominee to comment on  issues that might come before the Court. His words.   Consider also Justice Thomas, who testified that such opining would  ``leave the impression that I prejudged this issue,'' which would be,  he said, ``inappropriate for any judge who is worth his or her salt.''   Justice Kagan told the committee it would be ``inappropriate'' for  her to ``give any indication of how she would rule in a case'' even  ``in a somewhat veiled manner.''   Justice Kavanaugh testified that nominees ``cannot discuss cases or  issues that might come before them.'' He went on that prejudging an  issue in this manner is ``inconsistent with judicial independence,  rooted in Article  [[Page S4713]]  III.'' He continued that ``litigants who come before [the Court] have  to know we have an open mind, that we do not have a closed mind.'' He  quoted Justice Ginsburg: ``No hints, no forecasts, no previews.''   Justice Gorsuch went one better in his confirmation hearing. He  actually testified that this ``no opining'' rule applies to discussions  about Supreme Court ethics--the exact topic of Justice Alito's Wall  Street Journal opining.   Senator Blumenthal on the committee had asked Judge Gorsuch about  proposed ethics rules for the Supreme Court and whether they would  violate separation of powers. Gorsuch answered:         Senator, I am afraid I just have to respectfully decline to       comment on that because I am afraid that could be a case or       controversy, and you can see how it might be. I can       understand Congress' concern and interest in this area. I       understand that. But I think the proper way to test that       question is the prescribed process of legislation and       litigation.    In sum, the Court itself is plainly on record that this sort of  opining is wrong. So that is broken rule one, just offering the  opinion, but it gets worse. This was not just general opining out into  the general ether. Alito's comments referred to a specific, ongoing  legal dispute. Let me explain.    There are ongoing Senate investigations into the scandal of secret  billionaire gifts to certain Justices. The Senate Judiciary Committee  is investigating reports that Supreme Court Justices accepted and  improperly failed to disclose, in violation of Congress's disclosure  laws, lavish gifts from billionaire benefactors seeking to influence  the Court. The Senate Finance Committee is investigating Federal tax  compliance regarding those undisclosed gifts. Were tax laws broken?  Were proper declarations made?   In those congressional investigations, requests for information have  been sent out. In response to those requests, objections have been  raised. Here is where Alito comes in. The objections by the  billionaires' lawyers assert that Congress has no constitutional  authority to legislate in this area--hence, no authority to  investigate. They assert--in my view, plainly wrongly--that our  constitutional separation of powers blocks any congressional action in  this area, which in turn, they assert--also plainly wrongly, in my  view--blocks any congressional investigation.   Set aside the demerits of that argument--for which I refer you to the  lawyers' letters I added to the record in my previous speech and my own  takedown of that argument--sound or unsound, the point is, it is their  argument in that ongoing dispute.   In that ongoing dispute, Justice Alito's Wall Street Journal comments  prop up that argument. The language is nearly identical. You can  compare it for yourself. In fact, lawyers for some of the billionaires  to whom we have sent information requests have actually quoted Justice  Alito's comment in declining to respond.   So this is not just some improper general opining; it is a Supreme  Court Justice leaning in to one side of a specific ongoing dispute and  being used and quoted by one side of a specific ongoing dispute. That  is pretty bad. It gets worse.   One of the interviewers in that Wall Street Journal interview,  Attorney David Rivkin, wasn't just some interviewer; he is the attorney  for a party in that specific ongoing dispute. Rivkin is the attorney  making the precise legal argument that Alito echoed, and he is making  it in that ongoing dispute. None of this, of course, was disclosed in  the so-called ``interview.''   A logical mind would rightfully ask whether Justice Alito opined on  this matter at the behest of his interviewer, Attorney Rivkin. A  suspicious mind would even wonder whether Attorney Rivkin prepped his  witness, as lawyers are wont to do. With no means of factfinding, all  this remains unknown.   Bad enough to opine on some general matter that may come before the  Court; worse when the opining brings a Supreme Court Justice's  influence to bear in a specific ongoing legal dispute; and worse yet  when the influence of the Justice might have been summoned by counsel  to a party in that dispute.   The timeline is suspicious. Mr. Rivkin's interview with Justice Alito  was reportedly conducted in early July 2023. Well, on July 11, Chairman  Durbin and I had sent a letter to Rivkin's client in that dispute  inquiring about undisclosed gifts and travel provided to Justices. On  July 20, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance my judicial  ethics bill.   By the way, the Rivkin-Alito Congress-has-no-authority argument fared  very poorly that day in the committee.   On July 25, Mr. Rivkin, by letter, refused to answer our information  requests on the purported ground that ``any attempt by Congress to  enact ethics standards for the Supreme Court would falter on  constitutional objections.'' Three days later, on July 28, comes the  supportive opining from Justice Alito about those constitutional  objections.   There are a lot of questions that need answering under oath about how  this mess played out.   But wait, there is more. Attorney Rivkin's client in that dispute has  a relationship with Justice Alito. He is a friend and ally of Justice  Alito's. Rivkin's client is Leonard Leo. Leo is not just a friend and  ally of Alito's. Our oversight questions that Attorney Rivkin is  blocking relate to Mr. Leo's actions to facilitate gifts for Supreme  Court Justices from rightwing billionaires of free and undisclosed  transportation and lodging. Mr. Leo didn't just facilitate; he was  Justice Alito's companion on the luxurious Alaskan fishing trip in 2008  that rightwing billionaires funded.   The relationship goes back. Leo's political organization ``had run an  advertising campaign supporting Alito in his confirmation fight, and  Leo was reportedly part of the team that prepared Alito for his Senate  hearings.''   So it appears that Justice Alito, A, improperly opined in the Wall  Street Journal, B, to influence a specific ongoing dispute, C, possibly  at the behest of counsel in that dispute, and D, to the benefit of a  personal friend and ally.   None of that was disclosed in the interview either, and it brings us  to the last and most damning point.   Justice Alito's opining, potentially at the behest of his friend and  ally's lawyer, props up an argument being used to block inquiry into  undisclosed gifts and travel received by Justice Alito himself. Justice  Alito himself is the ultimate beneficiary of his own improper opining.  It comes full circle.   In the worst-case scenario, Justice Alito broke the rules against  opining in order to facilitate an organized campaign to obstruct  congressional investigation into tens of thousands of dollars in gifts  he, Alito, personally received and doesn't want investigated.   Whether Justice Alito was unwittingly used to provide fodder for such  interference or intentionally participated in that interference plan  and whether he did it to protect the rightwing billionaires or himself  or both, those are questions whose answers require additional facts.   The heart of any due process is a fair determination of the facts.  Uniquely in the whole of government, the Supreme Court has insulated  its Justices from any semblance of fair factfinding. The obstruction of  our inquiries by Mr. Rivkin and Mr. Leo, fueled by Justice Alito's  opining, prevents Congress from gathering those facts, and the Supreme  Court won't even look. That can't be--not in a nation of laws. That is  flagrantly, obviously wrong.   So I have asked the Chief Justice or the Judicial Conference to take  whatever steps are necessary to develop a process to investigate this  affair and provide the public with the prompt and trustworthy answers  it deserves. The Supreme Court's legitimacy cannot stand on an edifice  of obstruction, secrecy, and lies.   To be continued, Mr. President.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                 Washington, DC,                                                  September 4, 2023.        Dear Chief Justice/Chairman Roberts: I write to lodge an       ethics complaint regarding recent public comments by Supreme       Court Justice Samuel Alito, which appear to violate several       canons of judicial ethics, including standards the Supreme       Court has long applied to itself.        I write to you in your capacity both as Chief Justice and       as Chair of the Judicial Conference because, unlike every       other federal court, the Supreme Court has no formal process       for receiving or investigating such complaints, and asserted       violations by justices of relevant requirements have       sometimes been referred to the Judicial Conference and its       committees. I include all justices in carbon copy because I       am urging the  [[Page S4714]]       Supreme Court to adopt a uniform process to address this       complaint and others that may arise against any justice in       the future.        The recent actions by Justice Alito present an opportunity       to determine a mechanism for applying the Judicial Conduct       and Disability Act to justices of the Supreme Court. Nothing       prohibits the Court or the Judicial Conference from adopting       procedures to address complaints of misconduct. The most       basic modicum of any due process is fair fact-finding; second       to that is independent decision-making.                                  background         Some of the background facts here were related by members       of the Senate Judiciary Committee who signed a letter to you       dated August 3, 2023. As that letter explains, the Wall       Street Journal on July 28, 2023, published an interview with       Justice Alito conducted by David Rivkin and James Taranto.       Justice Alito's comments during that interview give rise this       complaint. The interview had the effect, and seemed intended,       to bear both on legislation I authored and on investigations       in which I participate.        During the interview, Justice Alito stated that ``[n]o       provision in the Constitution gives [Congress] the authority       to regulate the Supreme Court--period.'' Justice Alito's       comments appeared in connection to my Supreme Court Ethics,       Recusal, and Transparency Act, which the Senate Judiciary       Committee had advanced just one week before the publication       of this interview. That bill would update judicial ethics       laws to ensure the Supreme Court complies with ethical       standards at least as demanding as in other branches of       government.        Justice Alito's comments echoed legal arguments made to       block information requests from the Senate Judiciary       Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, on both of which       I serve. Those arguments assert (in my view wrongly) that our       constitutional separation of powers blocks any congressional       action in this area, which in turn is asserted (also wrongly,       in my view) to block any congressional investigation. Sound       or unsound, it is their argument against our investigations,       as reflected in the letter appended hereto. The subjects of       these committee investigations are matters relating to dozens       of unreported gifts donated to justices of the Supreme Court.        As the author of the bill at issue, and as the only Senator       serving in the majority on both investigating committees, I       bring this complaint.       Improper Opining on a Legal Issue that May Come Before the Court         On the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have heard in every       recent confirmation hearing that it would be improper to       express opinions on matters that might come before the Court.       In this instance, Justice Alito expressed an opinion on a       matter that could well come before the Court.        That conduct seems indisputably to violate the Code of       Conduct for United States Judges. Canon 1 emphasizes a       judge's obligation to ``uphold the integrity and independence       of the judiciary''; Canon 2(A) instructs judges to ``act at       all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the       integrity and impartiality of the judiciary''; and Canon       3(A)(6) provides that judges ``should not make public comment       on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any       court.'' These canons help ensure ``the integrity and       independence of the judiciary'' by requiring judges' conduct       to be at all times consistent with the preservation of       judicial impartiality and the appearance thereof.        The Court's Statement of Ethics Principles and Practices,       ``to which all of the current members of the Supreme Court       subscribe,'' concurs. That document makes clear that, before       speaking to the public, ``a Justice should consider whether       doing so would create an appearance of impropriety in the       minds of reasonable members of the public. There is an       appearance of impropriety when an unbiased and reasonable       person who is aware of all relevant facts would doubt that       the Justice could fairly discharge his or her duties.'' These       same precepts are also enforced through the federal recusal       statute, which requires all federal justices and judges to       recuse themselves from any matter in which their impartiality       could reasonably be questioned.        Making public comments assessing the merits of a legal       issue that could come before the Court undoubtedly creates       the very appearance of impropriety these rules are meant to       protect against. As Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, prejudging       an issue in this manner is ``inconsistent with judicial       independence, rooted in Article III,'' because ``litigants       who come before [the Court] have to know we have an open       mind, that we do not have a closed mind.''        Justice Alito and every other sitting member of the Supreme       Court told the Senate Judiciary Committee during their       confirmation hearings that it would be (in the words of       Justice Alito) ``improper'' and a ``disservice to the       judicial process'' for a Supreme Court nominee to comment on       issues that might come before the Court. Justice Thomas said       that such comments would at minimum ``leave the impression       that I prejudged this issue,'' which would be ``inappropriate       for any judge who is worth his or her salt.'' Justice Kagan       echoed those comments, telling the Committee it would be       ``inappropriate'' for her to ``give any indication of how she       would rule in a case''--even ``in a somewhat veiled manner.''       And Justice Kavanaugh explained that nominees ``cannot       discuss cases or issues that might come before them.'' He       continued: ``As Justice Ginsburg said, no hints, no       forecasts, no previews.''        Justice Gorsuch made clear during his confirmation hearing       that this rule applies to the precise topic on which Justice       Alito opined to the Wall Street Journal:        Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. I also want to raise a       question, talking about court procedure, relating to       conflicts of interest and ethics. I think you were asked       yesterday about the proposed ethics rules that have been       applied to your court--        Judge Gorsuch. Yes.        Senator Blumenthal: [continuing]. To the appellate court,       to the District Court, but not to the Supreme Court. Would       you view such legislation as a violation of the separation of       powers?        Judge Gorsuch. Senator, I am afraid I just have to       respectfully decline to comment on that because I am afraid       that could be a case or controversy, and you can see how it       might be. I can understand Congress? concern and interest in       this area. I understand that. But I think the proper way to       test that question is the prescribed process of legislation       and litigation.        You, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Barrett each expressly       cited the canons of judicial ethics as the source of a       nominee's obligation to refuse to comment on such matters.       There seems to be no question that Justice Alito is bound by,       and that his opining violated, these principles.                  Improper Intrusion into a Specific Matter         These principles apply broadly to any opining, on any issue       that might perhaps come before the Court. But here it was       worse; it was not just general opining, it was opining in       relation to a specific ongoing dispute. The quote at issue in       the article--``No provision in the Constitution gives       [Congress] the authority to regulate the Supreme Court''--      directly follows a mention of my judicial ethics bill.       Justice Alito's decision to opine publicly on the       constitutionality of that bill may well embolden legal       challenges to the bill should it become law. Indeed, his       comments encourage challenges to all manner of judicial       ethics laws already on the books.        Justice Alito's opining will also fuel obstruction of our       Senate investigations into these matters. To inform its work       on my bill and other judicial ethics legislation, and oversee       the performance of the statutory Judicial Conference in this       arena, the Senate Judiciary Committee is investigating       multiple reports that Supreme Court justices have accepted       and failed to disclose lavish gifts from billionaire       benefactors. Separately, the Senate Finance Committee is       investigating the federal tax considerations surrounding the       billionaires? undisclosed gifts to Supreme Court justices.       Both committees' inquiries have been stymied by individuals       asserting that Congress has no constitutional authority to       legislate in this area, hence no authority to investigate.       Justice Alito's public comments prop up these theories.        As the author of the bill in question and as a participant       in the related investigations, I feel acutely the targeting       of this work by Justice Alito, and consider it more than just       misguided or accidental general opining. It is directed to my       work.    Improper Intrusion into a specific matter at the behest of counsel in                                that matter         Compounding the issues above, Attorney David Rivkin was one       of the interviewers in the Wall Street Journal piece, and       also a lawyer in the above dispute. This dual role suggests       that Justice Alito may have opined on this matter at the       behest of Mr. Rivkin himself. Bad enough that a justice       opines on some general matter that may come before the Court;       worse when the opining brings his influence to bear in a       specific ongoing legal dispute; worse still when the       influence of a justice appears to have been summoned by       counsel to a party in that dispute.        The timeline of the Wall Street Journal interview suggests       that its release was coordinated with Mr. Rivkin's efforts to       block our inquiry. Mr. Rivkin's interview with Justice Alito       was reportedly conducted in ``early July'' 2023. On July 11,       Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Durbin and I sent a letter       to Mr. Rivkin's client inquiring about undisclosed gifts and       travel provided to justices. On July 20, the Senate Judiciary       Committee voted to advance my judicial ethics bill mentioned       above. (Notably, the Rivkin/Alito Congress-has-no-authority       argument fared poorly in the committee that day, with no       Republican rising to rebut the arguments against it.) On July       25, Mr. Rivkin by letter refused to provide the requested       information on the purported ground that ``any attempt by       Congress to enact ethics standards for the Supreme Court       would falter on constitutional objections.'' That response,       appended hereto, was instantly published in Fox News Three       days later, on July 28, the Wall Street Journal editorial       page published the supportive opining from Justice Alito.     Improper Intrusion into a Specific Matter Involving an Undisclosed                           Personal Relationship         On top of all this, the dispute upon which Justice Alito       opined involves an individual with whom Justice Alito has a       longstanding personal and political relationship. As my       colleagues and I pointed out in our August 3 letter, ``Mr.       Rivkin is counsel for Leonard Leo with regard to [the       Judiciary] Committee's investigation into Mr, Leo's actions       to facilitate gifts of free transportation and lodging that       Justice Alito accepted from  [[Page S4715]]       Paul Singer and Robin Arkley II in 2008.'' Mr. Leo was       Justice Alito's companion on the luxurious Alaskan fishing       trip in 2008 and facilitated the gifts to the justice of free       transportation and lodging. Two years earlier, Mr. Leo's       political organization ``had run an advertising campaign       supporting Alito in his confirmation fight, and Leo was       reportedly part of the team that prepared Alito for his       Senate hearings.        The timing of Justice Alito's opining suggests that he       intervened to give his friend and political ally support in       his effort to block congressional inquiries. It appears that       Justice Alito (a) opined (b) on a specific ongoing dispute       (c) at the behest of counsel in that dispute (d) to the       benefit of a personal friend and ally. Each is objectionable,       and appears to violate, inter alia, Canon 2(B) of the Code of       Conduct for United States Judges, which provides, ``A judge       should neither lend the prestige of the judicial office to       advance the private interests of the judge or others nor       convey or permit others to convey the impression that they       are in a special position to influence the judge.''             Improper Use of Judicial Office for Personal Benefit         The final unpleasant fact in this affair is that Justice       Alito's opining, apparently at the behest of his friend and       ally's lawyer, props up an argument being used to block       inquiry into undisclosed gifts and travel received by Justice       Alito. At the end, Justice Alito is the beneficiary of his       own improper opining. This implicates Canon 2(B) strictures       against improperly using one's office to further a personal       interest: a justice obstructing a congressional investigation       that implicates his own conduct.        The Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation encompasses       reports that Justice Alito accepted but did not disclose       gifts of travel and lodging valued in the tens of thousands       of dollars. Further investigation may reveal additional       information that Justice Alito would prefer not come to       light. The facts as already reported suggest that Justice       Alito likely violated the financial disclosure requirements       of the Ethics in Government Act. Perhaps Justice Alito should       also have recused himself as required by the recusal statute       in a 2014 case involving a company owned by Paul Singer, one       of the billionaires who attended and paid for his Alaskan       fishing vacation. Justice Alito's public suggestion that       these laws are unconstitutional as applied to the Supreme       Court, and that Congress lacks authority to amend them or       investigate their implementation or enforcement, appears       designed to impede Senate efforts to investigate these and       other potential abuses.                                  Conclusion         In the worst case facts may reveal, Justice Alito was       involved in an organized campaign to block congressional       action with regard to a matter in which he has a personal       stake. Whether Justice Alito was unwittingly used to provide       fodder for such interference, or intentionally participated,       is a question whose answer requires additional facts. The       heart of any due process is a fair determination of the       facts. Uniquely in the whole of government, the Supreme Court       has insulated its justices from any semblance of fair fact-      finding. The obstructive campaign run by Mr. Rivkin and Mr.       Leo, fueled by Justice Alito's opining, appears intended to       prevent Congress from gathering precisely those facts.        As you have repeatedly emphasized, the Supreme Court should       not be helpless when it comes to policing its own members'       ethical obligations. But it is necessarily helpless if there       is no process of fair fact-finding, nor independent decision-      making. I request that you as Chief Justice, or through the       Judicial Conference, take whatever steps are necessary to       investigate this affair and provide the public with prompt       and trustworthy answers.            Sincerely,      Sheldon Whitehouse,        Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Federal Courts,       Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights.                                   ____                                                  Baker Hostetler,                                                      July 25, 2023.      Re Response to July 11, 2023 Letter to Leonard Leo.         Dear Chairman Durbin and Senator Whitehouse: We write on       behalf of Leonard Leo in response to your letter of July 11,       2023, which requested information concerning Mr. Leo's       interactions with Supreme Court Justices. We understand this       inquiry is part of an investigation certain members of the       Senate Judiciary Committee have undertaken regarding ethics       standards and the Supreme Court. While we respect the       Committee's oversight role, after reviewing your July 11       Letter, the nature of this investigation, and the       circumstances surrounding your interest in Mr. Leo, we       believe that your inquiry exceeds the limits placed by the       Constitution on the Committee's investigative authority.        Your investigation of Mr. Leo infringes two provisions of       the Bill of Rights. By selectively targeting Mr. Leo for       investigation on a politically charged basis, while ignoring       other potential sources of information on the asserted topic       of interest who are similarly situated to Mr. Leo but have       different political views that are more consistent with those       of the Committee majority, your inquiry appears to be       political retaliation against a private citizen in violation       of the First Amendment. For similar reasons, your inquiry       cannot be reconciled with the Equal Protection component of       the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. And regardless       of its other constitutional infirmities, it appears that your       investigation lacks a valid legislative purpose, because the       legislation the Committee is considering would be       unconstitutional if enacted.       The Committee's Inquiry Raises Serious First Amendment Concerns         Bedrock constitutional principles dictate that ``no       official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox       in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of       opinion.'' W. Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319       U.S. 624, 642 (1943). In the guise of conducting an       investigation concerning Supreme Court ethics, the Committee       appears to be targeting Mr. Leo because of disagreement with       his political activities and viewpoints on issues pertaining       to our federal judiciary. An investigation so squarely at       odds with the First Amendment cannot be maintained.        Mr. Leo is entitled by the First Amendment to engage in       public advocacy, associate with others who share his views,       and express opinions on important matters of public concern.       ``[T]he freedom to think and speak is among our inalienable       human rights.'' 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 143 S. Ct. 2298,       2311 (2023). Indeed, expressive activity of this kind is       afforded the greatest protection possible. See Connick v.       Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 145 (1983) (``[S]peech on public issues       occupies the `highest rung of the hierarchy [sic] of First       Amendment values,' and is entitled to special protection.''       (quoting NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 913       (1982)). Yet Mr. Leo has, for years, been the subject of       vicious attacks by members of Congress, specifically       including members of the Committee majority, because of how       he chooses to exercise his rights. In reference to Mr. Leo's       public advocacy work, for example, Senator Whitehouse has       called Mr. Leo the ``little spider that you find at the       center of the dark money web.'' Senator Sheldon Whitehouse,       Remarks on the Floor of the United State Senate (Sept. 13,       2022). Similar remarks from Senator Whitehouse and others are       too numerous to recount.        This campaign of innuendo and character assassination has       now moved beyond angry speeches and disparaging soundbites.       In the July 11 Letter, Committee Democrats have now wielded       the investigative powers of Congress to harass Mr. Leo for       exercising his First Amendment rights. That transforms what       has to this point been a nuisance occasioned by intemperate       rhetoric into a constitutional transgression.        ``[T]he First Amendment prohibits government officials from       subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions for engaging       in protected speech.'' Nieves v. Bartlett, 139 S. Ct. 1715,       1722 (2019) (quotation omitted). Thus, an official is       prohibited from ``tak[ing] adverse action against someone       based on'' that person's expressive activity. Id. This bar       against retaliatory action applies to Congress as much when       it acts in its investigative capacity as when it legislates.       See Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 126 (1959)       (``[T]he provisions of the First Amendment . . . of course       reach and limit congressional investigations.'').        The Committee's investigation into Mr. Leo's relationship       with Justice Alito quite clearly constitutes an adverse       action for purposes of the First Amendment. The burden       created by a congressional inquiry is significant. See       Watkins v. U.S., 354 U.S. 178, 197 (1957) (``The mere       summoning of a witness and compelling him to testify, against       his will, about his beliefs, expressions or associations is a       measure of governmental interference.''). It can chill       expressive activity and infringe on First Amendment rights.       See, e.g., Smith v. Plati, 258 F.3d 1167, 1176 (10th Cir.       2001) (``Any form of official retaliation for exercising       one's freedom of speech, including prosecution, threatened       prosecution, bad faith investigation, and legal       harassment, constitutes an infringement of that       freedom.''); see also United States v. Hansen, 143 S. Ct.       1932, 1963 (2023) (Jackson, J., dissenting) (noting that       an investigative letter sent by members of Congress ``can       plainly chill speech, even though it is not a prosecution       (and, for that matter, even if a formal investigation       never materializes).'').        It seems clear that this targeted inquiry is motivated       primarily, if not entirely, by a dislike for Mr. Leo's       expressive activities. Retaliatory motive can be shown in at       least two ways: (1) where the ``evidence of the motive and       the [adverse action] [are] sufficient for a circumstantial       demonstration that the one caused the other,'' Hartman v.       Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 260 (2006); or (2) where ``otherwise       similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort       of protected speech'' were not subjected to the same adverse       action, Nieves, 139 S. Ct. at 1727. Both circumstances are       present here.        As noted, Mr. Leo and the groups with which he is       affiliated have been subjected to a barrage of disparaging       remarks because of their views on judicial nominations and       other judicial matters. Sen. Whitehouse has attacked ``creepy       right-wing billionaires who stay out of the limelight and let       others, namely Leonard Leo and his crew, operate their''       supposed ``far-right scheme to capture and control our       Supreme Court.'' Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Remarks on the       Floor of the United State Senate (July 12, 2023). Senator       Durbin has similarly decried ``Leonard Leo and the Federalist       Society'' for their  [[Page S4716]]       ``joint effort [with] very conservative groups, special       interest, dark money groups, and the Republican party'' to       shape ``what will be the future of the court.'' Senator       Richard Durbin, Interview with the Washington Post (July 13,       2023). And perhaps most tellingly, the present investigation       was announced with a statement titled``Whitehouse, Durbin Ask       Leonard Leo and Right-Wing Billionaires for Full Accounting       of Gifts to Supreme Court Justices.'' Sens. Richard Durbin       and Sheldon Whitehouse, Press Statement (July 12, 2023).        These explicitly political attacks, and others like them,       made over the course of many years and reaching a crescendo       in the days immediately following the transmission of the       letter to Mr. Leo, provide an ample basis for concluding that       the July 11 Letter is animated by animus toward       ``conservative'' ``Right-Wing'' views and organizations,       rather than a purely genuine concern about Supreme Court       ethics. See Lyberger v. Snider, 42 F.4th 807, 813 (7th Cir.       2022) (explaining that statements from officials who took       adverse action can demonstrate retaliatory motive). The       circumstances of the Committee's investigation show that       ``retaliatory animus actually caused'' the adverse action       taken against Mr. Leo. Nieves, 139 S. Ct. at 1723.        This conclusion is confirmed by the targeted and one-sided       nature of the investigation. Despite professing interest in       potential ethics violations and influence-peddling at the       Supreme Court, the Committee has focused its inquiries on       individuals who have relationships with Justices appointed by       Republican Presidents. Reported instances of Democrat-      appointed Justices accepting personal hospitality or other       items of value from private individuals have been ignored.       Here are some examples:        In 2019, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was given a $1 million       award by the Berggruen Institute, an organization founded by       billionaire investor Nicolas Berggruen. See Andrew Kerr, Ruth       Bader Ginsburg's Mysterious $1 Million Prize, Washington Free       Beacon (July 19, 2023). Justice Ginsburg used the money to       make donations to various charitable causes of her choosing,       most of which remain unknown. See id.        Between 2004 and 2016, Justice Stephen Breyer took at least       225 trips that were paid for by private individuals,       including a 2013 trip to a private compound in Nantucket with       billionaire David Rubenstein, who has a history of donating       to liberal causes. See Marty Schladen, U.S. Supreme Court       justices take lavish gifts--then raise the bar for bribery       prosecutions, Ohio Capital Journal (April 26, 2023).        On September 30, 2022, the Library of Congress hosted an       expensive investiture celebration for Justice Ketanji Brown       Jackson that was funded by undisclosed donors. See Houston       Keene, Library of Congress explains why it hosted Jackson       investiture but not for Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Fox News       (Sept. 30, 2022).        On two occasions, Justice Sonia Sotomayor failed to recuse       herself from cases involving her publisher, Penguin Random       House, which had paid her $3.6 million for the right to       publish her books. See Victor Nava, Justice Sonia Sotomayor       didn't recuse her self from cases involving publisher that       paid her $3M: report, N.Y. Post (May 4, 2023).        Justice Sonia Sotomayor used taxpayer-funded Supreme Court       personnel to promote sales of her books, from which she       earned millions of dollars, including at least $400,000 in       royalties. See Brian Slodysko & Eric Tucker, Supreme Court       Justice Sotomayor's I staff prodded colleges and libraries to       buy her books, Associated Press (July 11, 2023).        Throughout her tenure on the Supreme Court, Justice Ruth       Bader Ginsburg maintained a close relationship with the pro-      abortion group National Organization for Women (``NOW''),       which frequently had business before the Court. See Richard       A. Serrano & David G. Savage, Ginsburg Has Ties to Activist       Group, Los Angeles Times (Mar. 11, 2004). Among other things,       Justice Ginsburg helped the organization fundraise by       donating an autographed copy of one of her decisions, and       contributed to its lecture series, even as she participated       in cases in which NOW filed amicus briefs. See id.; Katelynn       Richardson, Here Are the Times Liberal Justices had Political       Engagements that Were Largely Ignored by Democrats, Daily       Caller (May 5, 2023).     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
