 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of the Asia-Pacific Subcommittee,  which has jurisdiction over China, I rise today in strong opposition to  the America COMPETES Act, which should really be called the America  concedes act.   After decades of inaction, it is high time we reevaluate our basic  approach towards engagement with China. On every front, the Chinese  Communist Party is aggressively challenging the free world and the  premise that open societies, free markets, and the rule of law  logically result in a prosperous and equitable civilization.   The CCP's ambitions have thrust us into a new Cold War that we did  not start, and we do not want but which we must win. Because if we  fail, the Chinese Communist Party will replace the post-World War II  order with one that revolves around Beijing. This moment calls for bold  policies to ensure that we win this struggle.   On this score, today's legislation is woefully deficient. It is  stuffed full of irrelevant provisions. The Committee on Foreign  Affairs' section of the bill is a prime example. It fails to take  advantage of serious tools, like export controls and security  assistance, and instead, spends twice as much money on climate policy  as it does on China-related matters.   Democratic leadership has refused to even allow debate on Ranking  Member McCaul's serious amendment or in the package that I offered that  includes 13 tough, relevant proposals crafted by subcommittee  Republicans. We must take the Chinese Communist Party's threat  seriously. If we don't, we are going to see China continuing to eat our  lunch and steal our jobs.   This Democratic effort was an opportunity for bipartisanship and  actually doing something that mattered. They blew it, let's face it.  And that is most unfortunate.   Therefore, I have to encourage my colleagues to oppose their  misguided legislation today.
