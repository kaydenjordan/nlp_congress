 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Hiram Maristany, an East Harlem Afro-Boricua photographer  whose work is an ode to his beloved neighborhood of El Barrio and the  Latino community as a whole.   Hiram was the official photographer and a member of the Young Lords,  a Puerto Rican activist group inspired by the Black Panthers, and a  lifelong resident of El Barrio.   Hiram helped found El Museo del Barrio in 1969, curating the  institution's visual language in its early years, and later serving as  its director from 1974 to 1977.   Hiram was always giving back to his community in East Harlem, serving  as a mentor to young people and as a photographer who understood the  importance of self-preservation and the power of images.   Hiram knew that his photos were political, representing El Barrio  from the perspective of our residents: Filled with love and pride.   ``Dignidad over fame,'' was his motto. I am thankful our community  lived to see his work--and our people--showcased with respect and  dignity.   May his memory and his art live on to inspire all of us.                            ____________________
