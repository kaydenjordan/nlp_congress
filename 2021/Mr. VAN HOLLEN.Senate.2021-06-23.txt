 Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of  Kiran Ahuja to serve as the Director of the Office of Personnel  Management. Mrs. Ahuja is highly qualified and has a deep commitment to  public service that will serve her well as the Director of OMB. I am  confident that she has the skills to rebuild the civil service and  restore protections for civil servants that were rolled back by the  Trump administration.   Mrs. Ahuja spent her childhood travelling across the South with her  parents as they worked to provide desperately needed mental health  services to underserved communities. After graduating from Spelman  College and the University of Georgia School of Law, Mrs. Ahuja began  her career in public service as a civil rights attorney at the  Department of Justice. She went on to lead the White House Initiative  for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and then serve as the Chief  of Staff for OPM as it responded to a data breach that exposed the  personal information of millions of Federal employees and contractors.   Kiran Ahuja will be tasked with leading OPM as it faces a new set of  challenges. After 4 years of attacks by the Trump administration on the  protections at the core of our merit-based civil service system, OPM  needs a leader who understands that Federal workers serve our country,  not the individual or political party currently occupying the White  House.   OPM is an independent Federal agency tasked with a vital mission:  ensuring that the Federal workforce delivers top-notch service to the  American people. The next OPM Director must recognize, as President  Biden and Mrs. Ahuja do, that union organizing and collective  bargaining are in the public interest and that these rights are vital  safeguards to protect the merit system principles of the civil service.  The next OPM Director must also work to attract new talent to Federal  agencies that have lost valuable expertise and modernize OPM's outdated  information technology systems. I am confident that Mrs. Ahuja has the  skills and knowledge to meet these challenges and to carry out the  agency's mission.                            ____________________
