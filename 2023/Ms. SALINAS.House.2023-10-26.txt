 Mr. Speaker, I rise today out of deep sadness,  frustration, and anger.   Last night, we witnessed yet another mass shooting, in Maine, that  claimed the lives of at least 18 innocent people. These tragedies have  come to define daily life in America, but it doesn't have to.   We need to pass commonsense gun safety legislation that a majority of  Americans support, including expanded background checks and a Federal  assault weapons ban.   At the same time, we need to address the mental health crisis in our  communities by expanding access to care and ensuring more people can  get the help they need.   There are many solutions to this problem and no time to waste.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in saying not one more, no more lives taken and families irreparably  broken by gun violence, and no more thoughts and prayers without  action.                            ____________________
