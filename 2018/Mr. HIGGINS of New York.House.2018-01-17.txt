 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life  of Dr. Jim Melius, who passed away on January 1.   Possessed of a technical expertise and a fierce sense of justice, Dr.  Melius was a tireless advocate for people who, due to no fault of their  own, were exposed to toxic and deadly substances in the workplace. He  was a powerful force in our efforts in helping thousands of western New  Yorkers get long overdue relief for suffering caused by their unknowing  exposure to uranium at long-shuttered plants like Linde Ceramics,  Hooker Chemical, Carborundum, and Bethlehem Steel, where, today, over  $300 million in compensation and medical bills have been paid out to  former employees. With a calm and steady demeanor, he gave instant  credibility to any fight. He was a tremendous resource and he was a  good man.   While our fight to provide full and fair relief for all of these  citizens continues, we will never forget this fighter for all the Cold  War warriors.                            ____________________
