Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.  [[Page H2334]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Washington?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we will be voting on the American  Health Care Act. We are doing this in spite of the fact that we just  found out that there is an even more dire and harsh plan. We still have  not received the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of what that  plan will do, but we do know that TrumpCare will throw at least 24  million people off of their health care.   Tonight, for the next hour, I am proud to help lead our Congressional  Progressive Caucus Special Order hour with my distinguished members  from the caucus.   I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, as the gentlewoman from New Jersey  said, my colleagues and I will show and prove our true intentions in  occupying our seats here in Congress.   We will have the chance to stand with the 24 million Americans who  have health coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act or cosign  billion-dollar tax cuts to the wealthy. We will have the chance to  reject the attacks on the health of women and older Americans or force  Americans to pay more for less. We will have the chance to choose  between what is best for all or what is best for some. We will choose  between right and wrong.   Changes to the current law proposed in the un-American Health Care  Act, also known as TrumpCare, could result in cuts to benefits,  increased costs, or reduced coverage for older Americans.   According to the 2016 Medicare Trustees Report, the Medicare part A  trust fund is solvent until 2028. This is 11 years longer than  predicted in 2009, due in large part to the changes made in the ACA.   Repealing the additional 0.9 percent payroll tax on high-income  workers, as proposed in this new bill, would remove $117.3 billion from  the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund over the next 10 years. It would  hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to 4 years and diminish  Medicare's ability to pay for services in the future.   Additionally, provisions of the un-American Health Care Act that  create a per capita cap financing structure in the Medicaid program is  equally dangerous. These provisions would endanger the health, safety,  and care of millions of individuals who depend on the essential  services provided through Medicaid.   The CBO found that the bill would cut Medicaid funding by $880  billion over 2017 to 2026. Medicare and Medicaid must be protected and  strengthened for older Americans and future generations.   Any healthcare legislation presented must take into consideration  future generations of men and women who will take our seats in this  Chamber, future generations that will produce our first woman  President, future generations of women that hopefully will not have to  fight against men meddling in their healthcare decisions.   This bill is a war on women, and, quite frankly, there is nothing  pro-life about it. This bill attacks women's access to reproductive  health care from every angle, undermining not just contraception access  and abortion coverage, but also making it much harder for women to  receive maternity coverage when they do give birth.   The abortion rate is at a historic low, and most analysts say the  principal reason is that the ACA made contraception cheaper and easier  to obtain. The CBO report was all-encompassing, but most strikingly  pointed out a provision that would undermine Planned Parenthood, a  critical provider for women's health care.                                time  1615    This provision would bar women on Medicaid from using their coverage  to go to Planned Parenthood, immediately resulting in many of these  women losing access to contraception and leading to closing of clinics  nationwide.   The CBO estimated that 15 percent of women living in low-income and  otherwise underserved areas would lose their access to services to  prevent pregnancy. In short, local access to reproductive health care  dries up.   In short, this is unacceptable. Just as I opened, I am going to  close. Tomorrow my colleagues and I will show and prove our true  intentions in occupying our seats here in Congress. We will have the  chance to stand with the 24 million Americans who have healthcare  coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act, or cosign billion-dollar  tax cuts to the wealthy as proposed under the Trump healthcare bill.   We will have the chance to reject the attacks on the health of women  and the working families or force Americans to pay far more for far  less, and we will have the chance to choose between what is best for  all or what is best for some. Tomorrow, with the votes cast on this  bill, we will get the chance to choose between right and wrong.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Watson Coleman for her  excellent statement.   Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to yield to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Watson Coleman for her  excellent statement.   Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to yield to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Rhode Island  for his incredible leadership on so many issues and for reminding us  again that 24 million is just a number, but behind that number are all  of the people and all of the stories that will be impacted.   Mr. Speaker, now it is my great honor to yield to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Judy Chu), my good friend, the chair of the Asian  Pacific American Caucus here in the House.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my  strong opposition to the American Health Care Act, or TrumpCare.   TrumpCare would result in 24 million people losing healthcare  coverage. In my Pasadena, California, district, nearly 70,000 people  will lose coverage. In Los Angeles County, about 1 million people will  lose the coverage they have through Medicaid expansion.   Worst of all, this bill would result in skyrocketing healthcare  costs, especially for older Americans. It would hurt people like my  constituent Patty from Claremont. Patty is 62 and never had to worry  about health care because her husband was a union member with a good  job, but in one moment, Patty's life was turned upside down.   Last September, Patty's husband passed away, suddenly. In the blink  of an eye, Patty was forced to find new insurance for herself and her  20-year-old son who suffers from a preexisting condition. She couldn't  afford COBRA and is a few years away from being eligible for Medicare.   Well, thank goodness the ACA came along and she was finally able to  get affordable healthcare insurance. She was so relieved.   But what will happen to Patty's insurance under TrumpCare? We only  have to look at the CBO's estimate that a 64-year-old making $26,500 a  year could see their health insurance premiums skyrocket from $1,700 a  year to $14,600. That amounts to over half their income.   For Patty, these changes could mean thousands in out-of-pocket  expenses for her hypertension medication, which she needs to take  consistently or face life-threatening consequences. Patty would face a  situation that so many older Americans would face: premiums that would  rise by 20 to 25 percent by 2026. The premiums rise because, in this  bill, the GOP created an age tax which allows older Americans to be  charged five times more than younger Americans.   Now, in this bill, there is no concrete plan to help older Americans  like Patty deal with the rising cost of premiums under TrumpCare. And  certainly nothing in this bill will address the enormous deductibles or  out-of-pocket costs that they will face if insurance companies can once  again offer substandard plans with limited benefits. You know, so many  people like Patty are just one accident away from losing coverage.   Why is she and 24 million other Americans going to suffer so that, in  this bill, health insurance executives earning over $500,000 can get a  tax break? so that the wealthy can get $600 billion wealthier? so that  400 of the Nation's richest families can get a $7 million tax cut every  year?   You know, the term ``coverage loss'' isn't some political tool. It  has real life-threatening consequences for people of all ages and  incomes across the country.   The bill before us today has been crafted behind closed doors. We  have had no hearings on this legislation, and Republicans have not  accepted a single Democratic amendment to the bill.   There are just too many American lives at stake. I urge my colleagues  to oppose TrumpCare.    I thank the gentlewoman from California.   Now it is my tremendous honor to introduce and yield to the co-chair  of the Progressive Caucus, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), a  dear friend and somebody that has been on the streets and been a leader  on so many issues, from immigration reform to healthcare.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Grijalva.   I am so proud to introduce my colleague from Massachusetts,  Representative Joe Kennedy.   Two weeks ago, during the Energy and Commerce markup on TrumpCare,  the gentleman actually forced Republican lawmakers to admit that the  bill--their bill, the TrumpCare bill--would not guarantee essential  healthcare benefits for the millions who are covered under Medicaid  expansion, and, later, the gentleman went on to give an incredibly  compelling speech about this bill not being an act of mercy but being  an act of malice. I hope that the gentleman is now going to tell the  American people exactly why he said what he did.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Massachusetts  (Mr. Kennedy).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Kennedy so much. As  the gentleman was talking, I was thinking about the simple rule that we  are all better off when we are all better off. I appreciate everything  that you just said.   Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to yield to the gentleman  from the great State of Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Minnesota  for his tremendous work and for his words. As the gentleman spoke, I  think about all the names that we could call this bill that is before  us. We can call it TrumpCare, we can call it the pay more get less  bill, and we can call it the broken promises bill. But I think what the  gentleman's words have shown us is that this is a bill that is going to  deeply affect 24 million Americans across the country and tear them off  of their health care, and that is just not acceptable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Brownley). It is a great honor to introduce my colleague who is a  champion for so many issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), my colleague on both the Judiciary Committee and Budget  Committee and a champion for people of color and folks across this  country.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to join the  Congressional Progressive Caucus, on which I serve as a vice chair. I  remember this experience less than a decade ago when we worked so hard  to have the Affordable Care Act.   For many, you are seeing this poster for the first time. I think I  need to give you a little journey down memory lane as we talk about why  we are so vigorously opposing what would seem to be new and fresh  ideas.   First of all, let me say the good thing about the Affordable Care Act  is that it is not a respecter of economic standing as relates to the  benefits of health insurance. We were able to grant every American the  right to have insurance that did not penalize you for being a woman,  penalize you for having a preexisting condition. In fact, it did lower  premiums.   We realize that in certain areas that is one of the beginning aspects  of a bill that is only 7 years old, but one of the important points is  that we have given you insurance that has more benefits than it ever  had 10 years ago, 15 years ago. More importantly, working people who  happen to be of low income and who are no less able or dignified or  equal in this Nation now have insurance.   It is insurance. The underpinning of it is Medicaid, but it is  insurance. It allows families, pregnant women, and children to have  insurance, people who are working. Then, on the other side, it has help  for the blind, the disabled, as well for those in nursing homes.  Remember, people in nursing homes have worked. We give them the ability  to live in dignity.   Unfortunately, to the contrary, what I am seeing now, just coming out  of the Cloakroom, is a hustle and bustle of negotiations and meetings,  going in and out of meetings, going to the White House, trying to  corral these last votes. Some of these individuals want it to be made  worse, and they are holding their ground.   But I tell you what is missing in all of this. What is missing is  that what we did almost 10 years ago was have hundreds, maybe  thousands, of hearings or townhall meetings in our districts. We had 79  bipartisan hearings in the House, 453 hearings in the Senate. In the  House, we had over 181 witnesses  [[Page H2338]]  and 239 considered amendments. We believed in listening to the American  people, many of whom did not understand, but we wanted to get it out.   In the dark of night, this bill has come. There are amendments coming  by the day. I will be leaving here and going to the Rules Committee to  try to understand what is in the bill.   To the American people, what you can clearly see that is in the bill  right now is that we are paying more for less. You are getting $880  billion taken out of the Medicaid that is used to keep people whole  after they have worked--those in nursing homes, the blind, the  disabled, or other things that may have occurred--as well as those who  are taking care of children and who are pregnant women. Twenty-four  million will lose their insurance right now, today, as that bill is  passed. Overall, in 2026, 52 million Americans will be uninsured. You  can't be plainer than that.   Then what saddens me the most, besides the $880 billion coming out of  your insurance, they give a $600 billion tax cut to 1 percent of the  richest Americans, whom I would venture to say, getting $57,000 per  family, they would say to you: Take it back and help all of America.   The age tax, if you are 50 to 64, you are paying a penalty--not 85,  but 50 to 64. They can't get rid of that. How are you going to pass a  bill that penalizes?   I have indicated about $880 billion for Medicaid. Then, of course,  the tax relief for people who do not want it.   I say that your patriotism today is letting this see the light of  day. Let's debate it and discuss it. Let's talk to States like Kentucky  and West Virginia and those States that have taken expanded Medicaid.  Let's talk to families, like I have just done today, with children who  are only being taken care of with their catastrophic illnesses, with  smiles on their face, and homebound, because they have Medicaid as  their insurance.   That is why we oppose the TrumpCare bill. No matter how many backdoor  meetings President 45 can take care of--I wish, maybe, it started  earlier, before he attacked President Obama. But, in any event, with  all of these meetings, we are still at a point where we don't know what  the bill is doing for people that is good, but we do know what it is  taking away from people. I just ask that we stop and do this right to  save lives.   I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, Ms. Norton is right: the uninsured rate in  my home State of Washington got cut more than half. So we are down to  not quite as low as you, but 5.6, I think now, compared to over 13  percent before the Affordable Care Act.   I often get to co-chair this Special Order hour with my good friend,  a brilliant colleague. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from great  State of Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, once again, it looks like we need to school  our colleagues on the Constitution. I thank Mr. Raskin for consistently  doing that.   Now it is a great honor to yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro), the dean of the congressional delegation, a champion for  women and families, paid leave, and health care across our country.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to join my colleagues here  tonight. I thank the gentlewoman for taking the lead in this effort.   There really is such an urgency to this debate and to what is  happening on the floor of this House. I rise to voice my opposition to  the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but the urgency of the debate is  because tomorrow, in this Chamber, in the people's House, House  Republicans are prepared to vote on a healthcare plan which is  supported by President Trump and by Speaker Paul Ryan.   What is at stake on this vote tomorrow in this House? What happens to  people in this country with this vote tomorrow?   There is real clarity here. We will see families pay higher premiums  and higher deductibles. This plan will increase out-of-pocket costs to  working Americans. In addition to that, older Americans will be faced  with what has been described as an age tax. Those Americans who are 50  to 64 years old will pay premiums five times higher than what others  pay for health coverage, no matter how healthy they are.   There will be less coverage because we are going to take away health  care for 24 million hardworking Americans. And for older Americans,  once again, something that they rely on in terms of healthcare coverage  is what happens to Medicare. Well, Medicare and the trust fund for  Medicare will have a shortened life by 2 or 3 years because it takes  $170 billion from the Medicare trust fund.   To do what? What does all of this mean? Who benefits from this  legislation that my Republican colleagues want to pass tomorrow and who  are strong-arming their own Members to vote for it? Who benefits?   Don't take my word for it, but the Joint Committee on Taxation  estimates that two of the tax breaks in the repeal bill will give a  $275 billion tax cut to individuals with incomes over $200,000; $190  billion in tax cuts for insurance companies and drug companies who are  making a fortune, for medical device manufacturers who are making a  fortune.   And so what is the balance?   It is working Americans, older Americans who are going to pay  increased costs for premiums and deductibles, and the wealthiest  corporations and individuals are going to get a $600 billion tax cut.   I will make one final comment because this is where the values of  this Nation come into play, and when you think about a young woman in  my district, Mnikesa Whitaker. She is 36 years old. She has an  autoimmune disease known as scleroderma. She cannot breathe without an  oxygen tank. She cannot work any longer at 36 years old. What she says  to me is, without the Affordable Care Act, each day is one day less in  her life. We cannot let the Mnikesa Whitakers all over this Nation down  in order to be able to take care of tax cuts for the wealthiest  Americans and increase the costs to working Americans and older  Americans.   We have an opportunity to say no tomorrow and defeat this Republican  healthcare plan supported by the President and the Speaker of this  House, which will only do great damage to the health care of the people  of this great Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Connecticut  so much for that incredibly compelling testimony of why we cannot let  this bill pass.   Let me summarize what you heard in this last hour from Members across  our country who are terrified. Frankly, this plan--TrumpCare, the pay  more get less plan, the broken promises plan--might actually pass. We  have to make sure that it does not pass.   So, in summary, TrumpCare strips healthcare coverage from 24 million  Americans. It cuts $880 billion--that is almost a trillion dollars-- from Medicaid expansion, and it gives $600 billion in tax breaks to the  wealthiest Americans and corporations while cutting benefits for  seniors, working families, and the most vulnerable among us.    Frankly, we don't know everything it does because there have been  amendments after amendments that have been passed today. We still don't  know what the full impact of this bill is, yet they are pushing through  a vote tomorrow if they can get enough votes to pass it.   TrumpCare is going to raise the cost of health care by about $14,000  for those between the ages of 50 and 64. That is the age tax you have  heard about on the floor tonight. And it is going to raise premiums for  almost everyone. It puts a 30 percent penalty for getting health care  to anyone who suffers any kind of a catastrophic event that throws you  off of health care. If you lose your job and somehow you end up without  health care for a couple months, you are going to have to pay 30  percent more in order to get your health care back.   You heard from Representative Kennedy about mental health, you heard  from Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton about work requirements, and  that is just a piece of what this TrumpCare bill does.   Tomorrow I will join my Democratic colleagues and hopefully enough  Republican colleagues who know that our job is to make sure we provide  health care for everyone across this country. Tomorrow I will vote  ``no'' for the 24 million people who will lose their coverage. I will  vote ``no'' for the almost 15 million people who will lose their  coverage under Medicaid expansion alone. I will vote ``no'' for the  millions of low-income women who rely on services from Planned  Parenthood. I will vote ``no'' for the tens of thousands of people who  will literally die each year if the Republicans succeed in repealing  the health care that we have now.   Let's be clear that the Republican majority has been passing  legislation and voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act for 7 years,  yet they could not come up with a plan that would, in fact, do what  they promised, which is to make sure that we are covering more  Americans at lower prices. As my friend, Representative Raskin, said,  this is not a healthcare plan. A  [[Page H2340]]  healthcare plan would cover more people. This is a tax plan to take the  benefits that working families were receiving on healthcare coverage  across the country and convert it into tax benefits for the wealthiest,  $600 billion in tax benefits.   People around the country are calling in to say if you care about the  American people and if you care about providing health care for all of  us, this is a bad plan, you should not vote for it. And Republicans are  hopefully listening to constituents across the country, to their  Governors in Republican States, Republican Governors who have said how  much Medicaid expansion has helped their States. They have asked and  pleaded for people to keep what we have; to make it better, yes, but  not to strip $880 billion away.   Just recently, Paul Ryan, the Speaker of our House, was quoted as  saying that he has been dreaming about yanking health care away from  the people who need it the most since he was ``drinking at a keg.''   This is what he said: ``So Medicaid, sending it back to the states,  capping its growth rate, we've been dreaming of this since I have been  around--since you and I were drinking at the keg. . . .''   Well, I don't know what he was thinking about when he was drinking at  the keg, but I can tell you that what we have been dreaming about as  Democrats, as people who care about the health care of people across  this country is that we cover people, that we don't put anyone in a  position where they are one healthcare crisis away from bankruptcy,  that we make sure that kids can get asthma inhalers, that we make sure  that grandma and grandpa can go into the nursing home and get the care  that they need. If we pass this bill tomorrow, those grandparents are  not going to have the care that they need. Nursing homes are going to  shut down. We are going to take away jobs from rural areas, rural  hospitals across this country.   Mr. Speaker, today, as we close this Progressive Caucus Special Order  hour, I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I  believe we all have the interests of the American people at heart, and  if we do, then I hope we will stop this TrumpCare bill from moving  forward tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
