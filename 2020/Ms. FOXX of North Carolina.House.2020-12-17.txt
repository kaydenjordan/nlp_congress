 Mr. Speaker, on December 4, Speaker  Pelosi and Congressman Clyburn announced the unveiling of a new exhibit  in the Capitol that pays tribute to Joseph Rainey, the first Black  Member of the House of Representatives.   He served from 1869 until 1879. He was the first African American to  preside over the House, and he was the longest-serving Black lawmaker  in Congress during Reconstruction. In fact, he was a founding member of  the South Carolina Republican Party.   Two other Republicans, George White and Jefferson Long, made history  as the first Black Members of Congress from North Carolina and Georgia  during the same period. George White, from North Carolina, was a  staunch advocate for other Black Republicans in the State and often  took Democrats to task for not accepting the values that other Black  Republicans held as well.   Their stories deserve due recognition, and they also serve as  reminders that political affiliations of any type are based on the  values that one espouses, not just the color of one's skin or sex.   It is unfortunate that more Black Republicans are not elected to the  House of Representatives or to the Senate. That is because Black  Republicans have been attacked repeatedly by the Democratic Party and  their friends in the mainstream media.   Mr. Speaker, even now, Democrats are still peddling a facade of being  the party of the people. However, their outright rejection of those who  hold different beliefs just goes to show how contradictory the party  truly is.   Meanwhile, the Republican Party welcomes members from all different  backgrounds. Just look at the diverse new Republican representatives  that the American people elected to Congress: women, veterans, and  minorities. Those are the Republican candidates from across the country  who have proven that Republican values are not the values of a few;  they are the values of many.   If we look at the centennial of the 19th Amendment that happened this  year, we see the same disinformation tactics at play. Democrats harp  incessantly about how they were the ones that fought for the 19th  Amendment, but history tells a different story. On May 21, 1919, 200  Republicans voted for the 19th Amendment in the House, while many  Democrats objected.   Mr. Speaker, facts can't be forsaken as we look back at these  historic events. However, flip through the pages of any classroom  textbook and you do not see the Republican Party getting the credit it  deserves for fighting for equality, women, and minority populations.   Americans are not consigned to one set of political ideologies based  on immutable characteristics. Free societies are built by an open  exchange of ideas, and that exchange must be respected.   The American people do not need to be told how to feel, how to think,  and what values they should support. That is irresponsible. The  American people are perfectly capable of coming to their own  conclusions, but they need the facts presented to them.   The Republican Party is the party of equality, and the facts clearly  show that.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, there has been a lot of  news coverage lately on coordinated efforts by the Chinese Communist  Party to infiltrate America's institutions.   I am particularly troubled by reports revealing efforts by the CCP to  exploit academic integrity on U.S. college campuses.   We know the CCP is using Confucius Institutes to further its agenda.  Located on college campuses across the U.S., Confucius Institutes use  their platform to spew Chinese Government propaganda.   While Democrats turn a blind eye to China's threat, I am proud my  Republican colleagues and I joined forces on the China Task Force and  made bipartisan recommendations to Congress on how best to counter  threats from the CCP.   There is no place for Chinese censorship in America, especially not  on college campuses where American ingenuity should take flight.  Congress must deliver a strong message: CCP propaganda will be met with  consequences.                            ____________________
