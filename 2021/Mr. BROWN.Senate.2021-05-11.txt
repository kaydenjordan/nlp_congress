 Mr. President, the vote we are about to take on this Van  Hollen resolution, S.J. Res. 15, is a bipartisan opportunity for us to  show people whom we serve that we are on their side.   States all over the country--red and blue States, States in the South  and Midwest, on both coasts--have all recognized that people need  protections from predatory lenders. That is why nearly every State and  the District of Columbia have passed laws to limit, to cap the  interest--the amount of interest--that can be charged on payday and  other loans.   In the late 1990s, payday lenders were desperate to find a way to  evade State laws that limited them from charging exorbitant interest  rates that trap people in a cycle of debt they can't get out of, no  matter how hard they work. They came up with what the Comptroller of  the Currency called ``rent-a-charter''--what we now know as a ``rent-a- bank'' scheme.   Because banks are generally not subject to these State laws, payday  lenders funneled their loans through a small number of willing banks.  It looked like the banks were making the loans, when it was really the  payday lenders.   Federal regulators in both parties--Republicans and Democrats--saw  through this very obvious ruse that hurt low-income people who were  forced to get credit any way they could. Federal regulators cracked  down. Under both President Bush and President Obama, the Office of  Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation--OCC and FDIC--shut down a series of these schemes by  payday lenders and banks.   States from across the country also stepped in to protect their  residents. Georgia, West Virginia, my State of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New  York, Maryland, Montana, South Dakota, Colorado, Illinois, Virginia,  and Nebraska all passed new laws and regulations either to stop these  schemes or to cap interest rates on payday loans at 36 percent--still a  very, very high number that most of us never pay, but that people who  can only get credit that way end up paying, unfortunately. It is still  a high number that, obviously, will make any company making these loans  plenty of money.   Several other States, including California and Ohio, also passed laws  to limit the interest that can be charged on consumer loans. These new  laws passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.   Now, get this: More than 75 percent of voters in Nebraska and South  Dakota supported the ballot initiatives to cap interest rates on payday  loans. So three-fourths of the voters going to the polls in a popular  vote wanted to cap interest rates on payday loans in those two States.   In recent years, new financial technology companies emerged that  partner with banks to offer responsible small-dollar loans at more  affordable rates.   But we also have a separate group of online payday lenders  resurrecting the same old rent-a-bank scheme to offer abusive, high- interest loans. They are not even attempting to hide it.   One online lender told its investors it would get around California's  new law by making loans--these were their words, this lender's--through  ``bank sponsors . . . not subject to the same proposed state level rate  limitations.''   So he or she is even acknowledging that States--voters or State  legislatures or both--are saying: We want to cap those interest rates  so people don't take out a small loan and end up paying 200, 300  percent after these payday lenders put that on them.   Another lender said: ``There is no reason why we wouldn't be able to  replace our California business with a bank program.''   So they know what they have to do. They know they are going against  the intent of the legislature and the intent of the voters.   Given the broad bipartisan support for these laws, we had hoped that  the Trump OCC would take action and crack down on these schemes, the  same way that Bush and Obama had done--schemes that have been rejected  by voters and legislatures over and over, in State after State after  State.   But last year, the OCC issued what is known as the true lender rule,  overruling voters of both parties, giving essentially a free pass to  these abusive rent-a-bank schemes.   Now, to fight back on behalf of low-income people and on behalf of  fair play, a broad bipartisan coalition is asking Congress to overturn  the OCC's harmful true lender rule.   That support includes credit unions, State bank regulators-- Republicans and Democrats alike--and State attorneys general of both  parties. One of the most outspoken has been the Republican attorney  general of Nebraska, because his State passed--his State's voters  passed--a limit, 75 percent of them, to keep interest rates down.   There is support from small business groups, support from the  Military Officers Association of America.   We know that payday lenders especially prey on young members of the  military. One of them may be off in a foreign country while the spouse  stays back at the base or stays back in a community and is struggling  with just having the resources to get by. They are preyed upon so  often.   Other groups are the National Association of Evangelicals, the  Southern Baptist Convention, and other members of the Faith in Just  Lending Coalition.   That coalition wrote to Congress:         Predatory payday and auto title lenders are notorious for       exploiting loopholes in order to offer debt-trap loans to       families struggling to make ends meet. The OCC's ``True       Lender'' rule creates a loophole big enough to drive a truck       through.    That came from this coalition--the coalition of attorneys general,  the Military Officers Association, the National Association of  Evangelicals, and the Southern Baptist Convention. They are saying the  OCC's true lender rule creates a loophole big enough to drive a truck  through.  [[Page S2441]]    We know why these commonsense laws that our States passed are  popular. We know why they enjoy bipartisan support in States across the  country. People don't want abusive lenders to prey on them, their loved  ones or their neighbors.   Some issues that come before the Senate are complicated. They divide  people. There are thorny nuances to consider. This isn't one of them.  It is simple. Let's protect the people whom we serve. They have clearly  cried out for us to do this. We should protect those people.   I urge my colleagues to support S.J. Res. 15 to overturn this rule.   I yield the floor.    I thank my colleagues for their vote on this resolution,  which was so important to protect people from being abused by payday  lenders. S.J. Res. 15 will be a big deal, saving a lot of money for a  lot of low-income people who have been fleeced far too many times.   I thank the leader. I thank, in my office, Laura Swanson and Jan  Singelmann for their terrific work in making sure that everybody was  here and everybody was learned on this issue so well and how important  that was for our State and for our country. I thank them.                             National Police Week    Mr. President, each year during Police Week, we honor the law  enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to  their communities.   This year, we add the names of four Ohioans to the National Law  Enforcement Memorial who laid down their lives last year: Corporal Adam  McMillan of Hamilton County Sheriff's Office, Detective James Michael  Skernivitz of Cleveland, Patrolman Anthony Hussein Dia of Toledo, and  Officer Kaia Grant of Springdale.   Sadly, we already know of two names who will be added to the memorial  next year: Officer Brandon Stalker of the Toledo Police Department and  Jason Lagore, who worked for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.  Each one of these losses is a tragedy for a family, for a community,  and for their fellow officers.   Ms. Grant's mother, I know, and I talked to her about how tragic this  is for her, for her family, and for the families of all of these  officers who gave their lives in service to others.   Over the past year, we have had many reminders of the work that must  be done to reform and reimagine public safety and to rebuild trust  between law enforcement and communities. These Ohioans' lives are a  reminder of the ideals we should strive for--officers who are true  public servants in the best sense of the word, people who gave  themselves to their communities. And these Ohioans gave so much.   Officer Anthony Dia was the father of two young sons. He married his  high school sweetheart. In a letter he wrote to his family during  Ramadan, the devout Muslim wrote:         Every day I put on the uniform, it is with the intention to       protect the innocent and the weak in my community.    The imam who spoke at his memorial service said:         When you think of Islam, think of this man who gave his       life on the Fourth of July to defend the values of the United       States.    Detective James Skernivitz served my city of Cleveland. He served in  neighborhood policing districts, and in 2013, he joined the Gang Impact  Unit, working to reduce violence in Cleveland. He was a devoted father  and played softball for many years, traveling to tournaments with the  Steel City Enforcers.   Corporal Adam McMillan spent 19 years serving the public at the  sheriff's office in Hamilton County, Cincinnati. So many in his  community spoke about his kindness. His pastor said at the memorial  service that ``he was the kind of guy who asked the person in the  drive-thru window how their day was going.'' His generous spirit will  live on. Corporal McMillan was an organ donor, and his loss is giving  new life to someone else.   Kaia Grant was in the Reserve Officer Training Corps in college.  After graduating and working with at-risk kids in Cincinnati, she  joined the Springdale Police Department. Her coworker said:         Instead of going into the military and then going into       politics, like many do, she wanted to serve the community.    Another colleague related a story about how she saved a woman's life.  The department got a call about a person considering taking her own  life, and they searched and searched but found no one. They were close  to giving up, but Officer Grant didn't. She found the woman in a  parking garage in time to save her life.   As part of her dedication to our country, Officer Grant interned for  a U.S. Senator while she was in college. That Senator's name was Joe  Biden. Earlier this year, on his first trip to Ohio as President, Joe  Biden met with Officer Grant's mother, Gina Mobley, to thank her for  her daughter's service to him, to our country, and to her community.   We can't begin to repay the debt we owe Ms. Mobley and all these  families. We can work to reform our systems to protect more officers  and the communities they swear an oath to protect.   This week, I am introducing legislation, the Law Enforcement Training  for Mental Health Crisis Response Act, with Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma.  We have seen too many Americans, both officers and those they serve,  hurt or killed when law enforcement responds to people in their  communities suffering a mental health crisis. This bill would invest in  training to help families resolve those situations safely for  themselves and for their communities. They help officers resolve these  situations safely for themselves and for the communities they serve.   Law enforcement officers, reformers, and advocates all agree we  pushed too many problems onto the criminal justice system, expecting  officers to be social workers and crisis responders and family  mediators without the proper training to fill those roles.   We need to actually invest in mental health and education and other  social support. We need to give officers the training and resources  they need to help when they are called on to respond to these  situations.   This Police Week, let's offer--many of us come to the floor to do  this--more than empty words. Let's honor the memory of these women and  men who have laid down their lives in service of their community by  getting their fellow officers the tools and the training they need to  do their jobs and to build trust with the communities they have sworn  to protect.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
