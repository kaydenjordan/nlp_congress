 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I rise in support of    ========================= END NOTE =========================     I want to thank Mr. Knight and Ms. Esty for introducing this bill.  Women continue to be woefully underrepresented in the aerospace sector.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women made up only 8  percent of aerospace engineers last year. While we are inspired by the  career of NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who holds the U.S. record for  days in space, we must do more to ensure that successes like hers are  the rule and not the exception.   H.R. 4254 will help address the underrepresentation of women at all  levels in aerospace education and in the workforce by privatizing the  recruitment of qualified women to apply for NASA internships and  fellowships. Some of these women will go on to be STEM teachers, and  others will have research or industry careers. They will all benefit  from participating in the NASA programs, and I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
