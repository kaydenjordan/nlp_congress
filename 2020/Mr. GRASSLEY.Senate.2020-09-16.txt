 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, I imagine the people of the United  States have been able to follow the demonstrations in Belarus in  opposition to the President declaring victory there. Since Aleksandr  Lukashenko came to power in Belarus in 1994, he has consolidated power,  and, in the process, suppressed democratic opposition.   So the fact that the Belarus August Presidential election was a sham,  as we all know, and he was once again declared to be the winner by a  highly implausible margin, should not surprise anyone. However, this  time, the Belarusian people have had enough. This time, brutal  crackdowns by security forces have not crushed grassroots demands for  democracy.   The quest for liberty is embedded in the DNA of the American  Republic, so the Americans naturally watch with interest as the people  of Belarus continue to demand their God-given rights. The American  people stand with the people of Belarus.   I also appreciate very much the strong stance taken by European  governments supporting the Belarusian people as the American people  have.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, we have recently seen yet another  manufactured crisis by the Democrats for the benefit of the upcoming  election. This is in regard to scaring the people about some notion  that only Republicans would think about taking away Social Security and  Medicare. It is not true that any Member of this Congress will do that,  but it always comes up as TV advertising against the Republicans; you  are going to scare old people into thinking Social Security is going to  be gone if you vote Republican.   So this is another election season. If there are not any real issues  regarding Social Security, the Democrats make one up, and they do it,  of course, to scare the people into believing that some people want to  destroy the program, not realizing that it is such a part of the social  fabric of the American population that nobody would think of doing it.   We saw it in the last Presidential election when Secretary Clinton  didn't have a basis to attack then-Candidate Trump on Social Security  because Trump campaigned on the basis that he wasn't going to cut  Social Security, but that didn't stop them from making things up. With  their lacking any real ammunition, Clinton's allies here in the U.S.  Senate decided to manufacture a crisis.   Now, why does something that happened in 2016 come up now? It is an  example that this is an ongoing situation, and it is happening in 2020.   Back in 2016, three prominent Democratic Senators conjured up false  claims about a nominee for the position of public trustee of the Social  Security and Medicare trust funds. That nominee happened to be a  Republican who was nominated--can you imagine this?--by a Democratic  President. He was already on there as having been nominated for another  term.   The false claims published in the Huffington Post were that this  nominee, promoted by President Obama, was a Koch brothers-funded  individual because he worked at an educational institution that  received grants from the Koch Foundation. I don't know whether they  even made an attempt to connect this individual to the Koch funds, but  it is irrelevant at this point. The Democrats claimed that this single  individual somehow duped all of the other trustees, including all of  the other Obama administration officials, into buying off on  assumptions that would lead to an overstatement of the financial crisis  facing Social Security.   According to the three Democratic Senators, this was so bad that the  Chief Actuary of Social Security felt compelled to write special notes  to trustee reports and identify how shocking the assumptions were. Of  course, that would have meant that one single public trustee who  happened to be a Republican duped outstanding Democrats who were also  trustees: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell,  Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, and then the additional Democratic public  trustee. If you had bought into the Democrats' allegations at the time,  it would have meant that all of those Obama officials had been duped  and had been too inept to see what had been going on and that only the  Chief Actuary could have seen the light.   Well, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance at that time  investigated those allegations and showed that they were flatout lies.  Even the Washington Post identified the lies in an op-ed titled: ``The  showdown Democrats don't need to have.'' The Post concluded that the  ultimate victims of what they called ``petty politicization'' would be  ``the perceived nonpartisanship and objectivity of key government  reports--that is, the very values Senate Democrats claim to be  upholding.''   The Democrats used their misinformation campaign to run a smear job  on a very qualified and well-respected nominee. They also used it to  run ads against anyone who voted in favor of that nominee, including  ads against me in my most recent reelection.   Unfortunately, even though Social Security's Chief Actuary was  clearly implicated in the Democratic lies, he remained silent as then- Chairman Hatch and even the Washington Post identified how ridiculous  and false the Democrats' claims were.   The Chief Actuary's position, apparently, is that, even if his office  is being implicated as supporting clearly false and very public claims  during an election season, he will just sit quietly and let them go by  rather than admit to or apologize for being used once it is pointed out  to him that he is being used.   All of that was 4 years ago. It is 2020 now, and it is all happening  again. Here we are in another Presidential election season, and, of  course, like clockwork, we are getting another round of misinformation  from the Democratic candidate and his supporters in the Senate. The  Washington Post Fact Checker labels the current scheme in a headline  that reads: ``Biden campaign attacks a Trump Social Security `plan'  that does not exist.''   Now, that was a Washington Post article. Not often does the  Washington Post talk about things that might defend Republican  positions against the Democrats.   This time around, the misinformation stems from a letter written to  Social Security's Chief Actuary by four Democratic Senators, including  the minority leader, the ranking member of the Committee on Finance,  and Senator Sanders, who has been counseling former Vice President  Biden.   In a letter, these Democrat Senators asked the Chief Actuary to  analyze hypothetical legislation--now, those words ``hypothetical  legislation'' have to be emphasized--what they say, even they wouldn't  support eliminating payroll taxes. Of course, those Senators could  easily find the information that they were seeking by looking at the  latest Social Security trustees' report. Instead, for purely political  reasons, they wanted to draw in the Chief Actuary once again   The same Actuary of 4 years ago is being used here once again, and  the Chief Actuary at Social Security seems to gladly have played along  and written a response. He wrote that his office was not aware that  anyone had proposed the hypothetical legislation.  [[Page S5625]]  Nonetheless, he identified that, without payroll tax revenue and no  replacement from the general fund, the trust funds would run out of  money pretty quickly.   Of course, this is obvious to anyone who has even slight knowledge of  these programs, but information was not the aim of the Democratic  Senators' letter. Instead, it was to put forward a silly hypothetical  case that doesn't correspond to anything that anyone has or is  proposing. Of course, they attributed it to the President of the United  States.   I know you all now see the purpose of this replay--because it is an  election year. They used the Chief Actuary's response to claim that  authoritative sources have shown that President Trump has a plan to  essentially defund Social Security, and in due course they engaged in  the cottage industry of groups which exist here in Washington, DC, that  regularly scare seniors and the disabled, especially before an  election, about some sort of backdoor plan or Trojan horse plan to  destroy Social Security, and the Democratic Senators used the Chief  Actuary's response to feed the Biden campaign with a false talking  point about Social Security.   So you see the motives of these Senators in their using the Chief  Actuary as their tool. You see it pretty clearly. The Biden campaign  has run ads, stating, among other mistruths, ``If Trump gets his way,  Social Security benefits will run out in just 3 years from now.''   Let's go back to the Washington Post. Even the Post's Fact Checker  gave those ads four Pinocchios, meaning that they contained a whopper  of a lie. The Fact Checker also concluded: ``To make a long story  short, Democrats ginned up a letter from the chief actuary to describe  a plan that does not currently exist.''   In a followup letter that Ranking Member Kevin Brady of the House  Ways and Means Committee and I wrote to Social Security's Chief  Actuary, we expressed our concerns about the Democrats having, once  again, used his office for political purposes, and, once again, it  refers back to the 2016 era that I have already talked about. From his  response, we learned a few things.   First, we got confirmation that no one has a plan to defund Social  Security, including the President of the United States. That confirms  that the Democrats' letter was just pretty silly, but not oddly, pure  politics.   Second, we got confirmation that the Democratic Senators, during the  2016 election, published lies in the Huffington Post article, invoking  the Chief Actuary in an effort to smear a trustee nominee.   Third, we learned that Social Security's Chief Actuary feels  compelled to respond to any hypothetical posed to him by any Senator,  independent of how silly or blatantly political it would be.   Of course the Chief Actuary shouldn't be so compelled. With that  latter lesson, it would be easy for a Republican Senator to ask the  Chief Actuary to analyze hypotheticals corresponding to the allegations  made by Senator Sanders, one of the authors of the letter, concerning  the ``hypothetical legislation'' about Vice President Biden's history  on Social Security.   Senator Sanders, during the primary, has run political ads  characterizing Biden's record on Social Security, saying that Biden's  claim that he has always protected Social Security are ``patently  false.''   It wouldn't be hard to send a hypothetical in for analysis by the  Social Security Chief Actuary to get an answer to reinforce Senator  Sanders' views that former Vice President Biden has not acted to  protect Social Security.   It wouldn't be hard to send a letter to the Chief Actuary asking  about how Senator Sanders' plans to reform Social Security--which  Senator Harris has cosponsored--would harm the middle class by raising  payroll taxes, with no corresponding benefits for people with incomes  below Biden's $400,000 threshold for defining who is rich and who is  not.   It certainly wouldn't be hard to construct politically charged  hypothetical legislation and ask the Chief Actuary about it in order to  make political points and use the Actuary's position for political  purposes.   It happens that the Chief Actuary doesn't exist for the purpose of  political interference.   In my view, though, none of those would be a proper use of Social  Security taxpayer resources, in the same way that the Democrats are  wasting resources using the Chief Actuary for political purposes. So  Democrats should stop wasting Social Security's resources trying to  construct false and misleading political points to use in elections to  feed their political base and dark money groups who then use the points  in social media and attack ads against Republicans. But that is how  they wasted the taxpayers' money--by writing the letter and eating up  the time of the Chief Actuary for nothing other than pure partisan  politics.   They should also stop politicizing Social Security's actuaries and  the Social Security trustee's position in their transparent attempt to  mislead the public and try to score political points about Social  Security.   The American public should--especially during even years, in the  runup to elections--turn a deaf ear to scare tactics that Democrats  continue to use on Social Security beneficiaries. But when senior  citizens who aren't sophisticated in the operation of the Federal  Government or the uses of politics to scare people--they might believe  this stuff. So you are doing a disservice to a lot of people who  shouldn't have to worry about where their next meal is coming from.   As well, I think journalists should be more responsible when  reporting on these political shenanigans, although I will note that  even the most recent ploy was at least called out by fact checkers and  given four Pinocchios.   Rather than acting like demagogues on Social Security, we should do  what we can to improve these programs. Social Security trustees across  administrations have continually and consistently recommended  addressing the projected trust fund shortfalls since protected benefits  will continue to outpace revenues.   Some sort of reform is inevitable, but outside of broad reform, there  are many programmatic improvements that can help make the programs work  better for beneficiaries and today's workers.   While not as encompassing as broad reforms, there are plenty of areas  that we and Social Security Commissioner Saul continue to monitor and  work to reduce backlogs and improve services.   Just recently, for example, the Senate passed by unanimous consent a  bill that we entitled ``Improving Social Security's Service to Victims  of Identity Theft Act.'' That was sponsored by this Senator and Senator  Sinema. This bipartisan effort will help people who fall victim to  identity theft by providing improved services from Social Security with  a single point of contact.   In my view, more bipartisan work to improve the programs is the way  we should go. Partisan attacks to scare beneficiaries into believing  that people are out to destroy people's retirement and disability  benefits do nothing to help working, disabled, and retired Americans.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, earlier today, my colleagues, Senator  Schumer and Senator Wyden violated the Senate rules by attempting to  offer a resolution disparaging oversight work being done by me and  Senator Johnson. My colleague, Ranking Member Wyden, said that the  investigation Senator Johnson and I are engaged in is advancing a  Russian disinformation campaign. To be clear, that investigation is  focused on potential conflicts of interest and other wrongdoing  regarding the time Vice President Biden was lead on the Obama  administration's Ukraine policy. At that same time, his son, Hunter  Biden, was on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian gas firm called Burisma.  This investigation is a good-government investigation to better  understand the effect these potential conflicts had on policy  execution. This investigation is based on Federal Government records  from the Obama administration and records from a Democratic lobby shop,  Blue Star Strategies. If those records are Russian disinformation, then  that says more about the Obama administration than the purpose of this  investigation.   I have also addressed the claim that this investigation is somehow  connected to Andriy Derkach. I have said publicly on many occasions  that I have never received information or material fom him. I have  never solicited information from him. The same is true for my staff. In  fact, the only two times that I am aware of that my staff have come in  contact with his information are, No. 1, when the Democrats introduced  his records into a transcribed interview, and No. 2, when Minority  Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, Senator Warner, and Representative  Schiff used it in their July 13, 2020, letter.   They also attempted to link Andriy Telizhenko to Andriy Derkach,  apparently to cast him as a nefarious foreign agent, but they neglected  to mention his many connections to the Obama-Biden administration,  including White House meetings and outings with White House staff. They  also omitted his work for Blue Star Strategies, which was working on  behalf of the corrupt Ukrainian firm that hired Hunter Biden while his  father was the face of U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Democratic  connections to Mr. Telizhenko are many and well documented. If they are  so concerned that he is a conduit for disinformation, why did they work  with him for so long?   Maybe the Democrats should take a pause and realize that they are the  only ones pushing Russian disinformation. Let's not forget about the  Steele Dossier. Thanks to now-declassified information, we know the  dossier was filled with Russian disinformation. The Democrats bought- and-paid-for crown jewel ironically was an example of the very  disinformation and collusion that it falsely accused the Trump campaign  of. The Democrats pushed it for years. Now that it is a failed  document, they have tried to run the same baseless smear tactic on this  investigation. The facts simply aren't on their side. If my colleagues  on the other side are as concerned about foreign disinformation as they  claim to be, they would stop relying on it to falsely attack us. Let's  stop playing these games and get back to business for the American  people.                            ____________________
