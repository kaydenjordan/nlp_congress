 Mr. Chair, I rise to support the gentlewoman from  Utah's amendment. I think that it is very appropriate, and,  unfortunately, we find ourselves in a time where this is needed. But we  have the awesome responsibility, and we have to remind ourselves  sometimes that we are the only 435 people in the country that will vote  on this country going to war and making decisions that impact this  country. Because of that, I think that we need to make sure that we  safeguard ourselves in this rising time of new threats and dangers.   Look, we all signed up for public service and to serve our country  and to make it a more perfect Union; however, a lot of our families and  our neighbors and our constituents that show up at our functions didn't  necessarily sign up for that. So for those reasons, I would just ask  that my colleagues support it. I think it is a very prudent piece of  legislation, amendment, at a very important time.
