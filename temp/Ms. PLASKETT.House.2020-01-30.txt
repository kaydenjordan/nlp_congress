 Mr. Speaker, the Virgin Islands is known for its  queens--powerful, dynamic, passionate women who lead. We had Queen  Coziah, who led the coal strikes; Queen Mary and ``Bottom Belly,'' who  led the labor strikes.   We lost one of our queens last week, Ann Elizabeth Christian  Abramson, who was a loyal, fearless, compassionate leader, an  entrepreneur, and a stateswoman.   She was born in 1924, the last of 15 children. Ever industrious, even  as a child, she left school for several years to help her family when  they were in need and then went back.   She was a businesswoman extraordinaire--taxicab business,  construction company, bus company, aggregate owner, and the list goes  on. She was appointed to our municipal council, where she was the only  woman to serve during her time, as well as to our legislature.   She gave tremendously to our community, but I know she also gave to  me. When I went to this fearless leader to ask her for support, she not  only gave me her support, but she gave me her time.   I saw how she cared for her islands and her people. She was chair of  the state Republican Party and helped the Girl Scouts, hospitals, and  chamber of commerce. She did it all.   Mr. Speaker, we will remember her legacy and hope she rests well.                            ____________________
