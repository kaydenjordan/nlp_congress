 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding a Special  Order on a topic that could not be more relevant than at this very  time: the failures of ObamaCare.   As a healthcare professional myself, the elected representative of  over 700,000 constituents, and the grandfather of 13, I have a duty to  see that access to medical care is more affordable for the welfare of  my patients, for my constituents, and for the livelihood of my children  and my grandchildren.   ObamaCare moved us away from the patient-centered affordable medical  care--the traditional doctor-patient relationship--that we have enjoyed  for well over a century. ObamaCare was designed by Washington  bureaucrats who, unlike other Americans, are exempt from ObamaCare. In  the last 24 hours, I have heard from nearly 1,000 of my constituents  who are overwhelmingly begging me to repeal ObamaCare and replace it  with a bill that restores their healthcare freedom.   That is no surprise to me. I have heard from thousands of my  constituents, including my own patients and my own family members,  about how their premiums have skyrocketed and their deductibles have  skyrocketed. They have health insurance, but they can't afford to  access medical care because their deductibles are too high and their  longtime family doctors are no longer accepted as providers in their  new health insurance. They have to drive long distances to get to a new  and different doctor in their medical plan. They have had medical care  interrupted. Simply put, they want this ObamaCare nightmare to end.   A truck driver from Hardin County told me how she was forced to  switch plans last year from the PPO that she wanted to keep to an HMO  that she did not want. This has made it significantly more difficult  for her to find a doctor to accept her insurance when she gets sick out  on the road even though she pays much higher in premiums than she did  last year for her PPO.   Melissa, who lives in Harris County, has the same story. Last January  she had to switch her family to an HMO plan because of ObamaCare's  limited choices in her community. This forced her family to leave their  doctor of 20 years and their local pharmacy.   Melissa said: I have always been a very responsible American citizen,  yet ObamaCare told me what kind of plan that I had to buy.                                time  2045    This is what ObamaCare does. It makes decisions for patients instead  of the other way around. Brute Federal force.   The message is clear: ObamaCare's top down, Big Government approach  is leading to higher premiums, less choice, and insufficient access for  people in my district and all across this great land of ours. These  higher out-of-pocket costs and premiums have priced too many Americans  out of the insurance market altogether.   Melinda, who lives in the county next to me, had an ObamaCare plan  last year and paid nearly $600 a month. She also had a $3,000  deductible. She had to spend over $10,000 before her health insurance  plan paid for anything. Even with these high premiums, her insurance  plan would not cover many of her asthma medicines or the cataract  surgery that she desperately needs.   This year, when her premiums went up another $100, she dropped  coverage altogether. Under ObamaCare, now she has lost affordable  coverage, and she must pay a penalty, a tax.   Angela, from Harris County, actually decided to sign up for an  ObamaCare plan after going uninsured for some time. Unfortunately, she  soon realized that the cost vastly outweighed the benefits. So this  year, she chose again to go without insurance. Now she pays the  ObamaCare tax.   Others in my district don't want insurance coverage or only want  catastrophic coverage. Yet, they are forced to pay expensive fines.  Their freedom of choice is grossly limited.   Gina, a hardworking single mother and businessowner told me that she  is now forced to use the little bit of money that she gets from her tax  refund to pay the ObamaCare tax.   Charlie from Harris County says that he wants me to vote to repeal  the individual mandate, stating that ObamaCare has forced him to buy a  product that he doesn't want.   ObamaCare relies on force and coercion, but this is not the American  way. If ObamaCare is so good, why did a larger percentage of Americans  elect to pay the penalty than to take the subsidy for their coverage  last year? The American people deserve much better.   I have got hundreds of similar stories, including those from a  college student who couldn't work more than 27 hours a week over her  Christmas break to earn money for school because the ObamaCare law  imposed costly mandates for her employer if she does.   ObamaCare is in a death spiral and is imposing too much pain and  suffering on the American people. Premiums have gone up, on average, by  25 percent across the country for enrollees this year alone. Some  States, like Arizona, had a 116 percent increase in premiums.   Twenty-five percent of Americans have only one health insurer to  choose from, and 50 percent of Americans live in areas with only two  insurance providers. Folks, that is not a choice.   The complaints I am hearing now are at a fever pitch, and the  American people are demanding a change now. We need a patient-centered  healthcare system driven not by mandates and coercion, but by freedom  and choice for my patients, for my constituents, for my family, and for  all Americans.
