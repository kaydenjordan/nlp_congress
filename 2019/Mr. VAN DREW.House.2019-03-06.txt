 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am profoundly  concerned with the possible permitting of seismic airgun blasting off  the Atlantic Coast, from Jacksonville, Florida, to Cape May, New  Jersey, to Portland, Maine. This is an extremely serious issue.   Late last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  also known as NOAA, issued five Incidental Harassment Authorizations  which advanced permit applications for seismic airgun blasting in the  Atlantic Ocean. This action essentially sets the stage for the Bureau  of Ocean Energy Management to approve these permits at any day now.   Seismic airgun blasting is not only the first step toward offshore  oil and gas exploration and development, but it is harmful to marine  mammal life and to marine life in general, and it encroaches on vital  military operations.   At a time when we are attempting to limit the dangers of climate  change, such as extreme weather events like Superstorm Sandy, it is  unthinkable to further harm the environment and endanger our coastal  economy in South Jersey and along the coast, which is largely based on  fishing and based on tourism.    Our public policy goal is to create a cleaner and healthier  environment, an environment that we can pass on to our children and on  to our grandchildren so that they may enjoy it.   I am proud that broad arrays of organizations in New Jersey have  supported my legislation. These organizations include the Chambers of  Commerce of Cape May County, Ocean City, Vineland, Greater Wildwood,  Greater Atlantic City, the Garden State Seafood Association, the  Recreational Fishing Alliance, the Jersey Shore Partnership, Clean  Ocean Action, Surfers Environmental Alliance, the American Littoral  Society, Oceana, and the New Jersey chapters of the Sierra Club, the  League of Conservation Voters, Audubon Society, and Environment  America.   Mr. Speaker, it was a pleasure to have worked with Congressman  Rutherford of Florida on H.R. 1149. I am also grateful that several of  our elite colleagues joined us on important efforts, including Joe  Cunningham of South Carolina, Chris Smith of New Jersey, Donna Shalala  of Florida, and Brian Mast of Florida, as well.   Our bipartisan bill, the Atlantic Coastal Economies Protection Act,  would prevent the five seismic airgun blasting permits that are now  under consideration from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management from  being issued. It would stop them.   I urge my colleagues to protect our precious coastline and to protect  the livelihoods of those that depend upon it by supporting H.R. 1149.  It is a bipartisan bill. It is the Atlantic Coastal Economies  Protection Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include three letters of support for the Record.                  [From the Greater Atlantic City Chamber]  Resolution Opposing BOEM 2019-2024 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas                              Leasing Program         Whereas, on January 8, 2018, the federal Bureau of Ocean       Energy Management (BOEM) announced in the Federal Register       notice the release of their Draft Proposed Program (DPP) for       the 2019-2024 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing       Program. BOEM is requesting public comment on the  [[Page H2376]]       DPP as well as formal scoping for a Programmatic       Environmental Impact Statement for the 2019-2024 Program; and        Whereas, this new plan includes the entire Atlantic Ocean       from Maine to Florida, including the waters off New Jersey       within 3 miles of beaches, as well as including other ocean       areas totaling some 90% of US ocean waters; and        Whereas, New Jersey boasts over 127 miles of beautiful       ocean coastline and hundreds of miles of back-bays,       estuaries, and other waterways connected to the Atlantic       Ocean; and        Whereas, the Jersey Shore is essential to the health of the       our communities, environment and the thriving economy of New       Jersey; and        Whereas, the physical, hydrodynamic, and biological       characteristics of the ocean off the Jersey Shore are unique       in the world, as more than 300 species of fish, nearly 350       species of birds, 5 species of sea turtles, and many marine       mammals such as 20 species of whales and dolphins, 1 species       of porpoise, and 4 species of seals, frequent this region.       Nine endangered species, four of which are whales, can be       found in these ocean waters, including the Atlantic Right       Whale, one of the world's most endangered marine mammals. The       region also serves as an essential migratory pathway for many       of these species; and        Whereas, the Jersey Shore sustains the economy of the       region with its bounty of natural resources and intrinsic       values for millions of people through tourism. Tourism brings       more than $44 billion to NJ's economy each year and provides       jobs to more than 500,000 people with $6.2 billion generated       in Cape May County alone; and        Whereas, recreational and commercial fisheries in NJ       provide enormous economic benefits, including revenue, food       production, and recreational activities with the port of Cape       May and Wildwood ranking as the second largest seaport on the       east coast. In 2014, recreational fishing supported nearly       20,000 jobs and resulted in $2 billion of retail sales.       Commercial fishing supports nearly 7,300 jobs and provides       $152 million in landings, not including restaurant and retail       sales; and        Whereas, current estimates of the amount of technically       recoverable oil off the entire Atlantic coast from Maine to       Florida would only last the nation approximately 229 days,       and the amount of technically recoverable gas would only last       approximately 562 days; and        Whereas, offshore oil and gas development, causes       substantial environmental impacts, including: (a) onshore       damage due to infrastructure, (b) water pollution from       drilling muds and the water brought-up from a well with oil       and gas (called ``produced waters''), (c) noise from seismic       surveys, (d) air pollution, and (e) oil spills; and        Whereas, the harmful environmental consequences of offshore       oil and gas exploration and development are serious and       threatens the environmental and economic assets of New       Jersey; and        Whereas, The BP Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico       (2010) is clear evidence of the dangers associated with       offshore drilling, including costing the lives of 11 people,       devastating coastal economies and countless livelihoods, and       killing countless marine animals, as well as continuing to       cause harm to marine life as documented by a steady flow of       studies; and        Whereas, Federal Administration officials are also       weakening protections of ocean resources by undermining rules       and regulations, cutting funding sources for spill response;       and        Whereas, oil spills travel vast distances, and the Gulf       Stream and Labrador Ocean Current all flow toward New Jersey       making the region vulnerable to impacts from spills anywhere       in the Atlantic Ocean; and        Whereas, Within 5 days of the release of the DPP Governor       Scott from Florida was able to convince Department of       Interior Secretary Zinke to remove Florida from further       consideration for drilling due to the importance of coastal       tourism to that state and NJ shares this same economic       dependence on tourism and clean ocean economies;        Whereas, bi-partisan opposition against drilling off the       New Jersey coast has included every Governor since 1985, and       a majority of the congressional delegation and most coastal       towns; and        Whereas, in the January 8, 2018, BOEM Federal Register to       requests comments on the Draft Proposed Program (DPP) and       scoping comments for the Programmatic Environmental Impact       Study        Whereas, energy conservation and efficiency measures can       significantly reduce the nation's need to explore and drill       for nonrenewable resources, such as oil and natural gas; and        Whereas, coastal municipalities have a profound interest in       maintaining strong federal protections for our nation's       coastal environment, as well as the economic and social       benefits it supports;        Now, therefore, be it resolved on March 5, 2018, that the       Greater Atlantic City Chamber hereby opposes offshore oil and       gas exploration and drilling activities that would affect the       coast of New Jersey, and calls upon Secretary of the Interior       Ryan K. Zinke who oversees the Bureau of Ocean Energy       Management to withdraw New Jersey and the entire Atlantic       Ocean from consideration for the offshore oil and gas       exploration, development, or drilling.                                                   Joseph D. Kelly,      President.                                   ____           Ocean City Regional Chamber of Commerce and Visitors             Services,                                  Ocean City, NJ, February 6, 2019.      Congressman Jeff Van Drew,      Mays Landing, NJ.        Dear Congressman Van Drew: On behalf of the Ocean City       Regional Chamber of Commerce, I would like extend our       endorsement of Atlantic Coastal Economies Protection Act to       prohibit the Department of the Interior from issuing certain       geological and geophysical exploration permits under the       Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and for other purposes.        The Ocean City Regional Chamber of Commerce, which is       comprised of more than 550 member businesses, strongly       supports this act as we are against seismic airgun blasting       in the Atlantic Ocean.        We stand by you and your support of the Atlantic Coastal       Economies Protection Act.            Kindest regards,                                                   Michele Gillian,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                            Greater Vineland Chamber                                                     of Commerce,                                     Vineland, NJ, February 7, 2019.      U.S. Representative Jeffrey Van Drew,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Van Drew: On behalf of our organization,       including more than 450 members, we write this letter as an       endorsement of your proposed bill, known as the ``Atlantic       Coastal Economies Protection Act'', to prohibit the       Department of Interior from issuing certain geological and       geophysical exploration permits under the Outer Continental       Shelf Lands Act, and for other purposes.        We agree that seismic air-gun blasting in the Atlantic       Ocean has the potential to harm or kill marine mammals and       other marine life that are vital to our region's coastal       economies. We are also wary that the survey data collected is       not available to the public.        Thank you for your efforts in proposing this bill.            Sincerely,                                                    Dawn S. Hunter,      Executive Director.                            ____________________
