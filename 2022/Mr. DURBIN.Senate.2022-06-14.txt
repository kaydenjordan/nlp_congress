 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is hard to believe it was 50 years ago  this week--50 years ago--when five men were caught breaking into the  offices of the Democratic National Committee here in Washington.   Two years after that, the so-called Watergate break-in and the  coverup by the Nixon White House, it brought down the President.   For nearly half a century, the Watergate scandal really ranked as  America's greatest constitutional test since  [[Page S2922]]  the Civil War--then came January 6, 2021.   An angry mob, summoned by a defeated President, attacked this Capitol  building, attacked this Chamber, and those of us who were in it knew it  was an attempt to overthrow an election, an election which Donald Trump  lost but never admitted.   How did we respond?   Well, the proposal was made--the right proposal--to create a  bipartisan commission to investigate what happened on January 6, 2021.  Unfortunately, the Republicans, led by Senator McConnell in the Senate,  filibustered the creation of an independent commission to investigate  January 6. Fortunately, the House went forward to proceed on its own on  a bipartisan basis to get to the truth.   Now, after 11 months and 1,000 interviews--more than 1,000--the  bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the  U.S. Capitol is sharing its findings with America, and the revelations  are so damning.   In its first two public hearings, the committee has shown that the  attack on the Capitol was not a demonstration that changed  spontaneously and became a riot. The attack on our Nation's Capitol,  the attack on this Chamber, was the result of a plan: a violent effort  to prevent the peaceful transfer of power from the Trump administration  to the Biden administration, to stop the peaceful transition of power  in America for the first time in our history.   To quote Congresswoman Liz Cheney, the former President Donald Trump  ``summoned the mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this  attack.''   When the mob beat our police officers and ransacked the Capitol-- going through our desks here on the floor, posing for pictures where  the Presiding Officer is now sitting, all sorts of things to make them  look famous with their friends at the expense of the integrity of this  building and this Chamber.   They beat the police officers. Donald Trump did nothing to stop  them--nothing. He wouldn't order the National Guard to defend the  Capitol, the Senate, the House. He watched the mayhem on TV, rewinding  it to watch it over and over again. He gloried in the moment.   When the crowd threatened to hang Vice President Pence, Donald Trump  said, ``He deserves it.'' Deserves it. The Vice President of the United  States deserves it.   His own advisers told him repeatedly that the voter fraud conspiracy  theories that he was pedaling were false. They were called ``idiotic,''  ``amateurish,'' ``detached from reality.'' Who said that? The former  Attorney General serving Donald Trump said it in describing the false  claims that President Trump continued to pedal.   Donald Trump was told the truth over and over again, and yet he  continued to push his deadly Big Lie.   He deliberately--the former President of the United States-- deliberately undermined America's faith in our election process to  overturn the election and to hold onto power no matter what.   He used the Big Lie to make big bucks. We learned that yesterday-- quarter of a million dollars--quarter of a billion dollars in  donations, including millions of dollars for an election defense fund  that didn't exist.   In a coming hearing, the committee will show how Donald Trump  pressured the Justice Department into helping him overturn the  election. I know a little bit about that. Our Senate Judiciary  Committee, which I chair, documented this attempt to subvert the  Justice Department in an 8-month investigation and report that we  produced last fall. We produced this report in a bipartisan fashion,  inviting Republican and Democratic Members of the Senate Judiciary  Committee to witness the testimony of key individuals and to ask  questions themselves.   We interviewed former Justice officials like Jeffrey Rosen and  Richard Donoghue, the then-acting Attorney General and Deputy Attorney  General, who resisted Donald Trump's pressure to take over the Justice  Department.   They told us how repeatedly they informed the former President that  his bogus election claims were false. They told us how Trump,  nevertheless, asked the Justice Department to ``Just say the election  was corrupt--and leave the rest to me and Republican Congressmen.''   And they resisted Donald Trump's plan to replace Jeffrey Rosen with  the Big Lie lawyer Jeffrey Clark, who wanted the Justice Department to  help overturn the election.   The facts that the Senate Judiciary Committee uncovered are damning.  The January 6 committee will unveil those--many of their own discovery  and reporting and some that we sent to them from our testimony that we  gathered in the Senate Judiciary Committee.   We came close to losing this democracy in America on January 6. I  believe that by laying out the truth for us and for future generations,  members of the committee are performing a public service of heroic  proportions.   It is sad--sad--that given an opportunity of a bipartisan commission,  just as we had with 9/11, that the Senate Republicans stopped it. Why?  It is a question they are going to have to answer.                             Political Prisoners    Mr. President, on another topic, we speak often in the Senate about  threats to peace and freedom around the world: Russia's unprovoked  invasion of Ukraine, China's brutal repression of the Uighurs, the  dismantling of democracy in Hong Kong, Nicaragua's repressive  dictatorship, and more.    In each of these struggles, there are some brave men and women who  are prepared to risk their liberty and their lives to defend democracy  and dignity. Many of them languish in prison as political prisoners.  Their captors often try to torment them by telling them: The world has  forgotten you; no one knows you are here.   Well, I want to make sure that that doesn't happen by coming to floor  of the Senate and sharing some of these stories. Today, let me tell you  about a few of them.   Let me start with a Russian opposition leader of remarkable courage:  Vladimir Kara-Murza. He was poisoned twice by the Russian spy agency  FSB, in 2015 and 2017. He not only survived that, but he continued his  work for a democratic Russia.   He was a close friend of Senator John McCain, who asked him  personally to serve as a pallbearer at his funeral.   I met Mr. Kara-Murza in March, 3 weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine.  He was living in Washington at the time with his wife and three  children, and he told me he was going back to Russia. He had work to  do.   On April 11, he was arrested in Moscow, 1 day after giving an  interview in which he called Vladimir Putin's government a ``team of  murderers.''   His wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, also an advocate for democracy in  Russia, who I expect to meet with later on this week, said: ``He's  doing as well as you can do in a Russian prison that is notorious for  torture, humiliation, and mistreatment.''   Earlier this month, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution I led  with Senator Marco Rubio, calling on Russia to release Vladimir Kara- Murza immediately, along with Alexei Navalny, another Russian  opposition leader, and thousands of others--Russians jailed for  speaking up against repression, for even mentioning the possibility of  the murderous war in Ukraine.   It is time for America to stand up for Mr. Kara-Murza and those like  him who have shown extraordinary courage.   Senator Leila DeLima is a leading human rights advocate in the  Philippines. She is a state senator who just passed her fifth year in  jail.   Here she is in her cell.   Why is she in prison for 5 years? She criticized the repressive  regime of President Rodrigo Duterte.   From time to time, she writes to me from her prison cell. Let me  share a short excerpt of a recent letter:         Warm greetings from my detention headquarters . . . I do       not know for how long I will remain behind bars but there is       one thing that I am sure of--my will to fight for what is       right continues to be undeterred.    Recently, two key witnesses in the sham case against Senator DeLima  recanted their testimony, proving what we already know: The case  against her is contrived. It is a travesty of justice.   Many Filipino Americans in Illinois tell me they are deeply concerned  about the accountability and democracy and its prospects in the  Philippines.  [[Page S2923]]    The incoming Marcos regime can demonstrate its commitment to a  democratic Philippines by ending the harassment of journalists and  making Senator DeLima's release one of its first priorities.   Let me now turn to Saudi Arabia--timely.   I have been troubled by the human rights record of this Kingdom,  including the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, for which there is no real  accountability yet.   This year brought a bit of welcome news. Writer Raif Badawi was  finally freed from prison after completing a 10-year prison sentence  for dubious charges about his peaceful writings.   I hope that the Saudis will allow Raif the dignity of reuniting with  his brave wife, Ensaf Haidar, who I met in Washington, and their three  children, now living in Canada.   Badawi's lawyer, Waleed Abu al-Khair, a leading human rights  defender, is still in prison. He was convicted in Saudi Arabia's  Specialized Criminal Court, usually reserved for terrorists.   I appeal to the Saudi Government to free Waleed and to allow Raif to  be reunited with his family.   These gestures would be particularly notable in light of President  Biden's upcoming visit.   Finally, let me turn to the United Arab Emirates.   This is Ahmed Mansoor, one of the last major human rights voices in  the Emirates.   He was arrested in 2017 for using blog posts to advocate for reform  and human rights in his nation. He was convicted of charges of  threatening the UAE's state security and social harmony, they sentenced  him to 10 years in prison. He has been there for more than 5, at times,  in solitary confinement, isolated from other prisoners, no contact with  his family. He has reportedly been tortured.   Despite the dismal conditions of his incarceration, he remains  steadfast in his commitment to human rights. He has conducted multiple  hunger strikes to protest prison conditions.    I appeal to the United Arab Emirates' new President, Muhammad bin  Zayed Al-Nahyan, to take this opportunity early in his Presidency to  demonstrate compassion and courage by releasing Mr. Mansoor.   America's strength around the world comes not only from our military  and economic might but from the power of our values. Over the years, I  have heard from many political prisoners. They tell me the support this  body, of Congress, of America, and so many others in our government  sustained them through the lonely, desperate times they spent in jail  for days and weeks and months and years.   I will close with the words of Vladimir Kara-Murza. This is from a  recent op-ed he wrote for the Washington Post from his Russian prison.  He wrote:         The prisoner's worst nightmare is the thought of being       forgotten . . . I always knew how true those words were--and       how important were international campaigns of solidarity with       prisoners of conscience. I now feel it with my own skin.    To Vladimir Kara-Murza, Raif Badawi, Waleed Abulkhair, Senator Leila  de Lima, and Ahmed Mansoor, I say: You are not forgotten, and we will  continue to advocate for your freedom.   Let me also close by acknowledging that a member of my staff, Chris  Homan, has really inspired me to take on this cause, and he works at it  diligently--our reward, an occasional political prisoner makes it here  to my office here in Washington. One of them from Africa presented me  with basically a baton that he had made while in prison with my name on  it because he heard that I remembered him and spoke of him on the floor  of the Senate.   I would say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Make this  part of your responsibility as a U.S. Senator. Find these people, these  heroes who are sadly wasting away in prison and remember them on this  floor. It can make a difference. Some will be released; all will  remember the fact that you stood up for them at a time of great need.   I yield the floor.
