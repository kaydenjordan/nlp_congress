 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for yielding. I  appreciate it.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 485, the Stronger  Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.   Children are our future teachers, doctors, police officers, and  Members of Congress. It is our responsibility to ensure that they can  live, learn, and grow up in a safe environment.   In fiscal year 2020, in my home State of Georgia, it actually ranked  second in the country for the number of calls to child abuse hotlines.   That is why I was so proud to introduce an amendment in the Committee  on Education and Labor last Congress with my colleague, the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Stefanik), that would establish a national child  abuse hotline. I am excited that same language was once again included  in this year's Stronger CAPTA legislation.   Madam Speaker, our bill will create a grant program for a national  child abuse hotline, for the establishment and operation of a 24-hour  hotline for victims of child abuse. Their families and caregivers,  parents, youth, mandated reporters, and any other concerned community  member can call or text the national child abuse hotline when looking  for immediate help and support during moments of crisis and moments of  doubt.   The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk factors that lead to  child abuse, as millions are experiencing elevated levels of stress due  in part to job and income loss, or even the loss of a loved one. Before  the pandemic, teachers, social workers, and members of the community  who regularly interacted with children and youth were able to identify  the instances of child abuse and record them and report them  accordingly. However, as we maintain social distancing to keep  ourselves and our loved ones safe, it is much harder for those  individuals, who once interacted with our youth, to identify such  abuse.   That is why we must continue to invest in child abuse and prevention  services, such as the national child abuse hotline that Congressman  Stefanik and I have included in Stronger CAPTA.                                time  1600    We do not yet know the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic  will impact our children, but we need to make sure that we are fully  prepared to take care of them no matter what.   As my esteemed colleague, Representative Foxx, has just made mention  of, we know that additional stressors with COVID-19 pose more conflicts  in our homes, and thereby adding additional opportunities for child  abuse. Now is not the time to reduce funding or support for these well- needed services. Our Nation's children need us now more than ever.   And I am so grateful, even though I no longer have my child with me,  I am so grateful to be able to encourage my colleagues to stand and  support this well-meaning legislation so that I can take part in saving  the lives and protecting children that may not even be my own.   Stronger CAPTA is bipartisan legislation that provides critical  protections and resources to families and children across our Nation to  prevent and end child abuse. With the passage of this bipartisan  legislation, we are just one step closer to saving our children's  lives. Stronger CAPTA is important, not only for my home State of  Georgia, but for the Nation.   Together we must ensure the safety of our Nation's children, they are  our future. If we, as a Nation, do not protect the most vulnerable in  the least of these, then who are we? Who are we in the eyes of the  Nation? And who are we in the eyes of the world? Together we must  ensure the safety of our Nation's children.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues, both Republicans and  Democrats, to support this very vital, well-meaning and important  legislation.
