 Madam Speaker, I rise today with great  disappointment as we await a vote on a secretive budget reconciliation  package.   I am incredibly proud to serve as the Republican leader of the House  Agriculture Committee, and it is an honor to work on behalf of the  farmers, ranchers, and foresters who feed, clothe, and power our  Nation. I am equally proud of the bipartisan work the House Committee  on Agriculture has done on behalf of rural America.   Sadly, though, since the start of the 117th Congress, it seems the  days of bipartisan, commonsense solutions are now few and far between.  The most recent reconciliation process for the Agriculture Committee is  especially concerning, if not utterly bizarre.   On Friday, September 10, my Republican colleagues and I participated  in a 9.5-hour markup only for the committee Democrats to recess until  the following Monday to gain the votes they needed to ram through an  incomplete and unvetted budget reconciliation package to the tune of  $66 billion.   Noticeably missing from the package was a whopping $28 billion--$6  billion more than the committee's instruction--in additional spending,  left out due to the Democrats' ongoing problems with the Congressional  Budget Office and the Byrd rule in the Senate.   During the markup, both Republican and Democrat members asked  repeatedly when the committee would know more about the missing funds  and whether the committee would be able to engage, review, and mark up  the provisions. The committee's majority indicated the $28 billion  would be added at a later stage.   This was a stunning admission and a departure from regular order for  the House Agriculture Committee. This amount of money would  traditionally demand dozens of public hearings, testimony from  stakeholders, and rounds of technical assistance from USDA, all  conducted by the committee of jurisdiction.   Unfortunately, that was not the case for this bill, a package that  rivals  [[Page H5561]]  many titles of a 5-year farm bill in size and scope, I might add.   Now, I wish I could say I was surprised, but given how Republicans  have been so brazenly ignored throughout the first reconciliation and  this newest sham reconciliation, this dereliction of process has,  sadly, become par for the course.    As for the $28 billion of missing mystery funds, members of our  committee remain in the dark. Initial summaries leaked to the press by  the stakeholder groups and Senate Democrats told one story. A draft  leaked this week told a very different one, including what appears to  be $34 billion beyond the Democrats' own instruction.   This past weekend, the Budget Committee spent time moving the total  package forward, and now it looks as though the Democratic chairman of  the Rules Committee gets to decide the fate of the Agriculture package.   This is absurd.   This sham of a process is an insult to the 201 years of the House  Agriculture Committee's bipartisanship. I refuse to stand idly by as  this committee is driven into the ground by a partisan process that  leaves rural America behind.   Enough is enough, Madam Speaker. Congress is a circus, and Democrats  in leadership are the ringleaders.   This process is an absolute farce, and it has only further devolved  into chaos as the press, lobbyists, and the Democratic leadership aides  know more about the policy than committees of jurisdiction. Leaked  documents and secretive briefings should not be the way Washington does  business.   Process aside, this is simply a bad bill, and it does next to nothing  for rural America. It is shameful that in the nearly $100 billion of  excess spending that claims to be for agriculture, there isn't one  penny for the commodity safety net, crop insurance, broadband, or  disaster assistance.   Madam Speaker, I could go on and on about how this bill fails rural  America. Five minutes simply is not enough time. So, I will close with  this: Democrats can either force this sham of a bill through and pat  themselves on the back for explosive spending and lack of transparency,  or we can start over and work together to put real solutions on the  table for rural America.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the Matric Group located in Venango County, Pennsylvania.
