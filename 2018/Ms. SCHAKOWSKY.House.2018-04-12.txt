 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   First, the Republicans passed a tax scam that blows a $2 trillion  hole in the budget and gives 83 percent of its tax cuts to the  wealthiest among us and corporate CEOs.   Then they offer a budget that would fill that gap by cutting more  than $2 trillion in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and even  programs like Meals on Wheels. And now, they want to amend our  Constitution to require a balanced budget.   We know how the Republicans plan to balance the budget--on the backs  of seniors. We have seen this movie before--budget after budget that  cuts Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid;  [[Page H3176]]  budgets that leave seniors without their earned benefits or access to  long-term care; budgets that privatize the Veterans Administration and  Medicare; providing vouchers and not health benefits; that raise the  age of eligibility for Medicare and Social Security; that cap and slash  Medicaid, the largest source of long-term care. And no wonder seniors  groups are raising the alarm.   Under this resolution, the AARP says: ``Social Security and Medicare  would cease to provide a predictable source of financial and health  security in retirement.''   The Alliance for Retired Americans calls it ``irresponsible'' and  ``extremely harmful to older Americans.''   The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare says  it ``would force severe cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,  and other vital Federal programs.''   The Strengthen Social Security Coalition says: ``We regard a vote for  the balanced budget amendment as a vote to cut Social Security, as well  as Medicare and Medicaid.''    When Paul Ryan announced his retirement yesterday, he said before he  leaves, he hopes that he is going to be able to go after these  retirements and entitlements and cut them: Social Security and  Medicare. This has already been announced. This is the future if we let  it happen. We need to vote ``no.''
