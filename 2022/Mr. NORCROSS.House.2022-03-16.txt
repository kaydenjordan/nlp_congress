 Madam Speaker, I am back once again to talk about the  people who brought you the $8 cup of coffee, Starbucks.   Since I last spoke on the floor, a couple things have changed. The  $20 million man, Kevin Johnson, has resigned. I think that is a good  thing. Now, Howard Schultz is back, the former CEO and chairman.   But plenty hasn't changed. They still send those corporate  representatives to the stores to intimidate the young workers. They  subject the workers to  [[Page H3754]]  captive listening sessions. When that doesn't work, they fire their  employees. Five hundred bucks an hour for an antiunion lawyer to go in  and fire a $13-an-hour worker. Wow. After what they did in the  pandemic, this is what we are seeing.   Howard, do the right thing. Respect your workers. Give them a voice  in the workplace. Let them vote on the union.                            ____________________
