 Mr. President, there are a lot of inscriptions--famous  words, inspirational sayings--that are detailed into and painted onto  the walls of the Capitol. One of my favorites, which I think also  happens to be one of the shortest, adorns a wall, I believe, on the way  into the House Chamber. The saying is attributed to Alexander Hamilton,  and it reads, simply: Here, Sir, People Govern.   Here, Sir, People Govern. It is purposeful that that quote finds its  way onto the walls of the Capitol Building because this is the branch  of government that is given primacy by our Founders. It is no  coincidence that we are the article I branch. Governing--the process of  setting the rules by which the country lives--is supposed to happen  here, in the article I branch, the elected wing of American democracy.   But as all of my colleagues know, there has been very little  governing here happening of late. This Congress--this Senate--has been  effectively dead. Here in the Senate, half the normal bills have been  passed during this Congress, compared to normal years, and nearly one- third of that legislation that we have finished has just been renaming  postal buildings or authorizing commemorative coins. In fact, over the  last 2 years, the Senate has spent floor time on a grand total of 20-- 20--pieces of legislation that weren't routine or emergency spending  measures. That is less than one bill a month. We are getting paid  $170,000 a year to work on one substantive piece of legislation every  30 days.   Now, perhaps you could intellectually reconcile this legislative  desert if there were no problems to solve in America, if not a single  major change in law was necessary. That, of course, is not the case. A  pandemic disease has killed over 200,000 Americans. An opioid crisis  that rages largely unchecked took another 70,000 lives last year, just  in drug overdoses alone. One out of 10 Americans are out of work today.  Wildfires and hurricanes and droughts, caused by a man-made warming of  the planet, ravage our landscape. No, there are really big problems  that need to be solved--deadly problems, existential problems.   I keep searching for the reason that no legislation is happening  here, especially since the Senate does actually seem to be doing  something. I mean, I am here voting most weekdays. So we must not be  totally out of business. No, in fact, the Senate has been doing  something, and that something is confirming judges to a record number  of vacancies in the Federal court system.   Those record vacancies were created by Senator McConnell, who  refused--refused--to confirm any judicial nominees, including to the  Supreme Court, during President Obama's final 2 years in office. And  the primary reason that Senator McConnell has stopped passing  legislation and has turned this institution into a judge-confirming  simple machine is because the modern Republican Party currently owns a  policy agenda that is about as popular as a pair of wet socks.   More people without health insurance and higher rates? Nobody wants  that. Easier access for dark money to influence Congress? Not very  popular. Less regulation of financial companies and polluters? No, few  people out there are clamoring for that. The criminalization of  abortion? Not a big groundswell in America. The elimination of the  firearms background check system? Yes, pretty much everybody hates that  idea too.   You see, no parts of that agenda can actually pass Congress.  Certainly not now, with Democrats in charge of the House. But they  couldn't even get it done when they had control of the Senate, the  House, and the White House. They spent months trying to repeal the  Affordable Care Act, for instance, but because Republicans figured out  that they would all lose their seats if they repealed the law, they  gave up and walked away.   Frankly, they gave up on it all, not just because they feared the  electoral backlash--no, also because they found another way to get  their agenda done. You see, Republicans found another place for that  Alexander Hamilton quote. It turns out that they can't--or they don't  want to--govern here. But they found a way to get another branch of  government, insulated almost completely from popular opinion, to  implement their world view. They want that inscription--Here, Sir,  People Govern--to move to a building a block away, on the other side of  First Street--the U.S. Supreme Court.   With the elevation of Amy Coney Barrett to that Court, Republicans  will have completed their methodical, careful surgical procedure--the  transplant of American rule setting from the abdominal cavity of this  building to that of the building across the street.   I want to explain what I mean by this, but, first, let's just lay  down an obvious predicate about the process that brought us to this  moment. It is important. Senate Republicans were not telling the truth,  as it turned out, when they said in 2016 that they believed the Senate  shouldn't confirm a Supreme Court Justice in the final year of a  President's term. Shocker--they didn't actually mean what they said.  They said it, in 2016, to try to put some lazy, razor-thin veneer of  intellectual legitimacy on their refusal to let President Obama fill a  vacancy on the Supreme Court, as was his duty and right under the  Constitution. But we know now that their obstruction of Merrick Garland  was, of course, just a simple, naked, anti-democratic, anti- constitutional power grab.    They should have just admitted it then because at least it would have  avoided the mind-blowing hypocrisy of this sudden, stunning reversal of  position. Now, suddenly, all of a sudden it is OK to confirm a Justice  in the last year of a President's term--in the last few months of an  election, while people  [[Page S6395]]  are actually voting, as it turns out. Of course, it is, because all  that matters here now is power. We get that. We will remember. The  rules have changed. The Republicans changed them. You went back on your  word. And it makes this whole process lack legitimacy.   It is important to stipulate that, but it is an insufficient  explanation, admittedly, of my opposition to Amy Coney Barrett, because  the consequences of this nomination go far beyond the downward spiral  upon which Republicans have placed this institution. No, the real  travesty here is that transplant of lawmaking from here to the Supreme  Court and what it is going to mean for regular people out there when 5  of 300 million Americans--5 people who are unelected and totally  unaccountable to popular opinion--start changing the rules under which  we all live because the rule changes they support and their political  movements support are so wildly unpopular that they couldn't be passed  in Congress. So they had to be enacted over in the Supreme Court.   Seventy times since the passage of the Affordable Care Act,  Republicans have tried to gut all or part of the law. Thirty-one times  the Republicans tried to repeal it in its entirety. They shut down the  entire Federal Government for 2 weeks, trying to strong-arm Democrats  to acquiesce to their demands to end health insurance for 20 million  Americans. But all 31 times, they failed--most spectacularly, of  course, in the summer of 2017.   So, having failed here at this political imperative, Republicans  turned to the courts. Senator Cornyn kind of explained what they did  for you in his remarks just before mine. He said, Republicans put into  the 2017 tax bill a relatively small change to the Affordable Care Act  that opened it up to judicial assault. Then, not coincidentally,  Republican attorneys general, joined by President Trump, sued to  invalidate the entire law because of that one small change. Senator  Cornyn talked about severability. That is not what the plaintiffs in  the case, including President Trump, are asking for. They are asking  for that change in law to bring down the entirety of the ACA, and  President Trump confirmed that, once again, today in an interview on  ``60 Minutes.''   A Republican-appointed judge ruled for Trump at the district court,  and then a Trump-appointed, McConnell-confirmed judge provided the  decisive vote at the appeals court in favor of striking down the law.  Now that entire law is up for legal challenge at the Supreme Court,  and--surprise--the hearing to invalidate the entirety of the Affordable  Care Act is in 3 weeks.   You wonder why we are rushing through this nomination in record time.  Amy Coney Barrett, who has already stated on the record that she thinks  the law, even before the changes in the tax bill were made, is  unconstitutional, has been selected specifically in order to be the  fifth vote to invalidate the Affordable Care Act.   That is not conspiratorial thinking. That is the President's word. He  has said he is not going to put people on the Supreme Court unless they  do the opposite of what John Roberts did.   The same goes for Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. They have all  been picked for the Court because of their willingness to bend the law  and the Constitution, through this riotously flexible doctrine called  originalism, to comply with Republican requests of the Court. This new  crowd of jurists that are trained, midwifed, and championed by  Republican political associations like the Federalist Society are  brought up through the farm system and up to the majors to do one  thing, to win games for the franchise--the pro-corporate, anti-worker,  modern Republican Party.   Really, Coney Barrett's confirmation is just the final act of this  plan to make the Supreme Court do what the Republican Congress  couldn't--in this case, end the Affordable Care Act and the insurance  it provides for 23 million Americans and the protections that it gives  to 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions.   I love this argument that Republicans use that all of a sudden we  shouldn't worry about what is about to happen on the Supreme Court,  that it is all a construction of our imagination that there is some  effort under way to invalidate the Affordable Care Act.   I didn't just wake up yesterday. I have been in Congress since the  passage of the Affordable Care Act. I have watched the methodical,  daily, unending campaign of Republicans to strike down the entirety of  the Affordable Care Act. I watched them make the change to the tax law  when they couldn't repeal it through Congress. I then watched  mainstream Republican attorneys general all together, en masse, bring a  case to invalidate the entire law. I watched the Trump administration  break with precedent and join that suit, arguing against his own  government's position.   Now I have watched this Senate elevate three people to the Supreme  Court who have been brought up through that same political movement and  will vote to end those protections in the Affordable Care Act. My eyes  have been opened these last 10 years. I know what is going on, and so  do the American people.   Joe is a constituent of mine from East Haven. He says:         After working for decades, I was one of millions laid-off       due to the covid-19 economic disaster. Not only was my       livelihood destroyed, but my health insurance disappeared       along with it. I am not old enough for Medicare nor young       enough to feel secure without health insurance. Private       insurance and COBRA are simply too expensive for the average       middle class individual who now has no income. The ACA is my       only option for healthcare coverage.    Margaret from Enfield, CT, says:         My husband had a near fatal heart attack 2 years ago. He       has recovered but requires on-going monitoring. He now has a       ``preexisting condition.'' He was laid off from his job . . .       six weeks ago [a job he had for 28 years]. We have no income,       and [we have] to pay . . . to have his health care continued.       Without the ACA, we would not only have no income, but also       no health insurance. We would be destitute trying to pay his       health care bills.    Imagine 23 million people losing health insurance in the middle of a  pandemic. But that is why we are rushing through Amy Coney Barrett's  nomination--because there is this chance, finally, to grab the brass  ring, to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. If you don't get Amy Coney  Barrett on the Court by the time that hearing happens in 3 weeks, it  makes that effort a lot harder.   Healthcare isn't the only area of our daily lives that will be  changed if Amy Coney Barrett turns the Supreme Court into a new  legislative body. Let me take you down another rabbit hole: the use of  the Supreme Court to rewrite the Nation's firearm laws.   The National Rifle Association's vice grip over Congress is nearly  over. Evidence of that comes from the 2017-2018 legislative session,  when the NRA controlled both Houses of Congress, had their man sitting  in the Oval Office, and they had priorities, but they couldn't get any  of them called up for a vote. Then, in 2018, 30-plus NRA A-rated House  Members were removed from office by their voters and replaced by  supporters of measures like universal background checks and bans on AR- 15s. NRA-sponsored measures can't even get a vote in a Republican  Congress anymore because they are so unpopular.   But just like ACA repeal, the window, though it is closed here to  weaken our Nation's gun laws, remains open on the Supreme Court. Once  again, it is time to abandon legislative action and for Republicans to  turn to the Court.   Amy Coney Barrett represents the vanguard of the new, radical, out- of-the-box pro-gun industry thinking on the definition of the Second  Amendment. It is the kind of radical, new thinking that is necessary if  one wants the courts, rather than the legislature, to invalidate  background checks laws, something an elected body could never, ever,  ever do, what with 90 percent of the Americans supporting universal  background checks.   Amy Coney Barrett's opinion in Kanter v. Barr is a sight to behold,  really. In it, she argues it is unconstitutional for a legislature to  prohibit felons from owning a gun. She says the Second Amendment  guarantees certain felons the right to own firearms, even though 90  percent of Americans think otherwise.   What she writes to back up her view is even more radical, even more  dangerous. She says that courts, not the legislature, should be the  finder of fact on whether a person is too dangerous to own a gun. And  she says that the courts can overturn any gun restriction if they find  evidence that refutes the efficacy of the law.  [[Page S6396]]    Basically, she is saying the courts are now going to micromanage our  gun laws. She believes the Second Amendment puts the courts, not the  legislature, in charge of choosing who can own a weapon and who can't.  That is, of course, a curiously convenient view for a Republican Party  that would love to weaken our gun laws but can't do it  through Congress. Now--surprise again--the Supreme Court rides to the  rescue.    This, of course, would be devastating for the safety of Americans if  criminals could once again buy guns. Last week, I was spending time  with Janet Rice, whose son Shane was killed just a few blocks from my  house in Hartford. An argument over a girl turned deadly when one angry  young man went to the front seat of his car and grabbed an illegal  weapon, likely bought through a loophole in the background checks  system, and used it to shoot Shane in the back.   Weaker background checks systems mean more illegal weapons, more  suicides, more domestic violence murders, but they probably mean higher  profits for the NRA's members.   Let's move on to one last priority of Republicans that is stuck, that  can't move, in the legislative branch: more power and influence for  dark money political groups.   No Member of the Senate who wants to run for reelection in this body  would ever introduce a piece of legislation allowing anonymous  billionaire donors to gain more influence over the political process.  That would be career suicide. No one in America supports that. But  these dark money groups are a boon for Republicans because most of the  billion-dollar interests that want to influence elections--like the oil  and gas industry, for instance--support Republican candidates.   Once again, the Supreme Court becomes that back door to get rules put  in place that advance a Republican political interest that could never  get enacted by Congress. Amy Coney Barrett will join five other  Justices who will all likely rule that most regulations of campaign  finance laws, like our Federal and State laws restricting the size of  donations to campaigns, are constitutionally invalid.   The Court has already ruled that the Constitution protects a  corporation's right to spend limitless amounts of political money. That  is just the beginning. Billionaires want all of our campaign finance  laws eviscerated, and that new radical, out-of-the-box thinking on the  First Amendment suggests that day is coming if Amy Coney Barrett does  what is expected of her and joins other ultraconservatives on the Court  to strike down our remaining campaign finance laws.   Here, Sir, People Govern. That is what the inscription says on the  walls of the U.S. Capitol. It used to be true. Now the inscription  should probably read ``Here, Sir, People Confirm'' because now, with an  activist, rule-setting, norm-busting Supreme Court, there is really no  need for Republicans to pass laws anymore. The Coney Barrett Court will  do all the lawmaking Republican interests require. And, frankly, if  Democrats win this November, that same Coney Barrett Court will just  invalidate any attempts that Congress tries to make to expand the  Affordable Care Act or pass universal background checks or protect  voters' access to the polls.   I get it. I know it feels weird to hear somebody like me describing  Amy Coney Barrett as extreme because she doesn't look extreme; she  doesn't talk in extreme tones. But, really, look at what she stands  for: the elimination of the Affordable Care Act, the right of felons to  own guns, the interpretation of a Constitution to allow for the flood  of billionaire money into politics. Those are extreme views. Do you  know why I know that? Because none of that--the repeal of the ACA, the  invalidation of our background checks system, the erosion of campaign  finance laws--none of that could pass Congress even when the most  partisan Republicans were in charge of all of the relevant lawmaking  institutions here. That agenda was so unpopular, so marginal, that even  a Republican Congress and a Republican President wouldn't touch it in  the end.   But over there at the Supreme Court, that is now the place where  people will govern after Amy Coney Barrett is rammed through in the  quickest confirmation process in modern history, an abomination of a  process that makes a mockery of the Senate and the Constitution. Over  there, that will become the new power in American democracy, and we are  all worse off for it.   I will oppose Amy Coney Barrett's nomination.   I yield the floor.
