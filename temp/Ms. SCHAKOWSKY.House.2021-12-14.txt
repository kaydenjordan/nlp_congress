 Madam Speaker, I rise as a proud colead of the  Combating International Islamophobia Act.   In the United States alone, nearly 70 percent of American Muslims  have reported personally experiencing anti-Muslim hate, bigotry, and  even violence. This anti-Muslim hate isn't just confined to certain  communities and areas of this country. It has reached out in ugly ways,  including in my own community, in my own district, to a member of my  staff and her family.   My colleagues and friends in Congress know that Congresswoman Ilhan  Omar, the chief sponsor of this legislation, knows all about this in  far too personal a way. She has been subjected to relentless attacks  and horrifying threats, not just from her fellow Americans, but even  within the Halls of Congress. Enough is enough.   This should not be a controversial bill. We have had a special envoy  to monitor and combat anti-Semitism for years, and I proudly support  that office's work. As a Jew myself, I see the parallel quite directly  between anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, and we need to be combating  both.   As a Nation that prides itself on defending human rights and standing  up against hate and bigotry, creating a special envoy to monitor and  combat Islamophobia makes perfect sense.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to do what is right, which is to vote ``yes'' on the Combating  International Islamophobia Act.
