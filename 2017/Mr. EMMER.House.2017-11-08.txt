 Mr. Speaker, obtaining accessible and reliable forms of  capital is one of the biggest challenges that small businesses and  entrepreneurs face today. I will say that again. We are not talking  about large corporations. We are talking about small businesses and  entrepreneurs.   According to the 2016 Year-End Economic Report from the National  Small Business Association, 41 percent of all small businesses surveyed  said that ``lack of capital is hindering their ability to grow their  business or expand their operations, and 20 percent said they had to  reduce the number of employees as a result of tight credit.''   That is why I introduced the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act. This  bill does not create a new securities registration exemption under the  Securities Act; rather, it defines what constitutes a permissible  nonpublic offering, and it provides small businesses with the clarity  and confidence to know that their offering is not a violation of the  Securities Act.   If enacted, this will make it easier for entrepreneurs and small  businesses--again, not large corporations--to raise money from family,  friends, and their personal network without running afoul of the vague  and undefined private offering safe harbor provisions in the Securities  Act of 1933.   More specifically, this legislation requires the following three  criteria be met simultaneously in order to trigger a safe harbor  exemption for a security offering: each purchaser must have a  substantive preexisting relationship with an owner; there can be no  more than 35 purchasers of securities from the issuer that are sold in  reliance on the exemption during the 12-month period preceding; and,  lastly, the aggregate amount of all securities sold by the issuer  cannot exceed $500,000 during the 12 months preceding the offering.   The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act helps bring clarity to existing  law so that our current and future job creators can easily raise  capital within the confines of an easy-to-understand provision without  the help of an ever increasingly expensive expert.                                time  1245    Furthermore, the legislation preserves all Federal and State  antifraud protections. Ultimately, this bill will scale existing  Federal rules and regulatory compliance for small businesses, thus  providing another practical option for entrepreneurs to raise the  capital they need to start and grow their business.   The timing for this legislation could not be better, as the House  continues to promote job creation and economic growth through this  once-in-a-generation effort to reform our Tax Code.   As our small businesses and startups continue to provide for over  half of all current jobs and over 65 percent of all net new jobs since  the 1970s, we must provide the tools they need to succeed, and this  legislation does just that.   I thank Chairman Hensarling, Chairman Sessions, and Chairman Huizenga  for working to bring this important bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the previous question,  adopt the rule for H.R. 2201, and vote in favor of the Micro Offering  Safe Harbor Act when it comes to the floor for consideration.
