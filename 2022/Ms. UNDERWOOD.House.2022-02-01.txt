 Mr. Speaker, climate change presents an existential  [[Page H312]]  threat to our environment, our economy, and our future. That is one of  the reasons I was so proud to support the bipartisan infrastructure  law, a generational investment in clean energy jobs and technology,  like solar.   This investment is critical for the communities I represent, which  are already working to advance clean energy technologies at home in  Illinois. Just last week Mundelein, Illinois, was awarded the  Department of Energy's SolSmart Silver award for making it faster,  easier, and more affordable for communities to utilize solar energy.   We owe it to our families, communities, and future generations to  create climate change solutions. Thanks to the bipartisan  infrastructure law, that is exactly what we are doing.                            ____________________
