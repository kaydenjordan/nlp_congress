 Madam Speaker, Americans from all walks of life suffer  because of rising healthcare costs. It is a problem that impacts  everyone. H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act starts addressing  this.   This bill fosters competition, lowers the cost of medication, and  spurs innovation, allowing more generic drugs to come into the market.  One way it does this is by preventing drug companies from unfairly  keeping generic equivalents from people who need them.   H.R. 19 also caps prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries  and includes a smoothing out mechanism allowing seniors to distribute  their out-of-pocket expenses throughout the year. That is why I  cosponsored H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, to take the first  step towards making healthcare affordable. It includes nearly 50  reforms supported by both parties, and it provides real healthcare  solutions.   Madam Speaker, I urge Speaker Pelosi to bring this bill to a vote,  and I urge my colleagues to support it.                            ____________________
