 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from South Carolina, the Honorable Ralph Norman, be permitted to take  the oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.   The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from  South Carolina?   There was no objection.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege, as dean of the South  Carolina delegation, to introduce to this Chamber Representative Ralph  Norman.   Mr. Norman is from Rock Hill in York County, South Carolina. He is a  real estate developer, a graduate of Presbyterian College, and  previously served in the South Carolina Legislature. He and his wife,  Elaine Rice Norman, have four children: Warren III, Caroline, Anne, and  Mary Catherine.   Last Tuesday, June 20, Mr. Norman won the special election in South  Carolina's Fifth District to fill the vacancy created when former  Congressman Mick Mulvaney became Director of the Office of Management  and Budget.   Now it is my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Wilson), representing the Second Congressional District, for  further introduction.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor  tonight to be here with Congressman Clyburn on a very extraordinary  evening. To me, it is a dream come true.   Eleven days ago, I had the opportunity--my wife, Roxanne, and I--to  campaign across the Fifth Congressional District by bus. As we traveled  the district with Ralph and Elaine Norman, I found out that his  business background gives him the basis to understand how to create  jobs. I saw his affection for our veterans and his understanding of the  importance of a strong national defense. In particular, with Shaw Air  Force Base in the district, he understands a strong national defense.   It was so inspiring, also, to be with their four grown children who  are each successful. And he has a real interest to be successful  because he has 15 grandchildren. What an achievement. Members  understand this is really important.   For the past 7 years, I am really grateful that he has been a floor  leader for Governor Nikki Haley, now our Ambassador to the United  Nations, where he has been a floor leader for limited government and  expanded freedom.   It is with great honor I introduce to you Congressman Ralph Norman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).
