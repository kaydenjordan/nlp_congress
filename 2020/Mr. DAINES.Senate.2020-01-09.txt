 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Tim McAllister, a 96-year-old veteran who served in World  War II. Tim is currently the oldest veteran living in Judith Basin  County.   Tim is a humble man who speaks quietly about his military service. In  fact, he spends more time reflecting on the service of his two  brothers, both of whom were soldiers in the D-Day invasion at Normandy.  Tim's military service took him to the South Pacific, where he was  engaged in the liberation of the Philippines with the American Division  in the region of Cebu City.   Tim's impact on the community is pronounced. This past November, Tim  wasn't able to attend the Veterans Day celebration at the local  elementary school, and his presence was missed. Because of his absence,  students in first and second grade at the school made a massive card to  thank him for his service and delivered it to his home. This small act  of kindness was very meaningful to Tim.   Tim's roots in Montana run strong and deep. His father rode the range  with the legendary Charlie M. Russell. Tim carried on those western  values from his father and developed a love for ranching and horses.  Tim truly understands and loves the Montana way of life.   I am proud of Tim for his service to our country and his tremendous  impact on his community. I am confident his legacy of service will live  on for generations to come, and I am honored to recognize him  today.                            ____________________
