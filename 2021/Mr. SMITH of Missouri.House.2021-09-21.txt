 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma for yielding.   For months, Democrats have been pursuing a radical partisan agenda  that will pile on trillions to our debt, and we are here today where  they are asking Republicans to basically help them get a loan.   They are pushing the most expensive piece of legislation in the  history of the United States with the largest tax increase in the  history of the United States. And yet Democrats are demanding we hold  the door open so that they can ram through this partisan reckless  agenda.   The debt limit is a chance for Congress to address government  spending, something we have done since 1985.   Sadly, today, the Democrats are playing chicken with a government  shutdown by tying the debt ceiling to a CR so they can enact their  multi-trillion-dollar partisan tax and spending plan, which currently  clocks in at $4.3 trillion, no matter the harm it will do, no matter  how it will fuel more inflation that is crippling family budgets.   Budget Republicans sent a letter to Congressional leaders back in  July outlining over half a dozen approaches Congress has taken in the  past to address government spending with a debt limit increase.   But they have ignored all of our suggestions, because the fact of the  matter is my colleagues have one goal in mind, an agenda of more  spending, more debt, and more taxes on working-class Americans.   Democrats control the White House, they control the Senate, and they  control the House. If they want to spend trillions of Americans' tax  dollars, they can stand alone and ask for that loan.   But Republicans will not cosign a loan for the Democrats' reckless  agenda that harms working families, fuels more record inflation, and  rewards their political allies and donors.
