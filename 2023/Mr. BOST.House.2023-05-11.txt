 Mr. Speaker, just last month, I went to the Del Rio sector  of  [[Page H2276]]  the U.S.-Mexican border to visit with our dedicated Border Patrol  agents. Over 15,000 frontline Border Patrol agents are veterans serving  their country and communities again, working to keep America safe.   However, our Commander in Chief has failed to give them the resources  and structure they need to effectively do their jobs.   They are pulling drowning children out of the river. They are finding  bodies left behind that were being smuggled across and thrown into the  bushes.   Mr. Speaker, these agents are fighting a new battle back at home, as  well. The mental strain on them as a result of President Biden's open  border policies cannot be ignored, so much so that the VA actually had  to deploy a mobile veteran center to the border to offer mental health  services to our veterans and even our non-veteran border agents who are  there.   Mr. Speaker, I heard it firsthand from the brave men and women that  need this bill. Securing our borders shouldn't be a Republican or a  Democratic issue. The people who suffer the most when we make doing so  hyperpolitical are the veteran law enforcement officers who are simply  trying to do their jobs. That is a disservice to them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.  It is vitally important. I have looked them in the eye, and I would  advise anyone on the other side of the aisle or on my side of the aisle  that has not went down and looked them in the eye, you will know what  they are suffering through because we are not doing our job and the  administration is not doing theirs.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I encourage the support of this bill.
