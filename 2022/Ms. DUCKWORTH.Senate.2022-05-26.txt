 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  the remarkable life of Brian Dennis Balbuena, a devoted son, brother,  and friend who passed away on April 3, 2022, after a hard-fought battle  with brain cancer.   Born March 14, 1983, Brian used his time on earth to bring joy and  light into the hearts of others. Having battled and beat cancer at the  age of 5, Brian enjoyed finding new ways to ``Pay it Forward'' to those  around him. Brian will be remembered by his family and friends as a  loving and compassionate person who had a contagious smile and a  presence that brightened any room he entered.   He leaves behind his incredible parents, Tina and Mark, his siblings,  Amber and Dustin, and a host of nieces and nephews. May his legacy and  kind spirit serve as an inspiration to us all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the  remarkable life of retired Colonel Louis (Lou) Lee Myers, Jr., a 38- year veteran of the Illinois Army National Guard who passed away on May  10, 2022.   Colonel Myers started his career in 1948 when he joined the Illinois  Army National Guard, first serving in an ordnance company and later in  a field artillery unit, a part of the Illinois' 44th Infantry Division.  In 1970, Colonel Myers moved to Springfield to work for the Military  and Naval Department, Facilities Division. During this time, Colonel  Myers began a program to rehabilitate the old armories and facilities  of the State and shortly after became the chief of facilities before  rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He attended the Command and  General Staff School and was promoted to colonel, Chief of Staff of the  Illinois Army National Guard.   After his retirement in 1986, Colonel Myers continued to serve those  around him as a life member of the Reserve Officer's Association,  volunteer for the ombudsman for the Department of Defense, Support of  the Guard and Reserve Committee, and a very active member in his  church--Petersburg United Methodist Church. In 2018, Colonel Myer was  recognized as one of the top 200 veterans in Illinois for the State's  200th birthday.  [[Page S2749]]    He leaves behind his devoted wife Paula; three daughters, Lea Ann,  Ellyn, and Kate; and four sons, Larry, Donald, Joel, and Richard. May  his legacy of service and kind spirit serve as an inspiration to us  all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  the remarkable life of Retired Colonel James A. Smith, Jr., a 31 year  veteran of the Illinois Army National Guard who passed away on May 11,  2022.   Colonel Smith started his career in 1977 as an enlisted soldier,  commissioning in 1982 through the Illinois Army National Guard's  Officer Candidate School. He served in various staff and leadership  positions throughout his career in the Illinois National Guard.   In 2003, Colonel Smith was appointed as the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Personnel (G-1). In this role, he played an integral role in preparing  Illinois Army National Guard units for deployment to Iraq and then  Afghanistan. In 2008, before his retirement, he was appointed as the  Illinois Army National Guard chief of staff before being appointed the  Illinois Department of Military Affairs chief of staff that same year.   As the IDMA chief of staff, Colonel Smith supported multiple Illinois  National Guard deployments, the Illinois National Guard's response to  floods, hurricanes, and wildfires, the 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago, and  most recently, the Illinois National Guard's COVID-19 response, as well  as law enforcement support missions.   Colonel Smith was proud of being an infantry officer, a devout  Catholic, and an unwavering Cardinals fan. He was a strong advocate for  Lincoln's Challenge Academy and its cadets, the Illinois Military  Family Relief Fund, the Illinois State Military Museum, the National  Guard Association of Illinois, and, most of all, the soldiers and  airmen of the Illinois National Guard and their families.   Colonel Jim Smith's voice will not be heard again in the Illinois  National Guard's buildings or training areas, but his spirit will  remain within this organization for many generations to come. He leaves  behind his wife Nilsa and their son Sam. May his legacy of service and  kind spirit serve as an inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
