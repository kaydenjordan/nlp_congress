 Mr. Speaker, today, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already  having an incredibly positive impact on our economy. Hundreds of  companies have already offered billions in bonuses and raises for their  employees, far from the crumbs predicted by some of my colleagues, or  the predicted Armageddon.   The best part is, this is just the beginning, as the law won't even  take full effect until next year, when we retire much of the current  tax calculation process and the burdens of it. That is when taxpayers  will notice the biggest difference when filing their tax returns.   Despite these early positive signs, some individuals claim people  should still pay more in taxes. They also think they themselves should  pay more, like our friend Bill Gates. He says: ``I need to pay higher  taxes. I've paid more taxes, over $10 billion, than anyone else, but  the government should require the people in my position to pay  significantly higher taxes.'' Interesting.   Not to be outdone, Mr. Gates' fellow billionaire buddy and Berkshire  Hathaway CEO, Warren Buffett, has offered similar ideas about the need  for people like himself to pay more in taxes. Fine. But the amount of  financial security established by people like this is obviously far  from mainstream Americans and what they earn themselves.   Before they amassed their current fortunes, were they as considerably  outspoken on the need for progressive taxation, long before  establishing themselves as some of the richest men in the world?   I don't think so. Indeed, these days, much of their funds are stashed  away in foundations and not voluntarily paid forward as taxes to the  U.S. Government. I find that interesting. In short, no amount of  taxation would truly impact their lives as it would for mainstream,  middle-income Americans. It does impact everyone else.   What is more, I do hear some people in the mainstream who are middle- income folks saying they wouldn't mind paying more in taxes for this or  that. What I don't get is why they demand that their neighbor does so,  too.   In America, many middle-income families enjoying lower rates question  how well their government is spending and managing what they tax them  for now. For them, the government report card isn't so good. They don't  wish to entrust government with more of their earnings and more of the  hard work from the sweat of their brow to an inefficient bureaucracy,  even if their neighbors demand that they do, or that the government  demands it of them by its power of taxation.    So what I am proposing is a bill with my colleague, Majority Whip   Steve Scalise, called the Donate Extra Money Against National Debt Act,  or the DEMAND Act, for those who demand to pay more. This bill will  allow those who want to pay more than required to simply check a box on  their tax return and donate as much money to the Treasury as they would  like.   Our bill would add to the 1040 tax form a check box and a line  stating: By checking here, I signify that in addition to my tax  liability, I would like to donate the included payment to be used  exclusively for the purpose of paying down the national debt.   Before, there was no simple or obvious way to accomplish this. This  makes it easy and obvious in how to do so. This way, anyone who feels  the need to pay more in taxes has an easy way to do so. For millions of  other hardworking Americans and business owners who suffered under our  previous Tax Code and tax law, they will not be forced to do so under  that Code any longer.   This bill, indeed, is one of those rare win-wins. Bill Gates and  Warren Buffett or anyone who feels they are not paying enough can  donate as much money to the Treasury as they would like, while everyday  American businesses will thrive in a probusiness and progrowth climate,  all this without Congress demanding more or people haranguing their  neighbors.   After all, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already working. U.S.  companies are already paying out more than $4 billion  [[Page H3457]]  in bonuses, while over 4 million American workers have already received  a pay raise, bonus, or other financial investment. Even Warren Buffett  recently referred to the new law as being a ``huge tailwind'' for  American businesses.                                time  1215    As much as Senator Schumer or Minority Leader Pelosi would like to  trumpet tax reform as unpopular, bad for the economy, Armageddon, or  just crumbs for people, they are missing the point. Tax reform grows  more popular each day, especially as more and more Americans see more  in their paychecks and begin to realize how they stand to benefit under  this new law, especially when the full extent of the law has not yet  been felt until next year.   Instead of taking away those savings and benefits, the majority whip  and I are giving the people who feel so strongly the option to help pay  down the deficit on their own accord voluntarily. I applaud the  philanthropic work of Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett, and others, but the  DEMAND Act doesn't force anyone to do anything; it allows certain  individuals who demand to pay more in taxes to put their money where  their mouth is.   Indeed, Senator Biden, a few years ago, said paying taxes is  patriotic, so let those who demand to pay more, who want to pay more,  lead the way in the new patriotism.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  passing of Harold K. Graves, Jr.   A native of Kentucky, Harold later lived in Oklahoma, moved to  California at a very young age, and eventually to Nevada County.   Throughout his life, he developed a reputation for being a natural  born leader, whether it was as a young man leading his fellow mates in  the neighborhood at playtime or carrying on through his service in  Vietnam and in civilian life. He went through basic training at Fort  Ord, California, was chosen for Officer Candidate School in Georgia,  and then went on to Ranger School.   First Lieutenant Graves received many distinguished awards for his  heroism in combat, including the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple  Heart, and many more. He was a special assistant to a general for a  time. When he learned after one day that one of his duties was setting  out nametags for dinner, he requested to move on to a different type of  tougher duty. That was his leadership. That was Harold.   Back home, Harold quickly became a leader in his community as well.  He served as president of many community organizations, including the  local chamber and Rotary. With his Hollywood actor looks, he charmed  many, including his beautiful wife, Patricia. They went on to have two  beautiful daughters, Jennifer and Kerry, and four wonderful  grandchildren.   In his service to Nevada City and Nevada County, Harold was president  of the local Vietnam Veterans of America chapter and became an honorary  member of the Blue Knights Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club.   I was proud to have known him. Even in hard times, such as after he  laid the motorcycle over, he still had that charm and presence even  when he was recovering.   We will miss him. He was a great asset to our community and to the  United States, as well as his family. God bless him and his family.                            ____________________
