 Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues  in opposing the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett as Justice of  the Supreme Court. This is the wrong time to be choosing a Supreme  Court Justice, and Justice Barrett is the wrong candidate for a seat on  that Court.   The timing of tonight's confirmation vote is shocking. The majority  of Americans want to be able to weigh in on who should sit in Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat on the highest Court in the land. They want  to vote to choose a President to fill that vacancy.   We are 8 days away from Americans casting their final votes in the  2020 election. Over 58 million Americans have already voted, including  more than 649,000 Nevadans. The American people are making their voices  heard in response to this administration's disastrous handling of the  coronavirus pandemic, which has led to the loss of 225,000 American  lives, including 1,748 Nevadans, and sickened over 95,000 Nevadans.   In the middle of this crisis, Congress should be doing everything it  can to address the needs of the American people. Instead, the Senate  majority leader is ramming through a nominee at breakneck pace. He and  the President are rushing this nominee's confirmation for a reason,  which is because they believe, based on Judge Barrett's own public  statements, that she will be the decisive vote to overturn the  Affordable Care Act in a case that will be heard just a week after the  election.   On November 10, the Supreme Court will listen to arguments from  lawyers in a court case about whether the Affordable Care Act is  constitutional. Majority Leader McConnell and the President want a  Justice who shares their views on the Affordable Care Act seated on the  Court by that date.   Amy Coney Barrett's record on the ACA, not to mention her stance on  the rights for women and the LGBTQ Americans that you have heard from  my colleagues today and you will hear throughout the night, but her  record on the ACA poses tremendous risk to Nevadans at a time when they  need every help we can extend to them during this health pandemic.   That is why I opposed her nomination to the Seventh Circuit Court of  Appeals back in 2017, and that is why I oppose her confirmation to the  Supreme Court today. Instead of rushing her through in a partisan  fashion to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, we should be working  together to get the additional coronavirus relief that Nevadans and  Americans so badly need right now.   Most of us here in the Senate understand that the American people  need help to cope with the pandemic. To save lives and to stop the  spread of the virus, people have to wear masks, they wash their hands,  and they socially distance. That has meant that businesses haven't been  able to operate as usual.   Some companies have been able to rethink their business models and  thrive, but others just can't substitute online interactions for in- person contact. That includes Nevada's world-class travel, tourism, and  hospitality industry.   During April, Nevada had the highest unemployment rate ever recorded  anywhere in the country at 30 percent. We are recovering from that peak  more slowly than other States, and we still have one of the highest  unemployment rates in the country. In August, second only to Hawaii's,  it was 12.6 percent. Nevadans are hurting. Nevadans are hurting,  Americans are hurting, and my constituents tell me about it all the  time, and the data is clear what I see in Nevada. One in seven Nevadans  say they aren't getting enough to eat, and one in five Nevadans say the  children in their household are underfed.   There has been a 14-percent increase in those receiving SNAP benefits  in the Silver State since February. There are 14 percent of Nevadans  who say they are behind on rent or mortgage, and 38 percent are having  difficulty with household expenses. There are 110,000 households in my  home State that could be at risk of eviction by January.   That is why I have spent weeks calling on Leader McConnell to extend  and expand upon the support that we put in place in the relief  legislation that we passed in the first half of this year.  Unfortunately, instead of negotiating another COVID relief package,  Leader McConnell would rather play politics.   Nevadans need to understand the partisan political games that are  being  [[Page S6508]]  played right now. Over the last 7 months, Senator McConnell has refused  to come to the table to even negotiate with the administration, with  Speaker Pelosi, and Leader Schumer.   Now, Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer originally asked for  $3.4 trillion in a new stimulus package. They have since come down to  request for $2.2 trillion in relief. That is a decrease of $1.2  trillion from their original position. In return, as they have been  negotiating with the administration, President Trump and Secretary  Mnuchin have offered $1.8 trillion in coronavirus relief. Clearly,  Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Mnuchin have been working to get closer to  an agreement over the amount and structure of the next needed  comprehensive COVID stimulus package.   Meanwhile, while that negotiation is going on, Senator McConnell is  not even at the table. He refuses to even negotiate with the Democrats.  Just this week, last week, he has forced two votes on the floor of the  Senate on relief packages that were crafted behind closed doors with no  bipartisan negotiation, and the second package was half the price of  the one before. That is not a negotiation. That is politics. Senator  McConnell doesn't want to deal. He hasn't participated in the talks,  and he is proposing less than a third of what even the Secretary of the  Treasury thinks we need.   Instead, the majority leader has been laser-focused on one thing and  one thing only, rushing through the Supreme Court nomination for Judge  Amy Coney Barrett. There is a reason he is pushing so hard. He and  others in the GOP have been obsessed with getting rid of the Affordable  Care Act since it passed, and in Amy Coney Barrett, they see their  chance to finally do just that.   Now, I want Nevadans to understand exactly what is at stake and how  we got here. Let me lay out the timeline of just some of the dozens of  Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act and how Judge Barrett  fits into their larger plan to overturn healthcare protections.   In 2010, the Obama administration passed the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act, the ACA, to bring down healthcare costs and make  sure that Americans had access to quality healthcare. Now, Republicans  have been trying to repeal it ever since, voting at least 70 times--70  times--to undo the law in Congress. When they failed in Congress, they  attempted in the courts.   Republicans have repeatedly used the courts to challenge Congress's  power to enact the ACA. Their first attempt ended in failure in 2012  when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the important provisions of the ACA  in an opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts in the landmark case,  NFIB v. Sebelius, but that has not stopped the Republican leadership.   Even though a majority of the American people have made it clear over  and over that they want the ACA and its extensive protections for  healthcare, this administration and Mitch McConnell have been stacking  the court with Federal judges they believe would overturn the ACA, and  Professor Barrett fits their profile.   In 2017, Professor Amy Coney Barrett wrote a book review article for  Notre Dame Law School making it clear at the time in that book review  that she thought Justice Roberts incorrectly decided NFIB v. Sebelius.  She said that Chief Justice John Roberts ``pushed the Affordable Care  Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.'' Conservatives  who agreed with her, well, they took notice, because in May of that  same year, 2017, they nominated her to serve as a judge on the Seventh  Circuit Court of Appeals--go from professor to a judge of the Seventh  Circuit Court of Appeals   Now, while her nomination was pending in 2017, in July, the  Republican leaders in the Senate again tried to force a vote to repeal  the Affordable Care Act, and during that vote, the late Senator John  McCain gave his famous thumbs down to show that he would not be  responsible for repealing the ACA and ripping healthcare away from  millions of Americans.   Well, a couple of months later, October 2017, Amy Coney Barrett was  appointed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. I opposed her then  for the same reasons that I oppose her nomination today. One month  later, in November, she is then placed on President Trump's list of  potential nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court. She just got to the  circuit court. A month later, she is now on President Trump's list. Why  is she on that list? Because she made it very clear in her writings  that she was opposed to the Affordable Care Act.   Then 3 months later, in December of 2017, the Republicans in Congress  passed a bill that would continue their attempts to sabotage the ACA.  What they couldn't get done, because Senator John McCain and several  others stopped him, they continued to sabotage it, so they passed a  law. Based on this new law, several Republican attorneys general then  went to Court asking the Court to rule the ACA unconstitutional. That  case is California v. Texas, and it will be argued this year, November  10, just 2 weeks from now.   So their pathway has been consistent; I give them credit for that.  The Republicans have been consistent in wanting to do away with the  Affordable Care Act. They have either tried it here in Congress, or  they are continuing to work the courts, and if they can't win in the  courts, then let's put judges on the Federal benches that we know will  support our position, and that is what you have happening. That is why  this is being rushed through now, because they need Amy Coney Barrett  on the bench when that case is heard November 10 to determine the  constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.   Let me tell you, the U.S. Department of Justice has done everything  it can to assist their efforts to strike down the ACA. They filed a  brief. The U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of President Trump's  administration, have filed a brief arguing that the entire law is  invalid in support of those Republican attorneys general who want to do  away with the Affordable Care Act. They have done this because the  President wants them to.   In an interview with ``60 Minutes'' that aired just this evening, the  President said that with regard to the Supreme Court's decision on the  Affordable Care Act, ``I hope that they end it.''   That is not the only time. It is not a secret. President Trump wants  to do away with healthcare coverage and patient protections in the  middle of a pandemic that has killed 225,000 Americans, and he has been  very clear about it. I mean, look back. June 26, 2015:         If I win the Presidency--    When he was a candidate.       --my judicial appointments will do the right thing, unlike       Bush's appointee, John Roberts, on ObamaCare.    February 8, 2016:         I am disappointed--    This is President Trump.       --I am disappointed in Chief Justice Roberts because he gave       us ObamaCare. He had two chances to end ObamaCare, and he       should have ended it by every single measurement, and he       didn't do it, so that was a disappointing one.    May 7, 2020, President Trump reiterated his position:         We want to terminate healthcare under ObamaCare, and       ObamaCare is a disaster.    September 27, 2020, shortly after Barrett's nomination to the Supreme  Court, President Trump tweeted:         ObamaCare will be replaced with a much better and far       cheaper alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court.       It would be a big win for the USA.    So, 4 years, at least, while I have been here, Republicans have been  trying to repeal it, and this administration has been promising a  replacement for healthcare in this country if the Affordable Care Act  is repealed, but we see no replacement. We know that they have been  putting judges on the Federal courts that will do their bidding--or at  least think that they will do their bidding.   Now, let me give Judge Amy Coney Barrett credit because here is the  thing: As an attorney, I respect judges, and I am always looking for a  judge--a mainstream judge--who is going to weigh the evidence and the  facts, look at the precedent, and make a decision that is on behalf of  this country and the American people. So it is fair, though, without  knowing her background, to judge which way she is going to rule and if  she has an inherent bias based on her writings. That is what we do all  the time.   What are her writings? Whether it is in private life as a professor  or as an  [[Page S6509]]  attorney practicing law or as a judge in her written opinions, that is  fair game. That will give us insight, because we can't see into  somebody's mind and what they are thinking. That will give us insight  on their legal analysis.   We know what she said at the hearing. There is two hearings: One is  the Seventh Circuit, and one is U.S. Supreme Court. I will say, in her  confirmation hearings, Judge Barrett has said:         I am not hostile to the ACA at all.    But this statement contradicts the thing she said about the ACA  before her nomination to the court.   I believe now what I believed in 2017, Judge Barrett's writing showed  her to be clearly opposed to the ACA. My view is that no one--no one-- not even a judge, should weaken those protections for healthcare in  this country during a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic.   The Affordable Care Act is a crucial part of the Nation's response to  coronavirus. Without it, insurance companies would be able to charge  more or even deny insurance to people with preexisting conditions. That  includes more than 95,000 Nevadans who have had COVID-19 to date  because contracting that coronavirus is a preexisting condition. It  includes another 1.2 million Nevadans with other preexisting conditions  from asthma to cystic fibrosis to depression.   Without the ACA, insurance companies would also be able to consider  pregnancy a preexisting condition as they used to. The 1.5 million  women in Nevada could be charged more for their care than men, and  lifetime and annual benefit caps could be reinstated.   If the Affordable Care Act is repealed or found unconstitutional,  insurance companies would be able to kick children off their parents'  insurance before the age of 26. Across the country, without the ACA,  more than 20 million people would lose their health coverage, and over  135 million Americans would lose protections for their preexisting  conditions. If the Supreme Court eliminates the ACA, millions of newly  uninsured people will be unable to afford coronavirus treatment.   If you don't have insurance and you contract COVID-19, you are  looking at tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills. Let me tell  you, this is especially alarming because COVID-19 has hit communities  of color the hardest, including in my State. In Nevada, a third of our  population are Latino; with another 10 percent of the population  African-American; and 9 percent, fastest growing Asian-American/Pacific  Islander; 2 percent, Native-American.   Among COVID-19 cases, however, these numbers are practically turned  upside down. Forty-five percent of Nevada's COVID-19 cases are among  Latinos who make up 29 percent of the population. And 29 percent of the  cases are among White Nevadans who are 45 percent of the population.  Nevadans of color are also overrepresented in the numbers of those who  have lost their lives during this pandemic. In Nevada, 12 percent of  those who have died of COVID-19 are African-American and another 12  percent are Asian-American/Pacific Islander.   We also know from national data that COVID-19 has particularly  devastating effects on children of color. Of those under 21 who have  been killed by the coronavirus, more than 75 percent have been  Hispanic, Black, or Native American. In addition, the coronavirus  pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on pregnant women of color  and their babies.   Nationwide, Latino mothers make up nearly half of the coronavirus  cases among pregnant women, according to the CDC data through August.   Young people and communities of color are also seeing the greatest  economic impact as a result of this pandemic. They are losing jobs and  healthcare at higher rates. A recent study suggested that job losses  would mean that 5 million Black, Latino, and Asian Americans would lose  healthcare during the pandemic.   People in these communities don't always have the financial reserves  to keep a roof over their heads, let alone access to critical,  physical, and mental healthcare. Repealing the ACA would just further  jeopardize these Americans, including millions in my home State and  across this country.   And without the ACA protections, women in Nevada would also see  adverse impacts on their health. That is because the ACA requires  insurance plans to offer women essential benefits, like annual wellness  examines, preventive mammograms and other screenings, maternity care,  and access to free birth control. If the law is struck down, these  benefits would go too.   In fact, Judge Barrett publicly signed a statement of protest against  the ACA contraceptive coverage requirements. She said that those  requirements were ``an assault on religious liberty when applied to  religious employers and institutions.''   But that is just the first part of the danger that Judge Barrett  represents to women's healthcare. She puts reproductive health rights  at risk across the board.   In 2006, Judge Barrett signed a letter that called for ``an end to  the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.''   As a judge, she has repeatedly voted to rehear cases that struck down  unconstitutional abortion restrictions.   During her confirmation hearing, she refused to describe Roe v. Wade  as a superprecedent that could no longer be challenged. These views  suggest--her written views and comments--that as she predicted in a  2016 speech, a Trump nominee to the Supreme Court would mean that the  restrictions on abortion would change and that the Court would likely  increase how much freedoms States have in regulating abortion, and if  those States have more freedom to regulate abortion, it will lead to a  patchwork of different laws in different States.   A recent study suggests that if Roe v. Wade were overturned, the  closest abortion clinic would close for 41 percent of women across the  country, and the distance to the nearest clinic would increase from an  average of 36 miles to an average of 280 miles.   In 2020, American women shouldn't have to choose what State to live  in based on what kind of healthcare they think that they can get. These  are fundamental rights that shouldn't be up for grabs.   More than 80 percent of Nevadans believe that women should control  their own reproductive choices, and I stand with them.   I am also concerned about the impact that Judge Barrett would have on  LGBTQ Nevadans if she is confirmed to the Court. The ACA contains  specific protections against discrimination based on gender identity.  The Trump administration has already weakened these protections  significantly. If the ACA is struck down altogether, people who don't  conform to gender stereotypes, including transgender Americans, could  face increased discrimination in healthcare.   A study of transgender patients before the ACA went into effect,  found that one in five had experienced discrimination from doctors and  that 28 percent have postponed medical care in the past in order to try  to avoid that discrimination.   Judge Barrett could also pose a considerable threat to the LGBTQ  individuals in other ways. During her confirmation hearings, she  refused to say whether she agreed with a decision in Obergefell v.  Hodges, which established the right to same-sex marriage nationally.   In 2015, she publicly signed a letter stating that marriage is  founded on the indissoluble commitment of a man and a woman. She has  also publicly argued that title IX of the Civil Rights Act does not  apply to transgender Americans, noting that it seems to strain the text  of the statute to say that title IX demands that the government  guarantee transgender bathroom access.   So, again, I am very concerned that if she is confirmed to the Court,  Judge Barrett will be an additional vote to strike down things like  same-sex marriage and imperil the health of LGBTQ Nevadans.   The truth is that Judge Barrett's views on a whole host of issues are  far from mainstream. In her short time in the Seventh Circuit Court of  Appeals, Judge Barrett has sided with corporations over workers and  consumers in a majority of business-related cases, resulting in the  erosion of workers' rights and consumer protection rights. She has  suggested that voting rights should be more easily restricted than the  right to possess firearms. And she has ruled that the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act does not protect job applicants from  hiring practices that harm older Americans.  [[Page S6510]]    Now, I have received over 18,000 letters from Nevadans opposing her  confirmation. That is compared to 3,900 supporting it. So, clearly,  Nevadans are concerned that Judge Barrett doesn't share their views,  and they are right to be concerned.   The Supreme Court makes decisions about so many issues that affect  our communities, and it will be lifelong. People in this country care  deeply about issues, and in so many cases, Judge Barrett's views are  out of step with what large majorities of Americans want.   Seventy-seven percent of Americans think we should stop unlimited  dark money from influencing our politics, but a 6-to-3 conservative  Court would slam the door on campaign finance reform, allowing  corporations and other groups to throw their wealth behind their pet  policies   Americans believe voting should be easy, safe, and secure, and that  you shouldn't have to risk your health during a pandemic to cast your  ballot. But, again, a 6-to-3 conservative Court with Amy Coney Barrett  on the Bench would make it harder for people to vote, especially people  in low-income communities and communities of color. And, again, bear in  mind that we are in the middle of an election.   If she is confirmed tonight, Justice Barrett would also be in a  position to rule on any legal disputes about that election.   That is one of many topics that she simply refused to answer  questions about during her confirmation hearings.   Now, it is understandable for a judge to avoid questions about a case  that may come before her so that she doesn't prejudge the outcome. But  Judge Barrett refused to answer the most basic of questions--questions  that any high school civic student knows the answer to.   She wouldn't say whether the Constitution allows Congress to protect  the right to vote. Answer: It does in at least five separate  provisions.   She wouldn't say whether the President of the United States can delay  the election. Answer: He can't. That is not within his authority.   She wouldn't say whether the President should peacefully transfer  power to the winner of a Presidential election. The most important  American principle is that we the people get to decide who governs it,  but Judge Barrett wouldn't even affirm that.   And she wouldn't say whether voter intimidation or voting twice in an  election is illegal. Well, it is. Those laws are clearly on the books.  It doesn't take a constitutional scholar to interpret them.   People in Nevada and across the Nation need to realize that many of  the rights and protections they enjoy are one vote away from being  ended by the Supreme Court.   There are at least 120 landmark Supreme Court cases from the past  several decades that were 5-to-4 decisions, with Justice Ruth Bader  Ginsburg the deciding vote in the majority and Justice Antonin Scalia,  whose judicial philosophy inspires Judge Barrett, in the minority.  There is every reason to think that Judge Barrett would take positions  like Justice Scalia's in those areas and more.   With Amy Coney Barrett on the Court, Americans' civil rights,  workers' rights, reproductive rights, healthcare, and, yes, their  voting rights are at risk. For all of these reasons, Judge Barrett is  not only the wrong nominee, but she comes at the wrong time.   Now is not the time to rush a nominee onto the Court. Now, as  millions fill out their ballots, is not the time to deprive the  American people of a voice in choosing the next President who will  choose the Supreme Court Justice. Now is not the time for us to focus  on the immediate crisis at hand.   We need to act to save lives and to protect families in Nevada and  across the country. We need that focus now on what our families are  dealing with because of this pandemic. That is why our focus should be  on passing another comprehensive COVID-19 stimulus package.   We need pandemic unemployment insurance for those who have been laid  off or furloughed, through no fault of their own, and subsidized health  coverage for those workers. We need additional funds to address the  health aspects of this pandemic--everything from PPE to COVID-19  testing and tracing, to funding to develop vaccines and treatment. We  need rental and homeowner's insurance to keep people safe in their  homes as winter approaches. Our small businesses need extended PPP so  they can retain staff. And many of our large industries need support as  well.   State, local, and Tribal governments must have assistance so they can  afford to fund EMTs, police, firefighters, and healthcare providers,  not to mention teachers who are reinventing education on the fly.   All of these essential services are keeping our communities safe and  functioning during this crisis.   I can keep going on and on with this list, or I can just simply point  my colleagues to the Heroes Act, which the House passed months ago.   If Senator McConnell really wanted to get meaningful relief passed,  he would do it. We know he can move quickly because we can see that  with this Supreme Court nominee.   If he would just come to the table with Senators from both parties  who are eager to find a compromise to help out their constituents, and  he could make that deal happen, that is what should happen. Instead, he  and the majority in this Chamber have decided to fast-track this  nominee. They have decided the most important thing they can do for  this Nation during a once-in-a-lifetime health crisis is to confirm a  Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court.   The cruelty and blindness to the real needs of Americans is  astounding to me. Instead of working for our constituents, Republican  leadership has focused on a last-minute power grab that threatens  Americans' health. I can't support that.   There is no reason to rush this nominee. There is every reason to act  on a comprehensive COVID-19 relief package. It is what we should have  been doing months ago.   My priority is and will continue to be getting Nevadans comprehensive  and meaningful support that they need right now.   Thank you   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise to recognize a  lifelong Nevadan and a friend to all he knew, Sean Higgins.   Sean was a dedicated member of our community, an unmistakable  presence, and a tireless champion and advocate for our gaming industry  and small businesses in Nevada. He was born in Chicago in 1964, but  raised in Las Vegas, 1 of 10 siblings--5 brothers and 5 sisters. His  father, Dr. Gerald Higgins, was an orthopedic surgeon and doctor for  the Rebels, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas football team. Sean  graduated from Bishop Gorman High School. He left Nevada only briefly  for his education, obtaining a degree in business administration from  Southern Methodist University and a law degree from Santa Clara  University School of Law.   Sean and I grew up in Las Vegas when it was a much smaller town of  330,000 people, so perhaps our paths were always destined to cross. We  met in the 6th grade when we attended Matt Kelly Elementary School  together. Even then, Sean had a presence, with his distinctive voice  and outgoing personality. He was friendly, charming--yes, even at 11  years old--and made you want to hang out with him. And so we did,  spending time at pool parties and dancing to the band ``Hot  Chocolate.'' Over the years our paths diverged, but his focus, like  mine, was on returning to Las Vegas and the State we loved to practice  law.   Sean represented clients both large and small to State gaming  regulators and government bodies across the Silver State. Everyone knew  Sean for his gregarious nature and his booming voice, which made him a  fierce advocate for championing the causes of his clients. He spent 17  years as general counsel of Herbst Gaming, a multijurisdictional casino  operator in Nevada that became Affinity Gaming in 2011, and where his  sister, Mary Beth Higgins, now serves as CEO. He served as executive- vice president of government affairs for Golden Entertainment,  [[Page S6595]]  a casino company and slot machine route operator, and became a partner  at the Gordon Silver Law firm. He became a small business owner  himself, operating a popular gaming pub with two of his brothers and  founding his own law firm, STH Strategies, in 2015.   We reunited in our professional careers in Carson City when I was  working for Governor Miller and he was advocating for taverns and  gaming. The best part, he was still the same Sean Higgins I met in the  6th grade--friendly, charming, and yes, he made you want to hang out  with him. So I did. For the last 20 years as our professional careers  converged, I had the opportunity to watch Sean as he advocated for the  town he loved and the businesses that made us a success, all the while  smoking cigars and enjoying a good meal with the friends he cultivated  along the way.   I will miss my friend, and I am grateful I got to talk with him to  say goodbye, to tell him that I loved him. During our conversation, his  main concern was for his family. Sean loved Lynn and cherished his  children Samantha and Connor. He was so proud of them. I experienced  this firsthand when he came to Washington to visit Connor, who was  working as an intern on the Senate Committee for Environment and Public  Works. In every conversation, Sean would talk about his amazing  children.   I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering my friend and fellow  Nevadan, Sean Higgins, for his advocacy and legal acumen. Sean will not  soon be replaced in the Las Vegas community or in the gaming industry  in Nevada. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife Lynn, his  children Connor and Samantha, and the many friends who knew him  well.                            ____________________
