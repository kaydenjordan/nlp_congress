 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Dakeyan Graham  for being selected as Florida's Teacher of the Year. He was chosen out  of more than 176,000 teachers to receive Florida's highest award for  public educators.   Known affectionately by his students as Dr. Dre, he has long been  driven by music. He played the saxophone in the marching band at King  High School; and he went on to study music education, earning a  bachelor's degree from the University of Florida and a doctorate from  the University of South Florida.   He returned to King High School as an educator where he teaches his  students music in the same room where he learned to play.   He has worked at the school for more than a decade and now serves as  the director of bands and instrumental studies. As part of this award,  Dr. Graham will spend 1 year as an education ambassador where he will  work to raise public awareness of other exceptional teachers, provide  learning opportunities to educators, and recruit future teachers.   Dr. Graham has dedicated his career to serving his students, and this  award shows he sets an example not only to his students but to us all.                            ____________________
