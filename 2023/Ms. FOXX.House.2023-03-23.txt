 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the American Flood  Coalition for 5 years of driving proactive solutions to combat  flooding.   During this time, the American Flood Coalition has brought together  political, military, business, and local civic leaders to build  resilience against stronger storms and more frequent flooding.   In North Carolina's Fifth District, recent tropical storms have  brought inches of rain in only a matter of hours, triggering  destructive floods and landslides. These storms can leave behind  millions of dollars in damages that burden communities for years.   The American Flood Coalition works across all levels of government,  supporting process improvements and projects that directly protect  against such impacts while lifting the experiences and needs of members  to drive transformational adaptation policy at the Federal level.   Congratulations, American Flood Coalition, on 5 years of protecting  our Nation's residents, economy, and military installations from  flooding.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to recognize the profound importance of H.R.  5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and what it means for families  across the country.   Over the past several years, parents witnessed the consequences of  lessons taught in classrooms firsthand. Math scores declined by the  largest margin ever, and reading scores plummeted to the lowest levels  in over three decades. These results are devastating.   Teachers' unions and education bureaucrats worked to push progressive  politics in classrooms while keeping parents in the dark. The Parents  Bill of Rights Act aims to end that and shine a light on what is  happening in schools. This bill will reaffirm a parent's right to  review course curriculum, meet with the child's teacher, and be heard  at school board meetings without fear of reprisal.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem convinced  Republicans are using this bill to punish teachers or push an extreme  rightwing agenda. This is false.   Our education system is spiraling out of control as parents are  pushed further outside the classroom. This bill will restore the role  of parents in schools and provide new mechanisms to promote parent- teacher partnerships.   When parents are involved in their child's education, students  thrive. That is the guiding principle of this bill. With the Parents  Bill of Rights Act, Republicans will help parents steer the education  of their children back onto the correct path where they can learn the  skills they need for a lifetime of success.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Louisiana (Ms. Letlow).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Bean), chair of the Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary  Education Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the chair of the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Miller), who is the vice chair of the Education and  Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mills).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Moran).    Mr. Chairman, here is the truth about this bill. This bill  will not ban any books. I repeat: This bill will not ban any books.   What is dangerous right now is when people misrepresent what is in  legislation before us.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Owens), my distinguished colleague, the chair of the Subcommittee on  Higher Education and Workforce Development.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler) for purposes of a colloquy.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from New York for his  questions.   Mr. Chair, I can confirm that the bill does not require a teacher to  disclose any of the information that the gentleman described.    The bill does not address a student's identity or statements but is  solely focused on notifying parents about actions taken by school  personnel to act on a gender transition, such as changing pronouns or  switching locker rooms.   I would add, despite the claims from my friends on the other side of  the aisle, even The New York Times acknowledged that this is not a  partisan issue, writing in January that, ``Parents of all political  persuasions have found themselves unsettled by what schools know and  don't reveal.''   Our bill enshrines commonsense transparency for parents of children  to reflect these concerns but it does not force any teacher to reveal  private conversations or any information about sexual orientation.   The legislation is also clear that education is largely the  responsibility of the States and any State or local school district  would work with the Department to ensure their compliance with these  provisions without violating student privacy. I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Allen).                                time  1545    Mr. Chair, there is no question that over the past several years, we  have seen parents being denied the right to make decisions about their  children's education. I don't quite understand the argument from the  other side.   The reason I stand before this body today is not because I happen to  be in Washington; it is because I am representing parents in my  district who want to know what their children are being taught and what  they are required to read.   In fact, parents across this country, certain groups, have gone so  far as to label the parents ``domestic terrorists'' just because they  wanted a say in their children's education. That is what we are talking  about today is giving control back to the parents of our children.   This is not the way our education system was created, and it is not  the way it is supposed to work. Allowing families to have a say in  their children's education should not be a controversial subject. I  don't get it.   Parents have a right to know what is being taught to their children,  to give consent for medical evaluations, and to be heard. My goodness,  it is in the top 10: Honor thy father and thy mother.   Unfortunately, we have seen Washington Democrats and outside groups  push to radically reshape our education system by injecting divisive  concepts and curriculum into our schools and classrooms regardless of  whether families approve.   House Republicans are working to fulfill our commitment to America by  building a future that is built on freedom, for crying out loud, a  future where parents' rights are protected and families are given a  seat at the table.   I am calling on all my colleagues to join us in support of H.R. 5,  the Parents Bill of Rights Act.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon  (Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer).   Mrs. CHAVEZ-DeREMER. Mr. Chair, I rise today as a proud mother of  twin daughters.   As a parent, I know moms and dads agree that we all want what is best  for our children. That is one of the reasons why it is so difficult for  us to let our sons and daughters go on their first day of kindergarten.  We have to start placing an enormous amount of trust in our teachers  and administrators to do what is best for our children.   At the end of the day, nobody will understand a child's interests and  needs more than the people who love them most, their parents.   It is easy to understand why parents want to have and deserve to have  the right to know what is going on inside the classroom. It is their  responsibility. That is why we need the Parents Bill of Rights Act to  help students succeed by ensuring every parent can have a voice in  their child's education.   During the committee markup on this bill, I was honored to lead two  proposals that are now included. One will help parents better  understand the priorities of their children's school by bringing much- needed clarity to school budgets. The other sets both parents and  teachers up for success by simplifying the curriculum feedback process.   My proposals build on two of the five core principles of the Parents  Bill of Rights Act: Parents have the right to know what their children  are being taught, and parents have the right to see the school's budget  and spending.   I will always fight to protect parental involvement and to put  parents first. I am proud to support the Parents Bill of Rights Act.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Guest).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, it has been a pleasure to work on the Parents Bill of  Rights Act. While working on this bill, I have heard from parents'  groups who offered their support. I would like to mention what just a  few of them said.   The Independent Women's Voice wrote: ``The Parents Bill of Rights Act  acknowledges parents' fundamental right to make decisions for their  children.''   ``Parents do not simply turn children over to government schools with  the assumption that the school will make every decision without  parental input. As parents, we have a right to direct the upbringing,  care, and education of our children.''   The Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee said:  ``Americans have been awakened to the troubling fact that public  schools are failing our children. The lack of educational standards  combined with the radical ideologies being taught in the classroom have  led more and more parents to question the public education system. . .  . This act reasserts the proper role of parents in their children's  education.''   Finally, Parents Defending Education Action said: ``There is an  intentional and universal lack of transparency and accountability among  school districts. Concerning incidents  [[Page H1369]]  are major and widespread. . . . The Parents Bill of Rights Act,  introduced by Congresswoman Julia Letlow, addresses the primary issues  parents have vocalized over the last 2 years: academics, free speech,  safety, fairness, and transparency. We hope Congress will be receptive  to the Parents Bill of Rights Act and vindicate parents who have spoken  up and yearn for such legislation.''   After hearing statements like this, it should be clear that this bill  gives parents what they want. Polling shows that overwhelming  majorities of parents want more control over what their children are  taught. According to survey results, 72 percent of Americans support  curriculum transparency. Additionally, 67 percent believe that parents  should be able to opt their children out of curriculum they believe is  inappropriate or harmful. Nearly 8 in 10 parents polled nationally want  to have influence over what is taught in K-12 classrooms.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 15 seconds.   Madam Chair, I am going to say again and again and again and again,  this bill does not do anything to ban books.   My understanding is that the book ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' was  banned by a liberal school board in California, so don't blame us for  what liberals do.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Williams).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Kiley), a member of the committee.    Madam Chair, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Chair, I will respond to a comment that my colleague  on the other side of the aisle mentioned a few minutes ago.   I point out that the manager's amendment that we will debate  clarifies the intent of the language the ranking member was reading.   The manager's amendment makes it clear the school district's  responsibility is to the parents' child, not any child.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, we have heard a lot about what this bill is going to do  in the future, and it is all bad from the other side.   What has been particularly disturbing to me to hear today are  comments that truly misrepresent what is in the legislation before us.  That scares the public, and that is not what we should be about.   This bill is not going to cause people to be mean to schoolchildren.  It does not attempt to hurt anyone. It is not going to ban books.   Our colleagues say, on one hand that a list of all the books is  already available out there to parents, and then they say, this bill is  going to force those lists to be put out and that will cause the  banning of books.   We have heard that books have been banned. In the Rules Committee  last night, books that they said had been banned inappropriately--those  assertations were refuted.   It has been truly troubling, in our committee markup in the Rules  Committee last night and today, to hear the terrible misrepresentations  about this bill.   As my colleagues and I have said, this Parents Bill of Rights Act is  to help parents be more involved with their children's education, as  they should be.   I am urging my colleagues to support H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of  Rights Act, and by doing so we will send a strong message that parents  are an integral part of their child's education and must be respected.   For too long, parents have been kept at a distance in schools and  classrooms. Teachers' unions and education bureaucrats made significant  efforts to conceal what was truly being taught in classrooms. What came  out of COVID was parents saw what was being taught and they didn't like  it.   For years, students were falling behind in critical subject areas  such as mathematics and reading, but prolonged school closures hastened  the deterioration of learning.   Now, the Parents Bill of Rights Act will foster robust parent/teacher  partnerships and close the gap between families and educators. That is  what this bill is about--setting up true partnerships between families  and educators.   We respect educators. We want to support what they are doing in the  classroom. But parents want to know what is being taught in the  classroom. We want transparency and we want accountability.   To recover lost learning and promote a safe learning environment,  parents must be involved in the classroom. Parents are the best  advocates for the best interests of their child, and teachers are an  important part of enhancing the well-being of students.   I hope our colleagues will not continue to misrepresent what is in  this bill but will work with us for the benefit of America's children.  That is what we are about on our side of the aisle, not to hurt, not to  be mean, but to support.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues across the aisle to do what is  best for students, support this important bill.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment.    Madam Chair, it has been a pleasure to support the Parents  Bill of Rights Act. I am especially proud of the work that our  committee has put into crafting this bill.   Our committee worked late into the night and early morning and  considered dozens of amendments. Nearly 20 were adopted to make the  bill even better. I am proud that we have reported to the floor a  commonsense bill that has broad support and aligns with what the vast  majority of Americans want.   The amendments we passed during the committee markup accomplished the  same goal we had when writing the bill: protecting parents' rights and  making sure that schools can never cut parents out of their children's  education decisions.   This manager's amendment makes a few minor technical changes to make  sure that the amendments we passed during the committee markup will be  implemented correctly and that the rights promised are fulfilled.   In addition, the manager's amendment adds language to the First  Amendment's sense of Congress included in the underlying bill. The new  language affirms the fundamental rights of parents to direct the  education of their children and encourages courts to use the strict  scrutiny standard in evaluating cases related to parental rights.   Schools should always be accountable to parents, and the parents  should always know what their children are being taught and what their  children are being exposed to. The Parents Bill of Rights Act protects  those fundamental rights.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of both this  amendment and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, the gentleman from Virginia I think will  remember that I believe it was in the Loudoun County Public Schools  where the father of a child who had been sexually molested in a  bathroom by a young boy dressed as a girl who then was transferred to  another school, and the parents were never notified that this had  happened, when the father stood up at the school board meeting to bring  this issue up, he was not allowed to speak. Furthermore, he was  arrested. He was wrestled to the ground and arrested.   So, again, we hear from our colleagues two different scenarios: one,  well, parents already have the right to address their school boards.  Yes. That is in our First Amendment. We have the right to petition our  elected officials for grievances. However, that is not happening as we  have seen in certain places.   Whether or not there is a time limit, I would hope that people would  be reasonable about that, but we are not dictating that. That will be  dealt with. As the gentleman says, those school board members in most  cases are elected, and it will be up to them to deal with the public in  that respect. If they don't do it correctly, then my assumption is that  there will be consequences.   Madam Chair, the manager's amendment, again, strengthens the  underlying bill, I urge its adoption, and I also urge passage of H.R.  5.   With this legislation we have an opportunity to make a stand for the  rights of parents. I hope all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  will vote with what they say they believe, which is that parents have  rights and that we want to have the best education for children.   Madam Chair, join us in this effort, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, while I appreciate the substitute put forward  by the Congresswoman, the Democrat proposal is wholly inadequate and  will do little to solve the problems that parents face.   Instead, the Democrats' amendment resorts to a tired old Democrat  strategy: spend more money, hire more people, and hope for the best.   Madam Chair, parents need more than that. They don't need massive new  amounts of taxpayer spending at the Federal level controlled by  bureaucrats when our country is already deeply in debt, nor do parents  need schools to hire massive numbers of new administrators.   What parents need is for their rights to be protected. The Democrats'  substitute does nothing to ensure that parents are the ultimate  decisionmakers in their child's education.   Of course, that shouldn't be a surprise. There has been a push to  silence parents around the country. Powerful teachers unions, several  school boards, Democrat politicians, and the Biden  [[Page H1381]]  Justice Department have all voiced opposition to the rights of parents  to have a say in their child's education.   This kind of rhetoric and political posturing has real-world  consequences for parents. For example, in 2021, a Rhode Island mother  of two, Nicole Solas, talked to an elementary school principal in South  Kingstown, Rhode Island, about what was being taught in schools. After  persistent stonewalling, the school district directed her to file a  public records request. She did, and the local teachers union filed a  lawsuit against her.   This kind of treatment is outrageous. Ms. Solas was subjected to  endless stonewalling, public humiliation, and an interminable and  costly legal battle. No parent should have to go through that.   The Democrat substitute would do nothing to ensure that stories like  this never happen again, but the Parents Bill of Rights Act would. Our  bill will ensure that parents can never be sued for wanting to know  their child's curriculum.   Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona recently published an op-ed  about the Democrat vision for parent empowerment. In his vision,  parents should be satisfied when the Federal Government spends taxpayer  dollars on top-down solutions. By contrast, Republicans want an  authentic give-and-take between parents and the education system about  what students learn, how they are taught, and how they should be  protected.   That is why I am proud to stand behind our bill.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Democrat  substitute and in favor of the Parents Bill of Rights Act.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I want to say again that the approach our  colleagues want to take is to spend more money.   Ms. Solas, who I mentioned earlier; Mr. Smith, who was mentioned  earlier; and others, they certainly did not have the right to  peacefully speak to their school boards and get responses, so that is  not going to happen under the Democrats' amendment.   We also are not mean, and again, we do not ban books. We do not  condone the banning of books.   We think, again, that the substitute presents the perfect picture of  Republicans' and Democrats' approaches to parent engagement. Democrats  believe protecting parents' rights means spending more taxpayer dollars  to impose a top-down vision. Republicans believe in giving parents real  power to secure the best education possible for their children.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time as I believe I have the  right to close.    Madam Chair, I want to say again that our bill is meant to  give parents their God-given rights to be involved with their  children's education and to seek the best education possible.   We do not want anyone to be treated unfairly. We want everyone to be  treated fairly. We do not ban books.   I urge the public to read this bill. It is fairly short, about 30  pages, to make sure where the truth lies in terms of this piece of  legislation.   Madam Chair, I reject the amendment that has been offered in the  nature of a substitute. I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment and a  ``yes'' vote on H.R. 5.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs.  Fischbach) having assumed the chair, Ms. Greene of Georgia, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 5) to ensure the rights of parents are honored and protected in  the Nation's public schools, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the  ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the veto message on H.J. Res. 30.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of overriding President  Biden's veto of H.J. Res. 30, a Congressional Review Act resolution  nullifying the Biden administration's attempt to politicize the  retirement savings of Americans.   This is deja vu for the American people. With this veto, the  President once again insists on undermining the financial security of  the very people who elected him.   Republicans will stand with American workers and retirees in  protecting their savings.   ESG investing puts the future of millions of Americans in jeopardy  when they are already facing economic hardships and inflation brought  on by this administration's reckless spending.   The President says H.J. Res. 30 would make it, ``. . . illegal to  consider risk factors . . .'' but that statement is blatantly false and  misleading.   The Trump rule, which H.J. Res. 30 would reinstate explicitly states,  ``Nothing in the final rule is intended to or does prevent a fiduciary  from appropriately considering any material risk with respect to an  investment.''   Last year, the Department of Labor, DOL, published a rule encouraging  retirement plan fiduciaries to consider ESG factors when making  investment decisions. Biden protected this rule with his veto.   Now, thanks to Democrats, workers can be placed into ESG investment  vehicles by default. If a fiduciary finds that two investments are  equal, the fiduciary is allowed to use collateral ESG factors to break  the tie without justifying or documenting that decision.   This is especially concerning since ESG investments often  underperform and are riskier than other investment strategies.   The left is using ESG investment criteria as a political tool to  cudgel companies into accepting leftist policies. If we do not override  this veto, the left will use ESG investing to push noncompliant  companies out of the marketplace.   Congress debated and it came to the bipartisan conclusion to overturn  the Biden rule. Now the administration persists through executive fiat.   Americans invest to secure their future, not to fund the Green New  Deal or leftist pet projects. That is why I supported the resolution to  nullify the Biden administration's destructive rule.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to quit playing petty politics  and vote in accordance with the best interests of the American people.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentleman from  Virginia is prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I obviously disagree with my colleague on the other side of the aisle  that a compelling argument to override the veto has not been made. I  believe that we have offered a compelling argument.   I believe there are two points of view on what my colleague said  about the successes of what our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle have done for the last 2 years.   We have the highest debt that we have ever had in this country. We  are staggering under an inflation rate that is historic, and so we  obviously don't think what we have inherited from the last 2 years of  total Democratic dominance in this country is positive.   I think we can make a small attempt to make some changes here by  overriding the President's veto. I urge even my Democratic colleagues  to vote ``yes'' to protect workers and retirees. Override the  President's veto.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, parents have a fundamental right to know what their  children are being taught, and it should not depend on how rich or poor  they are.   The amendment under consideration would strike the phrase ``at no  cost'' from the clause stating that parents have the right to review  and make copies of curricula. In other words, this amendment would  allow schools to charge parents for copies of what their children are  being taught.    On principle, that is a terrible idea. Republicans believe that every  parent, no matter how much money they have, should be free to know what  their child is being taught.   This amendment is also terrible policy. Under the provision, schools  could charge every parent exorbitant  [[Page H1391]]  amounts for copying curricula and effectively make it impossible for  parents to access the curriculum of their children. We know that  schools can use cost as a weapon to keep curriculum a secret.   I spoke earlier about a Rhode Island mother of two, Nicole Solas, who  became concerned that her child's school was teaching radical leftist  ideology. She asked for the school's curriculum but was persistently  stonewalled and told to file public records requests. She did, and the  school hit her with a $75,000 bill.   That kind of conduct is outrageous. No parent should have to pay  $75,000 to learn what their child is being taught. Just the threat of  this kind of a bill has a chilling effect on other parents.   That is why it is essential we defeat this amendment. Parents should  be able to see their child's curriculum without worrying the school  will slam them with an exorbitant bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and in  favor of the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, we should defeat this amendment that would encourage schools  to throw up roadblocks in front of parents.   We should defeat this amendment that would make money a barrier to  parental engagement. We should defeat this amendment and support the  underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We all know the impact that a good teacher can have. A good teacher  can be motivating, challenging, and life changing for young students.  We all want to have good teachers.   I spent my career in education. I have met countless teachers over  the years who care deeply about students and want to do the right  thing.   Unfortunately, too many in the education bureaucracy are working  against teachers with professional development materials that seek to  push radical ideologies meant to be passed on to students. Furthermore,  there are numerous professional development groups that want to supply  teachers with these talking points.   That is why it is essential we know exactly what teachers themselves  are being taught, what kind of professional development they are  receiving, and who is providing it.   We Republicans believe that parents have a fundamental right to know  these answers. Parents need to know who is teaching the teachers, and  taxpayers have a right to know what kind of professional development  they are paying for.   Frankly, opposition to giving parents access to this information and  these materials is evidence of the need for this bill. What is it that  proponents of this amendment are trying to hide?   During the Rules Committee hearing, one of the Democrat Members even  recognized that reviewing professional development materials is a  fundamental right. He told me: ``I agree with you. These are really  important, vital rights every parent in the country ought to have. . .  . I would think that the best place to start would be . . . to ask the  local school board and make sure that the right to review, for example,  any professional development material is secured.''   I agree with the Democratic Congressman. Reviewing professional  development material is a vital right of every parent.   His mistake, however, is to think that every local school board will  voluntarily allow such. Many do not. That is why we need the Parents  Bill of Rights Act.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and in  favor of the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to remove information about  the education children are receiving from parents. We should defeat  this amendment and support the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Fallon) having assumed the chair, Mr. Carter of Georgia, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5)  to ensure the rights of parents are honored and protected in the  Nation's public schools, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
