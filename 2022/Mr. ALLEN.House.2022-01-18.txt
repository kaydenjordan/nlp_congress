 Mr. Speaker, the Impact Aid program represents the Federal  Government's promise to provide school districts with additional  assistance when property taxes are lower because of the presence of  military, Federal, or Tribal lands.   Every year, affected school districts take count of the federally  connected students through a take-home survey.   This headcount determines the district's Impact Aid reimbursement,  which can help pay for teacher salaries, technology, and student  support services.   Throughout the pandemic, school systems across the Nation have worked  through many challenges to continue serving students. Conducting these  Impact Aid surveys have been no different.   That is why the Supplemental Impact Aid Flexibility Act will allow  school districts to reuse their FY22 student counts and property tax  data when submitting their upcoming FY23 applications at the end of  January.   This additional reporting flexibility will be helpful to many of the  1,100 federally impacted school districts, including Richmond County  schools in my district, which serves the great community of Fort Gordon  and our great base there, a U.S. Army installation.   I am proud to support the Supplemental Impact Aid Flexibility Act. I  believe that it will provide much-needed assurance for school systems.
