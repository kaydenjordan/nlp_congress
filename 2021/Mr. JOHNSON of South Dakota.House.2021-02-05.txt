 Mr. Speaker, from supply chain issues to  uncertain prices, it has been a tough time in cattle country.   To make things worse, there was a fire up near Lemmon, and it was a  big one. It burned 16,000 acres of land used to feed South Dakota  cattle.  [[Page H392]]    The tough hand that so many have been dealt did not keep the South  Dakota Stockgrowers from coming together and donating bale after bale  of hay to those Lemmon ranchers.   When asked why they came to the rescue, Scott Edoff of the South  Dakota Stockgrowers said: Nobody asks. We just do it. That is part of  our culture, part of our community.   Mr. Speaker, that sentiment did not surprise me in the least. That is  South Dakota. And that is what I call unity.                            ____________________
