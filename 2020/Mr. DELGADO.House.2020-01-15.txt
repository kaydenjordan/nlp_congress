 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor one of my heroes,  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was born on this day, 91 years ago.   Next Monday, the Nation will pay tribute to this incredible man and  his life, as well as his enduring legacy, a legacy rooted in  unconditional love.   In these difficult and divided times plagued by the rise of hate, I  can't think of a better legacy to reflect upon as we embark upon this  year.   The road ahead will be difficult for our Nation, but I am encouraged  by and find great hope in the following words once spoke by Dr. King:  ``We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the  altar of retaliation. The oceans of history are made turbulent by the  ever-rising tides of hate. History is cluttered with the wreckage of  nations and individuals that pursued the self-defeating path of hate. .  . . `Love is the ultimate force that makes for the saving choice of  life and good against the damming choice of death and evil. Therefore,  the first hope in our inventory must be the hope that love is going to  have the last word.' ''                            ____________________
