 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome the soon-to-be  newest members of NATO: Finland and Sweden.   Although the conflict in Ukraine has begun to fall out of the news  cycle, the free world continues to be challenged by a violent autocrat  with delusions of grandeur, making the strength of NATO all the more  important.   Every day, Vladimir Putin has demonstrated his willingness to kill  and maim countless innocent civilians and trample international norms  in hopes of reclaiming the glory of a long-gone empire.   By invading Ukraine, Putin expected to fracture the world's response,  dividing the United States and our NATO allies. Instead, he has done  just the opposite.   Led by the United States, the international community has stood in  lockstep with the people of Ukraine. And now, we are expanding the  roster of NATO countries, creating a stronger and more united  membership than ever before.   Finland and Sweden's accession to NATO will bolster our collective  security and serve as a warning to Russia and to all other global  aggressors: The United States and the international community are more  united than ever before. We will never tolerate attempts to expand  sovereign borders through force, not in Ukraine, not anywhere.                            ____________________
