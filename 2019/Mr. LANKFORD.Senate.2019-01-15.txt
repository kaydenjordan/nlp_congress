 Mr. President, it is amazing how much we talk about our  kids. People talk about bipartisan things here all the time. There is a  bipartisan conversation often about our families and about our kids and  how proud of them we are and about sharing our lives with each other.   My two daughters are a remarkable part of my family, of who I am. I  can't even process life without thinking about the two of them.   Our kids are some of the most valuable moments of our entire lives  and our greatest memories. When they were little, we looked into their  eyes and saw potential, and we dreamed for them. From our earliest days  of pregnancy, Cindy and I talked about the future for our girls as we  prayed for them, thought about them, prepared for them, and it had sunk  in what an incredible responsibility they really were. Kids are that  way. That is that earliest moment that we talk about all the time.   What is remarkable about this photo is thinking about just exactly  what this moment could be like because, in this moment, there are  really two directions that it could go in America. This little one was  born several weeks early. For that little one, life could have gone in  two different directions. This group of doctors is gathered around this  little one, delivering this child, and watching him take his very first  breath. Only seconds before that, that same little one we see there  with this same group of doctors could have been destroyed--that life in  the womb--and it would have been OK.   You see, in America, this moment could go two different directions at  any time. This life could be there, and we could watch the decades  ahead of him or, seconds before this picture was taken, when that child  was still in the womb, that life could have been destroyed, and no one  would have paid attention because the determination of whether this is  a child or whether this is just a little lump of tissue is determined  by a few seconds in a delivery room. If it is still inside the womb, it  is not a child; it is just tissue. A few seconds later, when he is  delivered, everyone smiles and looks at the face of this baby and says:  What a beautiful child, and what a remarkable miracle that is.   How do we do that in America? How do we decide what is life and what  is just tissue?   Some people would say it is only a child if we believe it is a child.  If we don't believe it is a child, it is not a child; it is only  tissue.   Some people say it has incredible value, and we should prepare for  his or her college, and we should think and pray about his future and  his spouse and what he is going to do. Some people would say it is  meaningless--just flesh that can literally be put into a bag and taken  to the curb. The determination is really by the mom and the dad there.  They get to choose whether that is a child or whether that is tissue.   I honestly don't understand that conversation because when I look at  this child with fingers and toes and hair and unique DNA, there is  nothing different about that child right there than this child. You  see, that child whom we saw in the picture before is the same age as  this one, but, this time, this is a 3D ultrasound taken inside the  womb, but there is no difference between the two. Both of them have  faces and fingers and toes and nervous systems and functioning brains  and lungs. They have DNA that is different from their moms and their  dads--DNA that is unique to those people. Whether you can see him or  not, that heartbeat and that DNA is a child.   In America, we still have this ongoing dialogue: When is ``life''  life?   I heard someone earlier jokingly say that if this life were  discovered on Mars, we would say Mars had life on it, but we are still  discussing whether this life is a life on Earth. What do we do with  that?   Here is what we continue to debate and continue to have a  conversation about. On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court ruled on  what is now the infamous Roe v. Wade decision. It was supposed to have  settled the issue about life. It was supposed to have settled the issue  that every single State has to allow abortion and that life, according  to the Supreme Court in 1973, was about viability. When can this child  live on his own outside the womb--viability?   Viability in 1973 was very different than viability now, thankfully.  When we think about viability now, there are people born at 21 or 22  weeks--extremely early--who would have never survived in 1973 but who  regularly survive now because of great medical care. Viability really  doesn't determine life, though. Life is something that begins much  earlier, and for some reason in our culture, we are still having a  conversation about what to do with that tissue.   As Americans, we spend a lot of time trying to work on very difficult  issues, but for some reason, this has become a partisan issue that is  exceptionally divisive in this culture. This life and this child  shouldn't be a partisan issue. This shouldn't be a Republican child or  a Democratic child. This should just be a child, and we should be able  to pause for a moment and determine what we are going to do about her  and determine: Is she valuable?   As a culture, we spend billions of dollars caring for the homeless  because we believe that every single life matters and that no life can  just be thrown away just because one struggles with life. We spend  billions of dollars caring for the oldest and the weakest in our  society because they need 24-hour care and because we respect that life  and the dignity that it carries. We demand equal protection for women  and men of all races, all ages, all sexual orientations, all faiths. We  demand that as a culture because we believe, as a culture, that every  person should have respect and every person should have opportunity  because of one's great potential.   We pat ourselves on the back when we adopt abused animals, when we  stand up against human trafficking worldwide, when we help clean up  ocean trash, or when we plant trees to beautify our communities. Yet we  are having a tough time considering that child as a child.   We even require that cigarettes, alcohol, theme park rides,  medicines, and many other products have warning labels on them to warn  pregnant moms not to use the product because it could harm the child  because, as a culture, we acknowledge that a mom's smoking hurts a  child. Yet, for some reason, we can't seem to acknowledge that a child  could be hurt by an abortion and that it really would end a life.    It is my guess that anyone who disagrees with this has already tuned  me out because, as a culture, we don't want to think about this life  because if, for a moment, we pause and consider that maybe she is  really alive and has purpose and value, we would have to swallow hard  and acknowledge the millions of little girls just like her who have  died in abortions in America--millions. To fight against having to deal  with that, we just don't want to think about it, and we just tune it  out. Yet, if you are one of the folks who has actually stuck with me  through the dialogue, let me walk through a couple of things just to  think about.   Let's start with a few things--the science. This little girl has DNA  that is different than her mom's and dad's. It has cell division. It  has something that we would look at in normal embryonic development  called the Carnegie stages of embryonic development.   For years and years, every medical school teaches the Carnegie stages  of embryonic development. They look at cell division at the beginning  point and acknowledge, as they go through the  [[Page S203]]  process, that this is a child from the earliest moments and that it is  a stage of life. Every single person who can hear me right now has gone  through the Carnegie stages of embryonic development, just like this  little one has. Every person has because we understand that it is a  natural part of life, that it is a stage of life, that it is an  acknowledgment of life.   It is something that we acknowledge in the animal world because this  Congress has passed laws to deal with endangered species, including a  $100,000 fine if you damage a golden eagle's egg, a bald eagle's egg,  if you go to marine turtles' nesting spots to destroy or to even  disturb the nests of marine turtles. In Oklahoma, we deal with barn  swallows that will build their nests in the springtime in construction  areas. All construction has to stop if a barn swallow builds a nest in  a construction area, because those eggs are important, not so much  because of the barn swallow but because there is a common understanding  in this Congress that those eagle eggs, turtle eggs, and barn swallow  eggs are future barn swallows, turtles, and eagles. We acknowledge that  it is a life that is in process. So we protect it, but we can't seem to  make the simple, logical step that that eagle egg becomes an eagle and  she is a little girl.   The science screams at us in this area, but for many people, they  just don't want to think about it because, at this stage, she is in the  womb. She is invisible. She hasn't reached the stage at which you can  see her. For many people, they say: She is only alive when I can see  her. If I can't see her, she is not real.   The problem is that the science doesn't prove that out.   The second issue that we have to deal with is where we are as a  culture and where we are as a country compared to other countries on  this simple issue about looking at this little one and asking: Is that  a child or is that just tissue? Where is the rest of the world on this?   It is interesting to note that the rest of the world is in a very  different spot than is the United States on this. This is a simple map  of the world. Most of the world--and you will see it in gray here--says  that abortion should stop at 12 weeks. That is 3 months. After 3  months, you can't have an abortion anymore.   There are seven countries in the world that will allow abortion all  the way up to 24 weeks. They are the countries that are here in black-- Canada, the United States, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, and  the Netherlands. They allow abortions up to 24 weeks.   At 24 weeks and on, in the third trimester, there are only four  countries in the world that allow late-term abortions--only four-- China, North Korea, Vietnam, and the United States. Everywhere else in  the world looks at that child and says that the child is a child--fully  viable--except the United States, China, North Korea, and Vietnam. Now,  that is not a club I really want us to be in.   All of Europe has banned late-term abortion--all of it. All of  Africa, most of Asia, and all of Central and South America have looked  at this, and as separate cultures, they have said no to a late-term  abortion--that he is a fully viable child.   Interestingly enough, there was a survey that just came out today--a  nationwide survey--that asked Americans' opinions on this issue about  life. There were 75 percent of Americans who said there should not be  abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy--that is 3 months--except to  protect the life of the mom. This was 75 percent of Americans. They are  with this part of the world. This part of the world all says that same  thing. That is most of Europe, and most of that area says OK to 12  weeks, but that after 12 weeks, you have to stop because the child has  a functioning nervous system and brain and is developing in all of  those areas.   Even if you don't acknowledge where I am, where I believe that life  begins--at conception--why can't you at least acknowledge that at 12  weeks, which is where most of the rest of the world is, he is a child  that should be protected?   At what point do we, as Americans, slow down enough to look at what  we don't want to look at and at what the rest of the world has done,  except for Vietnam, North Korea, and China? Why do we want to be in  that group when we deal with the issue of life? Those are some of the  worst human rights violators in the world. Why are we in that club?   Folks have recently said to me: You know, I understand this is a  legislative issue, but it is really a faith issue. This is really about  your faith, and your faith should not legislate who I am.   I would only tell you that a culture makes decisions, including our  culture, not just about its faith but about its values as a culture.   Stealing is also a religious issue. It is in the Ten Commandments. So  maybe, as a culture, we shouldn't ban stealing because the Ten  Commandments say you shouldn't steal. No one would really say that  because, as a culture, we all look at it and say that theft is a  problem, that you shouldn't be able to do that.   A culture makes its decisions based on its own personal values. So it  is not just a religious issue, but our faith does impact our personal  lives and decisions. It does affect who we are.   In China, where most faith is banned, they allow abortion at any  stage. In fact, in China the state is the most important thing.  Everything is about building up the state. The individual has no value.  The state has the greatest value. China determines it has too many  people. So it forces women to have abortions. It compels them. Some can  only have one child, and some can have two children, but every child  after that has to be aborted because the state chooses that. Its  greatest value is the state.   Our greatest value is the individual. That is why our documents begin  with things like ``we the people,'' because the individual has value.  We look at the senior adults who are in the nursing homes and provide  care for them. We look at the homeless person, the child who is in need  of food, and that little girl who is still in the womb, and we say they  all have value because the individual has importance.   I had someone who caught me and said: You know, your faith has this  whole verse in the Bible that says: ``I was knit together in my  mother's womb.'' So this is a religious issue. You have a belief that  each child was knit together by God in their mother's womb.   Then they paused and said: That is fine for you to have that belief,  but I have the belief that they were knit together, but it is when they  are not done. They are not fully knit together. They are not really a  shirt. They are only a sleeve, and if they are still in development,  then, they are not fully developed. They are not really a child yet.   I smile at that and say: Actually, although this child was born  premature, you are right. She is not fully developed. It is not just a  sleeve. It is just a smaller shirt, but she will get there because  everything about your life's development--your hair color, your height,  your health--is all bound up in those first cells as they start  dividing in your own unique DNA.   This is not about a religious conviction. This is about a child and  who we are as a culture.   Let me say this: I understand there is a lot of conversation about  this. As I mentioned before, this has become a partisan, divisive  issue. This is not trying to be a Republican or Democrat. I have met  Republicans and Democrats who both can look at this picture and say  that is a child, not tissue.   This shouldn't be a divisive or political issue, neither should this  be an attacking and condemning issue of the moms and dads who have  walked through abortion. Quite frankly, I have great compassion for  them. For those moms who have had an abortion, that memory never goes  away for them. Years later, they sit in the food court at the mall and  watch a small child playing nearby and think: That is how old my child  would be right now if they were still alive. I have not met a mom,  ever, who wasn't affected by abortion and the memories that come back  to them on that.   This is not a flippant issue for any person who goes through an  abortion. I grieve for those folks and the struggle they have, but I  also grieve for us as a nation in the devaluing of something so obvious  as a child. We can do better as a country, but the first thing we have  to do is stop and look.   As a nation, we have been through some moments that we are not proud  [[Page S204]]  of, but as a nation, we are proud of who we can become. As a nation, we  are not proud that at one point, we declared African-American men and  women as three-fifths of a man. As a nation, we are not proud of that.  As a nation, we are not proud that we once told women they could not  vote. As Americans, we are not proud that at one point, we took  Japanese-Americans and interned them in camps because we were afraid of  them. As Americans, we are not proud of those moments.   I pray there is a day that we are not proud that we looked away from  little girls and little boys and said: You are not human enough yet.  Your life can be ended because I don't want to look at you.   The beginning for us, really, is to stop and look at what is obvious.  That is a child. What are you going to do about that child?   One of the great books of the 20th century was written by a man named  Ralph Ellison, who, by the way, was an Oklahoman. Ralph Ellison was a  tremendous African-American author. In the early 20th century, he wrote  a book called ``Invisible Man.'' It is a remarkable journey to look  into that time period. The author, who is really writing as the  narrator of the book, is telling his story.   In the prologue of the book, there is a section I want to read to you  because I think it is powerful, just thinking about the philosophy that  Ralph Ellison put out. He said this:         I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and       liquids--and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am       invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see       me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus       sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors       of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they only       see my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their       imagination--indeed, everything and anything except me.        Nor is my invisibility exactly a matter of biochemical       accident to my epidermis. That invisibility to which I refer       occurs because of a peculiar disposition of the eyes of those       with whom I come in contact. A matter of the construction of       the inner eyes, those eyes with which they look through their       physical eyes upon reality.    Ralph Ellison was saying in the early 20th century that White  America, when they ran into Black America, refused to look and ignored  them as if they were invisible and just walked on.   As a culture, I am grateful that Americans are opening their eyes to  each other as friends and as neighbors and as Americans. I wonder, one  day, when the peculiar eyes that choose to pretend that this child is  invisible, simply because she looks like this, when our peculiar eyes  choose to look at what we have chosen to say is invisible and to turn  away and to say: Let's see what we do as a culture. Let's march for  life. Let's speak out for what is obvious, and let's determine what to  do in the next step.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
