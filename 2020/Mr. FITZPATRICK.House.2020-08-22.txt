 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hard  work and dedication of Mr. Joe Fabrizio and his eighth grade students  at Holland Middle School in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.   Each year, Mr. Fabrizio and his students write letters to our office  on a variety of topics, and each year, reading these letters is  something that our entire staff looks very much forward to.   Madam Speaker, one of the most important things that one can do as a  citizen is to communicate with your elected officials by writing a  letter, sending an email, making a call, or paying a visit. These  students are playing their part in the political process, and these  students at Holland Middle School know that the decisions that our  government makes today will impact them, and eventually, it will be  their turn to make decisions in their government.   I think my colleagues in the House would very much benefit from being  able to review these letters, and so I will include the letters in the  Congressional Record.   Madam Speaker, by taking the time to write our elected officials  regarding issues important to them, it shows that these students truly  care about our district and our Nation, and it should give all of us  faith in the future of our Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Comer for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I stand today with the hardworking letter carriers and  postal workers of the United States Postal Service.   The USPS must be fully funded so that my constituents and millions  across our Nation can receive the high-quality and timely service that  the post office has always provided us.   Madam Speaker, today I will vote in favor of the Delivering for  America Act.   Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, must come together and  address the serious challenges that USPS has been facing for quite some  time now. I look forward to continuing to work with our colleagues on  bipartisan solutions to move all of our heroes forward and support our  heroes at the U.S. Postal Service.                                time  1600
