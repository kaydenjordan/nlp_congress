 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also  thank him for pulling together this Special Order here this evening.   As the gentleman mentioned, I used to be the chair of the  subcommittee that he now chairs, and that is the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. I have been on the Foreign  Affairs Committee for over 20 years now. We do a lot of important  things on that committee, and our view of China has evolved somewhat  over that time.   Do we want to have good relations with China?   Absolutely. It is in our best interests, it is in China's best  interests, it is in the world's best interests. We passed normal trade  relations some years ago. It used to be called the most favored nation;  now it is normal trade relations. We trade with them a lot.   Many would argue that American jobs have gone to China. They have  stolen our technology, our intellectual property secrets, and a whole  range of other things. So they haven't been terribly cooperative in  that area, yet they have benefited a great deal.   One of our strongest allies, Taiwan, the PRC--China--has been  bullying for years. Too often, China has gotten their way. They have  been able to keep Taiwan out of international health organizations that  would be helped by having the Taiwanese expertise in that. They have  done a whole range of things.   When I first came here, there were several hundred missiles in the  PRC--China--pointed at Taiwan. Now there are over 1,600 missiles, and  they threaten them on a whole range of things. So it is very important  that we continue to have strong relations with Taiwan.   Legislation that I have proposed and that we have passed here before  in our committee and that we hope to pass in the House as well--and  then we hope the Senate will take it up as well--is to allow high- ranking Taiwanese officials to come here to the United States,  particularly to Washington, D.C., to meet with our officials here in  our Nation's Capital. That makes sense, and hopefully we will do that  in the very near future, but China has been very uncooperative,  obviously, with respect to Taiwan.   They have been particularly uncooperative with respect to one of our  greatest threats in the world right now, and that is North Korea. We  get a lot of lip service from China, but very little action.   North Korea is a threat. For a long time, they were a threat to the  region. We cared about that and we worked with our allies on that. But  now they are a threat to Washington, D.C., and Seattle and Los Angeles  and my home city, Cincinnati, and cities all over the United States,  because we believe they can now reach the United States with nuclear  weapons.   That is the first time. A lot of us were concerned about that day  ever coming. Previous administrations tried to get China to lean on  North Korea because China has the greatest clout with North Korea  because China provides most of their food and most of their fuel. About  90 percent of North Korea's trade is with China. China acts like they  are going to be helpful, and then they are not.   The last thing we want to see is military confrontation. You will  have some folks in our country that that is their principal priority,  they don't want any confrontation, but then they will be satisfied to  have North Korea have nuclear weapons.   We can't tolerate somebody as unpredictable, somebody as dangerous as  Kim Jong-un or his predecessors, his father or grandfather, people like  that to have nuclear weapons. It is just unacceptable to the United  States and most other countries around the world, but the rest of the  world looks to us to act.   This is a case where we really do need China to step up and do the  right thing. Thus far, they have not been willing to do that.    So the question is: How do we get China to do that?   In the past, a number of us thought the way you got China's attention  was  [[Page H543]]  to at least discuss with our allies in the region--South Korea, Japan,  even Taiwan, perhaps--to consider having nuclear weapon programs  themselves. And maybe even talking about that would be off-putting  enough to the PRC that they would lean on North Korea to back off their  program.   Well, we are probably beyond that now because North Korea not only  has a nuclear program, but they have one that could now hit the  continental United States.   I think the only thing at this point that works is any leverage that  we have with China itself, that if they don't act, then they can either  trade with North Korea or they can trade with us. That ought to be a  pretty easy deal for them to make. The economy in North Korea is in  shambles. The people are starving. The people are repressed by their  own illegitimate government. So there is not a lot of trade. It is not  of great import to China. In fact, their relationship with North  Korea--I think the way they look at it--it keeps us off balance. So  they can trade with North Korea or they can trade with us.   Now, trade with the United States is very significant to the PRC. It  means millions and millions and millions of jobs.   Are we willing to go that far?   Well, I think we should be when you are considering war, which is the  alternative to actually getting North Korea to back off their program.   So in this case, I think we ought to make it clear to China that we  are serious about this; whether it is the financial system,  international banking, cutting that off. We ought to fully cut that off  with North Korea and at least on the books we have, but China has ways  of getting around that and propping up their ally, North Korea.   So this is the time. It has got to happen soon. North Korea has, we  think, probably 20 or so nuclear devices at this point. You wait  another year or 2 years, they are going to have dozens and dozens and  dozens of them.   Not only is that dangerous because they have them, but it is  dangerous because they will sell those nuclear devices to  organizations, al-Qaida, perhaps even ISIS, or other organizations that  would love to smuggle those things into this country and use them. They  would use them in a heartbeat if they had them. We can't let that  happen.   So things that we talked about in previous administrations and that  administrations would negotiate--we had six-party agreements and we  would get together--and North Korea would agree:         Okay. For food and fuel, we will end our nuclear program.    On the books it was ended, but underground or in the mountains, it  was continuing.   Both previous Republican and Democratic administrations essentially  let that happen, and it was bad, but they couldn't reach the United  States. Now they can reach the United States.   So we are at that time now that years ago we warned about. We are  there now. So I would strongly encourage this administration to take  this seriously and do whatever is possible, short of war--we want to  avoid that if at all possible--to make sure that China finally leans on  North Korea to back down.   Mr. Speaker, I thank again the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), who  is doing a fine job as chair of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee.  I also thank him for the opportunity and pulling this together this  evening.
