 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 7566) to amend title 18, United States Code, to increase  the punishment for human trafficking in a school zone, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7566         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``No Trafficking Zones Act''       or the ``NTZ Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds as follows:        (1) Child sex trafficking can have devastating immediate       and long-term consequences, including health impacts,       psychological and physical trauma, and even death.        (2) While any child can be targeted by a trafficker,       research, data, survivors' lived experiences, and expertise       have revealed that traffickers often target vulnerable youth       who lack strong support networks, supervision, care, or basic       necessities, have low self-esteem, have experienced violence       in the past, are experiencing homelessness, are experiencing       academic difficulties, or are marginalized by society, and       lure them into forced labor and prostitution and other forms       of sexual exploitation. Traffickers are masters of       manipulation and prey upon vulnerabilities using       psychological pressure, intimidation, and drugs to control       and sexually exploit the child for their benefit.        (3) The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children       (NCMEC) has received reports of child sex trafficking in all       50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. These       reports include incidents occurring in every type of       community, including suburban, rural, urban, and Tribal       lands. In 2021, NCMEC received more than 17,200 reports of       possible child sex trafficking.        (4) Of 22,326 trafficking victims and survivors identified       through contacts with the National Human Trafficking Hotline       in 2019, at least 5,359 were under age 18.        (5) Many underage victims of sex trafficking are students       in the United States school system. No community, school,       socioeconomic group, or student demographic is immune.        (6) While the internet and social media make up the       majority of first encounters, traffickers regularly find       young people in shopping malls, through friends, at bus       stops, and at schools. Specifically, traffickers       systematically target vulnerable children and youth by       frequenting locations where young people congregate,       including schools. They also use peers or classmates, who       befriend the target and slowly groom them for the trafficker       by bringing the young person along to parties and other       activities.        (7) A 2018 survey reported that 55 percent of young sex       trafficking survivors in Texas were trafficked while at       school or school activities and 60 percent of trafficked       adults say they were first groomed and solicited for       trafficking on school campuses.        (8) Schools can and should be safe havens for students.       Schools are best positioned to identify and report suspected       trafficking and connect affected students to critical       services. Students are more likely to report instances of sex       trafficking, attempted sex trafficking, or grooming for the       purposes of sex trafficking where they feel most safe from       harm and threats.       SEC. 3. INCREASED PUNISHMENT FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN SCHOOL                     ZONES.         Section 1591 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (d) the following:        ``(e)(1) Whoever violates subsection (a) in a school zone,       or on, or within 1,000 feet of, a premises on which a school-      sponsored activity is taking place, or on, or within 1,000       feet of a premises owned by an institution of higher       education, shall, in addition to the punishment otherwise       provided under this section, be imprisoned for not more than       5 years.        ``(2) In this subsection:        ``(A) The term `school zone' has the meaning given such       term in section 921.        ``(B) The term `school-sponsored activity' means any       activity that is produced, financed, arranged, supervised, or       coordinated by a school or a State educational agency or       local educational agency or is under the jurisdiction of a       State educational agency or local educational agency.        ``(C) The terms `State educational agency' and `local       educational agency' have the meanings given those terms under       section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of       1965.        ``(D) The term `institution of higher education' has the       meaning given such term in section 101 of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001).''.       SEC. 4. INCREASED PUNISHMENT FOR COERCION AND ENTICEMENT IN                     SCHOOL ZONES.         Section 2422 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``individual who has not       attained the age of 18 years'' and inserting ``minor''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(c)(1) Whoever violates subsection (a) or (b) knowing, or       having reasonable cause to believe, that the violation is       committed against a minor who is enrolled in school and is,       at the time of the violation, in a school zone or on, or       within 1,000 feet of, a premises on which a school-sponsored       activity is taking place, or against a person who is enrolled       in an institution of higher education and is, at the time of       the violation on or within 1,000 feet of a premises owned by       the institution of higher education, shall, in addition to       the punishment otherwise provided under this section, be       imprisoned for not more than 5 years.        ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply in a case in which a       minor's presence on, or within 1,000 feet of, the premises on       which a school-sponsored activity is taking place is not       related to such school-sponsored activity, or the person's       presence on or within 1,000 feet of the premises owned by the       institution of higher education is not related to their       enrollment at such institution.        ``(d) In this section:        ``(1) The term `minor' means an individual who has not       attained 18 years of age.        ``(2) The term `school' means a public, parochial, or       private school that provides elementary or secondary       education.        ``(3) The term `school zone' has the meaning given such       term in section 921.        ``(4) The term `school-sponsored activity' means any       activity that is produced, financed, arranged, supervised, or       coordinated by a school or a State educational agency or       local educational agency or is under the jurisdiction of a       State educational agency or local educational agency.        ``(5) The terms `State educational agency' and `local       educational agency' have the meanings given those terms under       section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of       1965.        ``(6) The term `institution of higher education' has the       meaning given such term in section 101 of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 7566, as amended.  [[Page H7915]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill was introduced as an important response to  stopping human trafficking and sex trafficking at schools. In fact, its  name was Stop Human Trafficking in School Zones. I introduced that bill  to stop human trafficking in school zones.   I am glad to be here on the floor of the House to continue this  journey in protecting our children. I want to start with the words from  the Major Cities Chiefs Association, one of the major supporters of  this legislation:   Child sex trafficking is one of the most despicable crimes an  individual can commit. Sadly, there are far too many children  victimized by this scourge. For example, the National Center for  Missing and Exploited Children received more than 17,200 reports of  possible child sex trafficking in 2021.   It is especially troubling that these crimes sometimes occur at  schools which should be a safe haven for America's children.   Besides gun violence, human trafficking, sex trafficking is a scourge  that takes and destroys the lives of our children.   H.R. 7566 will play an important part in addressing child sex  trafficking by establishing additional penalties for offenders who  commit these offenses in a school zone or within 1,000 feet of a  school-sponsored activity.   We want to be heard on stopping human trafficking and sex trafficking  at our schools. And so the No Trafficking Zones Act, which was formerly  the Stop Human Trafficking in Schools Act, would ensure that schools  across the country, including institutions of higher learning, are safe  spaces for learning and academic exploration, free from the menace of  sex trafficking.   H.R. 7566 would establish a sentencing enhancement of up to 5 years  in several instances: First, in the case of any person who commits the  offense of sex trafficking within a primary or secondary school zone or  on or within 1,000 feet of the premises of a school-sponsored activity,  or premises owned by an institution of higher learning.   Second, for any person who commits the offense of coercion and  enticement of a minor enrolled in a primary or a secondary school, or a  person enrolled in an institution of higher learning, to travel in  interstate or foreign commerce and engage in criminal sexual activity  while the minor is in a school zone, or on or within 1,000 feet of  premises where a school-sponsored activity is taking place, or while  the person is on or within 1,000 feet of the premises owned by the  institution of higher education.   And third, for any person who commits the offense of coercion and  enticement of a minor using the mail or facilities of interstate or  foreign commerce, such as the text and instant messaging or social  media platforms which have been used extensively, while the minor who  is enrolled in school or an institution of higher education, is in a  school zone, or on or within 1,000 feet of premises where a school- sponsored activity is taking place, or premises owned by the  institution of higher education.   Human trafficking is one of the greatest threats to human rights in  the United States. It destroys a human being's life, and it destroys,  forever, a child's life.   In 2020, 11,193 instances of potential human trafficking were  reported to the United States National Human Trafficking Hotline, with  at least 70 percent of those instances involving sex trafficking, while  an estimated 25 percent of all human trafficking victims in this  country are in my home State of Texas at any given time, many of whom  are minors.   Mr. Speaker, I gave and held the first human trafficking hearing,  field hearing from Houston, Texas, with my cosponsor of this  legislation, the honorable  Mike McCaul. I express my appreciation for  his collaboration on this legislation, his enthusiastic collaboration,  as he did join me when we held the first hearing on human trafficking  in Houston, through the Homeland Security Committee.   What I would say is that Houston had been the epicenter of human  trafficking. It was a powerful hearing, and I am glad that we have  joined together now to stop human trafficking at schools.    Let me also offer my sympathy to him and his family for their loss.   At least 5,359 trafficking victims and survivors identified through  the hotline in 2019 were under the age of 18. And in 2021, the National  Center for Missing and Exploited Children received more than 17,200  reports of suspected child sex trafficking. Many of these young victims  of sex trafficking are students in school systems, colleges, trade  schools, and universities across the country.   A 2018 survey reported that in Texas, where no trafficking zone  legislation passed with bipartisan support earlier this year, 55  percent of young sex trafficking survivors were trafficked while at  school or school activities, and 60 percent of trafficked adults said  they were first groomed and solicited for trafficking while on school  campuses.   That has been a hotbed of opportunity for the scourge of sex  traffickers who want to prey upon our innocent children. I am grateful  that the legislation in Texas generated out of an effort chaired by  Bishop James Dixon, chair of the Houston Sports Authority at the NRG  Arena, and began to develop a policy where there would be no  trafficking zones around major stadiums and events.   Members of this body know all too well that children are sexually  exploited in many ways. Some young people are trafficked by their  schoolmates or people they once considered friends. And while the  traffickers seek out young people who have noticeable vulnerabilities,  including problems at school, conflicts at home, or even the need to  fill in a tuition gap caused by the loss of a scholarship, no child or  young person is truly safe from the schemes of charismatic traffickers  bent on exploiting and destroying young lives.                                time  1630    With the proliferation of social media and the myriad ways in which  we communicate with one another, traffickers have put these same means  of communication to their own use to find, target, lure, groom,  victimize, and exert control over their victims while buyers are using  technology to find and purchase sex anonymously.   Traffickers have infiltrated every known form of communication,  especially the sites, messaging apps, and social media platforms our  children use most frequently, leaving young children more vulnerable to  manipulation. Access to the internet, cell phones, and smartphones make  it easier, Mr. Speaker, for traffickers and buyers to communicate with  children and youth.   Even when they are at school, in class, or attending school-sponsored  activities, there are no barriers, no walls, no brick walls, cement  walls, steel walls, that can keep a trafficker from getting a precious  child.   As a result, trafficking has reached the halls, lunchrooms, gyms,  dormitories, and classrooms of schools, colleges, and universities in  every corner of the United States of America.   These staggering facts and statistics led me to introduce this  bipartisan legislation, the No Trafficking Zones Act, along with  Chairman Nadler and Representative McCaul, who I wish to thank for  working with me, as I have said previously, as well as Representative  Johnson of Louisiana for his amendment that included the protection for  young people at institutions of higher education.   We came together in a bipartisan manner to exert the influence  necessary to protect America's children collectively. I, again, thank  Chairman Nadler, Representative McCaul of Texas, and Representative  Johnson of Louisiana. I am delighted to work with them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the issue of stopping human trafficking in school zones  is such a crucial issue that I would hope that the focus of our debate  today would be on saving the lives of children.   I will just simply make the point, being on the Committee on Homeland  Security and chairing the Judiciary subcommittee that deals with Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security, that we all can work together for  comprehensive immigration reform.   Here we are today, specifically focused and pointed on ensuring that  there are no trafficking zones in our country and specifically around  our school zones where children cannot be harmed.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the Major Cities  Chiefs Association; Texas State Representative Ron Reynolds; NAACP,  Bishop James Dixon, Branch President; Break the Cycle U.S.A., Valerie  Winborne, mother of trafficking victim; and Courtney Litvak,  surviving--a summary of her experience where she was trafficked.                                                       Major Cities                                              Chiefs Association,                                                      July 13, 2022.      Hon. Shelia Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Jackson Lee, Rep. Nadler, and Rep. McCaul: I       write on behalf of the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA)       to register our support for H.R. 7566, the Stop Human       Trafficking in School Zones Act. The MCCA is a professional       organization of police executives representing the largest       cities in the United States and Canada.        Child sex trafficking is one of the most despicable crimes       an individual can commit. Sadly, there are far too many       children victimized by this scourge. For example, the       National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received       more than 17,200 reports of possible child sex trafficking in       2021. It's especially troubling that these crimes sometimes       occur at schools, which should be a safe haven for America's       children. H.R. 7566 will play an important part in addressing       child sex trafficking by establishing additional penalties       for offenders who commit these offenses in a school zone or       within 1,000 feet of a school-sponsored activity. These       enhanced penalties will help establish a strong deterrent and       ensure those who commit these heinous acts are held       accountable.        Thank you for your leadership and ongoing commitment to       protecting America's children. Please do not hesitate to       contact me if the MCCA can be of further assistance.            Sincerely.                                                  Jeri Williams,                                   Chief, Phoenix Police Department,      President, Major Cities Chiefs Association.                                   ____                                                       Ron Reynolds,                                  Texas House of Representatives,                                                      July 13, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, House Judiciary Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Shelia Jackson Lee,      Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Crime,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler and Chairwoman Lee: As organizations       and leaders in the movement to end human trafficking, we want       to thank you for scheduling this important markup of H.R.       7566, the Stop Trafficking in School Zones Act, which you       introduced along with Representative Michael McCaul. The need       for legislation that makes clear that children and youth are       never to be trafficked or pursued by sex traffickers       especially while at school or participating off-campus in       school-sponsored activities.        Human trafficking poses a grave danger to individual well-      being, public health, public safety, national security,       economic development, and prosperity. Child and youth sex       trafficking can have devastating immediate and long-term       consequences, including health impacts, psychological and       physical trauma, substance use disorders, mental health       problems, and even death. While any minor can be targeted by       a trafficker, traffickers often target vulnerable youth,       including those who lack strong support networks, supervision       care, have low self-esteem, are experiencing academic       difficulties, are marginalized by society, or ostracized by       their peers. No child or community is immune. Recruiting and       grooming occur everywhere that kids can be found, even in       schools across the country. Traffickers frequent places where       young people can be found, including school-sponsored events       like basketball and football games, field trips, and talent       shows. They also use peers and classmates, who befriend the       traffickers' targets and groom them for the trafficker by       forming relationships with the students and brining them       along to parties and other activities, slowly acclimating       them to the traffickers and their lifestyle.        Targeting youth online via social media, direct messaging,       and the like has become an increasingly common tactic among       traffickers. They will look vulnerable young people who are       receptive to their advances. Grooming occurs online or in       person, over an extended period. They gain their targets'       trust, fulfill their needs, make promises, gradually       isolating them and exerting control over their lives--      sometimes virtually. Technology has made it much easier for       traffickers to seek out children and youth.        To that end, we would like to express our strong support       for H.R. 7566 because young people should be safe at all       times--but especially while they are trying to learn or       pursue school-related endeavors that enhance their       educational experiences. We are thrilled that the House       Judiciary Committee will condenser this legislation that       would establish a sentencing enhancement for those who would       dare to commit sex trafficking or contact young people for       such purposes while they are at school-sponsored activities       and encourage members to vote yes.        We thank you for your leadership and as survivors and       advocated dedicated to eradicating human trafficking, we are       grateful for your commitment to ensuring that those who       choose to target and victimize children will be held       accountable.            Sincerely,                                                      Ron Reynolds,      State Representative.                                   ____                                                           NAACP,                                                      July 13, 2022.

Dear Chairman Nadler and Chairwoman Lee: As an organization       and leader in this movement for over a decade to end human       trafficking, we want to thank you for scheduling this       important markup of H.R. 7566, the Stop Trafficking in School       Zones Act, which you introduced along with Representative       Michael McCaul. The need for legislation that makes clear       that children and youth are never to be trafficked or pursued       by sex traffickers, especially while at school or       participating off-campus in school-sponsored activities.        Human trafficking poses a grave danger to individual well-      being, public health, public safety, national security,       economic development, and prosperity. Child and youth sex       trafficking can have devastating immediate and long-term       consequences, including health impacts, psychological and       physical trauma, substance use disorders, mental health       problems, and even death. While any minor can be targeted by       a trafficker, traffickers often target vulnerable youth.       including those who lack strong support networks, supervision       care, have low self-esteem, are experiencing academic       difficulties, are marginalized by society, or are ostracized       by their peers. No child or community is immune. Recruiting       and grooming occur everywhere that kids can be found, even in       schools across the country. Traffickers frequent places where       young people can be found, including school-sponsored events       like basketball and football games, field trips, and talent       shows. They also use peers and classmates, who befriend the       traffickers' targets and groom them for the trafficker by       forming relationships with the students and bringing them       along to parties and other activities, slowly acclimating       them to the traffickers and their lifestyle.        Targeting youth online via social media, direct messaging,       and the like has become an increasingly common tactic among       traffickers. They will look for vulnerable young people who       are receptive to their advances. Grooming occurs online or in       person, over an extended period. They gain their targets'       trust, fulfill their needs, make promises, gradually       isolating them and exerting control over their lives--      sometimes virtually. Technology has made it much easier for       traffickers to seek out children and youth.        To that end, we would like to express our strong support       for H.R. 7566 because young people should be safe at all       times--but especially while they are trying to learn or       pursue school-related endeavors that enhance their       educational experiences. We are thrilled that the House       Judiciary Committee will consider this legislation that would       establish a sentencing enhancement for those who would dare       to commit sex trafficking or contact young people for such       purposes while they are at school or school-sponsored       activities and encourage members to vote yes.        We thank you for your leadership and as survivors and       advocates dedicated to eradicating human trafficking, we are       grateful for your commitment to ensuring that those who       choose to target and victimize children will be held       accountable.            Sincerely,      Break The Cycle USA.                                   ____                                                       July 13, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, House Judiciary Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Crime,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler and Chairwoman Lee: NTZ is a bi-      partisan organization disrupting the criminal activity of       human trafficking. NTZ's mission is to create No Trafficking       Zones across the nation. In order to create no trafficking       zones, we must have policies set in place to protect our       communities from commercial sexual exploitation and human       trafficking. Children in America are being preyed upon every       single day in schools across our nation. In 2021, NTZ was a       part of the creation of the S.B.1831 ``No Trafficking Zone       Act'' for schools in Texas. The ``No Trafficking Zone Act was       authored by Rep. Senator Larry Taylor, was carried in the       House by State Representative Senfronia Thompson, and       approved with 100 percent bipartisan support. Our belief is       there needs to be unity in fighting for the protection of our       great Nation's children.        In this letter, you will hear testimonies of Mother and the       names of their daughters. You will learn brutal detail of       what is sex trafficking. Sex trafficking is the slave trade       where a person is raped and owned by another.        We want to thank you for scheduling this important markup       of H.R. 7566, the Stop Trafficking in School Zones Act, which       you introduced along with Representative Michael McCaul.       America needs legislation that makes it clear, that children       and youth are never to be commercially sexually exploited or       pursued by sex traffickers, especially while at school or       participating off-campus in school-sponsored activities        An Alarming Fact: Did you know that 60 percent of       trafficked adults say they were first introduced to       trafficking (groomed or solicited) on school campuses?        We have support across the nation. Parents and families       want their children safe while they are at school. Parents       and families across our country are picking up the pieces of       destruction as their children are being groomed and lured on       school campuses or during school functions. We have human       trafficking detectives, advocates, social workers, parents,       elected officials, law enforcement leaders, school district       superintendents, board members, PTO parents, survivor       leaders, nurses, doctors, and anti-trafficking specialists       coming together to say enough is enough. We need laws to       protect our youth while they are in school from sexual       predators. This is happening in all communities across our       nation.        The term ``institutional grooming'' describes the       perpetrator using a position of trust to gain access to a       child/youth and avoid detection. Perpetrators of grooming can       use online and offline methods to reach their victims.        Valerie Winbornes's daughter was trafficked in Virginia.       She like most families said she received no help and there       was no justice for her twelve-year-old daughter who was       trafficked from her school.        Madelynn Bennetsen. She trusted a girl in JH who she       thought was her friend--who would later lead her on the path       of skipping class, running away from home, drugs, and       trafficking. If there were more awareness and training for       the staff in the school and even myself. We may have been       more alert to these behaviors as red flags instead of teenage       behavior problems. We make it our life's work to help others       in honor of Mady. Mady was murdered by her trafficker and       never returned home.        Mary Well's daughter was a target because she had Autism.       She also was a young girl who was murdered and never returned       home.        Courtney Litvack was trafficked out of Katy Texas. Katy is       a suburban wealthy area in Harris County. She was sold to       multiple traffickers and eventually taken to Las Vegas. Her       family as all of these other families will express with grief       that there was no justice.        Leddie a fifteen-year-old girl committed suicide after she       could not get the proper help after being recovered from       being sex trafficked.        Do you know traffickers pick out young girls on tick tok       and Instagram and tell groomers to go lure them from school?       In many states, the traffickers introduce girls as young as       twelve to strip clubs. Fourteen and fifteen-year-old girls       are trafficked by gangs, pimps, and organized crime and then       ``trained' and ``broken in' at strip clubs. They will form a       trauma bond with many of their traffickers and such a level       of shame that most girls will not know how to leave even if       they physically can. They will also have the girls become       addicted to drugs becoming numb to being raped. The teen's       addiction will have them not knowing or understanding       everything that is happening and controlling them through       their addiction and abuse. I have given definitions to the       terms in this paragraph.        NTZ and I want to express our gratitude for scheduling this       important markup of H.R. 7566, the Stop Trafficking in School       Zones Act, which you introduced along with Representative       Michael McCaul. The need for legislation that makes clear       that children and youth are never to be trafficked or pursued       by sex traffickers, especially while at school or       participating off-campus in school-sponsored activities.       Every day kids are going missing and are being sex trafficked       from their schools or were contacted at their school. We must       change this. This is unacceptable. Nelsen Mandela said There       can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way       in which it treats its children.        To that end, we would like to express our strong support       for H.R. 7566 because young people should be safe at all       times--but especially while they are trying to learn or       pursue school-related endeavors that enhance their       educational experiences. We are thrilled that the House       Judiciary Committee will consider this legislation that would       establish a sentencing enhancement for those  [[Page H7918]]       who would dare to commit sex trafficking and slavery on our       children at schools. I encourage and pray the members will       vote yes.            Respectfully,                                                 Jacquelyn Aluotto,      President, No Trafficking Zone--NTZ.                                   ____                               Courtney Litvak         Courtney has made it her mission to tell her story and       speak out to spread awareness about human trafficking and       help shape policy to protect other young people from falling       victim to the schemes of human traffickers, and to hold       traffickers accountable.        Courtney first became entangled in sex trafficking when she       was still in high school.        Despite what some believe about victims of human       trafficking, she grew up in a loving, church-going family, in       a safe neighborhood, and attended an upscale, suburban high       school in Texas. But, by the age of 17 she was under the       control of her first trafficker and she was being advertised       for illicit sex on websites like Backpage.com.        Courtney was a junior in high school when a series of       traumatic experiences occurred, leaving her emotionally and       physically susceptible and in a downward spiral--like so many       victims of human trafficking. She began participating in       high-risk behaviors, including abusing drugs and alcohol.        A trafficker, with ties to her high school, used fellow       students to prey upon her and use her vulnerabilities to       their advantage--offering her friendship and support when she       felt she had none, meanwhile drawing her gradually and deeper       into ``the life.''        Courtney was actually being groomed by two different       organized crime networks simultaneously and each groomer       chatted with her through social media and messaging other       apps. One network even invested in grooming Courtney for       almost an entire year. She grew to trust these people, who       were in fact all friends of friends and all formerly attended       her high school.        Her first trafficker picked her up from her school on       multiple occasions. Consequently, she was unenrolled from her       school and had her entire life uprooted in a desperate       attempt for her family to intervene in her exploitation.       Courtney returned back to her hometown where days after       turning 18 she was taken from her home by the other invested       trafficking network. She soon realized that this individual       she thought she loved meant to pass her on to her next       trafficker for a finder's fee of $500.        Eventually, Courtney would be transported from Texas to       California, then, Las Vegas--passing from the clutches of one       trafficker to another.        The coercive tactics of her captors varied from subtle to       overt, physical to psychological--from violent to caring.        On an occasion when she attempted to seek help, law       enforcement officials treated her like a criminal, convincing       her that the safest place for her was with her trafficker.        Fortunately, after years of exploitation, overdoses, and       mulitple suicide attempts, Courtney escaped her final       trafficker in 2018. She sought trauma counseling and attended       an intense out of state recovery program, became a       consultant, and, in 2020, was appointed to the U.S. Advisory       Council on Human Trafficking.     Mr. Speaker, I would just simply like to suggest  that we can find trafficking in many other places.   I also include in the Record the article: ``Epstein's `ground zero':  How the financier reportedly wreaked havoc on Royal Palm Beach High  School community.''                   [From Business Insider, July 27, 2019]  Epstein's `Ground Zero': How the Financier Reportedly Wreaked Havoc on                 the Royal Palm Beach High School Community                             (By Kat Tenbarge)         Former Royal Palm Beach High School Assistant Principal       Carolyn Brown told The Palm Beach Post it was an ``open       secret'' that female students were involved in something       suspicious that involved hundreds of dollars in cash and       resulted in girls being bullied for being ``prostitutes'' and       ``sugar babies.''        What administers didn't know, or at least didn't act upon,       was that at least 15 underage girls enrolled at the high       school were sexually assaulted by financier and now convicted       sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to police reports       obtained by The Palm Beach Post.        Like dozens of other accusations against the shadowy       financier, who is currently being held without bail on       charges of sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy in the       southern district of New York, Epstein's Royal Palm Beach       High accusers say he paid them to give him massages, during       which he would coerce them into sex acts.        Epstein was well aware that his victims would have been       high schoolers, since The Post reported that a Royal Palm       Beach High transcript was found in 2005 in his bedroom desk       drawer at his $12 million Palm Beach estate, next to a       massage table and an armoire filled with sex toys.        One Royal Palm Beach High accuser told police she was 16-      years-old when Epstein asked her to give him a massage while       she was topless. She said she told him she was in high       school. He asked what her favorite sex position was.        Another 16-year-old told police Epstein said he would help       her get into her dream college, New York University, after       reviewing her SAT scores and high school transcript.        Epstein also wrote a note on his own Jeffrey E. Epstein-      branded stationary, Palm Beach police officers found, which       instructed an employee to deliver a dozen roses to an       underage girl who performed in a Royal Palm Beach High play.       Police found the note in Epstein's garbage in 2005.        These findings were some of the evidence brought forward       before Epstein signed a plea deal in 2008 that allowed him to       avoid federal prosecution and serve 13 months of an 18-month       prison sentence, during which he could work from a high-rise       in Palm Beach 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.        Now, Epstein is pleading not guilty to sex trafficking       charges that accuse the elite financier of assaulting upward       of 80 women, many who were underage at the time of the       assault, including some as young as 14. The Palm Beach Post       reports that Epstein recruited girls from several Palm Beach,       Florida high schools, but that Royal Palm Beach High was his       ``ground zero.''        The Post reports that girls who were part of Epstein's       underage sexual assault scheme were bullied for being       ``prostitutes'' and ``sugar babies,'' which administrators       took notice of when they found $300 in a girl's purse after       she was caught fighting with another female student.        Attorney Adam Horowitz, who has represented some of       Epstein's accusers in eight civil lawsuits, was quoted as       describing the girls who were allegedly targeted as       vulnerable, with some ``living in trailer parks,'' in The       Post.        Epstein asked girls to bring their friends, The Post       reported, paying girls up to $200 for recruiting new victims.       ``The younger the better,'' he instructed them, according to       one accuser who was first approached by an adult who worked       for Epstein in 2003 at a resort in Riviera Beach.        That accuser went into her senior year at Royal Palm Beach       High with Epstein's goal in mind, with The Post reporting she       recruited at least eight other underage girls who then       recruited their own friends, including some girls who were on       the verge of homelessness and needed money, badly.        ``Knowing what we know now, it's so sad what happened to       those girls,'' Brown, the former assistant principal, told       The Post.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article: ``  `Open secret' at Royal Palm High School: At least 15 students were  lured to Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach mansion'' right out of the  school.    Open Secret at Royal Palm High: At Least 15 Students Were Lured to                    Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach Mansion                             (By Lulu Ramadan)         Tucked in the drawer of Jeffrey Epstein's bedroom desk,       near a massage table and a wooden armoire filled with sex       toys, was a teenage girl's Royal Palm Beach High School       transcript.        She was 16 years old when Epstein lured her to his Palm       Beach home set at the end of a dead-end street behind a wall       of hedges.        And she's one of at least 15 girls from Royal Palm Beach       High School who Epstein sexually exploited in that bedroom 15       years ago, police reports reveal.        Epstein, a multimillionaire financier then in his 50s,       lured a procession of girls as young as 14 to his home to       perform nude massages for money, police and court records       say. The massages often ended with Epstein groping or       sexually assaulting the girls.        Epstein's victims attended several Palm Beach County       schools, including Lake Worth Middle and Palm Beach Gardens       High.        But Royal Palm Beach High, with about 3,000 students, many       from the county's rural reaches, was ground zero.        Evidence suggests Epstein knew his victims were school       girls and the signs didn't escape Royal Palm Beach High       administrators. The girls endured teasing and classmates       called them ``prostitutes.'' After two girls fought, an       administrator found one of them had $300 in her purse.        Aside from the student transcript found in Epstein's desk       in 2005, police collected more evidence and witness       statements that suggest Epstein knew his victims were still       school children:        He scrawled a note on Jeffrey E. Epstein-branded stationery       instructing one of his employees to deliver a dozen roses to       a girl who performed in a Royal Palm Beach High play. Police       found the note in his trash.        One 16-year-old girl described to detectives giving Epstein       a massage while she was topless. He asked her about herself       and she told him she was a student at Royal Palm High. He       then asked her which was her favorite sexual position, she       told police.        Another girl, who met Epstein at age 16, said Epstein       reviewed her college applications and SAT scores and promised       to help her get into her dream school, New York University.        Though Palm Beach detectives uncovered these details in       2005, the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office and U.S.       Attorney's Office in Miami, then headed by Alexander Acosta,       cut Epstein a plea deal that landed him in jail for 13 months       on two charges of soliciting prostitution.        This month, a decade after his release from a Palm Beach       County jail, federal agents in New York arrested Epstein, 66,       on charges of sex trafficking minors. The move came eight  [[Page H7919]]       months after a Miami Herald investigation zeroed in on       Acosta's role in Epstein's plea deal and let victims tell       their stories publicly for the first time.        Epstein preyed on dozens of girls, at least 32 identified       at the time by police but about 80 identified in 2018 by the       Herald.        ``These girls had never even been to Palm Beach island,''       said Adam Horowitz, an attorney who represented Epstein       victims in eight civil lawsuits filed against the       multimillionaire.        ``Some of them were living in trailer parks. This was a       whole new world to them.''                    For Epstein: `The younger the better'         Some of the girls told Epstein they were uncomfortable with       being touched during massages, so he asked them to bring       friends instead, police reports and court records reveal.        He paid girls about the same amount, around $200, to       recruit a friend as he paid the girls who stripped down and       performed massages, court records show.        Royal Palm Beach High was a target by coincidence.        ``One of Epstein's recruiters managed to infiltrate that       circle,'' Horowitz said.        The ``recruiter'' approached a 17-year-old Royal Palm Beach       High School student in 2003 at a resort in Riviera Beach with       an offer to make $200 for an hour to give a massage, she told       police two years later.        The teen went to Epstein's seven-bedroom home on the       Intracoastal Waterway, where an assistant led her up a       staircase lined with pictures of naked young girls and into       Epstein's bedroom, police say.        In keeping with descriptions to police from many Epstein       victims, the teen found Epstein wearing only a towel, which       he later removed, before lying on a massage table.        Epstein tried to grope her, but she resisted. She told him       she didn't want to be touched, she told detectives.        So Epstein asked her to bring friends to his home for cash       instead. ``The younger the better,'' Epstein said, according       to her police statement.        Going into her senior year at Royal Palm Beach High, the       girl became a conduit to the school, recruiting at least       eight other girls she'd met on campus, court depositions and       police testimonies reveal.        And those girls recruited more girls.                           Name-calling and a fight         One Royal Palm Beach High student told detectives in 2005       that she targeted promiscuous teens on campus. Another said       she brought a friend on the verge of homelessness and       strapped for cash.        School administrators knew something unusual was happening,       police reports show.        Students teased the Epstein clique as ``prostitutes'' or       ``sugar babies,'' a term for young women who seek       relationships with wealthy, older men, The Post learned from       court depositions and former students.        The tension came to the administration's attention in       February 2005, when a 14-year-old freshman, the first of       Epstein's victims to speak to police, got into a fight on       campus with a girl who called her a ``prostitute,'' police       said.        But the school kept no disciplinary record of the fight and       didn't report anything, police learned in 2005.        At the time, it appeared the girls were making money doing       something nefarious, one former administrator, then-Assistant       Principal Carolyn Brown, said in a brief interview this       month.        It was an ``open secret,'' Brown said, stopping short of       saying whether school administrators knew the girls were paid       for sexual favors.        Brown was subpoenaed to testify in the 2005 criminal case       against Epstein after she found $300 in the 14-year-old's       purse on campus shortly after the fight, court records       reveal.        Administrators considered and then dismissed the idea that       it might be drug money, detectives wrote in a 2005 report.        Brown, who is retired, never spoke to prosecutors. Soon       after her subpoena, federal prosecutors struck Epstein's plea       deal calling for 18 months in county jail, registration as a       sex offender and payments to victims.        It wasn't clear if the principal at the time, Sheila Henry,       knew that more than a dozen students were involved with       Epstein. Henry wasn't mentioned in police reports and could       not be reached for comment.        But two former students reached by The Post, who asked to       stay anonymous, said students gossiped that some girls had       rich, older boyfriends who bought them expensive gifts. Six       other students didn't recall any such talk.        None of the girls knew then what the public knows now: That       a Palm Beach millionaire tapped a local high school to prey       on girls for his sexual gratification.        ``Knowing what we know now,'' said Brown, the former       assistant principal, ``it's so sad what happened to those       girls.''     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article:  ``Police: Children recruiting other kids for human trafficking at  schools.'' This was in Florida.                 [From WKMG ClickOrlando.com, Nov. 1, 2018]  Police: Children Recruiting Other Kids for Human Trafficking at Schools    Florida ranks 3rd in the nation for calls to human trafficking hotline                            (By Erik von Ancken)         Orlando, FL.--Human trafficking is real and it is happening       in Central Florida.        Crystal Blanton, co-chair of the Marion County Human       Trafficking Task Force, said she receives thousands of       reports from the National Human Trafficking Hotline every       year.        ``Usually the reports are in the thousands, every year,''       Blanton said. ``Thousands of people are being human       trafficked. Right here in Marion County and across the state       of Florida.''        Blanton said it's not like the movies (``Taken'' 2008),       where young girls are taken during their summer vacations by       foreign human traffickers to be sold to sultans or sheiks.        But local children, often as young as 12, are being       recruited into a life of forced prostitution.        ``I just think it's the internet, I hate to say it,''       Blanton said. ``Social media has grown the field of human       trafficking. It's easier for these traffickers to make       contact with victims.''        Blanton said traffickers look for vulnerable teenagers       online--runaways, teenagers complaining about their lives and       their parents, young people with drug addictions--and       befriend them.        But human trafficking isn't confined to any race or class,       according to Blanton.        Some victims were on the honor roll headed to college.        ``We've had doctors' children who have been intertwined,''       Blanton said.        Blanton also said human traffickers align with students and       use them and their schools as recruiting grounds.        ``There are recruiters, juvenile recruiters in the schools,       working with a pimp of some kind, and they are sent out in       the schools and given a job to bring other minors on board,''       Blanton said.        Blanton said the task force has had success educating       Marion County elementary, middle and high school principals       in looking for signs of human trafficking and placing Human       Trafficking Hotline posters in schools.        Mike Lanfersiek, a sergeant at the Human Trafficking Squad       at Orlando's Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation (MBI), said       the definition of human trafficking is forcing a person to       have sex or to work through force, fraud or coercion.        ``Human trafficking is quite simply the exploitation of       another person for commercial sex or forced labor,''       Lanfersiek said.        Lanfersiek said once victims, female or male, enter into       the life of human trafficking, they are kept there by their       captor, taking advantage of their vulnerability.        ``A vulnerability to substance abuse, the fear of physical       beating, or withholding passports or documents, things like       that,'' Lanfersiek.        Lanfersiek's Human Trafficking Squad has rescued hundreds       of young women and children, often from hotels in the tourist       district of Orange and Osceola Counties.        ``Anywhere where the trafficker thinks there might be       demand for commercial sex,'' Lanfersiek said.        Traffickers often set up their prostitution operation at       hotels because they cater to visitors in town for business or       pleasure who are looking for sex, according to Lanfersiek.        Lanfersiek said he just rescued a 15-year-old girl from a       hotel on International Drive.        ``She had met someone on the `Plenty of Fish' website and       felt this person was her boyfriend, exploiting her       vulnerabilities, pimping her out,'' Lanfersiek said.        In July, MBI agents arrested three men for luring a teenage       girl through a social media app to an International Drive       hotel and then prostituting her and having sex with her.        In 2016, Orlando police charged two men with the death of a       14-year-old girl who they'd been allegedly prostituting,       driving her to men's homes to have sex.        Lanfersiek said MBI regularly sets up undercover sting       operations to catch traffickers and rescue victims.        MBI analysts spend their days online, searching through       postings by human traffickers looking for victims and       offering them for prostitution.        Lanfersiek offered this warning: If you're coming to       Central Florida looking for a date for sex, you may get a       date with an undercover officer.     Mr. Speaker, my good friend has spoken about the  southern border. I include in the Record the article: ``Recruitment and  Entrapment Pathways of Minors into Sex Trafficking in Canada and the  United States: A Systematic Review.'' Northern border, by the way, that  I would offer to say.                      [From Trauma, Violence, & Abuse]   Recruitment and Entrapment Pathways of Minors Into Sex Trafficking in             Canada and the United States: A Systematic Review                   (By Kyla Baird and Jennifer Connolly)         Abstract--the domestic sex trafficking of minors is       occurring across Canada and the United States. Understanding       the routes into sex trafficking, including the way       traffickers target, recruit and enmesh youth in the sex trade       is invaluable information for service providers and law       makers developing prevention and intervention initiatives.       This review synthesized research on the exploitation       processes and tactics employed by traffickers in the sex       trafficking of domestic minors in Canada and the US. The       authors comprehensively and systematically  [[Page H7920]]       searched five electronic databases and obtained additional       publications and grey literature through a backward search of       the references cited in articles reviewed for inclusion.       Inclusionary criteria included: Studies published in the       English language between January 1990 and June 2020       containing original research with quantitative or qualitative       data on the recruitment or pathways into sex trafficking for       minors trafficked within the US and Canada. The search       yielded 23 eligible studies. The synthesis of the studies in       the review converged on the notion of sexual exploitation       occurring on a continuum comprising of three components; the       recruitment context, entrapment strategies utilized by       traffickers, and enmeshment tactics used to prolong       exploitation. Findings highlight the significant physical,       psychological and emotional hurdles faced by youth victims of       sex trafficking and point to the importance of comprehensive       and holistic approaches to prevention and intervention       practices.        Human trafficking is a global problem that has garnered       significant international and national attention over the       past 2 decades. In 2000, 140 countries signed onto the       Palermo protocol agreeing that human trafficking is a       significant human rights violation and a criminal offense       that requires prevention, the protection of vulnerable       populations, and the prosecution of violators of the       protocol. In North America, both Canada and the United States       signed this protocol and have since passed legislation and       policies to combat human trafficking. Sex trafficking became       criminalized in Canada in 2005 when human trafficking entered       the criminal code under section 279.01 and in the United       States in 2000 with the passing of the Trafficking Victims       Protection Act (TVPA). Sex trafficking is one of the most       common forms of human trafficking consisting of the       recruitment and exploitation of an individual through the use       of threats, force, coercion, deception, or abuse of power for       the purpose of a commercial sex act (United Nations Office on       Drugs and Crime, 2014). A commercial sex act, as defined by       the American TVPA (2000), is ``any sexual act for which       something of value is given or received.'' Common examples       include prostitution, pornography, sexual massage parlors,       and strip clubs. Commercial sex acts may be exchanged for       money, drugs, shelter, clothing, or food (Cole & Anderson,       2013; Kotrla, 2010). Sex trafficking is rampant across the       United States and Canada (Clawson et al., 2009; Dalley,       2010). Despite various political and social differences       between these countries, they are united on the front of       combating sex trafficking within their borders and expanding       research to support effective evidence-based prevention and       intervention strategies.                       Sex Trafficking of Minors (STM)         Minors (under the age of 18) are overrepresented among       victims of sex trafficking, with the majority of victims       recruited between 12 and 14 years of age (Jordan et al.,       2013; Smith et al., 2009). Given the elevated risk for       minors, research and legislation have begun to focus on the       specific issue of the STM. Consequently, our understanding of       the risks for recruitment, experiences, and needs of underage       victims is growing, and important policy actions have been       taken. In the past decade, both Canada and the United       States have passed legislation, reformed laws, and enacted       policies to combat issues of the STM. Legislative changes       in both Canada and the United States have transformed the       way victims are viewed and treated by law enforcement.       More specifically, American and Canadian federal consent       laws declared minors under the age of 18 unable to consent       to commercial sex and have shifted the lens of law       enforcement from criminalizing youth in the sex trade to       viewing them as victims (Adelson, 2008; Franchino-Olsen,       2019). Language in research on STM has followed suit,       shifting from calling underage victims of sex trafficking       ``teen prostitutes'' to ``victims of STM.''        On the basis of age, youth from all sectors of society are       at risk for recruitment into sex trafficking. Developmental       vulnerabilities such as identity formation, the need for       belonging, desire for autonomy, desire for romantic       relationships, and evolving problem-solving skills make them       easily exploitable by traffickers who appeal to these       vulnerabilities (Schwartz, 2015). Based on the growing       literature, some youths are at greater risk for recruitment       than others. Several risk factors for STM have been       identified, including involvement with child protective       services, history of childhood sexual abuse, homelessness,       physical and emotional abuse, neglect, exposure to intimate       partner violence, problematic relationships with caregivers,       drug and alcohol abuse, and teen dating violence (Choi, 2015;       Countryman-Roswurm, 2012; Countryman-Roswurm & Bolin, 2014;       Farley et al., 2005; Franchino-Olsen, 2019; Kotrla, 2010;       Landers et al., 2017). Traffickers are known to be deeply       perceptive of the developmental vulnerabilities of youth and       target their unmet needs through strategic recruitment       methods.        Simply being a girl places a youth at an elevated risk       status relative to boys (Estes & Weiner, 2001), with 98% of       victims being women and girls (International Labour       Organization, 2012). Adolescent girls are particularly       vulnerable to sexual exploitation due to social norms that       cast gendered expectations and power imbalances in relation       to sexual activities, with boys being expected to take sexual       initiatives. Sexual inexperience, desire for romantic       relationships, and insecurity among young girls can set the       stage for manipulation and exploitation by adolescent boys or       men (Hanna, 2002).        Based on the differential needs and situations of youth,       the recruitment and exploitation of underage populations are       thought to differ from adult populations (Bouche & Shady,       2017; Dank et al., 2014). While it may be riskier to traffic       a youth due to increased policing efforts in protecting       minors and higher sentences for STM, it has been suggested       that these risks are offset by the youth being easier to       manipulate and control and being highly desired by       purchasers, bringing in more money for the trafficker (Dank       et al., 2014). Compared to adults, youths have greater needs       for protection, less life experience, and are dependent on       adults for basic needs such as food and shelter, making them       more vulnerable to traffickers who vow to provide care,       protection, and basic needs (Bruhns et al., 2018; Cole &       Anderson, 2013). Given youths' physical and emotional       dependency on adults, some research have suggested youths are       more trusting and less able to identify traffickers' coercive       and manipulative strategies to entrap them (Cole & Sprang,       2015). Adult victims, on the other hand, are generally less       psychologically dependent on their trafficker (Bouche &       Shady, 2017). In addition, literature on the trafficking of       adults identify several risk factors that are more unique to       adult victim populations, including needing to financially       support dependents, low educational attainment, and having       few job skills (Holger-Ambrose et al., 2013). Despite       differences in adult and underage victim populations, much of       the extant research on recruitment for sex trafficking have       pooled both underage and adult participants or examined       victimized adults only, limiting our understanding of the STM       specifically (Reid, 2014). In order to translate sex       trafficking research into evidence-based initiatives to       combat the STM, it is important for research to delineate the       specific ways in which traffickers target and recruit youth       into the sex trade. The current study aims to synthesize       research that focuses on youth recruitment into sex       trafficking in North America.                  North American Context of Sex Trafficking         There have been few attempts to estimate the prevalence of       the STM in North America; however, available statistics are       often ``guesstimates'' rather than reliable rates (Franchino-      Olsen et al., 2020; Stransky & Finkelhor, 2012). Available       estimates for STM most commonly come from the United States,       where the rates range from 1,400 to upward of 199,000 victims       (Banks & Kyckelhahn, 2011; Estes & Weiner, 2001; Snyder &       Sickmund, 2006; U.S. Department of Justice, 2004), with the       most commonly cited study estimating upward of 325,000       children at risk for sexual exploitation in the United States       each year (Estes & Weiner, 2001). However, available       statistics are problematic as they often fail to distinguish       between domestic and international victims, are based on       varying definitions of sex trafficking, are geographically       limited, and utilize nonreplicable, unreliable methodologies       (Fedina et al., 2019; Franchino-Olsen et al., 2020; Stransky       & Finkelhor, 2012). Researcher error aside, the very nature       of the sex trafficking industry presents barriers to the       acquisition of accurate statistics. Most significant among       these is the fact that trafficking occurs largely       underground, within criminal networks that are transient,       discrete, and often invisible, even to law enforcement       (Duger, 2015; Franchino-Olsen et al., 2020). Difficulty in       obtaining estimates of an invisible crime is compounded by       the fact that many individuals victimized by sex trafficking       do not view themselves as victims of a crime and therefore do       not report it in any official capacity (Mcclain & Garrity,       2011). Despite flawed and unreliable statistics, STM is known       to be widespread across Canada and the United States,       requiring immediate action and sound research to uncover       trends and pathways of youth into sex trafficking including       the way traffickers target, recruit, and enmesh youth in the       sex trade (Clawson et al., 2009; Cole & Sprang, 2015; Dalley,       2010).        While STM defies geographic borders, a country's economic       environment, geographic positioning, laws, employment rates,       per capita income, and historical events shape the industry       and individual risk for recruitment (Hepburn & Simon, 2010;       C. O'Brien, 2009). As a result, trends in STM within North       America are different from the European context. The       permeable borders between European countries allow for easy       international movement between proximal countries (Lindstrom,       2004). For example, one report found only 5% of all       identified sex-trafficked victims in the United Kingdom (UK)       were originally from the UK, which is a stark contrast to the       picture of trafficking in NA where the majority of victims       are domestic persons (Baird, McDonald & Connolly, 2020; Banks       & Kyckelhahn, 2011; Mitchell et al., 2010; Royal Canadian       Mounted Police [RCMP], Human Trafficking National       Coordination Centre, 2014; Serious Organised Crime Agency,       2013). Given sex trafficking industries vary between       countries based on differences in social, geographical,       cultural, economic, and historical factors, it is not       appropriate to generalize understandings of STM across       countries that are dissimilar across these factors (Hepburn &       Simon, 2010). As such, the current study narrowed its focus       to systematically reviewing the recruitment of minors for sex       trafficking in two countries, Canada and the  [[Page H7921]]       United States both of which have similar cultural, economic,       geographic, and historical contexts.        The domestic STM is of major concern within Canada and the       United States (Clawson et al., 2009; Dalley, 2010). While       both countries adhere to the standards of affluent and       profitable nations that are alluring destinations for       international sex traffickers, research consistently shows       that domestic youth (i.e., youth trafficked within their       country of origin) comprise the majority of underage victims       in their respective countries (Baird et al., 2020; Kotrla,       2010; RCMP, Human Trafficking National Coordination Centre,       2014). Due to the risks and challenges associated with       transporting victims across borders, some research suggests       that domestic youths are preferred by traffickers (Smith et       al., 2009). In summarizing the literature on recruitment and       entrapment, it is important to distinguish between       international and domestic sex trafficking due to the nuanced       differences in the process of exploitation. Comparatively,       researchers suggest domestic sex traffickers more often       utilize interpersonal relationships and domestic violence to       entrap their target and international traffickers rely upon       kidnapping, parents' selling their children, and offering       false promises of jobs abroad for entrapment (Cecchet &       Thoburn, 2014). Understanding the specific ways American and       Canadian youths are recruited by traffickers and exploited       domestically is important in developing effective prevention       and intervention strategies.     Mr. Speaker, then let me offer this point of  importance. The victims are not here on this floor, but we must carry  their story to this floor, to ensure that we do not see another victim.   So I will offer these words from Courtney. Courtney has made it her  mission to tell her story and speak out to spread awareness of human  trafficking and help shape policy to protect other young people from  falling victim to the schemes of human traffickers and to hold  traffickers accountable.   She became entangled in sex trafficking while still in school.  Despite what some believe about victims of human trafficking, she grew  up in a loving, church-going family, in a safe neighborhood, and  attended an upscale suburban high school in Texas.   At the age of 17, she was under the control of her first trafficker.  She was being advertised for illicit sex on websites like Backpage. A  trafficker with ties to her high school used fellow students to prey  upon her and use her vulnerabilities to their advantage, offering her  friendship and support when she felt she had none, meanwhile drawing  her gradually and deeper into the life. She was actually groomed by two  different organized crime networks simultaneously, and each groomer  chatted with her through social media and messaging. One network even  invested in grooming Courtney for almost an entire year.   Her first trafficker picked her up from school. She was unenrolled  from her school and had her entire life uprooted in a desperate attempt  to intervene in an exploitation.   She returned back to her hometown where days after turning 18, she  was taken from her home by another invested trafficker. She soon  realized she was in this world, and over and over again she was used  and transported from Texas to California to Las Vegas, passing from one  hand to the next.   What a vile life. She is willing to share this life.   It is extremely important that we pass this legislation and that we  address the question of what can happen to our innocent children.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for closing.   Let me express my appreciation to those who sacrificed to share with  us their stories and those who worked on this very important effort:  Bishop James Dixon, II, the No Trafficking Zone cofounder and senior  pastor of the Community of Faith Church, Branch President of the NAACP,  Houston Branch; Jacquelyn Aluotto, NTZ cofounder, founder of Real  Beauty Real Women; and Courtney Litvak, a member of the U.S. Advisory  Council on Human Trafficking, who will participate in unveiling their  annual report later this week; and so many others who have really  helped. Jacquelyn Aluotto was someone who inspirationally wanted to  lead us in this direction and worked very hard.   Each of us has a duty to protect young people, whether it be from  drugs, gun violence, or sex traffickers. Our children deserve to be  safe, and parents should know their children will be safe when they put  them on the school bus or move them into their new dorms.   To be sure, H.R. 7566, the No Trafficking Zones Act, provides  increased accountability for anyone who would dare interrupt or  interfere with a young person's ability to obtain an education and lay  the foundation for a productive future for the purpose of sexual  exploitation.   In drafting this legislation, I am grateful for the contribution of  the No Trafficking Zone Initiative and all of those whose names I have  called, including those names not called, those victims silenced, or  lives lost or destroyed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 7566. This is a  great day for helping to stop sex trafficking, human trafficking, where  our children should be most safe, and that is at our schools.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7566, the bipartisan ``No Trafficking Zones Act,''  would ensure that schools across the country, including institutions of  higher education, are safe spaces for learning and academic  exploration--free from the menace of sex trafficking.   H.R. 7566 would establish a sentencing enhancement of up to five  years in several instances:   First, in the case of any person who commits the offense of sex  trafficking within a primary or secondary school zone, or on, or within  1,000 feet of the premises of a school-sponsored activity or premises  owned by an institution of higher education;   Second, for any person who commits the offense of coercion and  enticement of a minor enrolled in a primary or secondary school or a  person enrolled in an institution of higher education--to travel in  interstate or foreign commerce and engage in criminal sexual activity-- while the minor is in a school zone, or on, or within 1,000 feet of,  premises where a school-sponsored activity is taking place or while the  person is on, or within 1,000 feet of, premises owned by the  institution of higher education;   And, third, for any person who commits the offense of coercion and  enticement of a minor using the mail or facilities of interstate or  foreign commerce--such as text and instant messaging or social media  platforms--while the minor who is enrolled in school or an institution  of higher education, is in a school zone, or on, or within 1,000 feet  of, premises where a school-sponsored activity is taking place or  premises owned by an the institution of higher education.   Human trafficking is one of the greatest threats to human rights in  the United States. In 2020, 11,193 instances of potential human  trafficking were reported to the United States National Human  Trafficking Hotline with at least 70 percent of those instances  involving sex trafficking, while an estimated 25 percent of all human  trafficking victims in the country are in my home state of Texas at any  given time--many of whom are minors. That is why the Stop Human  Trafficking in School Zones Act that we are debating is so important to  pass.   At least 5,359 of trafficking victims and survivors identified  through the hotline in 2019 were under the age of 18, and in 2021, the  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received more than  17,200 reports of suspected child sex trafficking.   Many of these young victims of sex trafficking are students in school  systems, colleges, trade schools, and universities across the country.   A 2018 survey reported that in Texas--where No Trafficking Zone  legislation passed with bipartisan support earlier this year--55  percent of young sex trafficking survivors were trafficked while at  school or school activities and 60 percent of trafficked adults said  they were first groomed and solicited for trafficking while on school  campuses.   Members of this body know all too well that children are sexually  exploited in many ways. Some young people are trafficked by their  schoolmates or people they once considered friends.   And while traffickers seek out young people who have noticeable  vulnerabilities--including problems at school, conflicts at home, or  even the need to fill in a tuition gap caused by the loss of a  scholarship--no child or young person is truly safe from the schemes of  charismatic traffickers bent on exploiting and destroying young lives.  [[Page H7922]]    With the proliferation of social media and the myriad ways in which  we communicate with one another, traffickers have put these same means  of communication to their own use--to find, target, lure, groom,  victimize, and exert control over their victims. While buyers are using  technology to find and purchase sex anonymously.   Traffickers have infiltrated every known form of communication-- especially the sites, messaging apps, and social media platforms our  children use most frequently--leaving young people more vulnerable to  manipulation.   Access to the internet, cell phones, and smartphones makes it easier  for traffickers and buyers to communicate with children and youth--even  when they are at school, in class, or attending school-sponsored  activities.   As a result, trafficking has reached the halls, lunchrooms, gyms,  dormitories, and classrooms of schools, colleges, and universities in  every corner of this nation.   These staggering facts and statistics led me to introduce this  bipartisan legislation, the No Trafficking Zones Act, known as the Stop  Human Trafficking in School Zones Act, along with Chairman Nadler and  Representative McCaul, who I wish to thank for working with me, as well  as Representative Johnson of Louisiana for his amendment, that included  the protections for young people at institutions of higher education.   Each of us has a duty to protect young people--whether it be from  drugs, gun violence, or sex traffickers. Our children deserve to be  safe; and parents should know their children will be safe when they put  them on the school bus or move them into their new dorms.   To be sure, H.R. 7566, the No Trafficking Zones Act, provides  increased accountability for anyone who would dare interrupt or  interfere with a young person's ability to obtain an education and lay  the foundation for a productive future--for the purpose of sexual  exploitation.   In drafting this legislation, I am grateful for the contributions of  the No Trafficking Zone Initiative, Bishop James Dixon, Jacquelyn  Aluotto, and Courtney Litvak, who is also a member of the U.S. Advisory  Council on Human Trafficking and will participate in unveiling their  Annual Report later this week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 7181) to amend the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of  2000 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to seek to provide for  the posting of contact information of the national human trafficking  hotline in the restrooms of each aircraft, airport, over-the-road bus,  bus station, passenger train, and passenger railroad station operating  within the United States, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7181         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Human Trafficking Prevention       Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. POSTING OF NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING PHONE NUMBER IN                     CERTAIN RESTROOMS.         Section 107(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Trafficking Victims       Protection Act of 2000 (enacted as division A of the Victims       of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C.       7105(b)(1)(B)(ii))) is amended by--        (1) striking the third sentence; and        (2) inserting after the period at the end the following:       ``The contact information of the national human trafficking       hotline (including options to reach out to the hotline such       as through phone, text, or TTY) shall be posted as follows:         ``(I) In a visible place in all Federal buildings.        ``(II) The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation       with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall seek       to coordinate with the owners and operators of aircraft,       airports, over-the road buses, bus stations, passenger       trains, and passenger railroad stations to place the contact       information of the national human trafficking hotline in the       restrooms of each such aircraft, airport, over the-road bus,       bus station, passenger train, and passenger railroad station       operating within the United States.        ``(III) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation       with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and in       coordination with the heads of such other Federal agencies as       may be appropriate, shall place the contact information of       the national human trafficking hotline at each port of       entry.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 7181.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7181, the Human Trafficking Prevention Act of 2022,  would provide for the posting of the contact information for the  National Human Trafficking Hotline in the restrooms of our country's  transportation centers, where we know many trafficking victims pass  through, as well as all Federal buildings and ports of entry to inform  victims and those who witness suspected trafficking situations that  help is available.   As I have said many times before, smuggling people across  international borders is an equally troubling crime but distinct from  human trafficking. Smugglers must be prosecuted, and the exploitation  of their victims must not go unpunished. While many believe human  trafficking happens only in other countries, the victimization of  adults, youth, and children for the purposes of performing labor,  commercial sex acts, and other services happens on an enormous scale in  rural, urban, and suburban communities across the United States. We can  document that by many organizations that are fighting the scourge of  human trafficking.   H.R. 7181 would require the posting of the National Human Trafficking  Hotline contact information in all Federal buildings; require the  Department of Transportation and the Department of Health and Human  Services to coordinate with owners and operators of transportation hubs  such as airports, bus stations, and train stations to post the contact  information for the hotline in their restrooms; and, three, require the  Department of Health and Human Services and other appropriate Federal  agencies to post the hotline's contact information at every port of  entry.   In 2020, more than 11,193 instances of potential human trafficking  were reported to the United States National Human Trafficking Hotline.                                time  1645     In Texas, there are reportedly 313,000 victims of  human trafficking at any given time, including 79,000 children and  youth who are victims of sex trafficking and 234,000 adults who are  victims of labor trafficking. The victims of human trafficking tend to  be concealed, living in fear and isolated, in some cases physically and  in other cases emotionally.   They might remain under the control of their traffickers for a  variety of reasons, including a lack of the basic necessities to  escape, like transportation or a safe place to go. Some may be afraid  for their safety, while others may not recognize that they are under  the control of their trafficker. Even after they are rescued or escape,  there is always a possibility the victims will be revictimized.   The National Human Trafficking Hotline is an essential component of  the fight to end human trafficking, offering toll-free phone lines and  SMS text lines that are available 24 hours a day, every day of the  year. The hotline provides help, safety, and hope to victims and  survivors by connecting them to the support and services they need.   They must know that they are not alone. That is the most important  message that we want to give on the floor of the House today. The  victims of sex trafficking and human trafficking, the children and the  adult victims, are not alone.   Victims in crisis can receive assistance with safety planning,  emotional support, and/or immediate connections  [[Page H7923]]  to emergency services, while survivors can get help in rebuilding their  lives. Mr. Speaker, that is an important aspect of this legislation we  are putting forward today.   The hotline also plays a vital role in combating human trafficking by  helping law enforcement identify and rescue victims by receiving tips  about a potential situation of human trafficking and by providing  reports of tips to the appropriate authorities.   We must make every effort to identify victims and ensure victims and  survivors of human trafficking are connected to services that can lead  them to safety and help them begin to restore their lives. That begins  with reaching them where they are and letting them know who they can  call on for help without risking their safety.   Traffickers rely on our Nation's transportation infrastructure to  transport their victims from city to city and State to State. In the  brief moments victims are allowed by their traffickers to have a moment  alone in the restroom of a bus station or airport, they may be able to  call or even text for help. Victims, survivors, and concerned citizens  need to know that help is just a phone call away because one call can  mean the difference between life and death.   Despite the clandestine nature of human trafficking, we have learned  from survivors that opportunities do exist to reach victims, and we  should make the most of them. H.R. 7181, the Human Trafficking  Prevention Act of 2022, does exactly that.   I am very grateful to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), the gentleman from California  (Mr. Issa), and the gentlewoman from South Carolina (Ms. Mace) for  introducing this strategic and practical measure.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bipartisan bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman for his  closing, I include in the Record the ``Katy Sex-Trafficking Survivor  Teams with White House to Fight Growing Threat''; ``4-Year-Old Among 31  Human Trafficking Victims Rescued in Kansas, Missouri''; ``Texas  authorities rescue 70 missing children victimized by sex trafficking'';  from the Houston Chronicle, November 23, 2020, ``Report: Human  Trafficking Spikes in Texas Amid Pandemic''; and two additional  articles relating to human trafficking.                  [From Katy Magazine News, Dec. 10, 2019]   Katy Sex-Trafficking Survivor Teams With White House To Fight Growing                                   Threat                          (By Natalie Cook Clark)         21-year-old Courtney Litvak of Katy hopes her experience as       a sex-trafficking victim can help other young people. As the       Childproof America Ambassador, she has taken her fight       against human trafficking to the White House.        After a year of ``grooming'' from various people, Courtney       Litvak, a Cinco Ranch High School student, left her Katy       home. At 18-years-old, she started a life in human       trafficking that lasted two years. Now, saved and back home,       Courtney works to raise awareness and end this epidemic       affecting students around the country, and right here in       Katy.                 Cinco Ranch Student Survived Sex-Trafficking         Courtney Litvak, now 21, grew up in Katy in a loving home.       She went to church every Sunday and competed on a local swim       team. But at 18, she willingly left her home to enter a life       in human-trafficking.        ``I was groomed by multiple people over the period of a       year,'' says Courtney. ``This is such a subtle process that       it's easy not to notice.'' She pointed out that social media       is often a major form of communication and makes such crimes       difficult to track.                           Victims Lose All Control         ``They (victims) don't understand what will be their       reality when they lose control,'' explains Courtney. She felt       she was targeted when she was vulnerable after experiencing a       traumatic event.        ``I was assaulted and I became a changed person,'' says       Courtney. ``You should not go through a loss and then become       a target.''          Childproof America Supports Families, Educates Communities         In 2017, Courtney's mother, Kelly Litvak founded Childproof       America, a non-profit organization aimed at educating       families and communities about the warning signs that can       ultimately save children from becoming victims of this       growing trend in our country.        ``It's key for people to understand this issue,'' says       Kelly. ``Every household in Katy needs to be informed about       human trafficking. Denial is a coping mechanism and it's       difficult for parents to comprehend. Child and sex should       never go into the same sentence. It's because of this mindset       that this is a threat to Katy. These people are counting on       families to be naive and it makes us sitting ducks.''                            Informal Interventions         In addition to her duties as spokesperson, Courtney meets       informally with teens and young adults going through the       grooming process or trafficking.        ``A parent will reach out to Childproof America and we talk       for about an hour on what they have found and are going       through,'' explains Kelly. ``Then Courtney is filled in and       if the youth is willing, she will sit down with them and can       help in key activities.''        These meetings are very effective. Since becoming the       Childproof America spokesperson this past August Courtney has       spoken to about 10 students, 3 of whom were boys. Currently,       Courtney and Kelly say that these sessions are seen as being       100 percent successful in getting these young people out of a       harmful and dangerous situation. However, they stress that       these cases will be followed up on.        ``You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped,''       says Courtney.           Katy-Based Childproof America Averages 2-3 Calls a Week         Since Childproof America is Katy-based and many in Katy       know the Litvak's story about 80 percent of their calls come       from Katy residents. They average 2-3 calls a week but it       comes in waves. Recently Childproof America worked with the       Children's Assessment Center to host a Childproof America       emergency safety seminar when calls reached a sudden       increase.        ``We started receiving so many calls that we felt something       was going on,'' says Kelly.                       This is Not the Student's Fault         ``I wish someone would have looked at me and said I get       it,'' says Courtney. ``I wanted to be validated and heard,       just listened to. We need to do better at recognizing these       groups and knowing this doesn't happen over night and this is       not the person's fault.''        When Courtney was trafficked, the city of Katy and Houston       community accepted that she chose this.``That is not true,''       says Courtney.                             Master Manipulators         Courtney describes the people involved with human       trafficking as master manipulators.        ``Everything is in their control,'' explains Courtney.       ``All of your decisions are theirs. You're a commodity, a       property.''        According to the University of Texas, more than 79,000       children are being trafficked for sex in Texas alone.        ``I've never seen so much coverage especially on social       media,'' says Courtney. ``It's really a combination of more       awareness being brought to it and such organizations are       growing. It (human trafficking) is continuing to get more       sophisticated and growing.''                        Interest from the White House         A major initiative launched by Childproof America is the       education and outreach initiatives, specifically Family       Guides, which is exclusive to their group. Family Guides is       inspired by parents of victims and is designed to meet the       need of families in crisis. During a time of stress and fear,       families need a trained advocate who knows how to navigate       the issue quickly to help. Families with minor children and       18+ are matched with a compassionate advocate who can assist       with critical questions in a quick and effective fashion.       It's this program that has really piqued the interest of       officials in our nation's capital.  [[Page H7924]]                                    Success in D.C.         Just before Thanksgiving, Courtney and her mother were       invited to meet with lvanka Trump, advisor to the President.       In that meeting, they discussed how the current       administration could help fight against human trafficking.        ``Ivanka was amazing and a champion for this cause,'' says       Kelly. ``We were prepared to present our mission in a short       time.''        The Litvaks say that lvanka was interested and has followed       up since their initial meeting.        ``We're going back to D.C. in January,'' says Kelly. ``We       developed a true trust and lvanka's administration has asked       up for our opinions on top leaders on this topic.''                     Putting Everything into Perspective         ``What we're doing really didn't sink in until I was there       (meeting Ivanka),'' says Courtney. ``It was really emotional,       which is hard for me to be vulnerable. Our trip to D.C. put       everything into perspective. I'm repurposing the pain and       it's the beginning of something great.''        ``There are so many areas where people are suffering,''       says Courtney. ``No matter where the suffering is, I hope to       help and use my platform to establish relationships with       leaders to get the ball rolling.''                           Passion for other Areas         Courtney is passionate with other areas of service that she       hopes one day to be able to work with her connections to make       a difference.        ``I'd love to help the homeless,'' says Courtney. ``Growing       up in Katy I could never wrap my head around it. I've seen       the gap and want to help.''             Local Schools Need to Open Doors to Expert Training         Childproof America is working with local schools and groups       to help spread their education initiative and educate people       on this difficult subject.        ``We have been talking to Fort Bend ISD and now they are       organizing a massive training for everyone from students,       parents, and teachers,'' says Kelly. ``Every school district       needs to swing open their doors to experts to train people on       this subject. Schools need to get over the mindset that if       they have training, people will think that they are having a       problem. We need to empower the community.''                            Faith Brought Her Back         Courtney credits her faith in God for giving her the       strength to stop putting harmful substances in her body and       to breakthrough the brain washing to get help and leave that       lifestyle.        ``I'm not the first person this has happened to and I won't       be the last,'' says Courtney. ``I always want to continue to       be very raw and very genuine on this subject. I'm not putting       a time stamp on my service. I will always put my full heart       into it but what that will look like I don't know.''            Human Trafficking is in Katy and Doesn't Discriminate         It is important to note that human trafficking doesn't       discriminate. It can happen to anyone, and according to       Childproof America, this activity is happening in Katy and       Katy schools, like it's happening all over.        ``I always want to acknowledge that everyone who's been       through this does not need to talk or help others,'' says       Courtney. ``It is extremely difficult and it's a lifelong       recovery.''                                   ____                        [From Newsweek, July 1, 2021]     4-Vear-Old Among 31 Human Trafficking Victims Rescued in Kansas,                                  Missouri                            (By Matthew Impelli)         A 4-year-old child was among a group of 31 human       trafficking victims recently rescued by authorities in Kansas       and Missouri.        The victims rescued were sexually exploited, according to       the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The 4-year-old was       the youngest victim rescued in the group of 31 human       trafficking victims, which included 14 missing children and       17 adults.        The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement       that, ``The operation took place June 17-26, 2021 in Wichita,       Kansas, Independence, Missouri and Kansas City, Missouri.''        ``The results of the operation were announced by Homeland       Security Investigations Deputy Special Agent in Charge,       Kansas City, James Wright,'' the statement read. ``He was       joined by Heartland Anti-Trafficking Rescue Taskforce       partners from across the region in making the announcement.''        Along with rescuing the 31 human trafficking victims, the       operation also resulted in the arrest of 82 individuals. The       individuals ``will be charged with crimes related to       soliciting prostitution, commercial sex trafficking, sodomy,       narcotics violations, felony assault on a police officer, sex       offender registry violations and outstanding warrants,''       according to the Homeland Security statement.        Homeland Security investigators received assistance during       the operation from the Wichita Police Department; the Kansas       Bureau of Investigation; Kansas Highway Patrol; the       Department of Health and Human Services; the United States       Marshal's Service; the Platte County Sheriff's Office; the       Independence Police Department; the Jackson County Sheriffs       Department; Missouri State Highway Patrol; the Bourbon County       Sheriff's Office and the Hutchinson Police Department.        The Department of Homeland Security did not identify any of       the victims rescued or those arrested and noted that ``the       defendants in this case are presumed innocent and entitled to       a fair trial where the government has the burden of proving       guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.''        Homeland Security investigators completed a similar       operation on Thursday in Fresno County, California. Operation       Stolen Hearts focused on arresting human traffickers and       child predators seeking to pay for sex with minors. The       operation ended on June 23 and resulted in the rescue of 10       women and girls ``from the sex trade,'' as well as the arrest       of 21 individuals, according to Homeland Security.        The arrested individuals were charged with ``contacting a       minor with intent to commit a sexual offense, aiding       prostitution, arranging a meeting with a minor for lewd       purposes and solicitation of acts of prostitution.''        Newsweek reached out to the Department of Homeland Security       for further comment but did not receive a response in time       for publication.                                   ____                        [From Fox News, June 1, 2022]      Texas Authorities Rescue 70 Missing Children Victimized by Sex                                Trafficking                  The children ranged in ages from 10 to 17                          (By Andrew Mark Miller)         Law enforcement officials have successfully recovered       dozens of missing children as part of a joint task force       operation in West Texas. The three-week operation, known as       ``Operation Lost Souls,'' started in late April in the Texas       counties of El Paso, Midland, Ector and Tom Green and       recovered 70 children ranging in age from 10 to 17 who were       victims of sex trafficking, physical and sexual abuse,       according to a press release from the Department of Homeland       Security.        ``Operation Lost Souls exemplifies Homeland Security       Investigations' commitment to protecting the public from       crimes of victimization. In this case, we are looking out for       our children--our community's most precious resource,'' said       HSI El Paso Deputy Special Agent in Charge Taekuk Cho.        ``HSI is committed to continue working with our law       enforcement partners to locate, recover and help missing       children heal, while ensuring that perpetrators are held       responsible for these heinous crimes and brought to       justice.''        The operation was conducted by several law enforcement       agencies, including the Texas Highway Patrol, El Paso Police       Department, U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI.        ``At the Department of Public Safety, teamwork is one of       our core values,'' said DPS Major Matthew Mull. ``We are       grateful for all of our law enforcement partners who       participated in this operation and who work around the clock       every day to protect our communities, including our youth.''        HSI added that several agencies have provided counseling to       the children.        Authorities say that the children who were located outside       of West Texas were found in Dallas, Texas; Colorado; and       Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.        Federal law enforcement teams have successfully rescued       missing children in operations across the country over the       last few years, including in January 2021, when the FBI       announced it located 33 children in the Los Angeles area.        U.S. marshals in Ohio rescued 45 missing children and 109       additional human trafficking survivors during ``Operation       Autumn Hope'' in October 2020.                                   ____                 [From the Houston Chronicle, Nov. 23, 2020]          Report: Human Trafficking Spikes in Texas Amid Pandemic                    (By Olivia P. Tallet, Staff writer)         Texas, already the home to the second highest number of sex       trafficking cases, is seeing a steep increase in crisis calls       related to the illegal activity because of the coronavirus       pandemic. What's more, trafficking activities are exploding       online, as criminals adapt to the changing environment,       experts said.        The Lone Star State is only second to California with 2,455       victims and survivors identified in Texas from over 2,000       calls to the hotline, which now includes texts and other       means for victims to communicate, according to a report       released last week by the Polaris Project. The calls led to       the identification of 515 traffickers and 240 businesses       involved in this illegal trade.        An analysis by Polaris comparing the hotline activity in       three periods this year to 2019 indicates that crisis has       worsened by about 40 percent, and that the pandemic has       impacted the victims' vulnerabilities, as well as the manner       of sex trafficking operations nationwide.        The number of cases identified through the hotline is only       a fraction of the prevalence of human trafficking, which is       defined as an individual being deceived or coerced into       prostitution, forced labor, or domestic servitude.        ``Calls have more to do with people on the ground knowing       about the hotline as a resource,'' said Ayan Ahmed, a Polaris       spokesperson. ``It's more about awareness.''        Because Houston is considered a hub for human trafficking,       the issue has gained significant awareness in the city, said       Ann  [[Page H7925]]       Johnson, former human trafficking prosecutor in Harris       County. She said hotlines might get more calls here ``because       our general population is more on alert.''        Elaine Andino, a director with the nonprofit United Against       Human Trafficking in Houston, said the prevalence of human       trafficking is hard to gauge because it's mostly a hidden       crime that flourishes in businesses posing as legal       enterprises or exploits victims who are too vulnerable to       report them.        Andino said the most reliable study available in Texas       about this illegal trade was published by the University of       Texas at Austin in 2016, which estimated that there are       310,000 victims of human trafficking at any given moment in       the state. Most are victims of labor trafficking, 234,500,       while 79,000 are minors and youth in sex trafficking.        Victims have been driven further underground and have       become more vulnerable as the pandemic forced the closure of       businesses, saw many employees let go, and prompted an       economic crisis, Andino said.        Many agencies providing services to victims were also       impacted and unable to receive new clients, according to the       Polaris report, titled ``Crisis in Human Trafficking During       the Pandemic.''        ``There are roughly about 500 beds in the entire country       for trafficking victims,'' Andino said. ``A lot of these       shelters are restricting how many people come into the       shelters to prevent COVID from spreading.''        While the pandemic closed businesses in industries where       human trafficking thrives, such as hospitality, restaurants       and bars, the criminal enterprise adapted by moving heavily       online.        ``A lot of victimization has just moved online,'' said       Andino. ``There are lots and lots of trafficking victims who       are forced to have sex on camera now; we saw a lot of that       really, really spike during COVID.'' Several reports point to       a significant increase in porn consumption during the       pandemic, with modalities such as cam sex and 3D services       gaining traction.        With social distancing, many men have avoided paying for in       person sex, but those who continue tend to be the most       reckless and violent, ``so it became even more of a scary       situation for trafficking victims'' vulnerability to abuse,       Andino added.        The pandemics effect has increased the very vulnerabilities       that put victims in the hands of traffickers in the first       place, said former prosecutor Johnson. For example, some       minors who are trying to escape abusive parenting get sucked       into trafficking. Also, immigrants are more likely to get       coerced by employers to work in dire conditions for little or       no pay.        ``Every victim I've seen, whether it's age, race,       background, the common theme, is vulnerability,'' said       Johnson.        Johnson insists that tackling human trafficking will       require increasing services to victims and prosecuting       exploiters, including sellers who profit from the business       and the consumer who pay for the abuse.        ``You need to continue the awareness constantly,'' said       Johnson. ``This is not like turning off the water faucet at       once.''                                   ____                   [From SpectrumNews1.com, Dec. 16, 2021]    Tips From Community Led Ohio Officials To Rescue 5 Suspected Human                            Trafficking Victims                             (By Lydia Taylor)         Ohio.--Ohio officials said five suspected human trafficking       victims were rescued this month after tips from community       members led them to two southern Ohio massage parlors.        The West Chester Police Department and the Chillicothe       Police Department contacted Ohio Bureau of Criminal       Investigation in June about tips received about an illegal       massage parlor. After investigating further, the BCI found       connections between two parlors: The Lucky Asian Bodywork,       1532 N. Bridge St., Chillicothe location and the Lucky Asian       Bodywork, 1532 N. Bridge St., Chillicothe location, according       to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost's office.        Officials executed search warrants on Dec. 7, finding five       victims who were offered medical attention and access to       other resources. Victim advocates were present during both       searches and talked with the women. Two women were found at       the Chillicothe location and the other three were at the West       Chester location.        The BCI is still investigating.        ``If you think human trafficking doesn't happen where you       live, you're wrong,'' Yost said. ``It happens everywhere       across our state and across every demographic. It happens       because of the demand, but won't happen in Ohio without       consequences--we're watching.''        Ohio is among the worst states for human trafficking.       According to data from the Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force,       between 2014-2020, more than 1,300 victims were identified by       officials. In 2019, Ohio ranked No. 4 for the most human       trafficking victims nationwide.        If you are in need of help or know of someone, you can dial       911, contact your local police department or call the       National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-3737-888.                                   ____                                [May 27, 2022]    Two Separate Human Trafficking Rescues in Tuscaloosa Within One Week                            (By Lauren Harksen)         Tuscaloosa, AL (WBRC).--Two teenage girls are now home with       their families after calling 911 from a Tuscaloosa hotel       room. It's the second human trafficking rescue in the city       within a week.        It's an issue becoming all-too common in the Tuscaloosa       area. Thankfully, the latest trafficking victims had a chance       to call for help, but it doesn't always end that way.        ``It's extremely unusual for them to call 911 and say, `Hey       we need help.' '' said Tuscaloosa Police Captain Phil       Simpson.        That call was from a 15-year-old and an 18-year-old       Wednesday night.        ``There came a time where they did not want to go any       farther with what was going on.'' said Captain Simpson.       ``Their initial request was that we help them get home.''        They wanted to return home to their families in a       neighboring state.        Captain Simpson says the two were brought to Tuscaloosa as       sex trafficking victims. Unfortunately, just one week ago, a       similar investigation happened in the area.        ``We've seen a lot of this activity increasing and we       believe it's leading up to the World Games in Birmingham,''       said Captain Simpson.        He is also Commander of the West Alabama Human Trafficking       Task Force and says when large-scale events like the World       Games are right around the corner, unlawful acts tend to       rise.        ``The traffickers want that business, so they're going to       go where there's a lot of people,'' he added. ``They're going       to take their victims to make them money where there is a lot       of people.''        In this day and age, Captain Simpson says most trafficking       victims are not abducted. Instead, they are coerced.        ``What we see is minors who are vulnerable,'' he said.       ``They become enamored with somebody on the internet that       they think is innocent and then they meet that person and it       goes from there . . . until it's too far or too late for the       victims to back out.''        Captain Simpson says the typical gateway for these       perpetrators is social media. He encourages parents to keep a       close eye on who your children are in contact with because       you never know who's on the other side of the screen.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as we have heard, the idea of human  trafficking is not going away. This legislation, I believe, will  provide us with the important instruction to give to those victims  where they may find some relief.   Human trafficking is a multibillion-dollar criminal industry that  denies freedom to nearly 25 million people around the world. It is an  ever-present threat to the health and safety of victims, many of whom  are children, but also poses grave danger to public health and safety  and national security.   Although the statistics we recite daily are breathtaking, they  represent a mere fraction of the instances of trafficking that occur,  as human trafficking is a highly underreported crime.   H.R. 7181, the Human Trafficking Prevention Act of 2022, would help  identify, protect, and provide essential services to victims of human  trafficking, who are often unseen, by requiring the posting of the  contact information for the National Human Trafficking Hotline so that  victims and anyone who sees someone who appears to be a victim know who  to call or text for help.   This is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that I urge all of my  colleagues to support, and I am seeking the support of my colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7181, the ``Human Trafficking Prevention Act of  2022,'' would provide for the posting of the contact information of the  National Human Trafficking Hotline in the restrooms of our country's  transportation centers--where we know many trafficking victims pass  through--as well as all federal buildings and ports of entry--to inform  victims and those who witness suspected trafficking situations that  help is available.   As I have said many times before, smuggling people across  international borders is an equally troubling crime, but distinct from  human trafficking. Smugglers must be prosecuted, and the exploitation  of their victims must not go unpunished.   And while many believe human trafficking happens only in other  countries, the victimization of adults, youth, and children for the  purposes of performing labor, commercial sex acts and other services  happens on an enormous scale in rural, urban, and suburban communities  across the United States.   H.R. 7181 would: require posting of the National Human Trafficking  Hotline's contact information in all federal buildings; require the  Department of Transportation and the Department of Health and Human  Services to coordinate with owners and operators of transportation  hubs, such as airports, bus stations, and train stations to post the  contact information  [[Page H7926]]  for the hotline in their restrooms; and require the Department of  Homeland Security--in consultation with the Department of Health and  Human Services and other appropriate federal agencies--to post the  hotline's contact information at every port of entry.   In 2020, more than 11,193 instances of potential human trafficking  were reported to the United States National Human Trafficking Hotline.   And in Texas, there are reportedly 313,000 victims of human  trafficking at any given time, including 79,000 children and youth who  are victims of sex trafficking and 234,000 adults who are victims of  labor trafficking.   Victims of human trafficking tend to be concealed, living in fear,  and isolated--in some cases physically and in other cases emotionally.   They might remain under the control of their traffickers for a  variety of reasons, including a lack of the basic necessities to  escape--like transportation or a safe place to go.   Some may be afraid for their safety. While others may not recognize  that they are under the control of their trafficker.   And even after they are rescued or escape, there is always the  possibility that victims will be revictimized.   The National Human Trafficking Hotline is an essential component of  the fight to end human trafficking. Offering toll-free phone lines and  SMS text lines, that are available 24 hours a day, every day of the  year, the hotline provides help, safety, and hope to victims and  survivors by connecting them to the support and services they need.   Victims in crisis can receive assistance with safety planning,  emotional support, and immediate connections to emergency services  while survivors can get help with rebuilding their lives.   The hotline also plays a vital role in combatting human trafficking  by helping law enforcement identify and rescue victims; by receiving  tips about potential situations of human trafficking; and by providing  reports of tips to the appropriate authorities.   We must make every effort to identify victims and ensure victims and  survivors of human trafficking are connected to services that can lead  them to safety and help them begin to restore their lives.   That begins with reaching them where they are and letting them know  who they can call for help without risking their safety.   Traffickers rely on our nation's transportation infrastructure to  transport their victims from city to city and state to state. In the  brief moments that allow victims to have a moment alone in the restroom  of a bus station or airport, they may be able to call--or even text-- for help.   Victims, survivors, and concerned citizens need to know that help is  just a phone call away because one call could mean the difference  between life and death.   Despite the clandestine nature of human trafficking, we have learned  from survivors that opportunities do exist to reach victims, and we  should make the most of them. H.R. 7181, the Human Trafficking  Prevention Act of 2022, does exactly that.   I thank Representatives Jeffries, Bass, Issa, and Mace for  introducing this strategic and practical measure.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill.   Human trafficking is a multi-billion-dollar criminal industry that  denies freedom to nearly 25 million people around the world. It as an  ever-present threat to the health and safety of victims, many of whom  are children, but also poses grave danger to public health and safety  and national security.   Although the statistics we recite daily are breathtaking, they  represent a mere fraction of the instances of trafficking that occur,  as human trafficking is a highly underreported crime.

This is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that I urge all of my  colleagues to support. Thank you.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 169) to amend title 17, United States Code, to require the  Register of Copyrights to waive fees for filing an application for  registration of a copyright claim in certain circumstances, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 169         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Artistic Recognition for       Talented Students Act'' or the ``ARTS Act''.       SEC. 2. WAIVER OF FEES FOR WINNERS OF CERTAIN COMPETITIONS.         Section 708 of title 17, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(e)(1) In this subsection, the term `covered competition'       means--        ``(A) an art competition sponsored by the Congressional       Institute that is open only to high school students; or        ``(B) the competition established under section 3 of House       Resolution 77, 113th Congress, agreed to February 26, 2013.        ``(2) With respect to a work that wins a covered       competition, the Register of Copyrights--        ``(A) shall waive the requirement under subsection (a)(1)       with respect to an application for registration of a       copyright claim for that work if that application is       submitted to the Copyright Office not later than the last day       of the calendar year following the year in which the work       claimed by the application wins the covered competition       (referred to in this paragraph as the `covered year'); and        ``(B) may waive a fee described in subparagraph (A) for an       application submitted after the end of the covered year if       the fee would have been waived under that subparagraph had       the application been submitted before the last day of the       covered year.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 169.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 169, the Artistic Recognition for Talented Students  Act, or the ARTS Act, would help introduce promising young students who  have won either the Congressional Art Competition or the Congressional  App Challenge to the intellectual property system by waiving the fee  for these students to apply for a copyright for their winning work.   I applaud the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) for introducing  the House version of this bipartisan, bicameral legislation with the  gentlewoman from South Carolina (Ms. Mace), along with several of my  colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, including Courts, Intellectual  Property, and the Internet Subcommittee Chairman Johnson and Ranking  Member Issa, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), and the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz).   The bill was passed under suspension last year. We are pleased today  to take up passage of the Senate version of the bill, championed by  Senators Leahy and Tillis, so the bill will pass both Chambers and  become law.   We in this Chamber know just how important intellectual property  rights are to our country and our economy, yet studies show that  awareness of intellectual property is lacking among the country's  students, even if they pursue fields that are IP intensive. The ARTS  Act helps close this awareness gap early on and allows these students  to participate in the intellectual property system without a financial  burden.   What it also does is help build the farm team for all of those who  will be protecting intellectual property in the  [[Page H7927]]  future. It gives them a sense of ownership, and it ties them to the  Constitution because intellectual property certainly is part of their  constitutional privilege, constitutional rights, and constitutional  protection.   Property rights are very important, and that is what intellectual  property is. It builds on Congress' work to encourage the creativity of  our Nation's youth with the establishment of the Congressional Art  Competition and the Congressional App Challenge. Year after year, in  both of these competitions, the talent of students displayed is  remarkable. I know it well in the candidates that I have seen and the  choices that our arts committee in Houston in the 18th Congressional  District has made. They are brilliant, and the apps are equally so.   Year after year, in both of these competitions, we see outstanding  work. Through both, we continue to see our youth encouraged to develop  their artistic and technical talents as Congress intended.   The ARTS Act makes these competitions even more impactful. Under the  bill, the students may apply to register a copyright for their winning  work or winning app for free. This introduces these students to the  intellectual property system and the benefits of copyright protection-- again, a constitutional right.   Under current law, the Register of Copyrights cannot waive these fees  on her own. The ARTS Act amends the Copyright Act to allow such a fee  waiver for these specific circumstances. Building the farm team, again,  is so very important.   Once again, I applaud the sponsors of the bill for bringing forward  this important legislation, which will aid the next generation of  creators and innovators.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, S. 169 is a short but important  bill that promotes education and awareness of intellectual property to  the next generation of creators. What an outstanding way to build the  farm team, to create a buy-in by the young geniuses of our time, both  in terms of the apps and arts and many other aspects.   Again, we recognize the constitutional connection to the idea of  property, copyright, intellectual property, and it is important for  young people to learn early on and to be protective of the genius of  America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, S. 169, the ``Artistic Recognition for Talented Students  Act'' or the ``ARTS Act,'' would help introduce promising young  students who have won either the Congressional Art Competition or the  Congressional App Challenge to the intellectual property system by  waiving the fee for those students to apply for a copyright  registration for their winning work.

Through both, we continue to see our  youth encouraged to develop their artistic and technical talents, as  Congress intended.   The ARTS Act makes these competitions even more impactful. Under the  bill, students may apply to register a copyright for their winning  artwork or winning app for free. This introduces these students to the  intellectual property system and the benefits of copyright protection.   Under current law, the Register of Copyrights cannot waive these fees  on her own. The ARTS Act amends the Copyright Act to allow such a fee  waiver for these specific circumstances.   Once again, I applaud the sponsors of the bill for bringing this  important legislation forward, which will aid the next generation of  creators and innovators.   I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4330) to maintain the free flow of information to the  public by establishing appropriate limits on the federally compelled  disclosure of information obtained as part of engaging in journalism,  and for other purposes, as amended.

(c) Notice to Covered Journalist and Opportunity to Be       Heard.--        (1) In general.--A court may authorize a Federal entity to       compel the provision of testimony or a document under this       section only after the Federal entity seeking the testimony       or document provides the covered journalist on behalf of whom       the testimony or document is stored pursuant to subsection       (a)--        (A) notice of the subpoena or other compulsory request for       such testimony or document from the covered service provider       not later than the time at which such subpoena or request is       issued to the covered service provider; and        (B) an opportunity to be heard before the court before the       time at which the provision of the testimony or document is       compelled.        (2) Exception to notice requirement.--        (A) In general.--Notice and an opportunity to be heard       under paragraph (1) may be delayed for not more than 45 days       if the court involved determines there is clear and       convincing evidence that such notice would pose a clear and       substantial threat to the integrity of a criminal       investigation, or would present an imminent risk of death or       serious bodily harm, including specified offenses against a       minor (as defined by section 111(7) of the Adam Walsh Child       Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (34 U.S.C. 20911(7))).        (B) Extensions.--The 45-day period described in       subparagraph (A) may be extended by the court for additional       periods of not more than 45 days if the court involved makes       a new and independent determination that there is clear and       convincing evidence that providing notice to the covered       journalist would pose a clear and substantial threat to the       integrity of a criminal investigation, or would present an       imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm under current       circumstances.       SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON CONTENT OF INFORMATION.         The content of any testimony, document, or protected       information that is compelled under sections 3 or 4 shall--        (1) not be overbroad, unreasonable, or oppressive, and as       appropriate, be limited to the purpose of verifying published       information or describing any surrounding circumstances       relevant to the accuracy of such published information; and        (2) be narrowly tailored in subject matter and period of       time covered so as to avoid compelling the production of       peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.       SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act shall be construed to--        (1) apply to civil defamation, slander, or libel claims or       defenses under State law, regardless of whether or not such       claims or defenses, respectively, are raised in a State or       Federal court; or        (2) prevent the Federal Government from pursuing an       investigation of a covered journalist or organization that       is--        (A) suspected of committing a crime;        (B) a witness to a crime unrelated to engaging in       journalism;        (C) suspected of being an agent of a foreign power, as       defined in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence       Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801);        (D) an individual or organization designated under       Executive Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; relating to       blocking property and prohibiting transactions with persons       who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism);        (E) a specially designated terrorist, as that term is       defined in section 595.311 of title 31, Code of Federal       Regulations (or any successor thereto); or        (F) a terrorist organization, as that term is defined in       section 212(a)(3)(B)(vi)(II) of the Immigration and       Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(vi)(II)).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4330.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4330, the Protect  Reporters from Exploitative State Spying Act, or the PRESS Act.   The PRESS Act would create a strong but qualified Federal statutory  privilege that protects journalists from being compelled by the Federal  Government to reveal confidential sources and information.   Additionally, the bill prohibits the Federal Government from  compelling an electronic service provider that stores a journalist's  information to disclose that information, as well as information  relating to the journalist's personal account or technology device, to  the government unless a court determines that there is a reasonable  threat of imminent violence absent the information's disclosure and  subject to other requirements and certain specified exceptions.   H.R. 4330 is necessary and long-overdue legislation.   Over the past several decades, Presidential administrations of both  parties have attempted to crack down on leaks of classified information  to media outlets, and these investigations have included efforts to  obtain journalists' records. For example, just last year, The  Washington Post, The New York Times, and CNN reported that the  Department of Justice under the Trump administration sought the  information and records of their reporters.   The most sacred part of our freedom includes the protection and  freedom of the press. That is embedded in the Constitution in our First  Amendment in the Bill of Rights, so to hear and to see that glaring  infraction shows us the necessity of this legislation before us.   In addition, during the Obama administration, the Department  reportedly searched FOX News reporter James Rosen's emails and even  listed him as a coconspirator in an Espionage Act case it brought  against a source of the leaked information.   These and other recent episodes illustrate the need for stronger  Federal protections for journalists and their sources.   The truth is cleansing. The truth is democracy.   Indeed, 40 States and the District of Columbia have enacted press  shield laws, while other States afford similar privileges through their  State constitution of common law.   Moreover, there has been longstanding and bipartisan support in  Congress for Federal protections. In  [[Page H7929]]  2005, former Vice President Mike Pence, when he was a Member of this  body, first introduced the Free Flow of Information Act, which was very  similar in concept to H.R. 4330. That legislation subsequently passed  the House twice in the 110th and the 111th Congresses, the first time  by 398-21, and the second time by voice vote. Unfortunately, the Senate  never took action on these bills, but I am pleased that efforts to  advance a Federal reporters shield bill continue in the House today.   Again, we must stand for liberty. It is my hope that the Senate will  finally take up this important issue.   I thank Congressmen Jamie Raskin, Ted Lieu, and   John Yarmuth for  their work on the PRESS Act. I also thank the Judiciary Committee  ranking member,   Jim Jordan, for his support.   The need for this legislation is as great, if not greater, than when  it was first introduced in an earlier form many years ago.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  important bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), the author of the PRESS Act, who has been  persistent in his commitment to civil liberties as an important member  of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just comment, as I determine whether we have any  further speakers, that this protection of the First Amendment rights of  our journalists are so crucial, and this legislation enjoys bipartisan  support.   We have already made the point that we have found some offense of  this in bipartisan officeholders, government, so I think it is  important, in the spirit of harmony today, that we choose no President  to suggest one was more so than the others, and I can't think of any  comparison to the previous administration. But, today, we are standing  here and wanting to bring people together around the importance of  ensuring that the press is protected and shielded, that the truth is  cleansing, and that the truth is heard.   Clearly, in the Trump administration, the truth was challenged, and  we are grateful that the press stood tall.   I believe this legislation is extremely important to cleanse all  persons in public life so that public officials can serve in the spirit  of transparency and that journalists can provide the facts to all the  people of America.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, H.R. 4330 is a bipartisan effort similar  to legislation worked on by Vice President Pence.                                time  1715    The Judiciary Committee reported the bill on a bipartisan basis by  voice vote. In addition, H.R. 4330 is supported by numerous civil  liberties and journalist organizations, including the American Civil  Liberties Union, Demand Progress, the Society of Professional  Journalists, the News Media Alliance, the National Association of  Broadcasters, the National Press Photographers Association, the Radio  Television Digital News Association, the News Leaders Association,  MPA--the Association of Magazine Media, the Project for Privacy and  Surveillance Accountability, and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of  the Press.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4330, the ``Protect  Reporters from Exploitative State Spying Act'' or the ``PRESS Act.''  The PRESS Act would create a strong, but qualified, federal statutory  privilege that protects journalists from being compelled by the federal  government to reveal confidential sources and information.   Additionally, the bill prohibits the federal government from  compelling an electronic service provider that stores a journalist's  information to disclose that information, as well as information  relating to the journalist's personal account or technology device, to  the government, unless a court determines that there is a reasonable  threat of imminent violence absent the information's disclosure, and  subject to other requirements and certain specified exceptions.

The need for this legislation is as great, if not greater, than when  it was first introduced in its earlier form many years ago.   I urge all my colleagues to vote YES on this important bipartisan  legislation.   As I noted earlier, H.R. 4330 and similar federal press shield  legislation has long enjoyed strong bipartisan support. The Judiciary  Committee reported the bill on a bipartisan basis by voice vote.   In addition, H.R. 4330 is supported by numerous civil liberties and  journalists' organizations, including the American Civil Liberties  Union, Demand Progress, the Society of Professional Journalists, the  News Media Alliance, the National Association of Broadcasters, the  National Press Photographers Association, the Radio Television Digital  News Association, the News Leaders Association, MPA--The Association of  Magazine Media, the Project for Privacy and Surveillance  Accountability, Protect The 1st, and the Reporters Committee for  Freedom of the Press.   Given the broad support for the bill and the pressing need for  federal protections for journalists and their sources, I urge the House  to pass H.R. 4330.   Mr. Speaker, given the broad support of the bill and the pressing  need for Federal protections for journalists and their sources, I urge  the House to pass H.R. 4330, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3034) to amend title 28, United States Code, to provide  an additional place for holding court for the Western District of  Washington, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3034         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ADDITIONAL PLACE FOR HOLDING COURT FOR THE WESTERN                     DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.         Section 128(b) of title 28, United States Code, is amended       by inserting ``Mount Vernon,'' after ``Tacoma,''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3034.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H7931]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3034 which would amend title  28 of the U.S. Code to provide an additional place for holding court in  the Western District of Washington.   This one-sentence bill would allow the residents of that district  which is comprised of half of Washington State from the Cascade  Mountains to the Pacific Ocean to attend Federal Court in Mount Vernon,  Washington, halfway between Seattle and the Canadian border.   Currently, residents of the surrounding counties, including the third  most populous county in the State, have to travel significant distances  to access the Federal justice system leading to increased travel time  and administrative costs. Adding Mount Vernon as an additional court  location would alleviate those burdens. It would also be a cost-free  change because there is an existing facility available for the court to  use, and no court personnel would be permanently stationed there.  Making use of this existing facility would ensure that litigants,  attorneys, witnesses, and other court users would have greater access  to the justice that our Federal courts provide.   Mr. Speaker, the Judiciary Committee is the holder, protector, and  nurturer of the Constitution. There is probably nothing as important  among other elements but for the right to a trial by jury or right to  be heard as a litigant in a court. This important legislation is  suggesting that those who may have difficulty or are even deprived  because of distance or other issues dealing with the far reaches of  where this court is away from them can now have unfettered access to  court in their region, in their area.   This move will benefit the many individuals who live, work, and do  business in northwest Washington which is very far from the present  site of the Federal Court. This legislation is broadly supported by the  judges, attorneys, prosecutors, public defenders, and law enforcement  in the Western District of Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Suzan DelBene and Rick Larsen for  calling attention to this issue and for introducing this legislation to  improve the lives of the residents of Washington State. Chairman Nadler  and all of the members of the Judiciary Committee were very pleased to  work with this legislation, and Congresswoman DelBene and Congressman  Larsen to be able to make this fix to provide an additional pathway of  justice and the protection of the constitutional rights of individuals  to have their access to courts and to trials by jury.   At this point, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is good music and good sounds to hear my colleague  indicating that this legislation has widespread support, and he is  absolutely right.   The only point that I would want to emphasize is that whenever this  body and this Judiciary Committee can expand the rights to the  protection of Americans and their rights to access justice, we should  stand tall.   Today, this legislation, with a small fix of providing an additional  site for the people of western Washington to access their  constitutional, judicial, and legal rights, I think this is a  celebration. So because of the broad support for this, we are  delighted.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 3034, and make known that it is a  straightforward bill that will improve the administration of justice in  Washington State and will reinforce our duty and responsibility to the  American people for justice.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3034, which would amend title  28 of the U.S. Code to provide an additional place for holding court in  the Western District of Washington.   This one-sentence bill would allow residents of that district, which  comprises half of Washington state--from the Cascade Mountains to the  Pacific Ocean--to attend federal court in Mount Vernon, Washington,  halfway between Seattle and the Canadian border.

I thank Representatives Suzan DelBene and Rick Larsen for calling  attention to this issue and for introducing this legislation to improve  the lives of the residents of Washington state.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3034 is a straightforward bill that will improve  the administration of justice in Washington State. I urge my colleagues  to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise to begin the discussion that I  think we will continue in days to come and even into the new year, and  that is to discuss the Congressional Black Caucus' accomplishments in  this Congress, the 117th.   By its very nature, the tenure and the breadth and depth of members  of the Congressional Black Caucus, I believe that we can be talking for  a very long time, and so this will probably be a continuum to tell the  American people how we have been helping to ensure that they have a  better quality of life.   I am very proud to join with the chairwoman of the Congressional  Black Caucus, Joyce Beatty, who has led us, in the 117th Congress, to  be instrumental in the lives of intergenerations, across generational  lines, and to ensure that those who are at the beginning of life, and  those at the end of life, and those in between raising their families,  know that the Congressional Black Caucus is standing with them.   One particularly unique example of that is, of course, the HBCU  conference that is going on this week, where HBCUs are coming from all  over the country. And it is interesting to be able to associate, not  only our colleague, Alma Adams, as the chair of the HBCU Caucus, of  which I am a member and many of our colleagues are members, including I  see on the floor, Chairman Scott.   Under his leadership, the HBCUs have gotten more money--than I  believe in the history of many of our tenure here in the United States  Congress--working with President Biden. This is the leadership of the  Congressional Black Caucus.   So let me quickly begin my comments, and I will look forward to  yielding to my friends who are here, including my colleague and friend  from Louisiana, Mr. Troy Carter, Congressman Carter, who is the new  vice chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus. And I know that we  are looking forward to many days of action on behalf of the children of  America and on behalf of children of color and African-American  children.   Members of the Congressional Black Caucus strongly support the  President's goal of passing legislation that will significantly reduce  healthcare costs for all Americans.   The Inflation Reduction Act will significantly reduce, and has  significantly reduced, prescription drug costs and expanded healthcare  coverage for millions of Black Americans, relieving financial strains  on individuals and families.   What I think is most important is the work that many of us on the  Congressional Black Caucus did, including the work that I advocated  with our whip,  Jim Clyburn, and Senator Warnock. We were on it for the  $35 cap on insulin, along with our colleagues. It was driven and  inspired by members of the Congressional Black Caucus to ensure that  insulin, which now is one of the driving forces of creating a better  quality of life for our seniors--you can say that the Congressional  Black Caucus was intimately involved in that.   We were intimately involved in ensuring that it has a fair response  to climate change around the issue of bringing down the cost of energy  for our families in America. And of course, that impacts Black  families.    This new law will help bring down energy costs for millions of Black  Americans, and it includes very strong protections and programs to  promote environmental justice.   Of course, we worked extensively on the bipartisan infrastructure  law. That was, of course, a very pivotal role for those of us in the  Congressional Black Caucus. Black, Hispanic, Asian American, Pacific  Islander, Native Americans, especially those who reside in urban  communities, are more likely to be negatively impacted by pollution.  Black people are almost three times more likely to die from asthma- related causes than their White counterparts.   And, of course, the Congressional Black Caucus led in negotiations to  assure that this was a balanced bill.   In particular, my constituents have already seen the magnificent  results of the once-in-a-generation piece of legislation. Houston METRO  was granted a $21 million grant to buy battery-powered electric buses,  and it has helped it move to the next level, next generation of rapid  transit, and plans to go to the airports, both Hobby and Bush  Intercontinental, in my district, with bipartisan infrastructure  dollars.   And as a hurricane-prone community, as many of the Gulf States are,  from Louisiana to Texas and Mississippi, the bipartisan infrastructure  bill will help us work on those flood-  [[Page H7949]]  prone areas and ensure the safety and life of so many.   I am excited about how the Congressional Black Caucus gravitated  around the Juneteenth legislation, the first bill in almost 40 years  that created a Federal holiday which was signed on June 17, 2021. I am  very pleased to be the first Member to introduce legislation to ensure  that there was a holiday after 10 years of introducing the resolutions,  and the culmination of all of these years, and particularly, the  culmination of Opal Lee, who came on a hot day in 2019, and brought us  a million petitions--she was in her nineties--to ensure that Juneteenth  could become a Federal holiday.   Her work in getting all those petitions, the introduction of the  legislation that I was proud to introduce, and ultimately presiding  over the floor--all of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus  were strong proponents of this, and we could not have done it without  their leadership and urgency.   Many of you know that Juneteenth represents two more years of slavery  for those west of the Mississippi, until General Granger came with  Order Number 15 to announce that the slaves were free, because the  South had not adhered to the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. So he came  to Galveston, Texas, General Granger, announcing the end of the Civil  War and the freedom of the last Americans enslaved in the Confederate  States.   Since the 1800s, Juneteenth has been an important commemoration to  African Americans. Even as Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois  reminded us that--Frederick Douglass, in particular--there is no power  with struggle. And, of course, W.E.B. Du Bois talked to us about ``The  Talented Tenth.''   That means that the work of the Congressional Black Caucus is keen,  and we are keen to make sure that the work that is done continues to  emphasize what is best for them.   Let me also take note of the support of African Americans in helping  to assure--and the Congressional Black Caucus, with the leadership of  Chairwoman Beatty, and working with the Judiciary Committee, the  chairman of the full committee, Nadler, subcommittee, Cohen and myself,  and the members of the Congressional Black Caucus on the Judiciary  Committee, we were able to mark up for the first time in history, H.R.  40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparations Proposals for  African Americans Act.   What a powerful experience, first, with two hearings, bringing people  from all over, including the author and proponent of the 1619 Project,  and leaders and scholars who understood that this is simply restoration  and repair, and this must be created as a commission by law, by vote,  or executive order.   In addition, glad to have the help of the Congressional Black Caucus  on the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, a reauthorization act  that I introduced. And in it were many aspects of work or language for  people of color for the first time; training for young men and boys on  how to deal with the issue of violence, and also the question of rape  and how we should be working on that.   We followed with massive work on education, as I indicated, doing  more for primary and secondary education than could ever be imagined,  under the leadership of Chairman  Bobby Scott.   I will conclude my remarks in order to yield to my friends. I want to  be able to say that during the midst of the pandemic, there were  several things that the Congressional Black Caucus led on. One, to push  testing into our community where there was none; to push vaccines and  vaccinations into our community where there were none; and to ensure  that we focused on lost learning and our children who did not have  access to broadband.   It was our voices that made it loud and clear. Ultimately, broadband  access has been put more and more into the bipartisan infrastructure  bill. But during the pandemic, it was the voices of the Congressional  Black Caucus that insisted that we do better with respect to these  children who had no access. The stories were large and looming. They  were frightening, and I am glad that our voices continue.   There are many other litanies of issues dealing with climate change,  dealing with criminal justice reform. It was because of us that  ultimately we introduced the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, one  of two bills named after George Floyd.   Because of all the work we did, with Karen Bass and all the members  of the CBC, all the work that we did ultimately resulted in an  executive order that we do know, as indicated by executive order, that  you will have no more choke holds, no more no-knocks, and more that  we hope to put into statutory law. We are excited that the bill did  include large aspects of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.    With that in mind, I am delighted to be able to yield to--as I talk  further about some of these important elements of the work of the  Congressional Black Caucus, but I am pleased now to yield to the  chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee so that he can  evidence the Congressional Black Caucus' 117th Congress accomplishments  through the works that he has done on his committee, the Education and  Labor Committee.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott),  chairman of the Education and Labor Committee.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks. It is clear that there is a new day on the Committee on  Education and Labor. That committee, led by Chairman Scott, has shown  itself to be the people's committee, and I am delighted that his  longstanding membership with the Congressional Black Caucus has shown  that his work is for all of America. But through the Congressional  Black Caucus he has helped and elevated families who have suffered  because of racial discrimination and because of economic inequities. He  has been focused.   Certainly, I credit him again with the work that has been done on  HBCUs. I can assure you, with HBCUs in Texas, everywhere I go, they are  taking note of the increased funding that has allowed them to do issues  or handle matters with physical infrastructure, scholarship, the new  Pell grant executive order, student loan executive order that is  allowing for those with Pell grant loans making $120,000 to get $20,000  in relief. The Congressional Black Caucus worked extensively to ensure  that those people with student loans were not forgotten.   Let me say it again. We work without ceasing to ensure that  individuals who were overburdened with student loans, couldn't get down  payments for housing and other matters for their quality of life--we  were ensuring that we were in the front, if you will, to continue to  advocate for student loan reduction.   Let me just say this, as I prepare to yield to my dear friend on the  floor here.   As poet Langston Hughes reminds us, in his famous poem ``Mother to  Son,'' life in America for African Americans ``ain't been no crystal  stair.''   The goodness of this message is that in spite of it all, African  Americans have put on uniforms and fought their battles on behalf of  this Nation. African Americans are great lovers of this country, and  they are great patriots. African Americans have worked in every level  of government. They have, of course, been individuals who have worked,  as some will say, at the bottom of the totem pole, meaning every manner  of work they have done.   There have been African Americans who were enslaved who helped build  the White House and the very building that we are in, never to hold the  anger of their station in life but continue to work to insist on a  better quality of life for their families.   It is very much important to take note of the bills that we have been  able to do as individual Members of Congress.   I am just going to cite H.R. 7566, stops human trafficking in  schools, that I introduced; working with an amendment to the Workforce  Innovation bill; ensuring HBCU's full access to job skills training;  amendment to H.R. 8294, the Transportation, Housing, and Urban  Development appropriations bill to ensure that HBCUs had specific  work--it supports the work of the National Institute of Food and  Agriculture by increasing the funding by $2 million.   Then I will finish more deeply on H.R. 40. That bill is much  exhibited, as I have been on the floor before, with this slave and his  back and the welts on his back from a whip. This was the life of  slavery in America.   I just read recently of Germany's response to aging holocaust  victims, which I applaud, providing millions of dollars to respond to  their pain, just recently. In the course of the commission to study  slavery and develop reparation proposals, it would give America a  moment of healing. We have been hearing this discussion across the  Nation and across the world, most recently, of course, in the halls or  the places in Great Britain.   But for America to take that stand that the discussion is worthy,  that the study is worthy, that the idea of what kind of proposals would  come about, what inclusive ways would we deal with the recognition of  over two centuries of slavery--unpaid, no insurance, no workers' comp,  no days off, from sunup to darkness, beat by the whip, as the slave  narratives in 1939 told us. The stories are powerful. Ripped away from  our families. Made families, husband and wife and children. Then you  would hear the pleas in the slave narratives when they say, ``Come  home, husband. They are about to sell me and the children in different  ways and different places.'' It happened to slaves all the time.    I was honored and humbled to meet the survivors of the Wall Street  massacre. It happened in 1921. Those people were, in actuality, some  even former slaves, but mostly descendants of the most recent people  who were slaves, the most recent, their ancestors or their mother might  have been a slave. But they built a Wall Street, but yet it could not  survive because of racism and discrimination.   So to heal our land, the Congressional Black Caucus has worked in  many ways to heal our land, and I am grateful for their advocacy for  just a fair and simple study and assessment of what we should do to  repair what occurred two centuries and continues even today.   The story is long about the inequities of the GI Bill, redlining,  discrimination in voting, in the criminal justice system, the basis of  wealth, so distinctive between other populations in this country.   So I thank the Congressional Black Caucus for the extensive  legislative history that it has had over the 117th Congress.   It really is my privilege, Madam Speaker, to yield to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Carter) to speak about the accomplishments of the  Congressional Black Caucus, my dear colleague and friend who has shown  himself a leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
