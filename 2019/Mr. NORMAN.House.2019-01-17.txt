 Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of life. Psalm  127:3 reminds us:         Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from       him.    With 4 children and 16 grandchildren, I know what a special gift each  child is. On the eve of the March for Life, I am proud to gather with  my colleagues to recognize the important work being done to protect  each life each and every day.   I look forward to supporting legislation that recognizes the value of  life and provides protection for each life, starting from the very  beginning. I will remain a strong advocate for the sanctity of life and  continue to be a voice for those who cannot speak for themselves.   We should celebrate every life and cherish the potential each child  possesses. As we March for Life, we show the world the value we place  on life today and every other day of the year.                            ____________________
