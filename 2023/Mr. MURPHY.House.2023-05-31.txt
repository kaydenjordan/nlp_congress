 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Fiscal  Responsibility Act.   Over 100 days ago, President Biden said he would not negotiate.  Republicans, acting on behalf of this country, forced him to negotiate.   The bill alters our fiscal trajectory and helps remedy the Federal  Government's insatiable spending problem.   This landmark legislation lowers nondefense discretionary spending  and forces Congress to employ a functioning appropriations process.   More importantly, the measure doesn't result in new taxes and doesn't  touch Social Security, Medicare, or veterans' benefits.   Is the bill perfect? Absolutely not.   Is it a step in the right direction? Absolutely. CBO scores a  decrease in spending of $1.9 trillion.   Let's not forget, Rome was not built in a day. It is now up to  Republicans to make the necessary cuts to rein in our terrible spending  and our terrible debt of $31 trillion.   I urge my colleagues to support this landmark legislation.                                time  1945
