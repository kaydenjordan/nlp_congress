 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  the VA Infrastructure Powers Exceptional Research Act, called the VIPER  Act, that the House will consider today.   In Buffalo in 1958, Dr. William Chardack and engineer Wilson  Greatbatch teamed up to develop the first implantable pacemaker at our  Buffalo VA hospital. Today, more than 3 million people around the world  have implanted pacemakers, and the VA Pacemaker Program still monitors  more than 11,000 veterans with pacemakers.   The VIPER Act will build on this record, bringing us another step  toward the next generation of life-saving treatments.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join in supporting this  legislation. It is an investment in a stronger future for veterans and  our healthcare system overall.  [[Page H8517]]                                ____________________
