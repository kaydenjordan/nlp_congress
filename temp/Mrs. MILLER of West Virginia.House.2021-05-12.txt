 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share  stories of employers across the country who are struggling to find and  hire employees.   According to April's disastrous jobs report, there are 8.1 million  job openings in the United States. Employers can't fill them and, as a  result, can't operate their businesses effectively.   The extended unemployment handouts my colleagues across the aisle  keep reauthorizing incentivize workers to stay at home and collect  unemployment rather than go to work.   I have talked with countless small business owners who cannot compete  with these handouts and are facing a grave workforce shortage.   I recently visited with manufacturers in Minnesota. They have had to  reduce their output on medical device orders by 20 percent because  workers, who they pay between $14 and $16 an hour, are making more on  unemployment and choosing to stay at home.   Paying people not to work won't help us recover from COVID-19. We  must encourage people to get back into the workforce and not stay on  the sidelines.   The opportunity to work hard and get ahead is a pillar of the  American Dream. Pursuing a career, providing for a family, and  supporting our communities, these are the things we should encourage  and celebrate.   We have got the vaccines. Now it is time to get back to work.
