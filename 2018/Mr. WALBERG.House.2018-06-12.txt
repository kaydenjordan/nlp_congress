 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I  thank Congresswoman Debbie Dingell for working with me on this  bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5009, Jessie's Law.   Everywhere I go in Michigan, I hear about the opioid crisis. It truly  is the crisis next door. For many of our friends and loved ones, the  terrifying realities of addiction are difficult to escape.   The story behind Jessie's Law is a tragic one. The bill is named in  memory of Jessie Grubb, a young woman living in Michigan at the time  she died of an opioid overdose. Jessie was training for a marathon when  a running injury required her to undergo surgery.   Before the procedure, Jessie and her parents informed the hospital  that she was in recovery from addiction; however, that information  never made it to her discharging physician. Jessie was unknowingly  discharged from the hospital with a prescription for oxycodone, which  ultimately led to her death. If Jessie's history of addiction had been  noted on her chart in a manner similar to other potentially lethal  medical concerns, like a drug allergy, Jessie might still be here  today.   Jessie's tragic story was entirely preventable and is an example of  why we need commonsense legislation like Jessie's Law.   Jessie's Law will require the Department of Health and Human Services  to establish best practices for hospitals and physicians for sharing  information about a patient's past opioid addiction when that  information is willingly shared by the patients with their doctor. By  ensuring medical professionals are equipped with the right processes  and tools to safely treat their patients, we can prevent future  overdose tragedies like Jessie's.   Mr. Speaker, the opioid crisis is devastating the dreams of a  generation. Let's pass Jessie's Law today and help save lives in our  communities.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5041, the Safe Disposal of Unused Medication Act is  a bipartisan, commonsense bill that simply allows trained hospice  personnel to dispose of unused medications in a patient's home once the  patient has passed away.   For patients in hospice care, opioid medication can be effective in  alleviating pain associated with the end-of-life care. Unfortunately,  current DEA regulations restrict visiting home hospice personnel from  disposing of leftover medication after the patient has passed away. As  a result, hospice staff must leave behind dangerous medications that  have a high risk for diversion or misuse.   In my home State of Michigan, we have seen some real challenges with  the diversion and misuse of leftover medications that have contributed  to the opioid crisis.   Earlier this year, the Energy and Commerce Committee heard testimony  that just one hospice, caring for 2,000 patients per year, might be  leaving behind tens of thousands of pills in need of disposal each  year. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 1.4  million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in hospice care in 2016.  This means hospice workers across the country are potentially leaving  huge quantities of unused medication in a home after a patient's death.   Mr. Speaker, we must act to curb the diversion of these powerful  prescriptions. We know that, tragically, many people begin the cycle of  addiction through the misuse of prescription medication. Hospices and  hospice personnel could play a key role in stopping that cycle before  it begins by ensuring powerful drugs are disposed of in a responsible  manner once they are no longer needed by the intended patient.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the committee staff for all of  their hard work in getting this commonsense bill on the floor today, as  well as my good friends Representative Debbie Dingell, who worked  closely with me on this legislation, and Representative Richard Hudson,  as well, for their support on this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5041.
