 Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire, first of all, if the  gentleman from Arizona has any speakers. I do have several.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity to be here. I also  appreciate Mr. Cole for his work on this particular issue and the time  he has put in over the last decade in trying to find a Carcieri fix.   That 2009 Supreme Court made the decision, but it actually opened up  more questions than it provided solutions and answers in the process.   In the years since that decision, the Democrats, when they controlled  the House, the Senate, and the White House, did not find a solution.  Republicans, when we were in the same situation, didn't find a solution  either, probably because there is even a bigger question than what was  decided in this particular case. That bigger question is one that is  extremely complex and grave, and it indicates the complexity of this  particular issue.   Lands taken into trust by Tribes definitely have a benefit and an  advantage to the Tribe, but it also has an impact on the counties and  local governments where this trust issue is taking place.   Let's be clear that, prior to Carcieri, the fee-to-trust process was  broken and fraught with conflicts. In fact, many will still argue that  even today, the current Bureau of Indian Affairs process provides very  limited incentives for any community or stakeholder to be partners in  this process. As a result, we are often left with conflict and  political turmoil and accusations and recriminations on the local  level.   Some areas of local government, especially the California State  Association of Counties, have been repeatedly asking us to try to come  up with a reform to the overall process because the process impacts  taxes and zoning in communities where these trust lands are acquired.   Local governments, States, and stakeholders who have some kind of  role to play in this area, should they have a seat at the table? Should  they be consulted? Should they have some kind of input? Yes, obviously.   Should they have a veto in the process? I don't think so.   Where we draw that line to ensure that there is consultation, so you  ensure that people have a voice in the process, that is the underlying  question. That is the complex question.   During markup of this bill, Mr. Huffman from California and Mr. Gosar  from Arizona entered into a colloquy. They actually had a discussion,  one of the few times a committee did what a committee is supposed to  do, talking about the need to come up with some kind of variance to  this underlying issue that is not necessarily the crux of the 2009  decision. But how do we come up with this process?    If this bill is going to go all the way to the Senate and ultimately  become law, we need some help in finding a solution to the bigger issue  of how much  [[Page H3815]]  consultation should take place and who should have their voices heard  in the overall process, a process that does not happen right now.   There is a pathway to solve these problems. We can address Carcieri  or we can move forward to prevent future litigation that has plagued  the land-in-trust process. The Tribes and every stakeholder in this  process deserve as much.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Grijalva).   If we, indeed, are going to be serious about a legislative solution  to Carcieri, then we need to work out some kind of compromise that  could pass both Houses of Congress and be signed by the President.   I have been encouraged by the debate not only on the floor here, but  also in our committee, regarding the need to consult with affected  parties before land is taken into trust.   Mr. Speaker, I ask Mr. Grijalva whether he will commit to work with  us on this type of legislation to solve this underlying problem as this  bill moves forward?    I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the  gentleman's commitment and I appreciate the comments that he will be  there.   There is this bigger question that needs to be answered. Where we  draw the line is a matter that still needs some kind of discussion, I  recognize that.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a brilliant letter from me to  Chairman Grijalva on this particular issue'                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                        Washington, DC, May 6, 2019.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: It is frustrating that the Democrat       Leadership has scheduled H.R. 375, legislation to reverse       Carcieri v. Salazar, under suspension one week after the       committee markup of the bill. It disregards what I believe       was a bipartisan agreement to work on an amendment to the       bill to improve consultation between the Bureau of Indian       Affairs (BIA) and states and counties to mitigate the impacts       of taking land in trust in their jurisdictions. The Carcieri       decision created vast uncertainty over the fee-to-trust       process for tribes and impacted stakeholders. I voted for       H.R. 375 in committee as a display of my support for       resolving Carcieri. My support for the bill's advancement is       contingent upon the inclusion of reasonable safeguards on       BIA's powers.        During markup on H.R. 375, Messrs. Huffman and Gosar       discussed a mutual, bipartisan desire to respond to long-      standing state and local concerns. The California State       Association of Counties (CSAC), in a letter submitted for the       markup record, reiterated the counties' ``longstanding, valid       concerns'' they have with a fee-to-trust process conducted       under a ``fundamentally flawed regulatory framework'' and       they also submitted proposals to resolve these problems. I       can attest that many counties in Utah share these same       concerns.        Mr. Huffman explained that he found himself in partial       agreement with CSAC's position, and that there should be       ``meaningful good faith consultation'' with local       governments. While saying the Gosar amendment went too far,       Mr. Huffman expressed a willingness to ``continue       collaborating on this issue'' to ``come up with something       that would at least codify that good faith consultation part       of a better process.''        Bringing the bill to the Floor this Wednesday is not a sign       that such collaboration is being taken seriously by Democrat       Leadership nor is it a pragmatic approach to resolving       Carcieri for the benefit of Indian Country.        The fee-to-trust system is broken because of a provision of       a 1934 law that has not been updated since that law's       enactment. Realistically, H.R. 375 offers an opportunity       through which to fix it. Moving forward without reasonable       consultation safeguards on BIA's authority will undermine       successful resolution of Carcieri.        It was our hope that after debate on the bill during markup       you'd allow Messrs. Huffman and Gosar, and other interested       Members (on and off the Committee), an opportunity to explore       solutions with H.R. 375's sponsor, Mr. Tom Cole. We need to       work on a compromise bill that solves the underlying issues       and can become law.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,                                                    Ranking Member.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
