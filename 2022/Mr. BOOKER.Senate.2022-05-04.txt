 Madam President, the instruction by my colleague from  Wisconsin directs conferees to reject bipartisan House language that  addresses a serious public health concern related to mink farming.   Mink farms in Europe and the United States have spawned five COVID-19  variants that have collectively infected thousands of people. The next  mink variant could infect millions of people. Vaccinations do not  prevent infection or transmission in mink, and the risk of virus  mutation on mink farms remains significant.   Today, there are only 60 mink farms left in the United States, and  they sell their furs to buyers in China, not here. Americans have  stopped buying fur because keeping these semiaquatic wild animals in  cages and breaking their necks to kill them for fur is inhumane.   More than a dozen European countries have already phased out mink  farming because of the serious pandemic risks they present. The United  States should immediately follow suit.   I urge my colleagues, for the health of our country, to join me in  voting no on this motion to instruct.                                Vote on Motion    I ask for the yeas and nays.
