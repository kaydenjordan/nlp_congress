 Madam Speaker, let me first thank the chair for her  leadership and friendship on our committee.   Madam Speaker, just a little bit of history. I want to take you back  to 1860. President Lincoln won the general election in 1860 by winning  18 of 29 States.   Madam Speaker, the 11 States that Lincoln failed to carry were slave- holding States. These States were fearful that Lincoln would find a way  to end slavery and deprive slave owners of their free labor. Eleven  Southern States immediately seceded from the Union, forming the  Confederate States of America. The CSA elected its leadership, they  printed a currency, and they set up a military.   At Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, the CSA took military action  against the United States of America. For the following 4 years, more  than 600,000 Americans lost their lives on the battlefield, including  Black Union soldiers. This was not a war between the States; it was a  war against the United States by 11 Southern States, including my  State.   When the Union finally won the war and both sides buried their dead,  4 million slaves were granted their freedom by the passage and  ratification of the 13th Amendment.   In 1864, each State was granted the privilege to donate two statues  of deceased persons to be displayed in this Capitol that depict the  history of their State. These statues are now known as the National  Statuary Hall Collection.   Approximately 10 of these statues depict men who volunteered to fight  against the United States in the Civil War. All of these statues were  donated many decades after the Civil War. Like many other statues  around the country honoring members of the Confederate States of  America, particularly those erected in the South, these 10 statues were  not donated and installed in the Capitol until the 1900s, during the  height of the Jim Crow era.   Many Americans see these statues and the timing of their placement to  intimidate Black Americans and to perpetuate the notion of white  supremacy. We must not continue to honor these combatants by allowing  their images to be displayed in this Capitol.   The bill before us today, Madam Speaker, identifies several other  statues for removal that are not part of the collection, including the  bust of Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, who authored the 1857 Supreme  Court decision of Dred Scott that ruled that slaves could not be  considered citizens and that Congress did not have the ability to ban  slavery. This opinion, Madam Speaker, is regarded as possibly the  Supreme Court's worst decision of all time, and the 7-2 decision was a  major factor contributing to the Civil War.   Another bust not a part of the National Statuary Hall Collection is  for Vice President John Breckinridge, 1856 to 1859. In 1860,  Breckinridge ran for President on the Southern Democratic ticket and he  lost. During the Civil War, Breckinridge served in the United States  Senate, from Kentucky, but became a traitor and enlisted in the  Confederate military and assigned to the Army of Mississippi, achieving  the rank of Major General. And it gets worse. He was expelled from the  United States Senate. Jefferson Davis then appointed him as Secretary  of War. After the war, he fled the country for several years.   Madam Speaker, this statue must also be removed.   I ask my colleagues to answer the summons of our time by voting to  remove these statues from the Capitol of the United States of America.                                time  1515
