Congress finds that--        (1) attempts have been made to prohibit usurious interest       rates in America since colonial times;        (2) at the Federal level, in 2006, Congress enacted a       Federal 36-percent annualized usury cap for servicemembers       and their families for covered credit products, as defined by       the Department of Defense, which curbed payday, car title,       and tax refund lending around military bases;        (3) notwithstanding such attempts to curb predatory       lending, high-cost lending persists in all 50 States due to       loopholes in State laws, safe harbor laws for specific forms       of credit, and the exportation of unregulated interest rates       permitted by preemption;        (4) due to the lack of a comprehensive Federal usury cap,       consumers have paid as much as approximately $14,000,000,000       on high-cost overdraft loans, $9,000,000,000 on storefront       and online payday loans, $3,800,000,000 on car title loans,       and additional amounts in unreported revenues on high-cost       online installment loans;        (5) cash-strapped consumers pay on average approximately       400-percent annual interest for payday loans, 300-percent       annual interest for car title loans, 17,000 percent for bank       overdraft loans, and triple-digit rates for online       installment loans;        (6) a national maximum interest rate that includes all       forms of fees and closes all loopholes is necessary to       eliminate such predatory lending; and        (7) alternatives to predatory lending that encourage small       dollar loans with minimal or no fees, installment payment       schedules, and affordable repayment periods should be       encouraged.       SEC. 3. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE.         Chapter 2 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1631 et       seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 140B.

and        ``(B) if the credit account has been open less than 1 year,       the fee and interest rate shall be calculated based upon the       total of all fees and finance charges described in subsection       (b)(1) charged by the creditor since the plan was opened,       divided by the average daily balance, and multiplied by the       quotient of 12 divided by the number of full months that the       credit plan has been in existence.        ``(2) Other credit plans.--For purposes of this section, in       calculating the fee and interest rate, the Bureau shall       require the method of calculation of annual percentage rate       specified in section 107(a)(1), except that the amount       referred to in that section 107(a)(1) as the `finance charge'       shall include all fees, charges, and payments described in       subsection (b)(1) of this section.        ``(3) Adjustments authorized.--The Bureau may make       adjustments to the calculations in paragraphs (1) and (2),       but the primary goals of such adjustment shall be to protect       consumers and to ensure that the 36-percent fee and interest       rate limitation is not circumvented.        ``(d) Definition of Creditor.--As used in this section, the       term `creditor' has the same meaning as in section 702(e) of       the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691a(e)).        ``(e) No Exemptions Permitted.--The exemption authority of       the Bureau under section 105 shall not apply to the rates       established under this section or the disclosure requirements       under section 127(b)(6).        ``(f) Disclosure of Fee and Interest Rate for Credit Other       Than Open End Credit Plans.--In addition to the disclosure       requirements under section 127(b)(6), the Bureau may       prescribe regulations requiring disclosure of the fee and       interest rate established under this section.        ``(g) Relation to State Law.--Nothing in this section may       be construed to preempt any provision of State law that       provides greater protection to consumers than is provided in       this section.        ``(h) Civil Liability and Enforcement.--In addition to       remedies available to the consumer under section 130(a), any       payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor, to       the extent that such payment is a transaction made in       violation of this section, shall be null and void, and not       enforceable by any party in any court or alternative dispute       resolution forum, and the creditor or any subsequent holder       of the obligation shall promptly return to the consumer any       principal, interest, charges, and fees, and any security       interest associated with such transaction. Notwithstanding       any statute of limitations or repose, a violation of this       section may be raised as a matter of defense by recoupment or       setoff to an action to collect such debt or repossess related       security at any time.        ``(i) Violations.--Any person that violates this section,       or seeks to enforce an agreement made in violation of this       section, shall be subject to, for each such violation, 1 year       in prison and a fine in an amount equal to the greater of--        ``(1) three times the amount of the total accrued debt       associated with the subject transaction; or        ``(2) $50,000.        ``(j) State Attorneys General.--An action to enforce this       section may be brought by the appropriate State attorney       general in any United States district court or any other       court of competent jurisdiction within 3 years from the date       of the violation, and such attorney general may obtain       injunctive relief.''.
