 Mr. Speaker, in 2022, we saw the highest  number of opioid overdose deaths in our Nation's history. These deaths  are the result of soft-on-crime policies from the Biden administration  that have failed to enforce strict penalties on the traffickers who  continue to deal in fentanyl-laced drugs.   Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, I received an email from Ray Cullen, a  resident of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Ray, along with his wife,  Deb, had raised their children in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional  District. Ray told me a story about his son, Zach, who had been out  with his friends. Zach was sold a combination of cocaine laced with  fentanyl, a deadly poison that took Zach's life.   Zach was a victim of fentanyl poisoning that night. He didn't know  that the drugs that he and his friends had purchased were laced with  this deadly synthetic opioid.   Because of how lethal fentanyl is in small quantities, it has become  the leading cause of death of Americans between the ages of 18 and 49  years.   Earlier this year, I was honored to be joined by Deb and Ray when the  House passed the HALT Fentanyl Act. This legislation would permanently  classify these drugs as schedule I narcotics and impose strict  penalties for those who are caught trafficking these deadly poisons.   For far too long, we have seen fentanyl components manufactured in  China and shipped to Mexico, where they are pressed into counterfeit  pills and trafficked across our porous southern border.   Addressing these supply chains at every level must become a top  priority for the Biden administration. Appeasing the Chinese Communist  Party with halfhearted requests to ``cut back'' on the production of  fentanyl is doing nothing to protect families in Pennsylvania. These  half measures are doing nothing to support our border towns that  continue to deal with the constant threat of cartel operations moving  north into the United States while Border Patrol agents are overwhelmed  with illegal immigrants.   We cannot afford to wait any longer to address the opioid crisis. It  is time for the Senate to pass the HALT Fentanyl Act and finally take  positive, concrete steps to stop the fentanyl poisoning deaths that  have continued to occur throughout the United States.   During this holiday season, we remember families like the Cullens who  have borne the brunt of these policy failures. We pray for them, and we  hold them in our hearts as they prepare for another Christmas without a  loved member of their family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act is part of our commitment to  supporting our patients, creating access to affordable medications, and  making the healthcare process easier to access for literally all  Americans.   Included in this legislation is my bill, the Strengthening Community  Care Act, which would reauthorize support for community health centers.  These centers are a vital source of care for over 30 million Americans  and nearly 240,000 individuals in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional  District.   By reducing barriers like cost, lack of insurance, or distance,  community health centers are able to provide high-quality treatment to  the patients who need it the most: the patients who are underinsured or  not insured at all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Lower Costs,  More Transparency Act, and I will be voting ``yes'' for this important  piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill will  grant the FCC temporary authority to issue over 7,500 licenses that  have been stalled while the spectrum auction authority has lapsed. To  address this issue, I am proud to be the sponsor of the 5G SALE Act,  which was unanimously reported out of committee.   It has now been more than a year since Auction 108 was conducted by  the FCC for these 2.5 gigahertz band licenses. During the auction, more  than $400 million was raised by 63 bidders. Releasing these licenses  will mean greater competition among providers and money funneled into  our economy.   The 5G SALE Act would cut through bureaucratic red tape and help get  more Americans connected to high-speed coverage than ever before.  Especially in rural areas, where I represent, in Pennsylvania's south  central and southwestern area, coverage can be scarce. Congress must  work to ensure that students, patients, workers, and farmers all have  access to 5G internet.   In places where seeing a medical specialist can mean a 2-hour drive,  access to reliable 5G connection can be life-changing for a patient.  These connections are invaluable also for our farmers, as they use  precision farming to plant crops and harvest.                                time  1715    Access to the internet is vital for our students as they work to do  their homework--their homework at home, not in the parking lot outside  of a convenience store.   Recently, the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology heard  from Chair Rosenworcel that the FCC would devote the necessary  resources and time to ensure that these licenses would be issued as  quickly as possible once this legislation is enacted.   I am grateful for all the work that went into advancing this  commonsense legislation to help connect more Americans than ever  before.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this  bill.
