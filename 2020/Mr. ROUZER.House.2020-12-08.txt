 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Water Resources  Development Act of 2020.   Our Nation's inlets, waterways, harbors, ports, and beaches are  critical components of our national infrastructure, supporting  countless local economies all across the country.   My district, which includes the southern portion of the North  Carolina coast, relies on this biennial, bipartisan bill to maintain  and improve our resource projects.   I would like to thank the Army Corps of Engineers for their work in  support of the coastal storm damage reduction projects at Wrightsville  Beach, as well as Carolina and Kure Beaches. Their team and mine work  together constantly to ensure that the right decisions are made and  executed.   I want to especially thank the chairman and the ranking member for  their work and commitment to keep this legislation a good, bipartisan  product of the committee. I particularly appreciate their willingness  to work with me to address the needs of our coastal communities and the  infrastructure so important to North Carolina's economy. I also want to  thank the staff of the majority and minority for the many hours they  have worked to make this day possible.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
