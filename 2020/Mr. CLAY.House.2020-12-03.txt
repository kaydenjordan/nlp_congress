 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my farewell remarks as a  Member of the people's House. And while I will be sad to leave this  historic place, I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to serve  Missouri's First Congressional District for two decades and to have  been blessed with the friendship of so many colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I have given my best because my constituents deserve  nothing less. I learned that vital lesson about public service from my  best adviser and my personal hero, my dad, former Congressman Bill  Clay. The truth is none of my success would have been possible without  my remarkable family.   I thank the rock of our family, my mother, Carol, and my devoted and  talented sisters, Vickie and Michelle.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank my children, Carol and Will. No Member  serves unto themselves. Families also sacrifice greatly.   Carol and Will, you all have made me extremely proud. You carry  yourselves with such dignity, poise, and character. There is no greater  joy I have than being your father. Thank you for being my greatest and  best legacy.    To my wonderful wife, Pat, I could not have selected a better partner  to share in my post-congressional career. Your love and optimism keep  my life balanced and exhilarated. I so look forward to our days to  come.   Mr. Speaker, of course, the best part of being a Member of Congress  has been helping tens of thousands of constituents solve issues with  the Federal Government. None of that would have been possible without  my dedicated and compassionate staff over the years: Patricia, Sheila,  Virginia, Sandy, Ishmael, Jasmina, Sean, Craig, Percy, Adam, Marvin,  Richard, Les, Mark, Lou, Brian, Michelle, Brittany, Josh, Pauline,  Perre, Samantha, Sherry, Tony, Bill, Frank, Erica, Matt, Rico; my  communications director, Steven Engelhardt; and the late Alyson  Singfield and the late Dottie Ross.   I also thank an exceptional American who has devoted 48 years of  public service to the U.S. House, my remarkable constituent services  director, Edwilla Massey.   I thank my devoted executive assistant and scheduler, Karyn Long.  Karyn is family. She always went above and beyond for me, and I am  forever grateful.   I also especially thank all my chiefs of staff: Harriet Grigsby,  Darryl Piggee, and Yvette Cravins.   In the book of Matthew, chapter 25, verses 36-40, the Scriptures  read:         When I was naked, you clothed Me. When I was sick, you       visited Me. And when I was in prison, you came to Me. The       righteous answered, ``Lord, when did we see You hungry,       thirsty, clothed You, or in prison visited?'' And the King       answered them, ``Truly I say to you, as you did it to the       least of these my brothers, you did it to Me.''    Mr. Speaker, these Scriptures have been a guidepost for my career in  public service. Over my 10 terms, I have fearlessly advocated for the  permanent interest of African Americans and other unheard voices. I  have had many legislative achievements in this body, and I thank all of  my colleagues who assisted me in doing as the Scriptures noted,  ``caring for the least of these.''   Mr. Speaker, in my remaining time, I highlight a few victories.   For 14 years, I hosted the Clay Career Fair at St. Louis' HBCU  Harris-Stowe State University, which connected thousands of jobseekers  with good-paying jobs, providing economic stability.   Creating jobs and economic development was a priority for me. We were  able to build the new $120 million National Archives administration  center in North St. Louis County.   The greatest economic victory for North St. Louis was the bipartisan  effort to build the headquarters of the National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency. That $1.7 billion project is the largest single  Federal investment in St. Louis' history, of which I am extremely  proud.   We have also built hundreds of units of new housing. We have also  expanded organ and tissue donation registry.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the legacy and work of Missouri's First  Congressional District.   May God bless you all.                            ____________________
