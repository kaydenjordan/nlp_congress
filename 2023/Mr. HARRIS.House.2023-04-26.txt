 Mr. Speaker, fiscal sanity has returned to Washington,  D.C. I didn't think I was going to live long enough to see this, but  today, minutes ago, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 2811, the  Limit, Save, Grow Act.   We agreed with the majority of the American public that inflation is  tied to runaway Federal Government spending and that it is about time  the President realized that his fairyland budget that never, ever, ever  balances is actually bad for America.   Maybe this will bring him to the negotiating table so that when we  raise the credit limit on America on our American credit card, we  actually do what we would do in our own households--we would actually  begin to control spending. That is a huge step. It is about time it is  happening in Washington. Mr. Speaker, I hope it is not too late.                            ____________________
