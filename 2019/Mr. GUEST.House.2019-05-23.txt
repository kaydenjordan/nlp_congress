 Mr. Speaker, our Nation has been built on democratic  ideas. Over the course of our Nation's history, these principles have  been threatened by forces that do not share our ideas of democracy. Due  to the heroic efforts of the men and women of our military, our Nation  has stood against these threats.   Memorial Day is the time to honor these men and women who gave their  lives in defense of our country and the blessings of liberty that we  enjoy today. This Memorial Day, I hope that all will join me in  remembering the soldiers who laid down their lives for this Nation and  to celebrate the rights, liberties, and institutions that they  preserved.                            ____________________
