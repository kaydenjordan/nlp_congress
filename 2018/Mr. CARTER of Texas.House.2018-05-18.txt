 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when  the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, May 21, 2018,  when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House  Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs,  and Related Agencies, I am honored to fight for the veterans in my  district and throughout the Nation. In return for their service and  sacrifice, we owe them the best medical care that can be provided.   I am proud that the House of Representatives has passed the VA  MISSION Act to address these critical concerns. I commend Chairman Roe,  Ranking Member Walz, and the members of the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee for their work on this issue over the last year.   This legislation will provide better community-based care without  detracting from the outstanding medical services provided by the  Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities, such as the Central  Texas Veterans Health Care Center in Temple, Texas, in my district.   While I believe veterans are best served by the VA, there are also  those who live too far from a VA facility, cannot afford a long wait  period, or have very specific medical services that are best provided  outside the VA system.   The VA MISSION Act provides this community-based care option, and it  pays for it with discretionary spending, which means Congress has more  control, more oversight, and more responsibility.   The VA MISSION Act includes a provision for a bill I authored, the  Veterans Transplant Coverage Act, to ensure that no other American hero  is denied organ transplant coverage again through the VA.   This was inspired by the Nelson family of Leander, Texas. Mr. Nelson,  a veteran, required a transplant. His son was a matching live donor.  However, the VA would not cover medical costs for the donor, Mr.  Nelson's son, even though this was a lifesaving transplant for Mr.  Nelson. I am sorry to say that Mr. Nelson had to liquidate almost  everything he owned to pay for the medical expenses. We could not help  Mr. Nelson's family, but his story inspired me to work towards changing  the law.   When the VA MISSION Act is enacted, it will ensure future generations  of veterans will have their transplant medical expenses, along with the  donor's expenses, covered by the VA. We must do the right thing for our  veterans who need these lifesaving procedures, and I am honored that  the VA MISSION Act includes language I wrote to do just that.   I want to publicly thank several of my colleagues on the committee:  Dr. Neal Dunn, Dr. Brad Wenstrup, and Gus Bilirakis, my neighbor, all  of whom championed transplant care for veterans and worked extremely  hard to ensure this language was included in the bill.   The VA MISSION Act is a step forward towards the goal of caring for  our veterans. The Senate must pass this legislation, and I urge  President Trump to quickly sign it into law. I can think of no better  way to celebrate Memorial Day than enact the VA MISSION Act, which will  ensure our heroes receive the best medical care available.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
