 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, the American people are getting ripped off  in this bill. The Chilean mining conglomerate behind this bill makes  out like a bandit.   They get two expired leases back, as well as exemptions from several  key environmental laws that could be used  [[Page H9511]]  to stop any of their dreams of massive profits from a giant copper  mine.   The American people are the ones that are getting ripped off. This  land is being given away for next to nothing. For the past 50 years,  the leaseholder has been paying rent of $1 an acre per year. Think  about that, $1 an acre per year, unchanged for 50 years. The American  people are the landlords here. They are charging the Chilean company  about $420 per month for 5,000 acres of prime land right next to the  most visited wilderness area in the country.                                time  1630    I can only imagine how many hardworking Americans would desperately  love to be guaranteed having only to pay $420 a month for their homes  for as long as they want, particularly if their home was over 2 million  square feet, as these leases are.   But we are not talking about someone building a house here. We are  talking about a giant, destructive copper-sulfide mine that threatens  one of the greatest unspoiled natural spaces in the country, the  Boundary Waters Wilderness. Don't be fooled by the claims that the  Boundary Waters are protected in this bill. They are not even remotely  protected.   Copper-sulfide mining results in acid mine drainage, the same kind of  pollution that comes from abandoned coal mines and has destroyed  thousands of miles of streams and rivers throughout Appalachia. Acid  mine drainage from these leases would flow into the Boundary Waters  into a neighboring Canadian wilderness and into Voyageurs National  Park. This would permanently impact millions of acres of lakes, rivers,  fish and wildlife habitat, and risk the entire tourism and recreation  economy of the region.   The majority says it is all worth it because of all the money that  will flow into the State's coffers and be used for education. Give me a  break. The only education benefit from this legislation would be  children learning the chemistry of how acidic water flows out of mines,  the biology of dead fish, and the economics of a shattered tourism and  recreation industry.   But if the majority is truly concerned about the amount of money that  a destroyed wilderness can bring to the State, they should be  embarrassed by the sweetheart deals in these leases: $1 per acre per  year and a royalty of 4\1/2\ percent on production. These numbers are  absurd. These rock-bottom prices effectively subsidize a foreign  company to mine on public lands right next to an irreplaceable  wilderness.   My amendment would make sure that the company would pay a royalty  rate of just over 60 percent because that is the same rate that Senator  Murkowski has determined that companies should pay for oil that would  come from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. If that is the cost of  destroyed wilderness in the Arctic, then it should be no cheaper to  destroy wilderness in Minnesota.   With the extra billions of dollars the State receives from the more  reasonable royalty rate, perhaps they could fund education and also  help all the owners and employees of tourism and recreation companies  that would be put out of business by a giant copper mine.   To be clear, I will not support H.R. 3905 even if this amendment is  adopted. But Members should be given the opportunity to demonstrate  that they don't believe that a foreign mining company should be allowed  to get public land and public resources at rock-bottom rates and out in  the West for free.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the taxpayers, support  my amendment, and oppose the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just close by saying that this precedent being  set here with H.R. 3905 is a precedent that I think every Member of  Congress needs to consider.   The backdrop is a mining law of 1872 that has not been changed one  iota since then that basically provides the public resources, the  extraction of our public lands for free to any company and more  prevalent now are foreign mining companies. No return to the taxpayer  and no consequences considered on the environmental damage that these  mines have caused, the abandoned mines that haven't been cleaned up.   This is a backdrop to a deeper and more serious problem that this  Congress has to grapple with, which is the mining law of 1872, and on  this piece of legislation a precedent that establishes a template that  can be destructive for the future and cut the public and the processes  out that involve the public and safeguard the environment at the same  time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, a ``no'' vote on  the underlying legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
