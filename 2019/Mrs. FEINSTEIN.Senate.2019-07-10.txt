 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Athletics Fair Pay Act of 2019 with my colleague Senator Murray.   Women and girls have made great strides in sports. Before Title IX of  the Civil Rights Act was passed 47 years ago, athletic programs for  girls and young women were virtually nonexistent. Now, women are world  class athletes and compete in a wide range of sports including soccer,  basketball, hockey, and tennis.   In the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, a record 45 percent of  the athletes competing at the games were women, and this year, the U.S.  Women's National Soccer Team won a historic fourth FIFA Women's World  Cup title. Despite the incredible advancements made by women in sports,  female athletes are paid significantly less than their male  counterparts and are given fewer opportunities to succeed.   Sports organizations in the United States still do not invest equally  in girls' and women's athletics. This lack of investment means that  many female athletes never reach their full potential. In addition,  studies show that sports participation has a positive influence on  girls' academic performance, employment opportunities, and their  physical and mental health.   The inequities faced by female athletes were highlighted in a wage  discrimination lawsuit recently filed by the U.S. Women's Soccer Team  against their employer, the U.S. Soccer Federation.   In addition to winning four FIFA Women's World Cup titles, the  Women's Soccer Team has won four Olympic gold medals and has been  ranked number one by FIFA for 10 of the last 11 years. By contrast, the  U.S. Men's Soccer Team failed to qualify for last year's World Cup and  has not won an Olympic medal since 1904. Yet, according to the lawsuit  filed by the Women's Team, the U.S. Soccer Federation pays the women an  average of 38 cents on the dollar compared to the male players.   Unfortunately, the Women's Soccer Team is not alone. In 2017, the  U.S. Women's Hockey Team received a pay raise from its national  governing body, USA Hockey, only after the team threatened to boycott a  major competition.   Prior to the boycott, USA Hockey did not pay female athletes at all  in non-Olympic years and paid each just $6,000 in the year leading up  to an Olympic games.   It is clear that we must do more to ensure that female athletes are  paid equally and treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.  This legislation gets us closer to that goal.   This legislation updates the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports  Act to mandate that the national governing bodies chartered under the  Ted  [[Page S4776]]  Stevens Act pay female amateur athletes fairly and equally.   This bill also requires national governing bodies to provide annual  reports to Congress on amateur athlete pay. This new reporting  requirement increases accountability and allows Congress to monitor  whether the national governing bodies are complying with their equal  pay obligations.   I am deeply disappointed that we still need this kind of legislation  in 2019. I am hopeful that the Senate will take up, and pass, this  important legislation and show its support for women around the  country. As a United States Senator, I will continue fighting for fair  pay and equality of treatment for all women, including our nation's  athletes.   I thank the president, and I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Athletics Fair Pay Act of 2019 with my colleague Senator Murray.
