 Mr. Speaker, I can't believe we are here again to vote,  or not, on the Republicans so-called healthcare bill.   Let me remind my colleagues that we are finally here only after  Republicans failed to even hold a vote on March 24, and then offered  extreme, multiple amendments to appease the furthest right of their  party.   But I have to give it to them: it takes real cojones to stand here  and vote on a bill that they know provides nearly zero healthcare  benefits for the American people. It takes real fortitude and  conviction to stand up for a bill that cuts coverage for 24 million  Americans, guts Medicaid, reduces the solvency of Medicare, and  segregates the sickest.   The truth is, Republicans lack the bravery to call this bill what it  really is: a massive tax cut for the rich on the backs of working moms  and dads and the sick. They lack the integrity to do the hard work that  it takes to craft an actual healthcare bill that would build upon  current law and improve the health of Americans.   I implore my colleagues to come to their senses, vote against this  terrible bill, and work with us to continue to improve health care in  this country for all Americans.
