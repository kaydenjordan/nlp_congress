 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Appropriations  Committee chairman for yielding me time.   I rise in support of this continuing resolution. Obviously, we would  rather fund the government for the entire year before the start of the  fiscal year, but that is in a perfect world, and one thing that the  Congress has never been accused of is being a perfect world. So we are  here dealing in the real world.   To my good friend from Connecticut who just spoke, and she is my good  friend, I would point out that the bill before us doesn't cut money  from the Prevention Fund. It directs money from the Prevention Fund to  spend on healthcare programs. In other words, it is taking some  discretion from the executive branch and directing that spending that  Congress thinks it should be spent for.   One of the programs that we are going to fund for 2 years is the  community health centers. Twenty-four million people each year get  their healthcare from these community health centers, and one of them  is in my home county, the Hope Clinic. Its main facility is in  Waxahachie, Texas. But in my hometown of Ennis, we have the Nell Barton  Hope Clinic Annex. These two facilities in Ellis County this year are  providing healthcare for over 10,000 Ellis Countians.   This is not exotic care. It is checkups, screenings, mammograms, and  all the odds and ends that you have in your basic healthcare  facilities. If they need more specific treatment, they are referred to  specialists in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.   But for the 10,000 citizens of Ellis County who depend on the Hope  Clinic for their healthcare, this is a big bill. In fact, the executive  director of the Hope Clinic was in my office today, saying: We want to  expand, but we don't know if we are going to have the funds. We really  need to get some certainty.   That is what this bill is all about. So I rise in strong support, and  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the CR later this evening.
