 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to bring this resolution to the  floor today which will fight against the Trump administration's harmful  Medicaid block grants.   I would like to take a moment to thank the chairman and the committee  and their staff for working hard to protect healthcare for all  Americans.   Today, we are here to shine a light on yet another one of the harmful  and irresponsible policies designed by the Trump administration.   These block grants are just the latest in a slew of attempts by his  administration to gut the Affordable Care Act and the numerous coverage  expansions that have been offered to millions of Americans of all ages  and all backgrounds who were unable to gain coverage before, and the  millions more who could gain coverage if States like mine would be  smart and expand Medicaid in our own States.   They have been talking about these block grants in Texas for a while,  and they are a hee-hee, ha-ha joke. Everybody knows that these are  harmful. People in the healthcare industry in Texas know that these are  harmful, and block grants would be harmful for the Nation.   This resolution on the floor today demonstrates our majority's strong  opposition to removing the expanded protections that the Affordable  Care Act provided to primarily childless adults and those parents who  are living at or below the poverty line.   Millions of hardworking Americans have finally been able to gain  affordable health insurance. Now the Trump administration wants to take  away the progress made by these Americans and undercut their access to  healthcare.   They also want to chip away at the access to healthcare for millions  of Americans who have and will be able to gain coverage through State  Medicaid expansions.   That is why I am proud to lead this resolution today because  affordable and accessible healthcare is a right. It should not be a  privilege, Mr. Speaker. It should be a right for all.
