 Mr. Speaker, this week is National  Salvation Army Week, and it is a time to recognize the good that this  organization does, but also a time to raise awareness about the  challenges faced by more than 40 million Americans who are living in  poverty, many who are stuck in poverty, quite frankly, because of  programs and regulations put forth by Washington, D.C., for decades  that serve as a spiderweb and makes people feel more comfortable living  in poverty, which is nothing we should ever do.   We should always be working to provide our friends, our neighbors,  our neighbors in need with a pathway to opportunity. The Salvation Army  is a great organization, actually, that accomplishes that.   With the help of 3.2 million volunteers, the Salvation Army serves  nearly 25 million Americans through a range of social services,  including food for the hungry, relief for disaster survivors, clothing  and shelter for the homeless, and opportunities for underprivileged  children.   National Salvation Army Week began in 1954 when Congress approved the  joint resolution for President Dwight D. Eisenhower to proclaim a week  to recognize the humanitarian efforts of the Salvation Army.   The Salvation Army is one of the Nation's largest and oldest faith- based health and human services providers.   With a presence in every ZIP Code across the country, the Salvation  Army uniquely understands the demands facing Americans in need.   Last year, the Salvation Army served more than 56 million meals and  provided more than 10 million nights of shelter.   The Salvation Army is on the front lines of the opioid crisis,  serving more than 173,000 Americans in 139 rehab centers across the  United States.   Since the 1900 Galveston hurricane, the Salvation Army has served  survivors and first responders of every major natural disaster and  numerous man-made disasters. In any given year, it helps more than  275,000 survivors receive hope, healing, and comfort.   Through a wide variety of job training programs, including culinary,  hospitality, and landscaping training, the  [[Page H4146]]  Salvation Army helps Americans build the skills they need to acquire  gainful employment and lift themselves out of poverty, help them  achieve food security.   The Salvation Army takes a holistic approach in addressing people's  needs. It supports the physical, emotional, and spiritual development  of those that they serve. Data shows that those who utilize the  Salvation Army's spiritual and emotional care programs are more likely  to reclaim their lives and get back on their feet.   Mr. Speaker, the Salvation Army was established in London in 1865,  and for more than 135 years, it has been supporting those in need  without discrimination.   Together, we can all join the fight for good. I am proud to honor  this outstanding organization that for more than a century has given  scores of Americans the help they need during trying times.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Gosar for  offering this commonsense amendment.   Good Neighbor Authority was one of the hard-fought achievements in  the 2014 farm bill that has proven useful in improving our national  forests and our rural communities. I was pleased to expand the Good  Neighbor Authority to Indian Tribes in the base text of this bill, and  I am happy that my colleague continues to improve the forestry title  with this amendment authorizing counties to be eligible.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I thank Mr. Gianforte for offering this important  amendment for Montana and, quite frankly, for our National Forest  System as a whole.   Over the past several years, fires have had a devastating impact on  our forest system lands, resulting in deteriorated landscapes. I have  witnessed this firsthand across the country as the former chairman of  the Committee on Agriculture's Subcommittee on Conservation and  Forestry.   It is vital that the Forest Service has the right tools, the ability  to restore these landscapes as quickly as possible to preserve habitat,  clean air, and the significant impact that these incidents can have on  clean water.   Unfortunately, litigation stalls many of these projects. As Madison  County, Montana, Commissioner Dave Schulz noted before the House  Natural Resources Federal Lands Subcommittee in May of 2015, due to the  threat of litigation from outside groups refusing to meet or  collaborate with the community, what started out as a consensus  proposal for 100,000 acres of fire salvage and reforestation was  reduced to less than 2,000 acres of salvage. ``Fear of litigation  prevents the Forest Service from thinking big.''   In another quote, he offered, a ``significant factor in preventing  responsible management of our Nation's forests.''   Mr. Chair, I certainly support this amendment. It has already passed  the House. I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment by my good friend and colleague from California. I do  that respectfully.   H.R. 2 includes a substantive, enforceable, and supportive work  requirement for work-capable adults 18 to 59. That is 20 percent of the  population, 6 million individuals.   Waivers and exemptions were modified and even tightened to ensure  that only the most vulnerable work-capable adults were waived from the  requirement. Waivers take into consideration those areas with  excessively high rates of unemployment, while exemptions assist those  who need short-term reprieve because of temporary hardship.   Allowing for married couples to fulfill one requirement disengages  recipients from the workforce. Work is more than just a paycheck. It  provides dignity, social impact, opportunity, and creates the only path  to self-sufficiency. One spouse fulfilling a 20-hour-per-week  requirement does not lead to self-sufficiency. It does the exact  opposite; it creates a lifetime dependency trap.   H.R. 2 provides equitable treatment to all households when promoting  work, including those that house cohabiting adults or married adults.   Currently, 42 States choose not to use education and training funds  to invest in childcare, which is an allowable investment. Reducing the  age of the child from 6 to 3 is an undeniable barrier that  disincentivizes employment more so than the current programming.   Requiring education and training providers to use E-Verify on all  participants who depend on them for services is just plain cruel. SNAP  has eligibility standards in place, and illegal immigrants are not  eligible for benefits. This is simply a means to shut out the very  organizations and entities that provide these necessary supports for  individuals in need.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do  the same.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield  such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Faso).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester).    Mr. Chairman, first of all, I ask  support in opposing this amendment from my friend and colleague from  California.   To my friends across the aisle who keep asking for bipartisan  opportunity, you blew the first one. That was in subcommittee, where we  could have amendments, and we are not seeing amendments from Members  here. So there has been plenty of opportunity for bipartisan work.   I do appreciate the recommendations that my Democratic friends made  in writing to both the ranking member and the chairman. All of those  points and all the titles, I believe, were--I know in the nutrition  title they were all incorporated into the base bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding to me.   Mr. Chairman, we have heard about broad-based categorical  eligibility. If this was a SNAP brochure, Mr. Chairman, and I hand this  to you, regardless of what your income is, if you accept this SNAP  brochure, you are now eligible for SNAP. That is broad-based  categorical eligibility.   Mr. Chairman, if somebody offers you an 800 number to call regarding  SNAP, which is a good thing, as is the brochure, and you use that  number, under broad-based categorical eligibility, you are now eligible  for SNAP, no matter what your income is.   So, if it has been found that some families will come off, it is  because it has been found that there are families who already exceed  the income.   Now, here is the thing. If they just go and fill out the application,  they can be eligible for SNAP if they meet those financial and asset  requirements.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  the International Association of Lions Club, Multiple District 14, in  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   Lions Multiple District 14 will host its 95th annual convention at  the Penn Stater Conference Center today through Sunday. They will  proudly welcome the Lions Club International president, Dr. Naresh  Aggarwal, of Batala, Punjab, India.   Mr. Speaker, this group is near and dear to my heart, as I am a  member of my local Lions Club, having served also as a Scoutmaster of  that Lions Scout troop.   The Lions are the world's largest service club, with more than 18,900  Lions in Pennsylvania and nearly 1.45 million Lions worldwide.   The Lions focus on five areas of service: diabetes; environment;  hunger relief; pediatric cancer; and probably the most well-known area  of service, vision. Thanks to the 692 Lions Clubs in Pennsylvania,  residents benefit from services like chartering units of the Boy Scouts  of America, operating a year-round camp for people with vision  challenges, supporting a camp for children with health challenges, and  offering scholarships for students.   Mr. Speaker, the Lions do so much for so many in need. I wish them  the best of luck as they host their 95th convention and live out their  motto: We serve.                            ____________________
