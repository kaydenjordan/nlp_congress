 Madam Speaker, I thank my fellow Florida Gator. I was  born in Gainesville, Florida, and raised in the Tampa Bay area. I am  very blessed to be a Floridian and with this wonderful woman here. I  thank her for doing this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, today I rise to stand for life. Earlier the United  States Supreme Court began hearing opening arguments in the Dobbs v.  Jackson Women's Health Organization case.  [[Page H6843]]    As this landmark case is litigated, I am mindful that modern science  confirms every unborn child is a human life. As early as 5 weeks,  unborn babies have a heartbeat and the brain and spinal cord are  developing. By 10 weeks babies have arms and legs, fingers and toes;  they can kick and jump if startled. At 15 weeks babies have fully  developed hearts that pump 26 quarts of blood per day.   Madam Speaker, they can taste and make facial expressions. They yawn,  they hiccup, they swallow, and they even suck their thumbs. During this  time period, painful procedures trigger a hormonal stress response, and  due to advances in technology, an unborn child is viable outside the  womb at 22 weeks or earlier.   Our laws must reflect these realities and be realigned to protect the  unborn.                                time  1730
