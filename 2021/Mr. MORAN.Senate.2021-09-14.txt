 Mr. President, I join the Senator from Missouri and his  colleague, Senator Blunt, expressing my condolences and concern for the  family of Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz from the great State of Missouri  and others who died at the Kabul airport in the effort to free  Americans and Afghans who helped Americans from their country and from  their deaths.   It takes us back to this weekend, Saturday, September 11. Our Nation  remembered the horrific attacks that occurred 20 years previous and  reflected upon the fight against terrorism, which was set in motion on  that very fateful day.   The events that unfolded in Afghanistan these past few weeks have  made the 20th anniversary of September 11 that much more painful;  painful especially for the men and women who served our Nation in  Afghanistan.   The chaos and collapse of that country cost American lives, opened  old wounds, and left many Americans questioning how all this could  happen in this manner.   The American people require answers from the administration on how  our withdrawal from Afghanistan went so horribly--so horribly, horribly  wrong.  [[Page S6471]]  Officials should be, must be, held accountable for their weak  leadership and mismanaged withdrawal.   During my tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives and here in the  U.S. Senate, following the attack of 9/11, I visited Afghanistan four  times. Over the course of those visits, I saw progress being made by  our troops and by civilians, by our NATO allies, and by Afghan  partners.   My last visit was about 4 years ago just to the day about a week ago.  At that time, the U.S. had less than 15,000 servicemembers in  Afghanistan and our men and women were operating as advisers to the  Afghan military. For the most part, the war seemed to be being fought  by the Afghan military. Certainly, several terrorist groups had a  presence in the region, but our military was preventing them from  gaining the ability to strike our homeland.   President Biden's withdrawal plan, if it could be called that, led to  the deadliest day for American servicemembers in Afghanistan since  2011. Thirteen of our servicemembers returned home in flag-draped  caskets. Most of them were too young to remember 9/11, yet they laid  down our lives to help Americans and Afghans flee the Taliban and find  safety.   Americans remain in Afghanistan and thousands of our Afghan partners  who are likely to face persecution or death at the hands of the Taliban  have little hope of escaping the country. Our own office continues the  effort to try to find and help those individuals remove themselves from  a country where death seems certain.   I thank my staff, and I pray for those people, and I thank the  Kansans who brought them to our attention.   People at home worried about Christians being persecuted for being  Christians in Afghanistan. Those who serve in Afghanistan worried about  someone who saved their life--an Afghan who saved their life or who was  their interpreter or who was there side by side with them--now being  left to the fate of the Taliban.   I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittees that fund  the Departments of Defense and State. We must hold hearings to examine  the President's decision-making process and his consideration of the  advice provided by his military and intelligence community leaders. We  need to determine what steps, if any, were taken to plan for the  withdrawal of Americans, with Special Immigrant Visas holders from  Afghanistan.   We also need to hear directly from the administration how costly the  lethal American weapons ended up in the hands of Taliban. The high- ranking officials who were responsible for this failure must answer to  the American people why this operation failed so spectacularly and why  their taxpayer dollars were left behind for the Taliban in the form of  helicopters, combat vehicles, and weapons.   How is it that we came to rely upon the Taliban to help those we are  responsible for, we owe a debt to, to be able to escape from the  Taliban?   The administration must also be held accountable for its  mismanagement and for the precarious security situation that this  incompetent withdrawal created. Hastily withdrawing thousands of  troops, apparently in the interest of a symbolic departure before the  20th anniversary of 9/11, made this world a more dangerous place. It  created an environment that will allow radical terrorists to find  refuge under the Taliban rule, and produced one that was the most  pressing humanitarian crisis in history.   We deserve answers on how we will remedy this complex security  situation, how we will help Afghan women and girls who are already  being persecuted, and how we will learn from mistakes that were made to  make certain it cannot happen again.   Finally, our veterans who served honorably in Afghanistan need to  know that their service--and when I say ``finally,'' this is not the  least important point. It is made at the end to make the point so  clear. Our veterans who served honorably in Afghanistan need to know  that their service was not--was not--in vain. More than 775,000  servicemembers were deployed to Afghanistan over the two decades since  9/11.   To those servicemembers: Make no mistake, your service has left a  lasting and unparalleled impact upon the world.   Our country has been safe from a terrorist attack from the region of  Afghanistan since their arrival in Afghanistan. Their work and efforts,  their sacrifice and service made a difference for the safety of their  fellow Americans. Those who served significantly reduced the threat  from al-Qaida and brought Osama bin Laden to justice.   You deserve to know that the collapse of Afghanistan does not fall on  your shoulders but on the failure of leadership here in the Nation's  Capital City. Our sudden, disastrous, and poorly executed withdrawal  opened old wounds and created new ones.   I commit as the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on  Veterans' Affairs to work side by side with our chairman, the Senator  from Montana, to make certain that our veterans receive the care and  attention they deserve and are entitled to, the respect and honor from  their fellow American citizens, and the benefits that we promised to be  available, available.   We have made the world a more dangerous place by our failing  departure, and we have left Americans and our Afghan partners behind.   I served in the House of Representatives on 9/11, 20 years ago. I  remember the day and the attack. I was one of the first Members of  Congress to visit Ground Zero, where I saw the remains of the two Twin  Towers--still smoke coming from the ground, steam--a bit like a  construction site as they were trying to remove the rubble that were  the remains of those towers.   First, family members were brought in to see the site where their  loved ones died, which captured my heart as I watched them see where  their loved ones died. After paying my respects to those family members  and as I was leaving, I found a makeshift memorial that New Yorkers had  placed there. It was a series of long tables at which people had  brought flowers and cards, stuffed animals--teddy bears--and notes to  pay tribute to those who had died just a few weeks before at that  location.   I picked up one thing from that table of remembrance and honor and  respect. It was a piece of notebook paper with a jagged edge along the  side, torn out of a spiral notebook, with a child's handwriting:         Dear Daddy, how much I love you, how I hope Heaven is a       wonderful place, and I hope, Daddy, that I live a life good       enough to join you there someday.        Amanda, aged 12.    That moment has stuck with me for 20-plus years now--the point being  that we have a responsibility to make sure that there are no more  Amandas who suffer the fate that this young girl suffered that day with  the death of her father. It occurred because of a terrorist attack  occurring on the lands of Afghanistan, held by the Taliban, that  allowed ISIS to attack the United States of America.   I have tried to change my conduct as a Member of Congress, since that  day, to be a more responsible Member, to do the things necessary to be  more worldly and understand what is going on, to make sure that I make  the decisions that help make the world a safer place.   What we have seen in the last few weeks discourages me in making the  world a safer place, but I rise to the call again to say we have  responsibilities left in Afghanistan; we have responsibilities to the  people we left behind to allow and to help them escape near certain  death; and we also have responsibilities to those men and women who  served in Afghanistan, who answered the call because they saw what  happened to our Nation on 9/11 and said: I have something to give. I  have something--perhaps my life--to give to see that this doesn't  happen again.   I hope that we, despite the circumstances that we have seen in the  last days, now have the ability as a U.S. Congress, as a Member of the  U.S. Senate, to rise to the occasion in which we are still needed in  this world to protect American lives, to save lives in Afghanistan, and  to make certain--to make certain--that there are no more Amandas asking  for the opportunity to see their fathers someday in Heaven.   The burdens are great for us. The responsibilities are real. Those  who have failed us to date need to be held accountable, and the rest of  us need to rise to the occasion to protect this country we love, the  United States of America.  [[Page S6472]]    I yield the floor.
