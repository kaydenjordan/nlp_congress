 Loretta, thank you. I admire your passion and your  enthusiasm for the Congress to Campus program. I have had the fortunate  opportunity, of course, of doing one of those digitally with you. It  was inspiring for me as well and something I hope that we continue to  develop with the game plan we have.   Today, my colleague Bart Gordon and I would like to report on the  Congressional Study Groups on Germany, Europe, Japan, Korea, and maybe  in the future with Ireland--who knows.  [[Page H2898]]    In the past year, there have been critical developments on the  international stage amongst America's closest allies and partners  around the globe.   We witnessed the somber anniversary of the Russian invasion of  Ukraine and rededicated ourselves to a robust and reliable NATO  alliance and celebrated one of our closest partnerships in the Indo- Pacific with Korea's President Yoon visiting Washington on an official  State visit that culminated with his rousing speech right here in this  Chamber.   With consideration of these and other international developments, it  is my great pleasure to highlight the work of the Congressional Study  Groups on Germany, Japan, Europe and Korea, the flagship international  programs of FMC.   As you know, our four Congressional Study Groups are the most active  and unparalleled peer-to-peer exchange involving current Members of  Congress and senior congressional staff in a highly impactful dialogue  with their colleagues in legislative branches overseas.   In an ever-changing world, the year-round bipartisanship, and  nonadvocacy outreach of these study groups to Capitol Hill remains the  premier forum for productive, candid, and timely dialogue on the issues  most relevant not only to America's leaders but to our friends and  allies abroad.   One is hard pressed to find another organization that so consistently  engages a diverse group of Members of Congress, the diplomatic  community, administration officials, the private sector, and civil  society in such critical conversations.   Each study group is proud to count over 75 Members of Congress as  members, and each is led by a bipartisan, bicameral group of four co- chairs. These co-chairs exemplify the study groups' dedication to  meaningful and robust education, not only serving in their role at the  official study group events, but connecting with the embassies and  outside organizations to speak on panels, attend roundtables, and meet  with countless visiting delegations to further the goals of their  respective study groups and the international relationships that they  support.   In the past year, the study groups have led six tours for Members of  Congress and their senior staff; engaged new Members of the 118th  Congress in introductory events with our embassy partners; hosted a  German delegation of parliamentarians, business leaders, and key  members of German civil society on a study tour in Texas; and held  dozens of roundtables between Members of Congress, chiefs of staff, the  diplomatic corps here in D.C., and business advisory members on  critical issues such as the war in Ukraine, the debt ceiling, the IRA,  supply chain security, energy, and international security, among other  topics.   This critical work, however, would not be possible without the  general patronage of a dedicated group of individuals, organizations,  and business advisory council members.   In particular, I recognize Dr. Satohiro Akimoto of the Sasakawa Peace  Foundation USA, Thomas Byrne of The Korea Society, Sung Won Bae of the  Korea Foundation USA, Heather Conley of the German Marshall Fund of the  United States, Paige Cottingham-Streater of the Japan-U.S. Friendship  Commission, and Julia Friedlander of the Atlantik-Brucke for their  support as key funders of the Congressional Study Groups in 2023.   We also benefit tremendously from our partners and Business Advisory  Council, and I include their names for the Congressional Record.              BAC partners to FMC and Congressional Study Groups         Aflac, Allianz, All Nippon Airways, BASF, Bayer, B. Braun       Medical, Beam Suntory, Central Japan Railway Company, CJ       America, Deutsche Telekom, DHL, Fresenius SE, Hitachi, Honda,       Hyundai, Itochu, JTI, KITA, LG, Lockheed Martin, Lufthansa       German Airlines, Marubeni America Corporation, Mercedes-Benz,       Mitsubishi Corporation (Americas), Mitsubishi Heavy       Industries America, Mitsui & Co., Mizuho, NEC, Nissan,       Nomura, Panasonic, Philips North America, POSCO,       Representative of German Industry and Trade, Samsung, Sojitz,       Subaru, Tellurian, Toyota Motor North America, UPS, and       Volkswagen Group of America.     Since last year's report to Congress, FMC's Business  Advisory Council has grown with the additions of Philips North America  and LG. Our Business Advisory Council continues to benefit from the  guidance and leadership of advisory board members Brad Knox of Aflac,  Majida Mourad of Tellurian, Anna Schneider of Volkswagen, Mark Sobol of  Longwave Partners, Jeff Werner of Panasonic, and Nancy Ziuzin Schlegel  of Lockheed Martin.   Amidst economic uncertainties, supply chain difficulties, and energy  and climate crises, these companies continue to be champions for  effective and productive dialogue between our elected parliaments. We  thank them for their support of our Congressional Study Groups.   In an increasingly tumultuous world where the bonds America shares  with her allies abroad are more important than ever, I am proud to say  the sustained involvement of our stakeholders and continued engagement  with our international partners play a critical role in the maintenance  and growth of these relationships and will continue to do so in the  years ahead.   I yield to my friend and colleague, Mr. Bart Gordon of Tennessee, for  further remarks.
