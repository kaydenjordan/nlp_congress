 Mr. President, Leader Schumer is blocking us from having  an important and timely debate on Biden's unlawful, immoral policy to  use tax dollars intended for our national defense to pay for abortions.   The world is imploding because of Biden's failed leadership and  weakness, and our country is under greater threat than it has been in  years. Meanwhile, the Biden Department of Defense is waging a war on  the unborn.   I never back down from a fight, and Democrats' tactics will not deter  my work to stop Biden from forcing the Pentagon to provide  transportation tourism for abortion with taxpayers' hard-earned money.   As a mom, soon-to-be grandma, and 23-year combat veteran and retired  lieutenant colonel of our great U.S. Army, I firmly believe the  Pentagon should be focusing on protecting innocent life, not destroying  it. That is why I have led the legislation to overturn this abhorrent  policy and why I am here today to continue my fight for life.   Congress has been clear for nearly half a century: The Hyde amendment  protects taxpayers from being forced to fund abortions, and that  includes the Department of Defense.   Senator Schumer should stop obstructing the world's greatest  deliberative body from debating this important, longstanding issue.   A ``yes'' vote on this motion would allow me to offer the House- passed, pro-life provisions similar to my own bill. Including these  protections in the Defense bill would restore the DoD's mission  integrity by preventing any taxpayer funding for Biden's radical  abortion tourism, including travel costs.   America is being threatened by adversaries at home and abroad. Why  are President Biden and Leader Schumer dividing us with their radical  abortion agenda?   This is a moment where we should all stand united in the defense of  our Nation. Let's do so today.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote yes to defeat  Schumer's gross attempt to silence our voices and those of the unborn.                      Motion to Table Amendment No. 1373    Mr. President, I move to table the Schumer amendment No. 1373 for the  purposes of offering my amendment numbered 1376, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.
