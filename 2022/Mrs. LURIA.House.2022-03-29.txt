 Madam Speaker, I come from a coastal district in  Virginia, and the responsibilities and duties of the Coast Guard are  integral to our everyday activities.   While I will vote to support the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization  Act for all these reasons, I must express my concerns with language  that was added to the bill in committee that makes significant  modifications to crewing aboard the important and unique vessels that  do the work lifting turbines on our growing and important offshore wind  farms including a new project in development off the coast of Virginia.   This provision assumes that the United States presently has a  sufficient number of vessels and mariners to perform this work. But as  a recent report from DoE just states, we need 3-5 of these vessels and  hundreds of skilled workers but unfortunately we currently lack them.   The proposed crewing changes--which go into effect immediately--would  block the progress Virginia and other states along the Atlantic coast  are making to produce clean energy and reduce the negative impacts of  climate change.   I'm willing to continue working with the Members of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on a reliable crewing  scheme that protects our national interests while ensuring that vital  energy work can be done. This is not the right time to make this  immediate and drastic change in the law.
