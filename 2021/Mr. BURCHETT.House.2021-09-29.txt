 Madam Speaker, Joe Biden preached vague, feel-good  messages to voters, like healing our country and pursuing  bipartisanship, during his campaign for President. In his victory  speech, he ripped off a line from Barack Obama and said: ``I pledge to  be a President who seeks not to divide but to unify, who doesn't see  red and blue States but a United States.''   Madam Speaker, these messages were blatant lies. His record 8 months  into his tenure proves his only intention is to govern on behalf of the  Democrat Party's far-left base.   Look at the ongoing farce on our southern border. The Department of  Homeland Security just released thousands of unvetted Haitian migrants  into this country, no questions asked. Even worse, the President turned  his back on Border Patrol agents over that bogus horse photo.   Our government wouldn't behave this way unless it was worried about  backlash from leftists who want to open our borders and defund the  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.   The border has been out of control from the moment Joe Biden stepped  foot in the Oval Office. Month after month after month, we hear about  Border Patrol agents encountering hundreds of thousands of migrants  attempting to illegally enter our country. President Biden put Vice  President Harris in charge of fixing our southern border, but whatever  she is doing to ``address the root cause of migration'' obviously isn't  working.   Last week, the White House press secretary whined about Republicans  giving floor speeches about the crisis at the border. I say to the  press secretary: We wouldn't need to be down here raising Hades if your  boss would quit being so soft, start doing his job, and enforce the  dadgum border laws.                                time  1030    Chaos at the southern border is just one of the many crises of Joe  Biden's own creation. I could stand down here for hours talking about  inflation caused by reckless government spending, a failed exit from  Afghanistan that left 13 American servicemembers dead, including one of  my constituents--his family lives in my neighborhood--and much more.   But my point is this, Madam Speaker, Americans across the political  spectrum see Joe Biden standing idly by while this country is being  destroyed. They think this President is grossly incompetent and  incapable of responsibly running the executive branch. I have even  talked to Democrats here in Congress who are extremely concerned about  these very issues.   Serious problems are getting worse, yet Joe Biden doesn't show any  interest in solving them. Given this President's lack of interest in  serving as Chief Executive, I can confidently say this President is  mentally unwell and unfit for office.   It is time for Joe Biden to step down. We need a leader who cares  about the future of this country, not one who isn't even aware of the  damage he is causing.
