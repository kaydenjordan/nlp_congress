 Madam Speaker, high-quality, high-speed  broadband is essential in today's interconnected and interdependent  world. Underserved communities throughout America need internet access  for education, transportation, and healthcare services and to realize  the full potential of all of our citizens.   The American Rescue Plan provides money, lots of money, for State and  local governments to expand broadband. The bipartisan infrastructure  law builds on that effort by making a $65 billion investment in  broadband.   Madam Speaker, I urge the Federal Government and local governments in  western New York to move quickly and effectively to ensure everyone can  realize their full potential with access to quality, high-speed  broadband.                            ____________________
