 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  opposition to this sham Republican budget resolution.   After wringing their hands for the last 8 years about debt and  deficits, today's resolution makes clear Republicans care about fiscal  discipline only when it is a Democratic President they are dealing  with. This budget resolution would add $9.5 trillion to the debt  [[Page H504]]  over the next 10 years. It has only one purpose: to provide for the  eventual repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but it would ruin our  fiscal health as well.   Of course, the ACA was fully paid for by Democrats with new revenue  and with cost-containment measures. Nonpartisan budget experts say that  repealing the ACA would actually increase the deficit by $350 billion.  So the hypocrisy of our Republican colleagues on this issue is simply  breathtaking, even by Washington standards.   Of course, repeal of ACA wouldn't just blow a hole in the budget, it  would: destabilize the insurance market and cause premiums to  skyrocket; eliminate insurance coverage for 30 million Americans,  including 4 million children; raise taxes on the middle-class; burden  local and rural hospitals with more uncompensated care; eliminate  Medicaid benefits for millions of vulnerable citizens; and abolish  vital patient protections, including the provision that stopped  insurance companies from discriminating against those with preexisting  condition.   After more than 6 years, moreover, we are still waiting for that  comprehensive Republican plan to replace the ACA. News flash: they  don't have one.    They simply don't have one. Rather than  work with Democrats to improve the ACA, Republicans continue to put  their own political ideology over the health and well-being of the  Americans we are all pledged to serve.   I urge all Members to forcefully reject this budget resolution.
