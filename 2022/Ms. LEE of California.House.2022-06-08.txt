 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids Act. I thank Chairman Nadler for  bringing these bills to the floor.   Gun violence is responsible for more than 32,000 deaths each year.  This is a heartbreaking moment for so many of us. This is a public  health crisis in our country. It is an epidemic.   The victims of Buffalo, Uvalde, Tulsa, and other mass shootings  deserve more than our thoughts and prayers.   Last week, I met with young, gun violence survivors in my district.  They spoke powerfully about the cycle of violence and the easy access  to guns, especially ghost guns. They talked about the trauma they  endured by themselves, their families, and their communities. This is  nothing new. This has been going on for so many years, and they are  asking us to take action to save lives.   This bill responds to their call by raising the age for purchase of  certain firearms.    All I am saying is, all of our children who  have died through gun violence had a right to live, and they had a  right to life.   So I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and to take action so  that we can save countless lives. Let's protect our kids. I thank the  chairman again for yielding.
