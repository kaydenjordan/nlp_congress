 Mr. Speaker, as the Congressman from eastern  Connecticut, it is a proud moment for me to congratulate the UConn  men's basketball team for winning this year's NCAA national  championship on April 4, just a couple weeks ago.   Mr. Speaker, the UConn men starting out in this season back in  November were not even ranked in any of the leading polls. Yet, despite  that negativity, they tuned it out and really came together as a team  led by a great coach, Danny Hurley.   By the time they got to the NCAA playoffs, their average margin of  victory was over 15 points per game. It is a record in terms of NCAA  championships in the past, and a great testament to a group of young  men who are now going to go on and do greater things, whether it is in  the NBA or next year's college basketball season.   It is a great program. This is their fifth title since 1999. The  women's team has won 11 titles. It is truly easy, I think without  exaggeration, to say that I represent the basketball capital of the  world for college basketball: Storrs, Connecticut.                            ____________________
