 Madam Speaker, right now is not the time for a  partisan exercise that could be used as propaganda by the ayatollahs.  Instead, Congress should be united in condemning a regime that has been  attacking America and our allies for 40 years.   Qasem Soleimani was the head of the most dangerous and well-armed  terrorist organization in the world, and his death has removed a major  terrorist leader off the battlefield. This decision followed repeated  rocket attacks by Iranian proxies on American forces and an attempt to  storm our embassy in Baghdad.   This decision was based on intelligence that our Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff has described as compelling, imminent, and very  clear, as Soleimani was planning attacks against our troops. This is an  assessment with which I concur.   No one wants another war in the Middle East. Instead of tying the  hands of our military, we should be sending a strong message to the  Iranian regime that there will be consequences for their reign of  terror, and we will protect our citizens at all costs.   The Iranian regime has killed over 600 American troops in Iraq. They  have killed over 1,500 of their own people for peacefully protesting.  They have lied to the world about their nuclear arsenal.   Appeasing them will only make future conflict and bloodshed more  likely. That is why I wish today, instead of this partisan exercise,  that we were sending to the Government of Iran a clearer message that  no elected official in America is supportive of its behavior.
