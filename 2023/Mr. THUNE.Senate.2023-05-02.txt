 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is about time. Ninety days after his  last meeting with Speaker McCarthy and after weeks of pointblank  refusal to engage in discussion, President Biden finally agreed to meet  with the Speaker about debt ceiling legislation.   I will say it again. It is about time. If the administration's  estimate is correct, the United States is mere weeks away from reaching  the limit of its borrowing capacity--which means, of course, that the  President has to reach an agreement with the Republican-led House of  Representatives on a debt ceiling bill, but the President has been  completely AWOL on this issue.   While I am very pleased that the President's Treasury Secretary has  apparently managed to convey the urgency of the situation to the  President and that the President is actually going to sit down with  Speaker McCarthy , it remains to be seen how seriously the President  will take negotiations.   He certainly hasn't been taking this issue seriously so far.   House Republicans, on the other hand, have been taking this issue  seriously. They have offered legislation to raise the debt ceiling,  paired with spending reforms to slow the rate at which we are  accumulating debt. But up until 18 hours ago, the President was  refusing to engage on the issue at all.   The day Republicans passed their debt ceiling legislation last week,  the President was asked if he would sit down with Speaker McCarthy to  negotiate on the debt limit. His reply: I am happy to meet with the  Speaker but not on the debt limit. The debt limit isn't negotiable.   In other words, it is my way or the highway. You either accept my  position on the debt limit--a debt ceiling increase with no spending  reforms--or I will let our Nation default.   If that is not an unserious position, I don't know what is.   The fact is, in recent history, increases in the debt limit have  almost always been the result of negotiations, and 7 of the last 10--7  of the last 10--debt limit increases have included some mix of policy  or budgetary changes rather than simply a straight increase. No matter  how much President Biden would like his word on the debt ceiling to be  law, the fact of the matter is that in our system of government the  President does not have absolute power. And when the American people  have sent divided government to Washington, as they did in the last  election, then if you can't persuade the other side to see things your  way, you have to negotiate. You have to compromise.   President Biden understood this at one time. Back in 2011, here is  what then-Vice President Biden had to say about lawmakers who didn't  want to negotiate on a debt ceiling increase:         How can you explain the fact that grown men and women are       unwilling to budge up till now, and still some of them are       still unwilling to budge, by taking an absolute position:       ``My way or no way.'' That's not governing. That's no way to       govern. You can't govern that way.    That from President, then-Vice President, Biden back in 2011.   Then-Vice President Biden was right, and I am very much hoping that  he will remember those words now and not only sit down with Speaker  McCarthy but actually commit to reaching a compromise.   I was not encouraged by a reference from the Senate Democratic  leader's office to sitting down with congressional leaders to discuss a  ``clean'' debt limit bill. That hardly displays an understanding of the  fact that any debt ceiling legislation will require compromise between  the White House and House Republicans.   It is also the height of hypocrisy for the Democrat leader to talk  about a ``clean'' debt limit bill when just a few years ago he was  using the debt ceiling as leverage to negotiate with President Trump.  But, apparently, ``one rule for me, another for thee'' are the  Democrats' watchwords.   Our Nation's debt situation is very serious. Our current national  debt is over $31 trillion--yes, $31 trillion--and it is projected to  grow to more than $50 trillion over the next decade, at least if the  President's budget were to be adopted. That is an unfathomable amount  of money, and more to the point, it is an entirely dangerous amount of  money.   Our national debt has already exceeded the size of our economy, which  is a very dangerous marker to hit. Under our current trajectory, by  2033, debt held by the public will be at the highest level relative to  GDP--relative to the size of our economy--literally, in history,  exceeding even post-World War II levels.   In fact, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget, 50 cents of every dollar our country borrows in the  next 10 years will go just toward paying interest on our national debt.  [[Page S1448]]    Debt at that level threatens economic growth. It sucks money away  from essential government spending on things like Social Security and  Medicare and our national defense, and it leaves us excessively  dependent on other countries, sometimes hostile countries, that hold  our Nation's debt. And for all of those reasons and more, it threatens  our national security.   House Republicans are absolutely right to take this opportunity to  insist on some attempt to at least slow our rate of spending, and the  American people would seem to agree. A recent poll found that 65  percent of Americans--including--including 58 percent of Democrats,  believe that the ``debt ceiling debate is a good time to force tough  issues, like cutting future spending to reduce the deficit.'' That is  the way the question was worded in the poll.   Let me just repeat that.   Sixty-five percent of Americans, including fifty-eight percent of  Democrats, believe that the ``debt ceiling debate is a good time to  force tough issues, like cutting future spending to reduce the  deficit.'' Let's hope that Democrats are paying attention.   The ball is in the President's court. House Republicans have been at  the table for a while now. They have offered ideas. They have put  forward and passed legislation. Now it is up to President Biden. He can  either get serious about this fundamental responsibility, engage in  real negotiations with Speaker McCarthy , and arrive at a genuine  compromise on debt ceiling legislation or he can continue to refuse to  meaningfully engage on this issue and ensure that his Presidency will  be remembered not just for a massive inflation crisis but for a  Democratic default on the debt. The choice is his.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
