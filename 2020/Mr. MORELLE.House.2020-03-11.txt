 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  [[Page H1598]]  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my dear  friend, Ron Pettengill, a pillar of the Rochester community, who passed  away on February 28.   As head of the local carpenters union in Rochester and Monroe County  building trades, Ron defined the Rochester labor movement, dedicating  himself and his life's work to improving the lives of working people  everywhere.   Our community is a better and more equitable place because of his  tireless commitment to advocating for social change. Ron's work will  continue to open doors for people in our community for generations to  come. I am so proud to have been able to call him my friend.   I join all of Rochester in mourning his loss and extend my prayers  and deepest sympathies to the Pettengill family.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 10 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, March 12, 2020, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
