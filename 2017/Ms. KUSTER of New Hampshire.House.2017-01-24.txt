 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the  New England Patriots on reaching their NFL record ninth Super Bowl. The  very questionable suspension of Tom Brady early in the season could not  stop New England or the determination and dedication to excellence that  defines the New England Patriots.   Fans throughout New Hampshire and beyond are incredibly proud of  their team and the unparalleled success of Tom Brady and Bill  Belichick. But they would be the first to tell you that the success of  the Patriots lies with not one individual but instead is built upon the  core value of team before self. This year, the motto made famous by New  England, ``Do Your Job,'' is as true as ever.   When the Patriots face the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI, I will  be joined by everyone across New Hampshire and throughout New England  in offering them good luck. Go Pats.                            ____________________
