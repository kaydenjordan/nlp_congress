 Madam Speaker, and still I rise, a proud,  liberated Democrat.   I rise today on this occasion of remembrance, remembrance of the  victims of the Holocaust. I rise to associate myself with comments that  have been made by others.   I would first note for the Record that there was a joint resolution  approved on September 18, 1978, a joint resolution designating April 28  and 29 of 1979 as Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust.   President Carter, who signed H.J. Res. 1014, Public Law 95-371,  approved on September 18, 1978, indicated in a public statement, ``The  resolution was passed unanimously by both Houses of Congress. This  reflects our Nation's wholehearted conviction that the lessons of the  Holocaust must never be forgotten.''   Madam Speaker, I acknowledge and associate myself with a statement  from President Joe Biden, dated April 22, 2022. It is styled, ``A  Proclamation on Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust,  2022.''   In this statement, he indicates, among many other things that I  associate myself with, ``The world must never forget the truth of what  happened across Europe during the Holocaust or forget the horrific  crimes and suffering the Nazi regime inflicted on millions''--I  underscore it by saying it twice--``millions of innocent people.''  A Proclamation on Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, 2022         On Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and throughout       this week of remembrance, we reflect on the horrors of the       Holocaust when the Nazi regime systematically murdered 6       million Jews and millions of other innocents, including Roma,       Sinti, Slavs, persons with disabilities, LGBTQI+ individuals,       political dissidents, and many others. We stand with Jewish       people in the United States, Israel, and around the world in       grieving one of the darkest chapters in history. We honor the       memories of the victims. We embrace the survivors. We commit       to keeping alive the promise of ``never again.''        The world must never forget the truth of what happened       across Europe during the Holocaust or forget the horrific       crimes and suffering the Nazi regime inflicted on millions of       innocent people. Entire families were wiped out. Communities       were shattered. Survivors were left with agonizing memories       and fading tattoos etched into their skin by the Nazis,       reducing them to numbers. It is forever recorded into the       history of mankind, and it is the shared responsibility of us       all to ensure that the Shoah is never erased from our       collective memory--especially as fewer and fewer survivors       remain. The truth must always be known and shared with future       generations in perpetuity.        I have taught my own children and grandchildren about the       horrors of the Holocaust, just as my father taught me. I have       taken my family to bear witness to the darkness at the Dachau       concentration camp so that they could understand why we must       always speak out against antisemitism and hatred in all of       its pernicious forms. The legacy of the Holocaust must always       remind us that silence in the face of such bigotry is       complicity.        Remembrance is our eternal duty, but remembrance without       action risks becoming an empty ritual. As individuals, we       must never be indifferent to human cruelty and human       suffering. As nations, we must stand together across the       international community against antisemitism, which is once       again rearing its ugly head around the world. We must combat       other forms of hatred and educate new generations about the       Holocaust. We must reject those who try to deny the Holocaust       or to distort its history for their own ends. We recognize       that, just as the Holocaust was an act of pure antisemitism,       so too Holocaust denial is a form of antisemitism. We watch       with dismay as the term ``Nazi'' is deployed to make flawed       historical parallels. Efforts to minimize, distort, or blur       who the Nazis were and the genocide they perpetrated are a       form of Holocaust denial and, in addition to insulting both       the victims and survivors of the Holocaust, spread       antisemitism.        My Administration has stepped up our efforts to counter all       the ugly forms antisemitism can take, including Holocaust       denial and distortion. We co-sponsored a United Nations       resolution that charged the international community with       combating Holocaust denial through education. We are       partnering with the German government to improve Holocaust       education and counter Holocaust denial and distortion. A       renowned scholar of the Holocaust and antisemitism, Deborah       Lipstadt, was recently confirmed as Special Envoy to Monitor       and Combat Antisemitism.        In addition to speaking out against the evils of       antisemitism, I signed--and my Administration continues to       implement--legislation that gives us more tools to combat       crimes that are based on a victim's actual or perceived race,       religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender       identity or disability. We issued the first-ever National       Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism. My Administration       has implemented increased funding for a program that helps       threatened nonprofits--including houses of worship and other       religious affiliated entities--to improve their safety and       security. On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, I met       with Bronia Brandman and the Vice President met with Ruth       Cohen--both Auschwitz survivors--at the White House so we       could bear witness to their stories, combat Holocaust denial       and distortion, and give life to the lessons of that most       terrible period in human history.        Those like Bronia and Ruth who survived the Holocaust and       went on to build new lives inspire our Nation and the world,       and they are living testaments to the enduring resilience of       the human spirit. It is the responsibility of all of us to       recognize the pain that they carry and to support them by       ensuring that the cruelty of the Holocaust is never       forgotten. Today and every day, we stand against antisemitism       and all other forms of hate and continue our work to ensure       that everyone can live in a world that safeguards the       fundamental human dignity of all people.        Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the       United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested       in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States,       do hereby proclaim April 24 through May 1, 2022, as a week of       observance of the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the       Holocaust, and call upon the people of the United States to       observe this week and pause to remember victims and survivors       of the Holocaust.        In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this       twenty-second day of April, in the year of our Lord two       thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United       States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.                                               Joseph R. Biden, Jr.     Madam Speaker, I rise to place in the Record a  statement from Speaker Pelosi styled, ``Pelosi Statement on Holocaust  Remembrance Day.'' Among the many things said that I agree with is this  statement: ``This occasion serves as a reminder of the profound danger  posed by hateful violence when met with indifference.'' Hateful  violence when met with indifference.               Pelosi Statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day         ``On Holocaust Remembrance Day, we pause to reflect on the       unfathomable evils of the Shoah. As we mourn the six million       Jews and countless others murdered across Europe, we also       honor the survivors who have bravely shared their stories so       that such atrocities may never be repeated. More than seven       decades later, we remain outraged by the Nazis' barbaric       crimes and unwavering in our commitment to fulfilling       humanity's sacred promise: Never Again.        ``This occasion serves as a reminder of the profound danger       posed by hateful violence when met with indifference. In       2020, I had the solemn privilege of leading a Congressional       delegation to Poland and Israel to commemorate the 75th       anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, bearing witness       to hate's destructive consequences. The epidemic of       antisemitism still remains today, threatening Jewish       communities both at home and around the world. Shadows of       these same dark forces have reached into more communities,       from the surge of bigoted violence across the country to       crimes against humanity being perpetrated abroad, including       against Ukraine.        ``Our nation must never fail to call out and defeat these       perilous threats wherever and whenever they arise. In 1943,       my father Thomas D'Alesandro appealed to `the American sense       of justice and decency' as he implored the Roosevelt       Administration to take action against the horrors of the       Holocaust. Today, driven by those fundamental American       values, the Congress is working to preserve our collective       memories of the past, educate the next generation and speak       out against all of hate's vile manifestations. Congressional       action has helped forge a safer, more just society: from       combating antisemitism by strengthening Holocaust education       resources and establishing Congressionally mandated Days of       Remembrance to fighting hate-fueled violence by enacting the       COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and the Emmett Till Antilynching       Act.        Today, joining with House colleagues to honor those       murdered in the Shoah, I recalled the moving words inscribed       on San Francisco's Holocaust Memorial: `In remembrance is the       secret of redemption.' Let us  [[Page H4579]]       reflect on that truth as we seek to find redemption in a       future of dignity and justice for all. May we never forget       the horrors inflicted on so many innocent souls, and may we       never relent in our righteous fight to put an end to the       scourge of hate.''     Madam Speaker, I rise and desire that the  statement from Majority Leader Hoyer be acknowledged. His statement is  styled, ``Hoyer Statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day.'' And I  associate myself with many of the things in this statement, but the  thing that I want to associate myself with the most are the final words  in his statement: ``Never Forget. Never Again.'' I associate myself  with his statement.                Hoyer Statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day         ``On Yom HaShoah, we remember the six million Jews and       millions of others murdered by the Nazis during the       Holocaust. The genocide perpetrated by Adolf Hitler and his       fascist collaborators--and enabled by the indifference of       millions of people in Germany and across Europe--continues to       bear scars to this day, with the families of victims and       survivors still living with immense trauma and grief. The       Holocaust was not only an immeasurable tragedy for the Jewish       people; it was also a low point for humanity, when the worst       evils of human hatred were unleashed in a way that was       methodical and on an industrial scale in an effort to       dehumanize and destroy an entire ethnic group. First by       enacting degrading racial laws and forcing Jewish people to       live in squalid ghettos and wear identifying marks for the       purposes of ostracism and discrimination, and later through a       systematic program of either deportation to labor and death       camps or the massacre of entire communities by mobile killing       squads, the Nazis taught the world a lesson on what happens       when antisemitism and other forms of racism and bigotry are       allowed to fester unchecked and are taken to their extreme.       Every human being who inhabits our planet has a       responsibility to learn the lessons of the Holocaust because       it is a warning to all of humanity. `Never Again!' must be a       promise kept by all. ``Terrifyingly, however, we are now       seeing in our day a dangerous rise in violent antisemitism       here at home and around the world. Extremists of all kinds       have revived Nazi tropes, and too many make light of Adolf       Hitler and the reality of his crimes against humanity. There       ought to be no celebration or even condoning of him or those       who helped him perpetrate the Holocaust. At the same time,       some have chosen to invoke the Holocaust flippantly when       engaging in debates about policy, which is not only deeply       inappropriate but also insulting to its victims, its       survivors, and their families. In much the same vein, the       misuse of the Holocaust and Nazism by Vladimir Putin in an       attempt to justify his unjustifiable and criminal invasion of       Ukraine--as well as the disgusting misuse of the Holocaust to       criticize the Jewish State of Israel, a democracy based in       human rights and the rule of law--is a cynical and disturbing       effort to twist history upside down. Together, all who       support truth and cherish human rights and human dignity must       oppose such statements and efforts.        ``The Nazis tried to destroy the Jewish people, but their       resilience, defiance, and heroism--and the sacrifices of so       many brave American servicemembers who were liberators and       rescuers--overcame Hitler's evil plans. Today, the success       and vibrancy of the State of Israel and the flourishing of       Jewish communities in America and around the world is a       living testament to Nazism's defeat and to the triumph of       justice. I'm proud to be the Majority Leader in a House that       affirms, again and again, that antisemitism has no place in       our country or in our politics--and to continue serving as a       leader in the broad, bipartisan coalition in Congress       ensuring that our ally Israel remains safe and strong and       that America and Israel can be successful together in rooting       out hatred, injustice, and antisemitism on Earth. ``Never       Forget. Never Again.''     Madam Speaker, I have Jewish friends, as I  believe most people do, and I have spoken to them about the horrors of  the Holocaust. I have been to Israel, and I have been to Yad Vashem. I  assure you, a visit to Yad Vashem can become a seminal moment in your  life because of what it shows with clarity about the horrors of the  Holocaust.   I am so proud that our leadership has gone on record in remembrance,  and I am proud that this Congress passed a resolution signed by  President Carter initially for days of remembrance.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, and still I rise. I thank Mr.  Meeks for what he has done to bring this legislation to fruition, as  well as Mr. Wilson.   I rise and I stand where I stand because we should all stand  together. I stand here because we are engaged in a war for the world,  and Ukraine is the front line of democracy in this war.   We cannot allow a ruthless, reckless, careless dictator to dictate  the terms of engagement. The terms of engagement for us will have to be  set by us.   Our President has said no boots on the ground. I agree, but that  doesn't mean that we can't have planes in the air that Ukrainians will  pilot. That doesn't mean that we can't have tanks on the ground with  the Ukrainians manning them. It doesn't mean that you can't have  torpedoes in the water that Ukrainians are going to fire. It simply  means this: We have no choice. If we allow this to happen, what happens  when some other dictator decides that he is going to threaten?   I believe that this legislation is a continuation of what President  Biden has said he would do. No boots on the ground. We provide the  armaments; they provide the army.   We are engaged in a war for the world. We must win. Ukraine must be  victorious in this battle.
