 Benjamin Franklin once famously said that those who  would give up liberty for security deserve neither.   My home, Dearborn, Michigan, is home to the largest population of  Arab Americans in this country. They are constantly targeted very  irrationally. Yet, Michigan, unfortunately, also lays claim to the  Michigan Militia, which was responsible for one of the worst acts of  terrorism in this country.   Muslims, Arab Americans, are my neighbors. They are my friends. They  are doctors, teachers, and pharmacists. They are part of this country.   Policies like the Muslim travel ban have no place in the United  States of America. It disrespects freedom of religion, and it is  unconstitutional.   National security experts have been clear that the Muslim ban has  made our country less safe. In fact, strong national security policies  include protecting the fundamental pillars of our democracy: freedom of  religion, freedom of speech, compassion, and justice. We must stand  together as Americans against unjust policies like this.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my wonderful chairman.   I rise in strong support of the Great American Outdoors Act. This  historic legislation makes good on our commitment to preserve our  Nation's environmental heritage for future generations.   This is an emotional moment for me. It provides full permanent  funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, landmark conservation  legislation that my late husband, John Dingell, wrote and helped  establish in 1964.   The LWCF funding has protected Michigan and the Nation's critical  natural resources, while supporting local economies, creating jobs, and  providing opportunities for outdoor recreation throughout the country.                                time  1300    LWCF was permanently authorized in 2019 as part of the John D.  Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act but has  received full funding only twice in its long history. The permanent  full funding in this legislation is the culmination of decades of work  by the conservation community; my late husband; and our wonderful  current dean,   Don Young, who first advocated for this permanent  funding through the Conservation and Reinvestment Act in 1999.   Additionally, the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Land  Restoration Fund included in the legislation will allow us to finally  address the $22 billion deferred maintenance backlog in our Nation's  public lands, a decades-long problem in the making.   I am proud today to stand with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to  [[Page H3649]]  continue that Dingell conservation legacy--I don't look like the  greatest outdoors girl, but I know how important they are--which  represents the boldest, most comprehensive conservation effort in  decades.
