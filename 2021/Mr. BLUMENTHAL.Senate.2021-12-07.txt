 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Mr. Carl  Leogrande, a remarkable man and World War II veteran who turns 100 on  January 3, 2022.   Following the invasion of Normandy, Mr. Leogrande served as a tank  driver for the 12th Armored Division. After his tank was hit with  artillery, Mr. Leogrande was transferred to the medical unit. While  there, he efficiently deployed his first aid training from his days as  a Boy Scout. This methodical, effective work earned Mr. Leogrande the  attention of an officer. Soon, he received warfront training and was  quickly assigned as a medic on the front lines.   Mr. Leogrande's division pushed eastward. Along the way, they passed  concentration camps that were being liberated by other units. The  indescribable sights and smells left Mr. Leogrande with trauma that he  speaks of to this day.   At the age of 22, Mr. Leogrande returned home unharmed. Not long  after,  [[Page S8960]]  he went on a blind date with a young woman named Annabelle. She ended  up becoming the love of his life, and the two married a year and a half  later.   In the 1970s, Mr. and Mrs. Leogrande moved to Mystic, CT, which they  would call their home for the rest of their lives. They became proud  member-owners of the Steamboat Wharf Condominium Association. The two  were married for over five and a half decades, until Mrs. Leogrande  passed away in 2003.   Mr. Leogrande continues to attend every reunion of the 12th Armored  Division. Though 782 members were lost during the war, 14 of them still  remain, and Mr. Leogrande looks forward to joining his fellow soldiers  for their 2022 reunion, which will take place in Texas.   Mr. Leogrande's tireless service will be an enduring legacy. I  applaud his many accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join me in  congratulating Mr. Carl Leogrande on this milestone of his 100th  birthday.                            ____________________
