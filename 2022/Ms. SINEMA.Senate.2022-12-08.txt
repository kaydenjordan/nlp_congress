 Madam President, thanks for letting me speak here. I am  not even on the list.   I just wanted to say a few comments about my friend and colleague Rob  Portman. I am not actually one to come and give a lot of speeches on  the floor so this is a big deal. A lot of people stood up today to talk  about Rob's accomplishments, of which they are numerous, but I want to  talk about the Rob who is my friend.   Rob and I worked together for 6 months straight on the infrastructure  package last year, which, as Rob mentioned in his comments, we built  from the center out, which I am inordinately proud of. It is the  model for how the legislative process should work in this country. I  couldn't be more proud of him. I think, over the course of those 6  months, though, I shared more meals and more glasses of wine with Rob  than with anyone in my personal life--ever. So, for that, I say to his  wife and his children, I am sorry because Rob and I spent more time  together, poring over spreadsheets in the basement of this U.S.  Capitol, than I have ever spent with anyone, and I couldn't be more  grateful for every one of those minutes.    Rob, in addition to being incredibly smart, incredibly focused, and  incredibly committed to outcomes is also a delightful human being, and  I consider him one of my closest friends in the world.   Rob, I am going to miss you so much, and I can't wait to go on ride  bikes together. I don't want to go to the support group--I have no  interest in that--but what I do have an interest in is spending time  with you for many years to come. You are an incredible friend. You have  got an incredible team that you have assembled, and I couldn't be more  honored and privileged to consider you a lifelong friend. Thanks.   I yield the floor.
