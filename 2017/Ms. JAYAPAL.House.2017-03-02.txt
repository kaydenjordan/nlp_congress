 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Simply put, Mr. Speaker, this amendment restricts the President from  making public statements to promote his own business interests in the  same way that the bill restricts statements by agencies on pending  rules. If we intend to hold agencies accountable for their statements,  we should certainly be willing to hold the President of the United  States to those same standards. Donald Trump's enormous web of business  interests and conflicts of interest make it clear that it is necessary  to explicitly expand this restriction to the President.   It is deeply disturbing, Mr. Speaker, that the President has refused  to release his tax returns or create a blind trust for the proceeds of  his assets. Numerous U.S. Presidents have placed their financial  holdings into a blind trust that is managed by a trustee without any  input from the President. This allows for the President to minimize any  conflicts of interest and any suggestion that the Presidency of the  United States is being used for his own personal profits.   This President, however, has avoided those calls for him to sell his  assets or place them into a blind trust. Instead, documents obtained  through public records requests show that President Trump has moved the  assets over, just in name, to his son and a longtime employee, but that  Trump himself, the President of the United States, is the sole  beneficiary of all of those trusts.   In other words, there is no wall erected between his businesses and  his Presidency, and anyone who wants to buy influence can simply do so  openly. His entire Presidency can be seen as a promotion of his  business interests and be used by domestic and foreign governments to  curry favor and produce benefit to his personal empire.   Trump Tower in D.C. is one example of this. The building, which is  leased to him by the Federal Government, stipulates in its lease that  ``any elected official of the Government of the United States'' may not  derive any benefit from that agreement. At 12:01 p.m. on Inauguration  Day, Trump was in violation of this clause. That lease should be  terminated effective immediately.   Just last week, the Kuwaiti Embassy held its annual event to  celebrate the country's national day at the President's D.C. hotel. The  event was initially scheduled to take place at the Four Seasons, and,  in fact, a ``save the date'' went out with the Four Seasons location.  But Kuwait canceled that reservation just a few days after the  election, and moved the event to the President's hotel after that  happened.   These are not isolated instances. They constitute a pattern of  conflicts of interest every time a foreign government holds a reception  or rents a room at a Trump property, a problem so important to this  country that it was put into the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution  of the United States of America.   The American people should also be deeply concerned about conflicts  of interest at the President's Mar-a-Lago resort. On January 1, 2017,  just 2 months after the election of Donald Trump, the exclusive resort  doubled its membership initiation fee from $100,000 to $200,000. When  Trump took Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe there, it created even  more free publicity for the resort as several social media posts were  made throughout the weekend.   Conducting government affairs in public settings not only has serious  national security concerns, but indicates that anyone who wants to be a  member of the club will have access to the President of the United  States, and the President will personally profit off of their  membership.   Mr. Speaker, the American people have a right to know what the entire  web of conflicts of interest are, but we have yet to get this  information because we have not received--we have yet to get any  information from this President, his tax returns, or any of the  documents that help us to ensure that he is complying with the  Constitution of the United States of America, that document that he  swore to uphold and protect, so that we can make sure that he is not  using the highest office of this land to profit.                                time  1100    The American people have the right to demand that this President put  their interests first rather than his own business interests.   I urge all of my colleagues to pass this motion to recommitment and  demand that we uphold our Constitution, protect this democracy and the  duty of this President to work not for the business interests, but for  we the people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
