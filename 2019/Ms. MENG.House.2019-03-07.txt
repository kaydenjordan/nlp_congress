 Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Massachusetts  (Ms. Pressley) for yielding her time.   I strongly agree with my friend from Massachusetts. I thank her for  sponsoring this important amendment, and  [[Page H2521]]  I am proud to cosponsor it with her. It addresses a crucial and often  ignored issue that I have been fighting to raise awareness of during my  time in Congress.   I have met with students across the State of New York and across the  country and am incredibly impressed with their drive and passion  directed at the democratic process.   Across the country, these students are getting involved. They are  marching. They are advocating for their generation's future, and they  are asserting their position in our society.   This is why I am proud to have introduced a constitutional amendment  in the 115th and the 116th Congress to lower the voting age to 16 for  Federal, State, and local elections.   The amendment in front of us today gives 16-year-olds the right to  vote in Federal elections. In localities that have already granted 16- year-olds the right to vote, we have seen an increase in voter  participation and better debate.   Madam Chair, 16-year-olds participate in our democracy already. They  are legally permitted to work. They pay Federal taxes on their income  and can even be tried as adults in court. It is only just that they are  given the right to vote.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Pressley) for championing this cause. I know this fight will continue.   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
