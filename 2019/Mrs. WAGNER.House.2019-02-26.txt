 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, if we, indeed, defeat the previous question, we will  allow consideration of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act.   I introduced this legislation because the Constitution clearly states  that all persons born in this country are entitled to life, liberty,  and equal protection under the law. The Constitution does not put age  limits on those who are entitled to life.   I am horrified, Mr. Speaker, that many in the United States Senate,  many Democrats, flagrantly violated the United States Constitution last  night and voted down the Born-Alive Act, embracing, in fact,  infanticide.   Pro-abortion politicians used to say life begins at birth. Now it is  more unclear than ever when they believe that life actually begins or  whether they even believe that living and breathing human beings should  be protected under the law.   I would like to commend three Democrats, in fact--Senators Bob Casey,  Joe Manchin, and Doug Jones--who defended the basic rights of newborn  children and voted for my legislation last evening in the United States  Senate.   I introduced this legislation because it is just common sense. I am  shocked that there are prominent American legislators who believe in  denying babies lifesaving medical care when they are born.   As a mother, a grandmother, a legislator, and an advocate who came to  Congress to serve as a voice for the voiceless, I believe that life  begins at conception and that it is wrong to kill a child no matter how  many weeks old he or she may be. But I am grieved to find that I now  must defend something that I never thought we would have to fight for:  lifesaving care for babies born alive.  [[Page H2116]]    In response to radical legislators who are promoting not just late- term abortions but infanticide, it is essential that we come together  to protect children.                                time  1300    So today, I am here to ask--no, Mr. Speaker, I am here to implore--my  colleagues to right the wrong that the Senate has committed and defeat  the previous question, and at least allow the debate to support H.R.  962, the Born-Alive Act here in the people's House.   Mr. Speaker, this should not be a partisan issue. Congress must never  stop fighting to ensure that every single newborn baby in the United  States of America receives lifesaving care, no matter their sex or  their race or ethnicity or whether or not they are wanted and cuddled  and wrapped into that first warm hug that they deserve.   The Born-Alive Act is the simplest vote any of us can take: Do you  support babies receiving lifesaving care after they are born, or would  you deny these innocent children that care and allow them to be left to  die and be discarded?   This is bipartisan legislation, Mr. Speaker. Last year, six of my  Democratic colleagues joined me in voting for the Born-Alive Act.   I hope that we will bring this bill to the floor for debate so that  many more of my colleagues can go on the record and vote to stand with  America's mothers and children.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question.
