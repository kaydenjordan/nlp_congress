 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week, President Biden announced  his choice to succeed Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court,  Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Judge Jackson was confirmed less than a  year ago to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.   Now, every Senator must carefully evaluate Judge Jackson's record,  legal views, and judicial philosophy. The nominee, the Senate, the  Court, and the American people all deserve a process that is free of  embarrassing antics that have become the Democratic Party's routine  whenever a Republican President nominates a new Justice--the baseless  smears, the shameless distortions. The country deserves a process that  is painstakingly rigorous and befitting the seriousness of a lifetime  appointment to our highest Court.   I, for one, don't care what Judge Jackson's friends wrote in her high  school yearbook. I care that American families are facing major crises  that bear directly on Federal courts and our legal system, from surging  violent crime and systematically weak prosecutors to open borders and  campaigns to shrink religious freedom and the rights of conscience.   What is more, one of our two major political sides increasingly makes  noise about attacking the very legitimacy and structure of the Supreme  Court itself. The country needs a serious and sobering examination of  all of it.   I look forward to discussing these issues and many others with Judge  Jackson when I meet with her tomorrow morning.   It has been less than 1 year since Judge Jackson was confirmed to the  DC Circuit. Since then, I understand she has authored only two  opinions,  [[Page S847]]  both in the last several weeks. I am troubled by the combination of  this slim appellate record and the intensity of Judge Jackson's far- left, dark money fan club.   Throughout the jockeying that preceded President Biden's announcement  and, indeed, dating back to her prior confirmation last year, Judge  Jackson has attracted loyal and intense support from some of the very  same dark money, far-left activists who have declared war on the  institution of the Court itself. One has to wonder why these leftwing  organizations worked so very hard to boost Judge Jackson for this  potential promotion.   I am sincerely looking forward to meeting Judge Jackson, to a  thorough conversation tomorrow morning, and to the vigorous Senate  process that lies ahead.                          State of the Union Address    Mr. President, on another matter, tonight, President Biden will  deliver his first State of the Union Address.   One year into his term, the American people have a lot of questions  they would like answered: why Democrats plunged ahead with reckless  spending that caused the worst inflation in 40 years, why violent crime  and illegal immigration are setting all-time records, why the  administration haphazardly withdrew from Afghanistan and proposed to  cut defense spending after inflation at a time when Russia is trying to  redraw maps in human blood.   When President Biden took office 1 year ago, he inherited major  tailwinds and a brimming optimism. Brilliant scientists and Operation  Warp Speed had developed vaccines in record time, and we were already  putting doses in more than a million arms every day. Scientific data  had already proven that, after a devastating year for children and  families, schools were safe to reopen in person.   Thanks to the historic CARES Act and another targeted, bipartisan  stimulus that had just passed weeks earlier, our economic foundations  had weathered the pandemic lockdowns and were primed for a roaring  recovery back to normalcy and prosperity. Before the pandemic,  Republican policies had America as a net exporter of oil for the first  time since World War II.   The same voters who gave President Biden the Presidency gave him a  razor-thin margin in both Chambers. His only mandate was to govern from  the middle.   In his inaugural address, President Biden promised to do just that-- to unite and to heal--but for the past year, he and his administration  have often behaved like they are trying to fail their own test.   Remember, the President made stifling American energy independence a  day-1 priority, killing miles of pipeline and freezing new jobs and new  exploration with the stroke of a pen.    Then came the spending bill his administration called the ``most  progressive domestic legislation in a generation'' that top liberal  economists warned would ``set off inflationary pressures . . . we have  not seen in a generation.'' Inflation has surged so steeply, most  Americans have seen their real wages actually cut.   Then came the decision to cut and run from the international  coalition we led in Afghanistan. President Biden's top military  advisers warned that retreat would embolden terrorists, endanger loyal  partners, and leave our intelligence capabilities in the region badly  handicapped; but the Biden administration failed to heed these warnings  and presided over a disastrous withdrawal. Our biggest adversaries took  notes, and now, one of them is testing the limits of the West's resolve  to oppose his murderous conquest.   Then there are the alarming trends this administration has placed on  the back burner but which communities across America are facing every  day.   After spending the Presidential campaign talking about potential  amnesties, the Biden administration wasted no time in making our  southern border more porous. The CBP has reported its highest single- year total for southern border encounters on record--with no sign of a  coherent administration response in sight.   Meanwhile, Democrats' response to a historic surge in violent crime  has been to double down on the hostility toward police and the  prosecution that has encouraged it. Across America, radical local  prosecutors are simply declining to charge whole categories of crimes.  But, instead of condemning this extremism, the Biden administration has  endorsed it, staffing their Justice Department with some of the most  outspoken critics of law and order.   Meanwhile, this Justice Department goes out of its way to keep tabs  on parents who dare to question teachers unions' veto power over  established medical science or who exhibit skepticism toward woke  propaganda in public schools.   So that is a heck of a rap sheet, but I am afraid the most damaging  legacy of President Biden's first year is bigger than just his unwise  policies. Democrats have not just tried pushing bad ideas through our  institutions; even under the Presidency of a self-styled  institutionalist, the far left has tried to wreck--wreck--our  institutions altogether.   Tonight, we will hear from a President who assigned a commission to  study packing the Supreme Court because his party didn't like its  current ideological makeup.   We will hear from a President who urged his former colleagues to tear  up Senate rules in order to rewrite the rules of American elections,  likened anyone who opposed these efforts to infamous racists, and  continues to stoke racial animus with wild nonsense about a revival of  segregation.   We will hear from an administration that has failed its own tests and  which, candidly, has the public approval figures to match.   On foreign affairs in particular, I am sincerely rooting for  President Biden's success. We need steady, serious, and smart  leadership to help guide the West through this perilous time, but on  most issues, what the American people deserve tonight is a commitment  to drastically change course. If this administration does not majorly  correct its course, the American people may correct course for them  this coming November.   I am glad the American people will also hear from Governor Kim  Reynolds this evening. She is a strong and successful leader who  delivers real solutions for the great people of Iowa. She fought COVID  without declaring war on freedom or common sense. She backed the blue,  stayed tough on crime, and kept Iowa's economy open.   I look forward to hearing her reaction to the President's remarks and  her thoughts on how Washington could better serve Middle America.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
