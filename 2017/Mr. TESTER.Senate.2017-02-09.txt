 Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Delaware,  and I also want to thank the Senator from Georgia, who has about the  same length speech as I have here--short and sweet.   Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of thousands of Montanans who  have reached out to me in opposition to the nomination of Congressman  Tom Price to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.   Health care in this country is a very complex thing. It has many  moving parts. It impacts patients, doctors, nurses, hospitals,  families, and rural communities in Montana and across this country.   Recently, I traveled across Montana, speaking with folks from most of  the 60 hospitals that we have in Montana. There is no doubt our health  care system has some problems. Costs are rising, and families are being  priced out of health care. There is no doubt about it--not all but  some. But these problems to be solved require thoughtful, responsible  solutions. These problems require folks to put politics aside and work  together for the health of our country and for rural America and for  our next generation.   Over the years and throughout this confirmation process, Congressman  Price has shown that he is not equipped for this vital and formidable  job. Health care in this country is too important to turn over to a man  who wants to reverse the progress, cut up the safety net, and rip away  the health care that our seniors have earned.   Everyone in this body knows that we have work to do to fix the  Affordable Care Act, but each and every Senator also knows that the ACA  has expanded coverage for millions of Americans, improved rural  America's ability to recruit and retain health care workers, and moved  us closer to closing the Medicare doughnut hole. We cannot make any of  these improvements if we do what Congressman Price has promised and  repeal the ACA, especially without a single plan to replace it. I would  tell you, if one exists, I would love to hear it, and I would love to  hear it today.   So I want to work to fix the problems with the ACA, not send us back  to a time when folks couldn't afford to get sick or couldn't change  jobs due to preexisting conditions.   Don't take my word for it. Joseph from Missoula wrote to me and said:         I am a practicing cardiologist in Missoula. I am adamantly       opposed to the nominee, Congressman Price. His approach takes       us back to the 1980s, ignores the reality of life for a large       portion of our population, and is inconsistent with our       obligation to care for the least of our brothers.    Joseph knows Montana cannot afford to go back to the old system. But  Congressman Price has indicated that is exactly what he wants to do.   In his confirmation hearing, when Congressman Price was pressed about  President Trump's replacement plan, he played it off with a joke to a  laughing audience.   The health care of the American people is no laughing matter. We need  a serious plan to address rising premiums and deductibles, but  Congressman Price and President Trump have come up empty. In fact,  Congressman Price's plan to repeal the ACA without a replacement is a  serious threat to the health of our country.   But the Congressman's attack on our health care system does not end  with dismantling the ACA. He wants to take a chainsaw to the safety net  that helps our hardworking, low-income families stay afloat.   Last year in Montana, under the leadership of Gov. Steve Bullock, the  Montana Legislature worked across party lines to expand Medicaid to  thousands of Montanans, giving folks coverage for the first time in  their lives. A man in Butte, MT, looked me in the eye, and he told me  that because of Medicaid expansion--listen to this--for the first time  in his life, he was able to go see a doctor, get his diabetes under  control, and ultimately find full-time employment. Because of Medicaid  expansion, this man was finally able to provide for his family.   Congressman Price's proposals will rip that coverage away from that  man and make it more difficult for others to use Medicaid as well. His  plan to block-grant Medicaid will do exactly that, and I have heard  from health care providers from across our great State that this will  cripple rural America.   In Montana, with the expansion of the Affordable Care Act and  Medicaid, it has created hundreds of jobs in the health care industry,  and we can't afford to let those jobs go away. Rural America cannot  afford Congressman Price's reckless plan--or lack of plan--to replace  the ACA.   But Montana's working poor aren't the only ones threatened by  Congressman Price. Our senior citizens often fall into the crosshairs  of Congressman Price's irresponsible battle with the Affordable Care  Act.   President Trump campaigned on protecting Medicare for seniors, and I  am with him on that one.   If Congressman Price had his way, Medicare, as we know it, would  cease to exist. He has supported budgets that would turn Medicare into  a voucher system and cut the program by nearly $500 billion.  Congressman Price's plan moves more of the burden of health costs onto  our seniors.   Under Congressman Price's plan, a senior in Glasgow, MT, who is  struggling with dementia would receive a fixed amount of money and  would be expected to go out, shop for insurance, and buy a private  insurance plan. A couple retired in Whitefish would be forced to spend  less time enjoying their final years together in order to comparison  shop and wrangle with insurance companies--not really how most of us  would envision retirement. A farmer from Fort Benton, who has  [[Page S1010]]  given his blood, sweat, and tears to feed our country would be hanging  up his dirty baseball cap for the last time and will have to worry  about finding extra money in his savings to cover higher premiums and  out-of-pocket costs.   Does that sound like a fair way to treat our seniors? I think not.   America's seniors have earned their Medicare over a lifetime of hard  work, and because most of them live on fixed incomes, they can't afford  to see it privatized. We cannot allow this administration to gamble  with our seniors' future and their health care.   Ann from Stevensville agrees. She wrote to me and said:         Please do not support anybody wanting to privatize       Medicare. No to Tom Price.    But that is not all. Congressman Price's track record of fighting  against affordable health care for all Americans is disturbing.  Throughout his confirmation process, a disturbing pattern has emerged.   Congressman Price has spent his 12 years in Congress pushing  legislation that would make health care less accessible for the poorest  among us and enrich himself by corporate special interests. In 2016,  Congressman Price used an exclusive sale of discounted stock of a  foreign biotech company to line his own pockets. Now he is nominated to  lead the agency that would directly impact this company.   Congressman Price underreported his holdings in this company by as  much as $200,000. Now, I know $200,000 may not seem like a lot to some  folks, but I am going to tell you, to this Montana farmer and to  farmers across this country, we would remember if we had $200,000 or so  invested in a company.   He introduced legislation to lower the tax bills of three  pharmaceutical companies that he personally held investments in. CNN  reported that during his time in the House, Congressman Price invested  in a company and then 1 week later, introduced legislation to delay  regulations that would have hurt that company's bottom-line profits.   Patients, nurses, doctors, and hospital administrators got a raw deal  while Congressman Price and his corporate special interests got richer  and richer.   As an elected official, as a potential Secretary, you are held to a  high ethical standard. Congressman Price failed to reach that standard.   President Trump pledged to drain the swamp. Congressman Price's  record shows that he swam with the alligators for a while.   It is clear to me that Congressman Price's priorities put him at odds  with the fundamental job of HHS Secretary.   Congressman Price's record is not one of expanding access to  affordable care, increasing coverage to rural America, and protecting  the Medicare that our seniors have earned. The legislation that he has  carried in the House enriched himself and the companies he has invested  in.   I think Elaine from Lolo, MT, said it best when she wrote to me and  said this:         I believe we should be expanding health care coverage for       Americans, not making it more difficult to access and afford.        Price wants to scale back Medicare and Medicaid, is out of       touch with the realities of the challenges and needs for       reproductive freedom and safety, and has financial conflicts       of interest that would potentially skew his judgment.        A better choice should be demanded for the person who will       lead Health and Human Services to ensure our country has the       best possible healthcare and service support for the needs       for all humans, not just those in line with Rep. Price's       interests.        I urge you to vote no on Price's appointment. I will be       watching the vote closely. Thank you.    Well, I couldn't have said it better myself, and I would encourage my  colleagues to vote no for Elaine, for Montana seniors, for Montana  families. Well, they are all going to be watching closely.   I would encourage a ``no'' vote on Congressman Price.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Georgia.
