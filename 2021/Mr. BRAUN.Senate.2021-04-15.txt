 Madam President, I rise to honor the 50th anniversary of  the signing of Coach Robert Montgomery Knight at Indiana University,  who set the standard for excellence as a collegiate men's basketball  coach.   Coach Knight had a legendary career as a college head coach for more  than 40 years, 29 of which were at Indiana University. During those 29  years, Coach Knight had 11 Big Ten Conference championship teams, took  24 teams to the NCAA tournament, and earned 8 Big Ten Coach of the Year  Awards. His 1975-1976 team at IU remains the last team to complete an  undefeated season and win every game in the NCAA tournament. They got  close this year.   Maureen, my wife, attended IU, and I can remember what a thrill it  was to watch his teams play. Their drive and will to succeed were  infectious. Coach Knight's success at IU continues to be a source of  pride for the entire State of Indiana. Coach Knight never focused his  coaching on winning a game but on the effort it takes to become a  champion, saying that the will to succeed is important, but the will to  prepare is even more important.   Due to his focus on his players' success on and off the court--this  is amazing--Coach Knight had an astounding 98-percent graduation rate  for all players whom he coached for at least 4 years--more than twice  the average graduation rate for Division 1 schools. On the world stage,  Coach Knight led the U.S. men's national basketball team to a Gold  Medal in the 1979 Pan Am Games and to a Gold Medal in the 1984 Olympic  Games.   Victory is fleeting, but Coach Knight both propelled young men toward  greatness on the court and gave them experiences and lessons that have  shaped their entire lives.   We honor the drive, determination, and character of Coach Knight and  all  [[Page S1976]]  that he did in educating and mentoring hundreds of Indiana University  players over three decades to bring pride to the State of Indiana.   For all the memories, Coach Knight, we give you a heartfelt thank  you.   Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 157,  submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the measure.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to and  that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
