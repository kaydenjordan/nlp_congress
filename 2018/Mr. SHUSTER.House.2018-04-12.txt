 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   On behalf of the Pennsylvania Republican delegation, I rise today to  welcome the newest member of the Pennsylvania delegation, representing  the 18th District, Conor Lamb. As Mike mentioned, he continues the Lamb  family tradition of public service and politics.   Again, as a prosecutor and as a marine, we thank him for his service  to his nation.   I would also like to point out that Conor and I share a unique bond.  Obviously, both of our families have been involved in public service  and politics for a number of years. We both hail from western  Pennsylvania, the Lambs from the South Hills, the Shusters from the Mon  Valley; we share counties in our districts; we were both elected in a  special election; but most importantly--most importantly--we come from  the same side of the aisle: Steelers fans, not Eagles.   Western Pennsylvania is in our blood, and we like to think the  importance of family, understanding the value of hard work, and, of  course, rooting for the black and gold are what we share with our  constituents back home.   Conor, I look forward to working with you, and on behalf of all the  Republicans in the House of Representatives, I welcome you to the House  of Representatives. Welcome, Congressman Lamb.
