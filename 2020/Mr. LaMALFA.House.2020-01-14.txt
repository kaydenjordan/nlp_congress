 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Human  Trafficking Awareness Month.   In my home State of California, human trafficking is a massive and  dangerous industry, with 375 reported cases of trafficking involving  minors in 2018. This must end.   That is why I am a cosponsor of H.R. 836, the Interdiction for the  Protection of Child Victims of Exploitation and Human Trafficking Act,  introduced by my colleague, Mr. McCaul from Texas.   This bill would establish a pilot program to provide training to  Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers on identifying child  victims of trafficking, exploited children, and missing children.   Indeed, the cues are out there, if we can see them. If our law  enforcement is able to identify victims of human trafficking more  quickly, it would lead to a safer environment, and identifying them a  lot sooner would save more of the individuals.   Our most vulnerable populations need our help in order to keep them  safe from this truly heinous and disgusting crime.                            ____________________
