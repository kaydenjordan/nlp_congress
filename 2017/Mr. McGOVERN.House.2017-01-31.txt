 Mr. Speaker, I ask my Republican friends to bring up  H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's appalling and  discriminatory refugee ban on women like Samira Asgari, a scientist  from Iran who was set to begin a project to study tuberculosis at  Harvard Medical School, and was stopped from boarding her flight to the  United States. Let us have a vote, let us have a little democracy, in  the people's House.
