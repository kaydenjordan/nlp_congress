 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 256 to  repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force that sent me  and thousands of other young Americans into war in Iraq.   Even though the mission in Iraq has been over for almost a decade,  this authorization remains on the books. This is not a mistake or an  oversight. It is a dangerous abdication of Congress' responsibility.   The longer this AUMF is on the books, the more opportunity it has to  be abused as a blank check for military action in the Middle East  without the input of the American people.   The longer this AUMF is on the books, the longer we in Congress are  bending our own moral and constitutional duty to debate and to decide  when to send American soldiers into harm's way and to look into the  eyes of servicemen and -women when we do. We cannot run from this  incredible responsibility any longer.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill and  retaking Congress' constitutional role in exercising our war powers.  [[Page H2906]]
