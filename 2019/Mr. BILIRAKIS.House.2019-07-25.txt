 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Tarpon  Springs native and devout University of Florida Gator and inspired  Greek Orthodox theologian, Archbishop Nikitas Lulias, who will be  enthroned this weekend in London as the Greek Orthodox archbishop of  Great Britain under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.   Archbishop Nikitas has had a blessed life, which started with the  retrieval of the Gold Cross in Tarpon Springs for the 1974 celebration  of the Epiphany. His proud parents, my great-aunt and great-uncle, Gus  and Kally Lulias, knew at that moment that Nikitas was destined for  greatness.   Archbishop Nikitas has had an extraordinary ecclesiastical career.  His devotion to orthodoxy and to the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical  Patriarchate make him a worthy choice as the archbishop of Great  Britain.   I wish this son of Tarpon Springs, Florida, and my constituent and my  cousin, a blessed ministry.   Axios, which means worthy.                      Recognizing Public Safety Aircrews     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge a group of  heroes who work tirelessly to keep our country and communities safe.   Public safety aircrews ensure the safety of our domestic airspace,  repeatedly operating in very hazardous conditions. They are also an  essential form of support for first responders during disaster response  and rescue missions.   Today, we honor the dedication and devotion that these public  servants demonstrate and acknowledge those who have made the ultimate  sacrifice.   It is only right that a day is set aside to recognize the thousands  of men and women who have served in this role. To that end, I am  reintroducing a resolution today to recognize July 26 as National  Public Safety Aviation Day.  [[Page H7388]]                                ____________________
