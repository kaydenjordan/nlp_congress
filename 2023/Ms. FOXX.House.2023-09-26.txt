 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Biden Department of Education shares a distinct and  familiar trait with every government agency in Washington right now: It  has a habit of making crackpot decisions.   One such decision made by the Department recently was to block  funding for hunting and archery education under the Elementary and  Secondary Education Act, ESEA.   Nobody at the Department of Education can truly believe Congress  sought to block this funding, yet they refuse to interpret the law  consistent with congressional intent.   The idea that schools should offer valuable educational enrichment  activities like teaching hunting, archery, and culinary skills have  never been a partisan issue.   Mr. Speaker, that same magnitude of support should be on display when  the House passes the bipartisan Protecting Hunting Heritage and  Education Act.   This legislation clarifies that the prohibition on the use of ESEA  funds for certain weapons does not apply to learning in activities like  archery, hunting, other shooting sports, or culinary arts.   It is a simple bill that would safeguard learning opportunities for  millions of American students every year, especially those who live in  rural areas across our country.   Hunting and archery programs teach America's schoolchildren self- esteem, responsibility, and, ultimately, how to use these recreational  tools safely. The National Archery in Schools Program has served over  18 million students since 2002.   Mr. Speaker, there is no logical reason why anyone should oppose this  legislation because there is no logical argument to be made in doing  so.   It is just that simple.   I am proud to support the bipartisan Protecting Hunting Heritage and  Education Act. I look forward to its swift passage in the House.
