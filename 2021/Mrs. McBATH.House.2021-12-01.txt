 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say enough is enough.  Enough is enough.   Enough gun violence in our schools, enough children hiding in fear,  and enough parents trembling in terror as they search for any news of  their own kids.   There were 100 calls made to 9-1-1 in Oxford yesterday. Hundreds of  children were stuck in their classrooms crying out for help. Hundreds  of kids were scared to death that this would be their last day of  school.   We have our young people learning how best to survive a shooter in  between math and science class. Six year olds were asked to figure out  for themselves whether they have a better chance to survive if they  hide in a closet or if they should rush the gunman.   And then, on days like yesterday, days that repeat with the same  frequency as this body's failure to respond, we hear the stories of  teenagers texting their parents from behind a desk saying things like:  Mom, if I don't make it, I love you, and I appreciate everything that  you have done for me. Parents were begging their children to  ``barricade yourselves behind doors, hide in classrooms, and, please,  hold your tears, you cannot make a sound.''   This Chamber has heard much about God since men first stood within  these hallowed Halls. This Chamber has heard much about the God-given  rights our Creator inalienably endowed.   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask you then: What rights has God given our  children?   Do they enjoy the God-given right to exist in their schools without  fear of death or gun violence?   Do American parents have the God-given right to drop their children  off at school and expect to see them come home at night?   Parents from Columbine to Sandy Hook to Parkland have had to bury  their babies. And the children who survived have had to live with the  trauma that only stepping over a friend painted in blood could ever  bring.   Do we, as a nation, have the God-given right to live free from this  epidemic of gun violence, of senseless loss, and of unimaginable pain?   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of you here today to put yourselves in the  shoes of those parents. Put yourselves in the shoes of the mothers and  the fathers who have gasped for air when desperation would not let them  breathe. Put yourself in the shoes of all those who have sunk to their  knees when the agony would not let them stand.   Mr. Speaker, do you have the courage to do that, to feel what it  might be like to bury your own child, to suffer with your God day after  day to make sense of the senseless, unnecessary gun violence?   Mr. Speaker, do you have the courage?   Does this body have the courage to do what is right and to save our  children and to protect our families?   And if not, Mr. Speaker, do you really, truly, have the courage to  look away?                            ____________________
