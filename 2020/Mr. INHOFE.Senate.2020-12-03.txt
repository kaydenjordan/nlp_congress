 Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize Mr. Roy  Lee Lindsey for his 22 years of service at the Oklahoma Pork Council.  Since 1998, he has served as a steadfast advocate for pork producers  and the agriculture industry in Oklahoma and we are grateful for his  years of service.   Over the years, I have had the experience of working directly with  Roy Lee on a number of issues, and I have greatly valued his insight,  partnership, and dedication to ensuring the hardworking pork producers  in the State of Oklahoma have access to the Federal resources they  need. Anyone who has had the pleasure to meet and work with Roy Lee can  attest for his love of the state of Oklahoma and the pork industry. His  unwavering passion and dedication have enabled him to be an  extraordinary ambassador for Oklahoma, both regionally and nationally.   From sharing producers' perspectives on multiple farm bill  reauthorizations to engaging in workforce development initiatives to  educate our future generation of farmers, Roy Lee has always provided a  judicious, thoughtful, and considerate perspective on Federal policy.  His understanding of the challenges of agriculture production and  appreciation for the producers he represents has consistently been  apparent in his advocacy efforts and instrumental in the pork  industry's growth and prosperity in Oklahoma.   I know I join his family and all that know him in thanking him for  his years of service and contributions to Oklahoma and our entire  agriculture community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I  report favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in  the Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save  the expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these  nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of  Senators.
