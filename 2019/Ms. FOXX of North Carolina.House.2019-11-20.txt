 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Scott Sewell for his 4 years of service as president of the Winston- Salem Police Foundation. When he steps down as president in December,  Mr. Sewell will be able to look back on his term and be extremely proud  of the successes he has had.   Mr. Sewell has led the foundation in a manner that truly gives back  to the community. One such example is when, under his leadership, the  foundation donated to the Winston-Salem Police Department the Operation  Sweet Reads truck, which will be used to engage with local children  with ice cream and promote literacy and education.   Scott Sewell has served his community well, and he will continue to  do so even after his term has ended. He is an exemplary member of the  community, and I am proud to call him a friend and to recognize his  service.                            ____________________
