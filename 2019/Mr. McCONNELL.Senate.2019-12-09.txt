 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as the end of the year approaches and  the House Democratic majority continues to pour its time and attention  into impeaching the President, a number of key legislative items remain  outstanding.   For weeks, my Republican colleagues have been pleading with our  Democratic friends in Congress to put aside their impeachment obsession  long enough to complete some basic work for the American people.   We have explained that American families cannot afford for Washington  Democrats to obsess over impeachment and obstruct the things we  absolutely have to do.   So I am pleased that the last several days have brought at least some  initial conversations that sanity and progress may be breaking through.  We are still a long way from the finish line, but this week begins on a  cautiously optimistic note. It appears that Democrats' willingness to  block these basic governing items may be finally giving way.   The National Defense Authorization Act is our annual must-pass  vehicle laying out Congress's plan for addressing military funding and  meeting the needs of our servicemembers. It is a responsibility that  this body has discharged in a bipartisan manner every year, without  fail, for 58 years.   That is why it was so disheartening that Democratic leadership in  both the  [[Page S6898]]  House and the Senate broke with tradition and used this year's NDAA  process to insist on all manner of partisan items, including nongermane  domestic policy changes. This partisan approach left the future of the  Pentagon's most urgent missions in the lurch.   So I am encouraged that bicameral negotiations, with participation  from the White House, reached a conclusion last week. Most of the  partisan demands predictably fell away. The result is not either side's  ideal bill, but it is one that should be able to pass both Chambers  under the circumstances. I hope the bipartisan conference report will  be signed and moved quickly through each Chamber so Congress can  finally fulfill our responsibility to America's Armed Forces for  another year.   Then there is the appropriations process--another fundamental  responsibility which, for the good of the Nation, is historically  approached with a bipartisan willingness to find common ground.   It seemed like that might again be the case when a bicameral,  bipartisan deal was struck by the President and the Speaker of the  House back in July, but then, when negotiations resumed in earnest back  in September, some of our Democratic colleagues realized they weren't  really ready to part with partisan poison pills. They ignored their own  agreement and months of stalemate ensued.   Fortunately, our appropriators are working hard to salvage the  process. Last month, Chairman Shelby and Chairwoman Lowey and our other  colleagues reached a deal on subcommittee allocations. I understand  their hard work continued in earnest over this past weekend, with the  goal of producing bills that both Chambers could consider before the  end of this year.   I am grateful to colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their hard  work. I hope this progress continues, and we can consider  appropriations measures this month.   Now, there is still one more major piece of bipartisan legislation  awaiting action by House Democrats. For months, Speaker Pelosi and  House Democrats have been slow-walking President Trump's landmark trade  agreement with Mexico and Canada. Month after month, House Democrats  kept 176,000 new American jobs in limbo, but, finally, after weeks of a  full-court press from Republicans in the House and the Senate, we are  seeing hopeful signals that Speaker Pelosi's months-long stalling  campaign may at long last be coming to an end. Reports suggest the  Speaker may finally allow the House to vote in the near future. For our  country's sake, I certainly hope so.   So what has been true for months is especially true now that time is  short--it is going to take bipartisan collaboration and hard work for  any of these outstanding legislative priorities to become law.   Even if House Democrats do finally relent and allow these key  priorities to move forward, it is now the eleventh hour, and it will  require consent and cooperation for the Senate to consider legislation  in a timely fashion.   I ask for that collaborative spirit from my colleagues on both sides  in the Senate as we move forward. We Republicans have been ready and  eager for weeks to legislate on these key priorities. I hope these  reports are accurate that leading Democrats may finally--finally--be  willing to let Congress govern, and I hope we can move forward at a  brisk pace and in a bipartisan way.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with  respect to the Halpern nomination, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
