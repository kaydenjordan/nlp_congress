 Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the 40th  anniversary of one of the leading voices in healthcare, the National  Association for Home Care and Hospice. Established on April 2, 1982,  from three separate organizations, for four decades, it has been a  voice for the essential and dedicated organizations that provide  healthcare services to over 12 million patients annually in their own  homes.   NAHC has provided valuable and trusted information that has helped  guide Congress, the administration, Federal agencies, and many other  health policy planners as we support the ability of patients to receive  high quality healthcare at home.   From the beginning, NAHC has recognized that complex health policy  issues require a unified voice. NAHC has brought together providers  representing a wide range of home services including home health,  hospice care, home and community-based services, home infusion therapy,  private duty nursing for pediatric and adult patients, personal care  services, home-based palliative care, and more. These providers are big  and small, freestanding and part of larger institutions, nonprofit and  commercial, rural and urban.   Healthcare continues to shift to care provided in the home--and with  good reason. Providing expanded, holistic care in one's own home when  clinically appropriate can improve the lives of patients while  increasing quality and efficiency.   I pay tribute today to NAHC's decades of work to expand access to  healthcare at home, and I look forward to partnering with NAHC members  and staff for many more years to come.                            ____________________
