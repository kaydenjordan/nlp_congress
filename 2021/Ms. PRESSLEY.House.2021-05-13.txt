 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act, which includes my bill-- and I thank the chairwoman for that--the Ending Debt Collection  Harassment Act.   Like many, my mother took pride in paying her bills and paying them  on time. But after several life-disruptive events--the death of an  immediate family member, a layoff, and a mandatory surgery--there came  a point where she could no longer afford it. No matter how hard she  worked, we owed everyone--the utility company, the landlord, the bank-- and we were frequently harassed by debt collectors.   Our story is the story of millions of families.   Due to poverty wages, a lack of affordable healthcare, the absence of  paid leave, and other policy failures which push working people to the  margins, millions of people in America are forced to take on  significant debt to survive.   This is especially true during times of crisis, and debt collectors  prey on that reality. They are making record profits during a pandemic,  using aggressive tactics to scare and to exploit people.   Consumer complaints of shaming tactics, of intimidation, of  harassment, especially from our elders, continue to rise year after  year. This bill provides the needed protection from mistreatment and  harassment.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the deep trauma  and loss of life perpetuated by systems of oppression here in the  United States and globally.   Many times I have stood at this dais and affirmed that our destinies  are tied. That was clear when protestors took to the streets in the  face of police murders, seeking to build a nation where Black lives  matter.   That was clear when our democracy and our lives were put at risk by  violent white supremacists, who shattered glass and broke doors while  wearing anti-Semitic phrases on their chests, carrying the Confederate  flag, erecting a noose on the west lawn.   That was clear when students protesting to end poverty and oppression  in the streets of Bogota were shot dead.   That was clear when families kneeling during this holy month at the  third holiest site in Islam were met with teargas, rubber bullets, and  hand grenades.   Our destinies are tied. As a Black woman in America, I am no stranger  to police brutality and State-sanctioned violence. We have been  criminalized for the very way we show up in the world.   Last summer, when Black Lives Matter protestors took to the streets  to demand justice, they were met with force. They faced teargas, rubber  bullets, and a militarized police, just as our Palestinian brothers and  sisters are facing in Jerusalem today.   Palestinians are being told the same thing as Black folks in America:  There is no acceptable form of resistance.   We are bearing witness to egregious human rights violations. The  pain, trauma, and terror the Palestinians are facing is not just the  result of this week's escalation, but the consequence of years of  military occupation.   In Sheikh Jarrah, the Israeli Government is violently dispossessing  yet another neighborhood of Palestinian families from homes they have  lived in for decades.   We cannot stand idly and complicitly by and allow the occupation and  oppression of the Palestinian people to continue. We cannot remain  silent when our government sends $3.8 billion of military aid to Israel  that is used to demolish Palestinian homes, imprison Palestinian  children, and displace Palestinian families.   A budget is a reflection of our values. I am committed to ensuring  that our government does not fund state violence in any form anywhere.   Many say that ``conditioning aid'' is not a phrase that I should  utter here,  [[Page H2307]]  but let me be clear: No matter the context, American Government dollars  always come with conditions.   The questions at hand are: Should our taxpayer dollars create  conditions for justice, healing, and repair? Or should those dollars  create conditions for oppression and apartheid?                                time  1845    Now, while I hold due space for the storied history and the unique  lived experiences on the ground globally, there is a through line here.   And whether we are talking about the militarization of our  communities or weapons of war, the question is the same. If our budgets  are a statement of our values, what do we value? Whose lives do we  value? We have seen footage of Israeli and Palestinian children huddled  fearfully while rockets blanket their homeland. No child should live in  fear. No child should grow up in the midst of a conflict that robs them  of a childhood. And Palestinian children do not have the same  protections afforded to them.   Without the U.S. exerting pressure on Israel to deescalate, the  explosive situation in Jerusalem is igniting further violence not just  in the city, but beyond. It is clear there is a grave asymmetry of  power here. Palestinians do not have a sovereign state and the  protections that come with it.   Following forceful violence against the Palestinians simply seeking  to remain in their family homes, militant groups in Gaza have launched  rockets at Israeli cities, resulting in seven deaths, including a  child. In response, the Israeli military has launched severe attacks on  Gaza, killing 83 people, 17 of whom are children. This is devastating.   The destinies of the Israeli and Palestinian people are tied. Our  outrage at the pain, violence, and oppression they face must be clear  and unapologetic. Equal outrage for violence perpetrated against all  people, and moral clarity when state-sanctioned violence is claiming  the lives of innocent mothers, fathers, daughters, and sons.   From Jerusalem to Boston, from Randolph to Gaza, from Colombia to  Yemen, our destinies are tied, and everyone deserves to live from fear  and to know peace.
