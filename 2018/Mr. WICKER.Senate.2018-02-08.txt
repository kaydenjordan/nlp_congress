 Mr. President, the Senator is very kind, and time is not  that pressing. I am actually expecting two or three colleagues, and  perhaps we will engage in a colloquy after that. I do appreciate my  friend's courtesy.                                Climate Change     I thank my friend from Pennsylvania and would observe  that he has exercised excellent leadership on this issue. It is a very  important issue. It is not at the top of the news media's treatment,  but it is an important issue, and it is one that we are close to being  able to resolve in a bipartisan way. I also want to thank my colleague  from Alaska, who has been a champion for this issue.   I would make a couple of points to underscore what my friends have  just said.   We are talking about ballast water in the waters of the United  States. Some of it gets out; they let some ballast water in, and they  have to let some out. It is incidental to operating a boat in the  waters of the United States of America.   We want this water to be clean. We want it to be as environmentally  pure as possible. That is what this bill attempts to do and attempts to  do on a uniform basis, rather than having a patchwork of regulations  from State to State and area to area. It would give us one strict  national standard regarding the incidental discharge of this ballast  water.   The water that gets into our lakes and rivers needs to be safe for  the environment, needs to be safe for fish in our American waters, and  needs to be safe for marine plant life.   What this bill would do is have the EPA involved in writing the  regulations and determining what is safe for American waters. So EPA  would be the scientific part, and the Coast Guard would be a part of  the enforcement. EPA has readily stated that they are not able to be in  the enforcement business in the waters of the United States. So they  are going to help with the science, according to this new proposal, and  the Coast Guard is going to help with the enforcement.   Who is for this? Well, 300 businesses, labor unions, ports, and  terminal operators. They are all in it together, and they all say that  this would work. This is not an example of one side getting up some  numbers on a partisan basis and deciding to try to run over the others.  As a matter of fact, this is such a bipartisan idea that we have over  60 Senators in favor of this proposal.   I just want to assure anyone who has doubts about this legislation  that the EPA is going to sign off on these standards. They are going to  sign off on standards that are safe, but we are really doing this for  jobs and commerce in the United States of America. Imagine you are in  the business--the barge business or the commercial maritime business  anywhere in the United States--and you have to worry about compliance  from State to State. And it might be just a reporting requirement.  Clearly this is a burden on people who want to do the right thing but  simply would like to have one standard nationwide to comply with. That  is what we are trying to do. We are close.    I would simply say to my friend from Alaska, who has done more work  on this really than anybody in my memory, I would observe to the  Senator that I think we are close to being able to do this on a  bipartisan basis and perhaps putting this as an attachment to a must- pass piece of legislation. I think we can do it because we have  demonstrated, through our friend from Pennsylvania and other Democrats  and Republicans, that we have been careful to include everyone and to  be bipartisan about it.   Would my friend agree that we are at a point where this really needs  to be signed into law?    Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alaska for once  again segueing to the larger issue there. Vessel incidental discharge  is a very important part but only a part of the Coast Guard  authorization. The Senator from Alaska makes the very valid point that  we really need to get to a point where we take up the Coast Guard  reauthorization on a regular basis because it is a very vital part of  our national security. The Coast Guard is actually one of those  domestic discretionary programs that provide us  [[Page S804]]  with a great deal of national security. Our Coast Guard currently  operates ships in its high-endurance cutter fleet that are more than 45  years old. We need some reforms in the Coast Guard. The Senate and the  House need to pay attention to the reauthorization on a very regular  basis. So the larger issue is absolutely well-taken on the part of the  Senator from Alaska.   I would once again say that my friend the Senator from Alaska has  exercised excellent leadership. He has been relentless on the Coast  Guard reauthorization and particularly the vessel incidental discharge,  and he and others who have fought so hard really deserve some results  because there are no substantive objections that can be raised at this  point.
