 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, House Democrats are delivering for the  people, and let me explain to you how they are doing so.   Under President Biden's leadership, our economy is growing at nearly  the fastest rate in over 40 years. The child tax credit is cutting  taxes for hardworking middle-class families across the country. And by  putting more of working people's own money back into their pockets, it  is generating $20 billion in spending in local economies, supporting  local businesses and jobs.   Now, Madam Speaker, we are hard at work to deliver even more for  working families through the Build Back Better plan and the bipartisan  infrastructure bill.   But while House Democrats are delivering for the people,  unfortunately, some on the other side of the aisle are promoting  misinformation about the coronavirus and opposing overwhelmingly  popular vaccine mandates that will save lives and keep our schools  open. Some of them, Madam Speaker, have even spread false narratives  about the attack on our Capitol and on this Chamber nearly 9 months  ago.   As The New York Times reported earlier this month: ``A growing number  of Republicans and their media allies have downplayed the riot. Some  have begun to treat it as a heroic act.''   Madam Speaker, this dangerous rhetoric from Republicans continues as  Senate Leader Mitch McConnell now threatens the full faith and credit  of the United States, and Senate Republicans refuse to do their job to  ensure that America can pay its bills on time.   Let's be clear, Madam Speaker, raising or suspending the debt limit  does not authorize new spending. It is about meeting obligations that  the government has already made, including the bipartisan COVID relief  package passed last year in December and vital payments to Social  Security recipients as well.   In fact, much of the debt was accumulated under President Trump. The  massive tax giveaways for millionaires and billionaires that  Republicans pushed through under President Trump added $1.8 trillion to  the national debt, and a full 97 percent, Madam Speaker, of the total  debt subject to the limit was accumulated before President Biden took  office.   Madam Speaker, it is no surprise that congressional Republicans voted  three times--not once, not twice, but three times--to suspend the debt  limit under President Trump.                                time  1700    Leader McConnell and congressional Republicans know what is at stake.  In 2019, Mitch McConnell himself said that raising the debt ceiling,  and I am going to quote, Madam Speaker, ``ensures our Federal  Government will not approach any kind of short-term debt crisis in the  coming weeks or months. It secures our Nation's full faith and credit  and ensures that Congress will not throw this kind of unnecessary  wrench into the gears of job growth and a thriving economy.''   Not my words, Madam Speaker, Mitch McConnell's words. He said it  himself. This is about supporting American jobs and our economy. This  is about doing our job for the American people.   We urge Leader McConnell: Stop playing games with the full faith and  credit of the United States. Stop playing games with American jobs. Do  your job to ensure that America can pay its bills on time by addressing  the debt limit.   Now, I think it is important for the American people to understand  why we are here standing up for the credit of the United States, and I  can think of no one better to help explain precisely that than my good  friend, the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Cartwright).    Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for  his comments. He couldn't be more right.   He raises a real salient point, which is the hypocrisy of the  minority leader in the United States Senate and the position that he is  taking today in threatening the full faith and credit of the United  States of America juxtaposed against the position that he took a mere  year ago.   But it just so happens that we have several distinguished colleagues  from the State of Pennsylvania who know a thing or two about the debt  ceiling, and that includes our prestigious colleague on the Ways and  Means Committee.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Brendan F. Boyle).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks and  for showing once again the innovative and creative problem-solving that  the good State of Pennsylvania is so well-known for, with respect to  the legislative solution that he has proposed.   I certainly agree with his admonition that it is time for our  political leaders to stop playing politics with respect to the debt  ceiling. I hope our colleagues in the upper Chamber, including the  minority leader, are listening.   I do want to zero in on one particular thing that my colleague from  Pennsylvania referenced, which is the consequences, right? What happens  if, in fact, the United States Government defaults?   I think a lot of folks watching at home are asking themselves that  same question, so I would pose to my other colleague from Pennsylvania  that same question.   What happens, as a practical matter, if we, God forbid, were to  default?    Well, I would just simply say what is so striking about  the consequences that you described, Mr. Cartwright, and that Mr. Boyle  described, in terms of the warning that was given by Secretary Mnuchin  years ago, is that congressional Republicans back then did the right  thing. They heard the same warnings that Representative Boyle  described, and they voted to increase the debt limit. They did it not  once, not twice, but three separate times during President Trump's  administration.   What has changed? That is the question that I wish the minority  leader of the United States Senate would answer.   But I think we know the answer, that this is ultimately politics and  gamesmanship. I would hope that for the good of the country, he and his  colleagues would reach the same conclusion that they reached literally  less than a year ago.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle),  because his experience on the Ways and Means Committee, I think, is  instructive with respect to how we dispose of this particular question  and issue.    Well, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Again, he  couldn't be more right in terms of the hypocrisy of some on this  particular issue and the adherence to, I think, the morally correct and  economically correct position that so many on this side of the aisle  have taken year after year after year. Our hope is that our colleagues  in the upper Chamber will do the same.   Don't you agree, Mr. Cartwright?    Madam Speaker, the gentleman couldn't be more right. And  certainly, the good news, for those that are watching, is that House  Democrats are committed to doing everything that we need to do to  ensure that the full faith and credit of the United States is not  threatened or undermined.   We have a colleague who has joined us who has spent her entire career  ensuring precisely that, and that is the distinguished gentlewoman from  the State of Texas.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee) for her to address this Chamber on this subject.    I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. Those of us who  have had the privilege to work with the gentlewoman from Texas know  that her ability to speak truth to power really is second to none, and  I think her argument is as compelling as it is straightforward. General  welfare. Full faith and credit. Pay your bills.   And so I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in this  Chamber and in the upper Chamber, it is time for you to do your job.  Let's address the debt ceiling and let's get on with the business of  this Congress in promoting and protecting the general welfare of our  wonderful country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
