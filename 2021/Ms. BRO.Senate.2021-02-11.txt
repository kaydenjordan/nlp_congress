 If you rush to heal, if you rush to ``everybody       grab each other and sing `Kumbaya,' '' we've accomplished       nothing, and we will be right back here in a few years.    ``We will be right back here in a few years.'' Those were her words  in 2018, 3 years ago. Her daughter's murderer, he was held to account,  but our Nation did not impose any meaningful accountability on a  President who, at the time, said that there were ``very fine people on  both sides.''   And, now, where are we, 3 years later? I would argue we are not just  back where we were. I would argue things are worse. In 2017, it was  unfathomable to most of us to think that Charlottesville could happen,  just as it was unfathomable to most of us that the Capitol could have  been breached on January 6. Frankly, what unfathomable horrors await us  if we do not stand up now and say: No, this is not America, and we will  not just express condolences and denunciations. We won't just close the  book and try to move on. We will act to make sure this never happens  again.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Representatives Cicilline and Lieu will now come  to show the harm done and the damage done to Congress and our  Democratic process.   Mr. Cicilline.   Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Mr. President, distinguished Senators, you  just heard from my colleague Manager DeGette how the conduct of Donald  Trump dramatically increased the threats to our security and emboldened  violent domestic extremists.   I would like to now turn to the harm that was caused here, inside  these walls, as a result of the conduct on January 6--the harm to us,  to Congress, to those who serve our country, and to the constitutional  processes as the Trump mob tried to stop the election certification  process.   The attack on January 6 is one of the bloodiest intrusions of the  Capitol since the British invaded in the War of 1812 and burned it to  the ground. And you have heard in painstaking detail the President's  mob posed an immediate and serious threat to the continuity and  constitutional succession of the United States Government with the  first, second, and third in line to the Presidency. The Vice President,  the Speaker of the House, and the President pro tempore were all  together and faced a common threat in the same location, and we have  seen the first and the second were purposely targeted by these  attackers.   These were not idle threats. The mob, as you recall, chanted:         Hang Mike Pence.    (Text of video presentation.)         (People chanting: ``Hang Mike Pence.'')    The charging documents show that the rioters said they would have  killed Vice President Pence and Speaker Pelosi had they found them.   Dawn Bancroft and Diana Santos-Smith, two of the rioters charged in  the attack, were caught on tape discussing the brutal violence that  they hoped to inflict on Speaker Pelosi had she not been rushed out to  safety. They said:         We broke into the Capitol. . . . We got inside, we did our       part. We were looking for Nancy to shoot her in the friggin'       brain but we didn't find her.    Senators, simply put, this mob was trying to overthrow our  government, and it came perilously close to reaching the first three  people in line to the Presidency.   It wasn't just the Vice President and the Speaker; rioters were  prepared to attack any Member of Congress they found. Thomas Edward  Caldwell, Donovan Ray Crowl, and Jessica Marie Watkins, three militia  members, were also charged for their role in the attack. They discussed  trapping us inside the underground tunnels.   The indictment quotes social media chatter with Caldwell:         All members are in the tunnels under [the] capitol seal       them in. Turn on gas.        All legislators are down in the Tunnels 3 floors down.        Do like we had to do when I was in the Corps, start tearing       out floors, go from top to bottom.    Never did any of us imagine that we or our colleagues would face  mortal peril by a mob riled up by the President of the United States,  the leader of the free world, but we did, all because Donald Trump  could not accept his election defeat.   Trump chose himself above the people, above our institutions, above  our democracy, above all of you. You know, we have heard Trump espouse  for years now his ``America First'' policy. But his true North Star  isn't America's well-being. It is not ``Country First'' like our dear  departed colleague John McCain. No, his directive is Trump first, no  matter the cost, no matter the threat to our democracy.   But each and every one of us in this room must agree on one thing: We  can never allow the kind of violent attack that occurred on January 6  to ever happen again in this country.   In the immediate aftermath, we heard many disturbing accounts from  [[Page S655]]  many Members of Congress about what they experienced that day. Here are  some of the reactions.   Following the attack, Representative Dusty Johnson expressed concerns  that we had gotten to the point where so many of us had sown the seeds  of anger and division.
