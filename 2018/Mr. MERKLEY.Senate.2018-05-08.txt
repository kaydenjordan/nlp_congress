 Mr. President, we have all heard the sad news. While we  were back in our districts last week, our Assistant Parliamentarian,  Michael Phillip Beaver, passed away unexpectedly at the very young age  of 39. Family and friends gathered this morning to celebrate his life.   Born in Mount Pleasant, he was the son of Linda Susan Beaver and  William R. Beaver. He was a graduate of Saint Vincent College, where he  studied political science with a minor in graphic design, and he earned  his juris doctorate from the Ohio State University Moritz College of  Law. He was a member of the Ohio and the California State Bar  Associations.   Most recently, he served here in this Chamber as the Assistant  Parliamentarian. Prior to that, he served as the deputy legislative  counsel for the State of California. Aside from being a brilliant  attorney, Michael was passionate about hockey and music. He was a  talented cook, an avid gardener, and a gifted artist.   He was a loving husband to his wife, Gilda, and was a caring, fun,  and patient father to his two young boys, Bradley Dastan Beaver, age 3,  and Connor Milad Beaver, age 2.   It is hard to believe that an unexpected medical condition could end  his life so soon at the age of 39. He was contributing so much to the  United States and so much to his family. We will greatly miss him here  as I know he will be missed by a very wide expanse of family and  friends and community.  [[Page S2536]]    Mr. President, I come to the floor to address one aspect of our ``we  the people'' Nation. In writing the Constitution, our forefathers put  those words, ``We the people,'' in supersized font, so even if you are  far away and you can't read the fine print, you know the mission  statement of our Constitution. It was all about, as President Lincoln  summarized, a ``government of the people, by the people, [and] for the  people,'' always intended to be the opposite of governments by and for  the powerful.   Yet what have we seen in 2017? Much of the year was spent on a  healthcare bill designed to destroy healthcare for some 22 to 30  million Americans. That is not government by the people or for the  people; that is government by and for the powerful.   We saw a tax bill that borrowed $1.5 trillion from the people of the  United States--which our children will have to repay--and gave it to  the wealthiest Americans. That is not government by and for the people;  that is government by and for the powerful.   We saw the theft of a Supreme Court seat for the first time in our  history--a Supreme Court seat sent when it was vacated by the death of  Antonin Scalia from one Presidency to the next, more than a year in the  future in order to sustain a 5-to-4 Court decision called Citizens  United, which allows a powerful America to spend unlimited sums,  contaminating our political system with hundreds of millions of  dollars, corrupting this Nation. That is not government of, by, and for  the people; that is government of, by, and for the powerful.   Now we see the ongoing effort to pack the courts. Although I have  heard complaints from some of my Republican colleagues about the slow  pace of nominees, we see that the pace is very fast compared to the  pace that existed for President Obama. For the first 14 circuit court  nominations, they waited under President Obama an average of 251 days,  but under President Trump, in less than half the time at 125 days--a  breakneck pace--we have seen more nominees confirmed. If we compare  from the start of the Presidency to this far into the Presidency under  President Obama, we had a total of 21 nominees--9 circuit court  nominees, 11 district court nominees, and 1 Supreme Court nominee,  totaling 21. We see that under President Trump there are confirmations  for 15 circuit court nominees, 17 district court nominees, and the  filling of a Supreme Court seat, a stolen seat. There are 33--12 more-- and more than 50 percent faster. So the argument that anything is being  slow-walked is completely false.   We see all kinds of efforts, though, to rush nominees through without  proper consideration. Last year, we had cloture votes on four circuit  court nominees in a single week. We had cloture filled on three  nominees within hours of being reported out of committee--and not  reported out of committee unanimously but with divided votes. We know  that when something comes out of the committee, there needs to be time  for the rest of the body to be able to exercise their efforts to  understand the background of that nominee. Often new information is  turned up. For example, with Brett Talley--nominated for the district  court--after he came out of committee, then it became known that he had  written controversial commentaries defending the KKK, and he had  belittled the Sandy Hook tragedy where little children were  slaughtered. We found that out after he came out of committee. Yet  cloture is being filed right after nominations come out of committee.  We even had an individual who was rated ``not qualified'' by the  American Bar Association. That, my colleagues, is rare.   The tradition of bipartisanship and cooperation involving the blue  slip goes back a long way--since about 1917, a little more than a  century. Senator Thomas Hardwick objected to President Wilson's  district court nominee. He wrote on a blue slip of paper, saying: ``I  object to this appointment--the same is personally offensive and  objectionable to me, and I can not consent to the confirmation of the  nominee.'' Thus began the blue-slip tradition of courtesy and respect  for the viewpoint of Senators from a variety of States.   Under President Obama the blue slips were honored, whether they came  from a Democrat or from a Republican. In fact, 18 of President Obama's  nominees were blocked by Republican blue slips because they were  honored by the Democrats.   In 2009, we had a letter from my Republican colleagues, and it said  about the practice of observing senatorial courtesy that ``we, as a  Conference, expect it to be observed, even-handedly and regardless of  party affiliation.'' Isn't the sentiment expressed in 2009 appropriate  for 2018?   Let me state that in the history of these 100 years, not a single  nominee has been approved over the objection of two Senators from the  relevant State. The former Republican chairman, Senator Hatch, said:         Weakening or eliminating the blue slip process would sweep       aside the last remaining check on the President's judicial       appointment power. Anyone serious about the Senate's       constitutional ``advice and consent'' role knows how       disastrous such a move would be.    I would like to know how many folks in this Chamber are still serious  about the Senate's constitutional advice and consent role.   Chairman Grassley said in 2015:         This tradition is designed to encourage outstanding       nominees and consensus. . . . I appreciate the value of the       blue-slip process and also intend to honor it.    He did honor it while President Obama was in office, but now,  apparently, the world is a different place. Look what is happening on  the Senate floor this week. We have a nominee, Michael Brennan, whose  views on women's rights, civil rights, education, criminal justice,  sexual discrimination, and judicial precedent are out of the  mainstream. His nomination has moved forward despite the opposition and  over the objections of a home State Senator. This is a seat, by the  way, that is open because the blue-slip process was honored. The  objection through a blue slip was honored under President Obama.   There are more extreme nominees coming through. So if we think back  to that point made by Senator Grassley that ``the tradition is designed  to encourage outstanding nominees and consensus,'' we are seeing that  the decision not to honor it is doing the reverse.   There is Kurt Engelhardt, a nominee for the Fifth Circuit. His record  on the district court is deeply troubling, particularly when it comes  to cases regarding sexual harassment, discrimination, civil rights,  discriminating against women in the workforce who choose to have  children--a right that should be open to every American woman without  fear of losing one's job. Yet, last night, this body voted for cloture  and is sending his nomination to a final vote.   We have Joel Carson, nominee for the Tenth Circuit, who has spent  most of his career deeply embedded in advocating for fossil fuel  interests. That is a huge conflict of interest for being able to weigh  in as a judge on any issue regarding energy.   Then we have the case in Oregon. The chairman of the Judiciary  Committee has scheduled a hearing for Mr. Ryan Bounds tomorrow, despite  the fact that Senator Wyden and I have not returned our blue slips.  Should this nomination come forward to this floor and be confirmed,  this will be the first time in the history of the blue slips that the  combined objections of both home State Senators have been ignored.   One might ask: Why is it that Senator Wyden and I feel so strongly  about this particular nominee? Well, first, the White House didn't  consult with us. They brought him in for an interview and decided they  were going to nominate him without consulting the home State Senators.  Any Member of this body who wants to stand up for consultation would  stand against this nomination. Oh, the White House says that they  consulted. They have a very strange definition of consultation. I think  they mean it to say that they informed us about their decision. We  asked the White House to stand aside until our committee back in Oregon  had completed its work, but they chose not to. That is not  consultation.   There are the inflammatory writings of this individual regarding the  rights of workers, people of color, and the LGBTQ community. The  Alliance for Justice said in their report on this nominee, Mr. Ryan  Bounds, that his ``writings reveal strong biases that call into  question his ability to fairly apply the law and maintain confidence in  the  [[Page S2537]]  justice system's ability to dispense even-handed justice to all.''   Shouldn't that be the heart of the nomination process, that we make  sure we are sending forward individuals who add to the integrity of our  judicial system, not individuals who take away from it?   During his interviews with our committee out in Oregon--this  committee continued its work, even though the President nominated him  without waiting for the committee to finish its work. The committee  asked him if he had controversial writings or events in his life that  he needed to disclose, and he said that he did not. He did not disclose  them. This is not an ancient failure of integrity; this is an  immediate, recent past failure of transparency and integrity.   The letter we received from the chair of Oregon's Federal Judicial  Selection Advisory Committee states:         I am writing to you as Chair of the [Oregon] Federal       Judicial Selection Advisory Committee. I have reviewed a       recent piece in the Wall Street Journal titled ``Give Amnesty       for College Writings.'' The piece concerns Ryan Bounds, a       candidate for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals vacancy, and       specifically states that our committee recommended him. The       piece notes Mr. Bounds' writings, but fails to point out Mr.       Bounds never disclosed those writings to the committee at any       point in the interview process. Since that time, I have heard       from four members of the judicial selection committee       specifically with regard to this omission. I can say with       confidence that those four committee members as well as       myself would not have ranked Mr. Bounds as we did had we       known about these deeply troubling writings.        Mr. Bounds' writings themselves are objectionable not only       for the views they express, but for the intemperate and       demeaning tone that he uses to express his opinion. Equally,       if not more disturbing, Mr. Bounds failed to disclose       these writings when specifically asked by the committee       about his views on equity and diversity. Although he felt       free to volunteer details about his life going back to       childhood, he misled the committee in response to this       important inquiry. For this reason, five of the seven       committee members no longer recommend Mr. Bounds.    That is what we heard from the Oregon committee.   We have a responsibility to the institutions of governance of the  United States of America, with the fundamental principle embedded in  those three words: ``We the People''--government of, by, and for the  people. We have seen a series of significant bills where it is the  exact opposite of this: bills designed to destroy healthcare for  millions of Americans, bills that put us deep in debt in order to  deliver the proceeds to the richest Americans. It is perhaps the  biggest bank heist in the history of the world.   Now we see an effort to sully the integrity, to damage the legitimacy  of our courts. That is unacceptable, and we need to rethink our course  and honor our responsibility to strengthen, not undermine, the  beautiful architecture of our ``we the people'' Nation.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I regret that, due to unforeseeable  flight delays, I was unable to make it back here to Washington in time  for the cloture vote on Kurt Engelhardt's nomination for the Fifth  Circuit Court of Appeals. Had I been present, I would have voted  against cloture.   His record on the district court is deeply troubling, particularly  those concerning sexual harassment, religious discrimination, civil  rights, and discriminating against women who choose to have children in  the workforce--a right that should be open to every American woman  without fear of losing one's job. In Mr. Engelhardt's court, ogling,  groping, making suggestive comments, and talking about a woman's  appearance do not constitute sexual harassment or a hostile work  environment. In Mr. Engelhardt's court, a woman who is ordered by her  doctor to be on bedrest can be fired 2 weeks after giving birth because  ``the fact that Plaintiff's absences were caused by pregnancy does not  dispense with the general requirement that employees must show up for  work.''   Then there is Judge Engelhardt's extremely disturbing ruling  overturning the convictions of five former New Orleans police officers  in the Danziger Bridge case. This was a case that was described at the  time as ``the most significant police misconduct prosecution since  Rodney King,'' but Mr. Engelhardt overturned the convictions because  three of the prosecutors wrote anonymous blog posts, even though the  judge acknowledged that there was no evidence that any of the jurors  had ever read these posts. Mr. Engelhardt's ruling in the Danziger  Bridge case is exactly the kind of action that makes so many Americans  distrust our criminal justice system and amplifies the racial  inequalities that exist in it.   Too many Americans have been denied justice in Mr. Engelhardt's court  for the Members of the U.S. Senate to reward and elevate him to a  position of higher authority. Therefore, I would like it to be known on  the record that I oppose Judge Engelhardt's nomination to serve on the  Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and would have voted in the negative had  I been able to be here.                            ____________________
