 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to  reconsider with respect to the Rikelman nomination be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nominations en bloc:  Calendar No. 46 through No. 52, No. 82 through No. 107, No. 110 through  No. 113, No. 130 through No. 139, No. 180 through No. 205, No. 224  through No. 234, No. 236 through No. 246; that the nominations be  confirmed en bloc; that the motions to reconsider to be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no  further motions be in order to any of the nominations; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, this is now the sixth time that I have  been on this floor asking for unanimous consent so that the U.S. Senate  can do its job to ratify, to approve the nominations of flag officers'  promotions at the Department of Defense.   That is something that we have done as a matter of course in the U.S.  Senate for the last 230 years. No Senator in the history of the United  States has ever prevented the Senate from proceeding with these  nominations of flag officers.   I certainly don't have to tell the Presiding Officer how important  these promotions are, how critical they are. And observer after  observer after observer has said that it is in the national security  interest of the United States, not surprisingly, for this Senate to  confirm these promotions, to ratify these promotions.   We are compromising our national security when one Senator out of the  whole 100 people decides that they are going to do something that no  Senator has ever done in the history of the United States. No Senator  has ever put a blanket hold on the promotions of flag officers, and  there is a good reason for that, because if people are willing to play  politics with that, they are playing politics with our national  security. If they are willing to play politics with that, they are  playing politics with the expectations of people who have spent an  entire career defending the national security of this country, serving  the public, serving in the Department of Defense, and who now have been  promoted to a position of trust and responsibility.   By the way, this doesn't just affect those people who are getting  that promotion. It also affects the people who are below them who can't  get the promotion that now is no longer vacant because they are stuck  in the job that they are in.   And I am shocked that somebody here would do this and pretend that  this is just common: You know, this is the Senate. This is the way the  Senate functions. This the way the Senate, as my colleague from Alabama  has said, just does its business.   This is not how the Senate ever does its business. It is not how the  Department of Defense does its business. And it, particularly, I think,  should be particularly grieving to the American people because of the  reasons the Senator from Alabama is doing what he is doing.  [[Page S2140]]    Tonight, we are here on basically the 1-year anniversary of the  Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs decision.  If you told me when I was in law school that a majority of the Supreme  Court would join the majority opinion by Justice Alito that would say,  if it wasn't a right or a freedom in 1868, it is not a freedom today-- if you told me that was the basis on which they were going to strip a  fundamental freedom from the American people, I would have said that  will never happen; it is never going to happen.   That is what is happening, and that is the result of a 50-year  crusade to overturn a woman's right to choose in the United States of  America. It is the first time since Reconstruction that we have given  up a fundamental right here. It is first time since Reconstruction that  we have been stripped of our fundamental rights and our freedoms have  been diminished, that they have grown smaller in the hands of a 50-year  campaign that was waged to put four people on the Supreme Court--a  majority on the Supreme Court--who subscribe to the best named doctrine  I have ever heard named in American political history or anybody's  political history, and that is the doctrine of originalism, a doctrine  that was dressed up to create a scenario or a legal set of arguments  that somehow there were a group of people in this society with such  mystical powers that they were capable--unlike anybody else in America,  they would be capable of divining the originality intent of the  Founding Fathers, putting aside the fact, tonight, that everybody in  this Chamber who studied the Constitution even for 10 minutes knows  that the Founders had fundamental disagreements among themselves and  that the Constitution itself was a product of these fundamental  differences--not their fundamental consensus but the fundamental  differences. There was consensus on some issues. There was compromise  on other issues.    But I dwell on that for a moment just to say, especially to people  around here--maybe the age of the pages in the Senate--that you  shouldn't give this theory of legal interpretation any great weight  just because they dressed it up and called it something called  originalism or they said somehow they could divine what the Founding  Fathers said.   Fundamentally, what it came down to in the case of the Supreme Court  was that because abortion wasn't a freedom, as they said, in 1868--a  country where women didn't even have the right to vote in the United  States yet--that it was not going to be a freedom today, and they  stripped the American people of this freedom.   And there are people on this floor, people, you know, in the other  party who spent 50 years trying to create a Supreme Court like this,  basically since Ronald Reagan was our President. I think Ronald Reagan  would be shocked by the extreme nature of the opinion that was rendered  by Justice Alito, but who knows.   What we do know is this has been a 50-year campaign that has been  waged. And the second that the Supreme Court did what they have been  shooting for the last 50 years, what they started to say was: Don't  worry about it. It is not a big deal. This is just reverting to States'  rights. This fundamental constitutional right, this fundamental  constitutional freedom, it is just being reverted to the States.   What has happened since then? Twenty States have banned abortion  since that decision was made or restricted access. Nine of those States  have no exceptions for rape or incest, like the State of Alabama, I  think, which has an exception for the life of the mother.   So there is a lot to worry about in this decision. There is a lot to  worry about for our men and women in uniform.   Before Dobbs, women in the military had at least some assurance that  wherever the Pentagon sent them, they would have minimal access to  reproductive care, a protected constitutional right, a protected  freedom. That is no longer the case.   One of the very first calls I got after Dobbs was decided was from a  woman whom I know in Colorado who was an Air Force officer. She was a  pilot. She told me her personal story, and then she said: I don't  understand how they could have possibly made the decision they made  because this is a fundamental readiness issue.   Well, they didn't have to deal with that. They didn't have to deal  with that fundamental issue of readiness. They didn't have to deal with  the fundamental fact of how people every single day would be dealing  with the loss of this right or the loss of this freedom because nothing  in their interpretive doctrine requires them to do that. It only  requires them to ask: Was it a freedom in 1868? Not a freedom today.   And in response to this shocking development--and it is shocking. You  know, if you are the age of the pages who are here, if you are my  daughter's age--my oldest daughter is 23 years old--you are wondering  how it is possible. We were having this conversation the other day. We  were driving by a billboard in Colorado advertising some stuff in  Colorado. Amazing thing that we could be, on the one hand, legalizing  marijuana in this country and on the other hand, banning abortion. If  you told me that when I was a teenager in America, I would have said:  What are you smoking? That is impossible. That is impossible, and that  is where we are.   What the Supreme Court did in this case is fundamentally unpopular  with the American people. The American people are angry that this has  happened. It didn't happen by accident. This is a war that has been  waged on a woman's right to choose. It is a war that has been waged for  that doctrine of originalism.   And a lot of people and a lot of institutions in America are having  to make adjustments in the wake of this shocking development, and the  Pentagon is one of those places.   In the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, the  Pentagon extended two policies that already exists for servicemembers  if a medical procedure is not available near their duty station. One  was the travel allowance. If you are not--if you can't get that knee  operated on close to your duty station, we are going to pay you to  travel. That is what the rules say today.   By the way, that is not a law that Congress passed. That is the DOD  making regulations, which is how this works, to ensure that people  serving our country are able to get the medical care that they need. We  say: You know what, you will have to travel and because you have to  travel to do this, we are going to give you paid leave to do that, to  go get that knee surgery.   And what the DOD said in the wake of the Dobbs decision reversing Roe  v. Wade is that if you are doing that because you made a decision to  seek reproductive healthcare, you made a decision to have an abortion,  we are going to apply the same rules to you that we apply for these  other surgeries. We are not going to treat you differently. We are  going to treat you exactly the same. That is what we are going to do.  And if you need to travel because it is not available, you can do it.   So if you live in a State like Alabama, where my colleague who is  blocking every single appointment or promotion in the DOD, where he  lives--where, if you are a doctor and you perform an abortion, you can  go to jail for 99 years--if you are living in a State like Alabama  where abortion is banned, and there are very limited exceptions, if any  exception, that you can go somewhere else to do it or the DOD will  actually pay for you to go, and the DOD will give you paid leave. That  is true whether you are seeking women's reproductive healthcare or you  are going for knee surgery. But knee surgery isn't banned in 20 States  in this country.   And there was one other thing that the Department of Defense said.  They said: You know what, in the case of a pregnancy, you can tell your  commanding officer, you can tell your command 20 weeks after you  learned of your pregnancy. You don't have to tell people right away  because things might happen in the early stages of pregnancy or you  might make a decision to have an abortion in that time. This was an  attempt by DOD to harmonize the rules at DOD for healthcare with the  changes of the Supreme Court. It would be difficult, in my mind, at  least, to imagine a more modest set of changes to the rules by DOD.    I thought about what could be more modest than saying: OK. If we are  going to pay people who are getting  [[Page S2141]]  knee surgery or pay them paid leave, then we are going to do this for  everybody else--for women who need reproductive healthcare. If we are  going to pay people to travel for these other things, then we are going  to let people travel.   I would think most people who have disagreements about abortion in  this country might say: Well, that is fair. People have the right to be  able to make this decision on their own--or they should have the right  to make this decision on their own--and we shouldn't discriminate  against people just because we might have a disagreement about  abortion.   One thing this set of rules does not do in any shape or form is pay  for an abortion. The Senator from Alabama has almost admitted as much  on this floor. He said it is sort of tantamount to that. It is sort of  this, and Senator Lee from Utah was saying it is sort of, but they know  that it is not. That is not what the rules do. That is a debate that we  are going to need to have here, but that is not what is happening here.  What is happening here is the rules, as I stated.   The Senator from Alabama was so enraged by this, so infuriated by  this, so angered by this, that he has now put a blanket hold on 249  military promotions to unwind those rules, to change those rules, to  force the DOD to retreat and for the DOD to say: OK. From here on out,  here is what we are going to do. We will pay for your travel for every  single operation that you can't get at your duty station except if you  are a woman who is seeking reproductive healthcare. If you are a woman  who is going to have an abortion, we are going to discriminate against  you. We are going to treat you differently than anybody else for every  other purpose.   And we are going to give you paid leave because we understand that it  is inconvenient to have to go somewhere else from your duty station. By  the way, you haven't asked to be at that duty station. We are going to  give you paid leave except if you are going because of reproductive  healthcare, in which case, we are going to discriminate against women  and say, uniquely: You do not get paid leave. And, I guess, you have to  inform your commanding officer--somebody does--that you are pregnant  sooner than the 20 weeks.   That is the world that the Senator from Alabama is trying to pursue  here on this floor by holding every single military promotion, every  flag officer promotion in the United States of America when Putin is  invading Ukraine and China is sailing their shiny new navy all over the  South China Sea. And I know he knows. He can't think it is a good idea.   He has come out here and said: Don't worry about it. There are acting  people who are doing those jobs. Don't worry about it. The generals  don't actually make decisions. It is the enlisted people who are doing  all the work. Don't worry about it. Somehow this is going to help with  the recruiting quagmire that he has pointed out.   I don't think, by the way, it is going to help with the recruiting  quagmire that he has talked about out here; that women who are thinking  about joining the military are going to know that their life, their  lives, are in the hands of politicians in Washington, DC. Their very  lives are in their hands. Their destiny is in their hands. And DOD can  send them to a place where abortion is banned and doctors go to jail  for 99 years if they perform an abortion or they might be lucky enough  to serve in a place like Colorado where we codified Roe v. Wade anyway.  We are the first State in America to do it.   And I don't have to tell the Presiding Officer, who, by the way,  served and has been on the Armed Services Committee, how important  these jobs are we are talking about: the next Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q. Brown; the Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Chief of the National Security Agency; the  next military representative to NATO. You think that is an important  job?   Soon this hold is going to include the next Commandant of the Marine  Corps, the Army Chief of Staff, the Chief of Naval Operations, putting  our national security at risk.   Mr. President, I asked unanimous consent at the outset of tonight's  proceedings if we could have unanimous consent on a number of these  promotions.

Former Defense Secretary Gates, who, by the way, for  those who don't know, was appointed by George W. Bush, said that the  Senator from Alabama has made the military ``a pawn.'' That is a guy  who served in a Republican administration. We have had Secretaries of  Defense from both sides of the aisle who said the Senator from Alabama  is hurting our national defense, hurting our national security, is  playing politics with our Department of Defense.   What is his justification again? Well, it is no different than what I  already said. He uses different words. He says that the DOD has made-- the Department of Defense--by making these rules, into an abortion  travel agency. Those are his words: abortion travel agency. Well, that  is not true.   We have already talked about the travel allowance and the absence  without leave and more time to notify. I am sure there are some  people--a handful of people in America--who couldn't see the wisdom in  that, who would disagree with that. But I will bet you that the vast  majority of people in this country, including people who have a  different view on a woman's right to choose than I have, would say that  women ought to  [[Page S2143]]  have the right, in the Department of Defense, to get travel paid for  just like anybody else and to get paid leave and to be able to have 20  weeks to be able to tell their commanding officer that they are  pregnant.   This is an effort to punish women who are seeking reproductive  healthcare and forcing them, for reasons I don't understand, to tell  their commanding officer the minute that they are pregnant.   This is reminiscent to me of the States after Dobbs--after the Court  overturned Roe v. Wade--that started to look at bills to try to prevent  women from traveling from States that had banned abortion to States  that had made abortion legal.   It is kind of a shocking place for us to be in to hear people--a  party--embrace freedom and talk about freedom all the time and still  live in a place where we are talking about trying to ban Americans from  traveling from one State to another or not allowing the Department of  Defense to pay money or to use paid leave for women's reproductive  healthcare the way they do for anything else.   I mean, I do believe strongly--I believe strongly in a woman's right  to choose, and I believe it should be a decision that is made between a  woman and her doctor. Most Americans agree with that. I know that there  is profound moral disagreement on this question, and I respect that.  But I think it is fair to say that the Senator from Alabama's position  on this to not allow paid leave, to not allow paid travel, to not allow  women to get 20 weeks before they have to tell their commanding  officers that they are pregnant--the vast majority of Americans, I  think, would agree that those rules are appropriate.   By the way, one of the other reasons the Senator from Alabama has  objected to this is that he has said that if the Senate wanted those  rules, it should have passed those rules. Well, the Senate doesn't  write the rules like that. We didn't pass the rules that exist today  that pay for people to be able to go get surgery or get paid leave in  the military. Those are rules that the Department of Defense makes,  having been delegated that authority by the Congress.   But, man, he is in a totally different place on this. He says that he  is going to keep this hold until the Pentagon follows the law or  Congress changes the law; that is the way we do it here in the Senate.  That is a reference to what I was just talking about in terms of the  rules.   By the way, this is not how we do this in the Senate. It is just not.  It is not. And the evidence is that no one in the history of this body  has ever done this--ever in the history of the country. Nobody has done  this. Nobody has done it. And I would say that not only has nobody done  it, nobody has done it and taken a political position that is so far  outside the mainstream of conventional American politics.   I think the American people should be asking their Senators where  they stand on this. There are only 100 people here. It is not hard to  find our telephone numbers or our addresses. They should be asking  them: Do you agree that we should be holding up every single flag  officer's promotion because one Senator thinks that we shouldn't have  paid leave or paid travel for women who need reproductive healthcare?   He says he is going to relent only when that is true. He is only  going to relent when there is a DOD policy that pays for every other  surgery that somebody could get, that has paid family leave for any  other procedure that you could get, but bans that for abortion. That is  an extreme position. That is an extreme position.   It is an extreme position to say that we are going to not allow  people to have 20 weeks to make this decision.   There are no exceptions in Alabama for rape or incest. That may be  part of the reason why he has the perspective he does. It is a State  where, if you are a doctor and you perform an abortion, you could go to  jail for 99 years. But that is not what the majority of Americans  believe on this issue. It is not. It is not. I don't even think the  majority of Alabamians believe that. But the majority of Americans  certainly don't. The majority of Americans believe in a woman's right  to choose. The majority of Americans believe that these questions are  best decided between a woman and her doctor or her family and her faith  if she has one.   That is what my State believes. We were the first State that  decriminalized abortion before Roe was even decided and were the first  State to codify a woman's right to choose. That is, I think, what  freedom actually looks like.   Our State, Colorado, is the first State to codify Roe since the  Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. And other folks were saying: You  don't need to worry about the States. Now one of the largest States in  America--a large State where something like 65 percent of the people  support a woman's right to choose--the Governor of that State, the  State of Florida, has banned abortion after 6 weeks. He signed that law  at 11 at night when nobody would be around to see the way he was  trampling on the freedom of his constituents.   Most Americans, if they knew this debate was happening, would be  shocked, I think, to hear that what we are trying to do here is prevent  women from getting paid leave; that we are trying to prevent women from  having paid travel; that we are trying to prevent women from having 20  weeks to tell their commanding officer. That is what the Senator from  Alabama is saying, that until that happens--until we are preventing  women from those things, until we are discriminating against women who  are seeking reproductive healthcare--he is going to continue to hold  all these nominations. Forever?   I don't know how anybody can take that position and say they stand  for freedom, but that is the position the Senator from Alabama has  taken. I hope he will reconsider what he is doing because of the damage  it is causing our national security at a moment when, as I said, Putin  has invaded Ukraine and China is pressing, you know, its advantages in  various places around the world.   We need the Senator to lift these holds, and I am going to keep  coming to the floor until he does.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session to be in a period of morning business  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I have two requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES    The Committee on Armed Services is authorized to meet in closed  session during the session of the Senate on Tuesday, June 20, 2023, at  5 p.m.                       SUBCOMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC FORCES    The Subcommittee on Strategic Forces of the Committee on Armed  Services is authorized to meet in closed session during the session of  the Senate on Tuesday, June 20, 2023, at 5:30 p.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk,  and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.,  on Wednesday, June 21; that following the prayer and pledge, the  Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed  expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that following the  conclusion of morning business, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate  resume consideration of the veto message with respect to S. J. Res. 11  and that the Senate vote on passage of the joint resolution, the  objection of the President to the contrary notwithstanding, at 11:30  a.m.; further, that following the disposition of the veto message, the  Senate proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the  Merle nomination, and following the cloture vote on the Merle  nomination, the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  caucus meetings; further, that at 2:15 p.m., if cloture has been  invoked, all time be considered expired and the Senate vote on the  confirmation of the Merle nomination; finally, that if any nominations  are confirmed during Wednesday's session, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:43 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, June 21, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
