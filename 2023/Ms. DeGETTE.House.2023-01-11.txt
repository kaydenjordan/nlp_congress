 Madam Speaker, if my Republican colleagues want to  condemn the growing level of political violence in this country, let's  do it together.   That is not what this resolution does. What it does is it goes to  great lengths to condemn attacks against anti-choice groups, and it  says nothing about the growing threat of violence targeting women's  health clinics across the United States.   It doesn't condemn the numerous bullets that have been fired at  healthcare clinics throughout the country.   It doesn't condemn the bricks that have crashed through windows at  providers' offices or the assaults, kidnappings, and even the murders  of doctors and healthcare personnel.    It doesn't condemn the arsons, bombings, death threats, or any one of  the more than 7,000 acts of violence that have been reported against  these facilities.   By ignoring these acts of violence, Republicans are sending a very  dangerous message that will only embolden the extremists behind them.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a resolution that  Congresswomen Lee and Pressley and I have introduced to condemn all  acts of political violence, regardless of their target or intent, and I  urge my colleagues to support it instead.        Whereas workplace violence ranges from threats and verbal       abuse to physical assaults and homicide;        Whereas, for decades, health care personnel for women and       people who access reproductive health care services have been       subjected to intimidation, threats, and violence;        Whereas between 1977 and 2015--        (1) nearly 7,000 violent acts were reported against       providers at health centers for women, including bombings,       arsons, death threats, kidnappings, and assaults; and        (2) more than 190,000 acts of disruption, including bomb       threats and harassing calls, were reported;        Whereas, between 1993 and 2015, there were 11 murders,       numerous attempted murders, 42 bombings, and 186 arsons       targeted at individuals and facilities associated with care       provided at health centers for women;        Whereas between 1993 and 2015, the 11 victims of anti-      choice violence include Dr. David Gunn of Pensacola, Florida,       in 1993; Dr. John Bayard Britton and a volunteer, James       Barrett, both of Pensacola, Florida, in 1994; clinic       receptionists Shannon Lowney and Leanne Nichols, both of       Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1994; Dr. Barnett Slepian of       Buffalo, New York, in 1998; clinic securitv guard Robert       Sanderson of Birmingham, Alabama, in 1998; Dr. George Tiller       of Wichita, Kansas, in 2009; and police officer Garrett       Swasey, Ke'Arre Stewart, and Jennifer Markovsky, all of whom       were lost during a violent attack at a Planned Parenthood       clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 2015;        Whereas, in 2016, two defendants vandalized a Baltimore,       Maryland, area abortion clinic on two separate occasions,       with one defendant pleading guilty and the other convicted at       trial of Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act       violations;        Whereas, in 2017, a defendant sent several threatening       emails to abortion clinics located in Chicago, Illinois, and       Hammond, Indiana, and the defendant pled guilty to FACE Act       and other Federal offenses;        Whereas, in 2018, a defendant directed a threatening social       media post to Planned Parenthood facilities and staff and       defendant pled guilty to Federal offenses, including a FACE       Act charge;        Whereas, in 2019, a defendant was indicted for FACE Act       violations and other Federal offenses related to a 2015       shooting at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado       Springs, Colorado, where he shot at several civilians and       police officers, killing two civilians and one officer, while       injuring several others;        Whereas, in 2020, a defendant pled guiltv to FACE Act       related offenses in connection with a bomb threat call the       defendant made to a Jacksonville, Florida, abortion clinic;        Whereas, in 2021, a defendant pled guilty to a FACE Act       violation and other State felony offenses for throwing a       Molotov cocktail at a Fort Myers, Florida, abortion clinic;        Whereas, in 2022, a defendant was indicted for FACE Act       violations after he assaulted a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,       area Planned Parenthood clinic escort twice on the same date,       with one assault resulting in bodily injury; and        Whereas extreme rhetoric continues to fuel a hate-filled       climate that is dangerous for individuals who provide or       access comprehensive health care services: Now, therefore, be       it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns all acts of political violence;        (2) condemns attacks on health care facilities, health care       personnel, and patients;        (3) affirms that all people have the freedom to access       reproductive health care services and medical advice without       fear of violence, intimidation, or harassment; and        (4) calls upon the Biden administration to use all       appropriate authorities to uphold public safety, to protect       health care facilities, and safeguard health care personnel       and patients.                                time  1330     Madam Speaker, the resolved part of our resolution says  this, and I think all of my colleagues should be able to join this.   Resolved, that the U.S. House of Representatives condemns all acts of  political violence; 2, condemns attacks on healthcare facilities,  healthcare personnel, and patients; and 3, affirms that all people have  the freedom to access reproductive healthcare services  [[Page H177]]  and medical advice without fear of violence, intimidation, or  harassment.   Isn't that what this is all about in this country, fear from  violence? No violence, everybody gets the healthcare services they want  and they deserve without fear of being killed.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  26 and urge my colleagues to instead support my motion to recommit to  take up and pass Representative Judy Chu's Women's Health Protection  Act that will restore the protections that we had under Roe v. Wade.   If there is one thing this last election showed us it is that the  American people believe strongly that every woman in this country  should have the ability to make her own healthcare decisions, including  abortion.   Sadly, however, if there is one thing this past week has shown us, it  is that the House Republicans just don't care at all about that.   They don't care that 61 percent of the American people strongly  support a woman's access to abortion care.   They don't care that just 2 months ago a record number of Americans  showed up at polling locations across the country to overwhelmingly  reject the GOP's plan to criminalize abortion care.   They don't care that in every State where abortion restrictions were  on the ballot they were rejected overwhelmingly--in places like Kansas.   They don't care that Americans think that people, not politicians,  should be making these decisions.   Apparently, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think they  know how abortion decisions should be made, not a woman and her doctor.   So instead of taking heed of the will of the American people, my  Republican colleagues are intending to do just the opposite.   The legislation before us today is part of a concerted effort to  fast-track this extreme agenda of anti-choice legislation. It creates  new criminal penalties for healthcare providers that fail to provide  specific standards of care--that the politicians on the other side of  the aisle will enact--after an attempted abortion.   It doesn't really protect newborn children in any way. Why?   Because if a child is born it is already illegal to kill it--as it  should be. Unlike what the majority leader said, it is already illegal  in every single State in this country. It is illegal to kill people in  this country.   Just in case anybody was confused about this, as Chairman Nadler  said, in 2002 Congress passed the Born-Alive  [[Page H187]]  Infants Protection Act, and all of us, including me, the co-chair of  the Pro-Choice Caucus voted for it because clearly if the baby is born,  we shouldn't kill it. Duh.    So what does this bill do? What it does, as I said, it creates  criminal penalties for healthcare providers that don't do what the  Republicans think they should do, and it creates new, complicated  standards that will make it harder for healthcare professionals to do  their jobs.    What it does is it hopes to deter doctors from providing  abortion care in the first place, which is exactly what we saw after  the Dobbs decision. This is not what the American people signed up for.   I strongly urge my colleagues to reject these extreme measures and  instead support my motion to recommit to take up and pass the Women's  Health Protection Act to ensure that everybody in this country, no  matter where they live, has the access to the reproductive care they  need.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to add the text of this  amendment into the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion  to recommit.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
