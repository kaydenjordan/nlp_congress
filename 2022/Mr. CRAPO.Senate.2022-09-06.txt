 Mr. President, as Americans who value the freedoms  protected by our country's servicemembers, we must meet our  responsibility to those who sacrificed so much for our country. To do  this, we must continue to seek answers for families of America's  prisoners of war, POWs, and missing in action, MIA.   In honor of the observation of National POW/MIA Recognition Day this  September 16, 2022, I join in raising awareness about the more than  81,500 Americans the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, DPAA, reports  remain missing from past conflicts. Thank you to the members of the  POW*MIA Awareness Rally Corp. of Pocatello, ID, and others across our  country for keeping a spotlight on the need to bring all missing  American servicemembers home.   Roughly 360 servicemembers from Idaho are among those who remain  missing. The vast majority, 328, of Idaho's missing servicemembers were  lost during their service in World War II, while 23 Idahoans were lost  serving in the Korean War, and one Idahoan was lost during service in  the Cold War.   The remaining eight Idahoans went missing while serving in the  Vietnam war. Some years ago, then-POW*MIA Awareness Corp. director  Hiedi Young shared biographies she prepared of those eight Idahoans at  a rally I attended. The biographies are a thoughtful reminder of the  ongoing price of our freedom, and I share them here again today to  highlight the ever-growing need to bring them and their fellow  servicemembers home. It has now been more than 50 years since these  Idahoans were lost in service to our country.         Lieutenant Roderick L. Mayer, United States Navy of       Lewiston, has been missing since October 17, 1965, in North       Vietnam. Lt. Mayer was a pilot of a fighter jet that was shot       down. He and his co-pilot ejected from their aircraft. Based       on testimony of his co-pilot, it is believed that he ``died       of severe  [[Page S4434]]       wounds from ejection.'' Status: ``Presumptive Finding of       Death, Body Not Recovered.''        Ensign Hal T. Hollingsworth, United States Navy of Grace,       has been missing since January 16, 1966, in South Vietnam.       Hollingsworth was the co-pilot of an aircraft that while       airborne had mechanical difficulties and crashed at sea.       Status: ``Killed in Action, Body Not Recovered.''        Staff Sargent William B. Hunt, United States Army of       Sandpoint, has been missing since November 4, 1966, in South       Vietnam. Hunt was lifted into battle to help evacuate       wounded. He voluntarily left the aircraft to help reinforce       remaining troops on the ground. The Viet Cong attacked the       position the unit was maintaining and after 2 days of heavy       fighting Hunt was gravely wounded. Status: ``Presumptive       Finding of Death, Body Not Recovered.''        Captain Curtis R. Bohlscheid, United States Marine Corps of       Pocatello, has been missing since June 11, 1967, in South       Vietnam. Bohlscheid was the pilot of a helicopter which       crashed into a steep ravine on a mission to insert a seven-      man Marine Force Recon team on the battlefield. Status:       ``Killed in Action, Body Not Recovered''        First Lieutenant William E. Lemmons, United States Army of       Pocatello, has been missing since June 18, 1967, in South       Vietnam. Lemmons was aboard a helicopter on a visual recon       mission. The helicopter was declared missing and after       extensive searches no trace of the aircraft or its crew was       found. Status: ``Missing in Action.''        Captain Jon K. Bodahl, United States Air Force of Boise,       has been missing since November 12, 1969, in Laos. Bodahl was       the pilot of an aircraft on a recovery mission that was shot       down. His aircraft was found during search and rescue       operations, but there was no trace of him. Status: ``Missing       in Action.''        Warrant Officer Jon M. Sparks, United States Army of Carey,       has been missing since March 19, 1971, in Laos. Sparks was       the co-pilot of a helicopter covering a downed helicopter       during a rescue effort. The aircraft was shot down and due to       heavy fire a search and rescue mission could not be       conducted. It is unknown what his fate was. Status: ``Missing       in Action''        Captain Gregg N. Hollinger, United States Army of Paul, has       been missing since December 14, 1971, in South Vietnam.       Hollinger was on an administrative mission aboard an aircraft       that experienced an in-flight emergency and lost contact with       ground control. Extensive searches were conducted for the       next three days, over water and the adjacent shore area, but       no trace of the aircraft or personnel was ever found. It was       later determined the aircraft was lost at sea and the crew       and passengers died. Status: ``Killed in Action, Body Not       Recovered.''    My prayers are with their families as the challenging work continues  to get needed answers and bring our country's servicemembers home. The  POW/MIA Accounting community's 2022 poster commemorating National POW/ MIA Recognition Day simply states, ``THEIR Sacrifice/OUR Pledge.'' Yes,  America's responsibility to our servicemembers must be met. May  presumptions be replaced with facts, as our country's bravest are  brought home to the families and communities who love them and long for  their return.                            ____________________
