 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 128, the  Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2019.   I am proud, once again, to be the sponsor of this legislation which  passed the House in a bipartisan manner during the 115th Congress. I  want to thank my colleague, Chairwoman Velazquez, for working with me  on this bill.   The Office of Advocacy at the United States Small Business  Administration plays a vital role in ensuring that Federal agencies  adequately consider how their policies impact America's small  businesses. While the Office of Advocacy has done excellent work on  behalf of our Nation's small businesses, the current law is silent on  whether it can research and advocate on behalf of small business on  international matters such as trade initiatives and regulations. This  is a problem that we can easily address.   For many small businesses, exporting and operating overseas is an  important part of their success and allows them to grow. Given the  Office of Advocacy's knowledge and research on how domestic regulations  impact small businesses, it is appropriate for the office to advocate  and research small business interests on international matters as well,  especially since international opportunities play a vital role for many  of our Nation's small businesses.   This bill advances the Office of Advocacy's mission to advocate for  America's small businesses and clarifies its authority on international  small business issues. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this important bipartisan bill.                                time  1730
