 Madam President, I thank Senators Manchin and Stabenow for  joining us today. Senators Baldwin and Casey will come later to shine a  light on the more than 1 million workers and retirees across this  country who are on the verge of facing massive cuts to the pensions  they have earned.   I want to thank the workers and retirees who are in Washington this  week. You will see teamsters, sheet metal workers, mine workers,  carpenters, ironworkers, bakers and confectioners--retirees, mostly-- who have earned this retirement but because of an action in this body,  simply haven't had that retirement promise fulfilled. They are  demanding that Congress honor the dignity of their work and honor the  promise of those pensions.   The crisis affects thousands in my State of Ohio and affects the  massive  [[Page S5781]]  Central States pension plan, the United Mine Workers pension plan, the  Ironworkers Local 17 pension plan, the Southwest Ohio carpenters  pension plan, the bakers and confectioners pension plan, and others in  every State in this country. We are talking about our entire  multiemployer pension system. If it collapses, it won't be just the  retirees who will feel the pain. Current workers will be stuck paying  into pensions they will never receive, and small businesses will be  left drowning in pension liability they cannot afford to pay. It will  have ripple effects throughout our economy.   Let's be clear. If we do nothing, this could trigger a recession  perhaps on par with the housing crisis. And we know what Wall Street  greed did in the housing crisis, and we know what could happen here if  Senator McConnell doesn't move on this. We know who gets hurt the most  every single time. Small businesses that have been in the family for  generations could face bankruptcy. Workers will lose jobs as businesses  are forced to close shop. These businesses and employees did everything  right. They contributed to these pensions, in many cases over decades.   Too often, people in this town don't understand the whole point of  collective bargaining, don't understand the collective bargaining  process. People give up dollars today for the promise of a secure  retirement with good healthcare and a pension. They give up dollars  today with a promise of having a pension and healthcare. These workers'  lives and livelihoods will be devastated if Congress doesn't do its  job.   When I think about the responsibility we have, I think about the  words of worker Larry Ward at a hearing at the statehouse in Columbus  last year. He said:         I don't understand how it is that Congress would even       consider asking us to take a cut to my pension, or see it go       away entirely, when it had no problems sending billions to       the Wall Street crooks who caused this problem in the first       place.    Don't forget that what happened on Wall Street had an impact on these  pensions.   He went on to say:         They used that to pay themselves bonuses. We use our       pensions to pay for medicine and food and heat.    It is bad enough that Wall Street squandered workers' money; it is  worse that the government that is supposed to look out for these folks  ignores the promise that was made to these workers. The President--who  essentially stood by and did nothing--would say it is disgraceful.   That is why these workers are fighting back. We have kept this on the  agenda because of them, because they refuse to give up. Workers  rallied, called, and wrote letters. We all have seen the camo UMWA t- shirts. These workers have rallied in the name of Butch Lewis, a great  Cincinnatian who helped lead this fight and passed away far too soon  while fighting for his fellow workers. His wife, Rita, has continued  this fight and has become a leader and an inspiration to me and so many  others. She once told me that the workers in this crisis feel like they  are invisible. They are not invisible to Senator Manchin, Senator  Stabenow, or to me. I know they are not invisible to my colleague  Senator Portman, who has put in months of work in good faith on this  issue on the committee and continues this year. I know he is committed  and I am committed, and my colleagues on the floor today--again,  Senators Manchin, Stabenow, Casey, and Baldwin will be joining us. We  are committed to these miners, teamsters, these retirees and workers  and small businesses. We will not give up. We are continuing to work on  a bipartisan solution.   It comes back to the dignity of work. When work has dignity, we honor  the retirement security that people earned. We respect collective  bargaining. We know collective bargaining created the middle class. I  urge my colleagues in this body--colleagues with a good pension and  good healthcare paid for by taxpayers--I urge my colleagues in this  body to think about those retired workers and the stress they are  facing.   Join us. Let's pass a solution that honors their work and keeps our  promise. If you love this country, you fight for the people who make it  work.   I yield to Senator Manchin.
