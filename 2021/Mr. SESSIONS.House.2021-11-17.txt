 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Johnson for this  opportunity.   Madam Speaker, we are here to talk to the American people about ideas  that roam across our Nation. They are conversations that take place  around every table, and next week at Thanksgiving we will have those  conversations at my table and others around the country.   Madam Speaker, you just heard a good discussion about inflation. But  part of inflation comes from government spending, and part of  government spending comes from policy that this President and this  administration's Democratic Party supports.   Madam Speaker, 1.6 million people have come to our borders and come  across, and we are doing things that will encourage them to come here.  We  [[Page H6356]]  are doing things that will encourage them when we give them free  education, free healthcare and to pay for them to do those things.                                time  1745    So, Madam Speaker, tonight we want to speak specifically about this  thing that is called inflation. Inflation is related to Federal  monetary and fiscal policy. Inflation is that thing that occurs in the  economy when the price of goods and services rise and rise  exponentially.   Normally, an administration would look at about a 2 percent growth, a  2 percent inflation rate, which would be, generally speaking, an  acceptable growth for a GDP model as well as inflation rate.   This administration, however, began with President Biden going down  and visiting the king of inflation, former President Jimmy Carter,  talking to this Nation about how great Jimmy Carter's service was. Well  what he really meant to say was I admired his policies, progressive  liberal policies that took this country to have 16 and 18 percent  interest rates, interest rates that raised prices an excessive amount  of money for families for a generation that could not buy homes.   Madam Speaker, the Republican Party is here speaking, just as the  American people are, and we recognize that this administration has made  dear and great friends with the conditions that create inflationary  spiral.   This administration knows exactly--they have smart people there, but  it is their policies that they demand to have, and those policies bring  about results that end up making friends with inflation: Higher prices  for goods and services; more government spending. This is big expensive  government spending across the board.   And so the American people will have the most expensive Thanksgiving  in years; the highest inflation rate in 30 years. Oh, that would be  back to Jimmy Carter. No wonder President Biden visited his favorite-- or second favorite President, Jimmy Carter, because he wants to make  friends with the conditions that create inflation: Big government  spending, prices rising, government control of the goods and services.   And just like Jimmy Carter, he had a Senate, a House, and a  Presidency to be very successful.   Madam Speaker, the American people spoke again last night in local  elections down in South Carolina. They spoke a week ago in State  elections.   Madam Speaker, the American people deserve better. Better comes from  policy, and better comes from adults who will recognize that it is not  just politics, it is about the American people who want and need to  have more take-home pay and more ability to take care of themselves;  not big, expensive socialist government that even breaks the laws of  this country.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his service to this  conference but, more importantly, for making sure that the American  people hear the other side of the story.
