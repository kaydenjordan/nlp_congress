 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today this Chamber, once referred to as  the greatest deliberative body, must take action. We have people all  over the country who want to see action, people who want to see change,  people who are crying out for their leaders in Washington to do their  jobs.   These days, the U.S. Senate has become a place where legislation goes  to die and the important issues of the day go ignored, in addition to  inaction--major, major issues, significant issues, like climate change  and infrastructure and immigration reform.   Today I will focus on three things that are right before us--three  bills in the gun legislation area that right now are on the leader's  desk--and two other areas, election protection and bringing down the  cost of prescription drugs, where we could literally take action  immediately.   I focus on these because they all involve bills that have passed the  House, and the Senate could literally act today. I focus on these  because, in all three cases, the timing is urgent.   I am talking about inaction in the wake of terrible tragedies in  Dayton and El Paso and in Midland-Odessa, all in just the last month;  inaction in protecting our elections and making it easier for people to  vote; inaction in response to serious issues of healthcare costs,  particularly prescription drug prices.   First, I will speak about gun safety. Think about the courage--the  incredible courage--of the people who were in Dayton and in El Paso and  in Midland-Odessa, of the mom who literally shielded her baby from  death as she herself perished from gunshot wounds, but she kept that  baby alive. Or how about the grandpa who died shielding his wife and  granddaughter or the off-duty soldier who carried children away to  safety? All of that happened in that store.   As we approach the anniversary of 9/11, I think also about the first  responders in all of these mass shootings. Those in Dayton, OH, got  there in 1 minute--1 minute--but, still, we lost nine people in 30  seconds. But they were there in 1 minute and saved so many lives. That  is courage.   That is the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things,  and I believe in this place of extraordinary power that their courage  must be matched. The courage must be  [[Page S5347]]  matched to that mom, to that grandpa, to that soldier, to those first  responders. These are ordinary citizens who stepped up and saved lives.  It is the least we can do to match their courage.   The American people can't afford more inaction. But over the past few  years, to me, it seems we have lost our resolve.   Today, I implore my colleagues, I implore the Republican leadership  to find the resolve once again and act with courage just as those men  and women did in El Paso, in Dayton, in Midland and Odessa and Gilroy  and Parkland and Newtown and Charleston and Orlando.   How about all of those families who lose a loved one every single day  to gun violence in homes, to gun violence on the streets? There are  1,300 children who die from gunshot wounds each year. That is a  classroom of kids every single week.   Yes, we are back today. Congress is back. I believe we should have  come back sooner. We were in recess for mere hours when the gunman in  El Paso claimed the lives of 22 people and for only a few hours more  when the gunman in Dayton claimed 9 lives.   I was among those who immediately called for the Senate to come back  from recess so that we could vote on gun safety measures--gun safety  measures that had passed the House of Representatives with some  Republican support.   I said that we should come back for that vote back then on background  checks. By the way, 9 out of 10 Americans support sensible background  checks; the majority of hunters support sensible background checks; the  majority of voters who voted for President Trump support sensible  background checks.   I know the history here. As the lead sponsor of the bill to prevent  perpetrators of domestic violence--perpetrators, people who have been  convicted of serious domestic violence and stalking--from possessing a  gun and as a longtime supporter of universal background checks, as well  as the assault weapon ban and limits on magazines, I was invited to the  White House right after Parkland, right after all of those kids died in  that school, and I thought: Well, this is a moment when we can act.    I was seated across from the President of the United States, and I  had a piece of paper that I saved, and I wrote down with hash marks how  many times he said that we should pass the bill for universal  background checks and stop that gun show loophole. Nine times he said  it--nine times.   I was seated next to the Vice President and across from the  President. I told the President that I come from a proud hunting State  and that when I look at proposals like this, I say to myself: Do they  hurt my Uncle Dick in the deer stand? Do they do anything to hurt our  hunting tradition in our State?   They don't. That is why the vast majority of hunters support  universal background checks and a lot of these other measures we talked  about that day in that conference room in the White House. It was on  TV, so people can see it. There is a video of it. There is evidence of  it.   I thought it was a done deal. But then what happened? The President,  the next day, met with the NRA, and he folded. He folded, despite the  fact that on TV in front of the Nation, in front of those kids, those  surviving kids from Parkland, in front of the families of the kids who  had died, he made a promise that he didn't keep. That is the history I  know and I have lived.   But it doesn't end there. I go back in time. I go back to the saddest  day in the U.S. Senate for me. That was the morning of the vote on  background checks. That was years before. That was after the Sandy Hook  shooting. Those families were there, and I had been working with some  of the Senators who were leading that bill, and I had to tell those  parents that morning who had lost their kids--their elementary school- age kids in that school--that we didn't have enough votes to pass that  bill.   I remember one of the moms said to me: You know, I will never forget  that day. I will never forget the last time I saw my son alive. He had  severe autism, so he really couldn't speak. But every morning he would  point at the picture of the school aide, whom he loved so much, who  would never leave his side. He loved her, and he would point at her  picture on our refrigerator.   That is what happened that last day she saw him alive. Then he went  to school, and then, just a few hours later, she was waiting in that  firehouse with all of those parents. One by one, those children came  into that firehouse, and pretty soon, the parents who were left knew  that they would never see their babies again.   As she was sobbing in that firehouse, she had this fleeting moment  where she thought of that school aide, and she knew at that moment that  the school aide would never leave the side of her little boy.   When they found them both, shot to death, that school aide had her  arms around that little boy.   That mom was in my office that morning, and she had the courage to  advocate for something she knew wouldn't have saved her kid because of  the particular circumstances of how that guy got that gun. But what she  knew about the background checks was that they would save more lives  than a lot of these other measures. Why? Because the States that have  them have reduced rates of domestic homicide. Yes, and they help with  suicide as well.   It probably would have helped in Midland-Odessa. We don't know all of  the facts, but what we do know is that one time that guy failed a  background check, and then somehow he was able to get a gun.   Those parents had the courage to do that. Then, a few hours later,  this place didn't have the courage to pass that bill.   That is the history I have had with this issue, but it goes back even  further. It goes back to when I was a prosecutor and we had cases all  the time of everyday gun violence. We had officers killed; we had  children killed; we had women killed in their homes.   But the case I most remember actually happened after I left that job,  and I was in the Senate, and we had a shooting of a police officer in a  small town. He was just doing his job. He showed up for a domestic  violence call, which maybe sounds regular to a lot of people but not to  officers because they know how dangerous those calls are.   It was a young woman, the victim of domestic violence, 17. The guy  was in the house, and the officer went to the door, just doing his job.  He opened the door, and the guy shot him in the head. He was wearing a  bulletproof vest, but it didn't protect him.   The widow told me--because I was there for that funeral--the last  time they had been in that church was for the Nativity play that the  kids were in. After Christmas, the next time they were in that church,  she was walking--a widow--down that aisle with her little children,  with a little toddler in her arms in a blue dress covered with stars.   That is gun violence. It is not just about one family; it is not just  about one victim; it is not even just about that police officer and  that family who will never be the same. It is about our entire  community. That is my history with this issue.   So when I come back here and I think of the courage of all of those  people and all of those survivors and I think about those mass  shootings and how, one by one, if we had passed these sensible bills,  we could have prevented some of this from happening, I don't know what  our excuse is anymore.   The leader on the Republican side said that ``if the President took a  position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law  and not just having serial votes, I would be happy to put it on the  floor.''   Then the President said: ``Congress is going to be reporting back to  me with ideas.''   The time for ideas is done. The ideas passed in the House of  Representatives--not all of the ideas that I would like put into law,  but some really good things got passed that would prevent a lot of  violence, including the background checks, including closing the  Charleston loophole, when that White nationalist went into that church  and gunned down those parishioners only because a background check  hadn't been completed. It just gives a few more days--that is what that  bill does--so police officers can do their job and complete the  background checks.   How about my bill, which is a bill that is sitting on Leader  McConnell's  [[Page S5348]]  desk? It closes the boyfriend loophole. What is the status of the law  right now? Well, if you get convicted of a serious offense of domestic  violence against your husband or wife--most of the time it is wives--or  against someone who lives in your house, then you can't go out and get  an AK-47. You can't go out and get a gun. That is the law right now.   But if you get convicted of the same crime against a boyfriend or a  girlfriend--usually a girlfriend--you could go out and get that gun.   We have had hearing after hearing about this bill. We have had  hearings because it is so sensible to close that loophole. Why? Because  half of those domestic homicides involve girlfriends.   I remember the one we had a few years ago. We heard from the sheriff  from Racine County in Wisconsin. He described himself as a  conservative. He said this:         Dangerous boyfriends can be just as scary as dangerous       husbands. They hit just as hard and they fire their guns with       the same deadly force.    That bill is in the Violence Against Women Act right now and is  sitting on Leader McConnell's desk. That bill passed with 33 Republican  votes in the House of Representatives. There is absolutely no reason we  should stop a vote on the entire Violence Against Women Act simply  because it includes this commonsense provision.   Those are the three bills right now, soon to be joined by a bill on  limits on magazines. Why that bill? Because in 30 seconds, nine  innocent people were killed in Dayton, OH. The cops did everything they  possibly could. They were there in 1 minute, and still nine people  died.   Those are the bills--background checks and closing the loopholes--so  the cops have time to simply finish their vetting. Why would you want  to cut off their days at 3? Third, closing the boyfriend loophole to  help in cases of stalking and domestic violence, and fourth, magazines.  These are commonsense bills. Would I like to do more with the assault  weapon ban? Yes, I would. But right now, we could get these done.   What do we hear instead? We hear this: The President took a position  on a bill, so then we can wait to see if we can have serial votes, and  then we put it on the floor.   The President is saying: Congress is going to report back to me with  ideas.   This is a dangerous game of whack-a-mole that has to stop. People are  dying while leaders are pointing fingers. We could point our fingers  and vote yes or no, and we could do that today. We ask that those bills  be called up immediately.   But it doesn't end there. There are other very important bills we  should be voting on right now.   Election security. We know a foreign country invaded our election. We  know that because we heard it from President Trump's top intelligence  officials. In fact, Dan Coats, the Director of Intelligence back then,  said that they were getting bolder. We know that. We know what  happened. We know they did it in multiple ways. They did it by trying  to hack into elections and election equipment in all 50 States. We  found that out. In Illinois, they got as close as the voter files.   We also know they tried to do it with social media, and there, they  were more successful. They ran a bunch of ads--paid for them in  rubles--to try to suppress the vote. I will never forget the one shown  at our Judiciary hearing, paid for in rubles. It was a Facebook ad that  went on African-Americans' Facebook pages in swing districts. It was a  picture of a woman--an innocent woman; they had just taken the face of  someone from Chicago--and it said: Why wait in line to vote for  Hillary? You can text your vote. And they gave a number, something like  86513. That is illegal. That is a crime. If we had known about that ad  and found the perpetrators, they would have gone to jail. But that kind  of activity by a foreign country was allowed to run rampant, and when  the President was asked about it at the G20, standing with Vladimir  Putin, he made a joke about it, looked at Vladimir Putin, and they  laughed.   Do you know what I thought? I thought to myself, hundreds of  thousands of Americans have lost their lives on the battlefield  fighting for democracy in our own country and around the world. I  thought of the four little innocent girls in a church in Birmingham who  lost their lives in the fight for civil rights, in the fight for  democracy, in the fight to vote. And he made a joke about it. This  isn't a joke.   We have an opportunity. We have several bills on this that I am  leading, to push for backup paper ballots in the remaining States that  don't have them and to push for funding for audits and funding to get  the right election equipment.   This isn't a joke. It doesn't matter if you are a Republican or a  Democrat or an Independent; this is about protecting our democracy from  the invasion of a foreign country. That is why our Founding Fathers  started this country--because they wanted to be independent and didn't  want to have foreign influence. It is what we fought for in war after  war--protecting freedom and democracy.   This is the new ground for invasions. They didn't do it with  missiles. They didn't do it with tanks. They are doing it with  computers, and it is called cyber warfare. We have to be as  sophisticated in our country as they are when they try to invade it.   When we tried to call up one of these bills--and Senator Blunt had  nicely called that hearing in the Rules Committee, of which I am  ranking member--we got gut-punched--Senator Lankford and I and the  other authors of the bill, Senator Burr, head of the Intelligence  Committee, Senator Warner, Senator Harris, Senator Graham--because that  got stopped by the White House--calls were made--and by the leader. It  is time to bring back this bill or pass one of the many versions that  are out there.   The last area I am going to bring up--and there are many other  things. I mentioned climate change and immigration reform, but the  reason I am focusing on these things--gun safety for the obvious  reason, as well as election security and prescription drugs--is because  these are bills that have passed the House of Representatives. They are  something we could do right now.   What about prescription drugs? It feels like years ago now, but it  was actually just last January when I went to the State of the Union  with my guest Nicole Smith-Holt. Nicole's son Alec was 26 years old, a  restaurant manager in the suburbs of Minneapolis-St. Paul, and he had  aged off his parents' insurance. Three days short of his payday, this  hard-working kid--a pretty severe diabetic--wasn't able to afford his  insulin, so he did what so many diabetics are doing right now because  of the incredible cost of insulin: He started rationing it. He saved  it. He took less than he was supposed to take.   I have talked to seniors who literally keep the injectors with those  precious drops of insulin so they can use them the next day. When Alec  tried it, tragically, it didn't work. He died. This should never happen  in the United States of America, not with as simple a drug as insulin,  which has been around for nearly a century.   I brought his mom with me to the State of the Union. She was sitting  right up there looking down at the President while he claimed--of  course many times--that he is going to do something about the prices of  pharmaceuticals.   I think those who are blocking and slow-walking bipartisan  legislation to reduce the cost of prescription drugs should give Nicole  a call. She is smart, she is pretty straightforward, and she is a nice  person. Listen to her story.   Healthcare is one-sixth of our economy, and total drug spending  accounts for over 15 percent of our Nation's healthcare costs, from  consumers to hospitals and nursing homes.   Between 2012 and 2016, the price of brand-name prescription drugs  increased 110 percent. If we don't act now, that number will keep  increasing as the profit margins for Big Pharma increase hand over  fist. They have two lobbyists for every Member. For every desk in the  Senate, pharma has two lobbyists. That is what Nicole looked down on  when she saw the State of the Union. That number also applies to the  House of Representatives, where we were that night.   There are solutions on the table. I think what would make the biggest  difference, because it involves so many people, would be to pass my  bill that I have led for years that would harness the negotiating power  of 43 million seniors and allow Medicare to negotiate to  [[Page S5349]]  bring drug prices down. The VA does it. Medicaid does it. They have  much less expensive drug prices because negotiation is allowed. I  figure, with the power of 43 million seniors, we could get pretty good  deals--43 million seniors--done through Medicare. But right now, it is  locked in.   Why would it help people who are not at the age to be on Medicare? It  helps you because it is the biggest block of drug prices, and once it  starts going down for Medicare, it will start going down for everyone.   We can also pass my bill that I worked on for years with Senator  Grassley to stop big, brand-name companies from paying off other drug  manufacturers to keep less expensive products off the market.   Let's think of what that means. What that means is pharma has a drug.  A lot of times, they have a monopoly. Then someone comes along with  another version of it that is less expensive. That would be great for  us, especially when there are three or four competitive drugs. You  always see those prices go down. Do you know what they do? They  actually pay the generics to keep the product off the market. The big  companies then have a monopoly. The new companies bringing the drug in,  the generic, are fine; they get the money from Big Pharma. The only  ones who get the short end of the stick are us, the consumers of this  country. That is why Senator Grassley and I have worked across the  aisle, and it is time to get that bill passed.   The third one I would suggest is a bill I first introduced with  Senator McCain--whom we all miss very much--that would allow Americans  to bring in less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries as  well. We know drug prices in Canada are so much less expensive than  they are in the United States. Some States, like Maine, have tried to  do this on their own, but they said: No; you have to have a Federal law  to make this really work. Individuals have tried to do it. Bus tours of  seniors go up there. We had bipartisan support for this in Minnesota-- former Governor Pawlenty supported changing this bill--but we couldn't  do it as a State. It really has to be done at the Federal level.   I am also pleased that Senator Grassley has now stepped into Senator  McCain's shoes and is carrying this bill for me. He is the chair of the  Senate Finance Committee. There is no reason we shouldn't be able to  call this bill up for a vote.   In conclusion, I started this speech by questioning whether this  Chamber is even capable of action on big things anymore. I will end by  asking a question that should be simple: Will the Senate respond to the  needs of the American people?   When Americans are shot in cold blood, their bodies littered on the  floor of a Walmart, will we respond to their needs? Will we respond to  their families? When their votes are threatened by attacks from a  foreign country, will we respond to the citizens of this country? Will  we respond when we know drug prices have gone completely out of control  and we uniquely could do something about it?   Today, what this Chamber needs are leaders. Leaders don't hesitate.  They don't drag their feet or put politics over country. They don't  block or obstruct progress. If my colleagues don't want to find common  ground, at least we could show some common sense.   It is time to live up to the promise of this esteemed body. Inaction  won't do. The American people can't afford inaction in the wake of  unprecedented attacks on our elections and our democracy. They can't  afford inaction when people are actually dying because they can't  afford common prescription drugs. They can't afford inaction when we  have people being slaughtered on our streets, going to a festival in  California, out on a weekend night with friends, going to a movie  theater, or going shopping for school supplies.   Historically, this Chamber has done great things. It is one of the  reasons all of us who got elected to this office decided to do it. Our  predecessors fought for and passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the  U.S. Senate. This place expanded voting rights the following year. This  place helped provide a safety net for families, seniors, and kids  across the country by passing Medicare and Medicaid. Guess what. When  those things were passed, they weren't totally popular at the time, but  now they are because they did the right thing. They were leaders. They  didn't wait. They didn't hesitate. They led. We can and should come  together and do great things now. That is the America we love. That is  the America we know. That is the America we can be again.   I ask that these commonsense measures come up for a vote.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
