 Mr. Chairman, I would like to present an  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my Nevada colleague,  Congressman Amodei, for his support on this bipartisan amendment.   Mr. Chairman, our amendment would provide increased funds for the  Drug-Free Communities Support Program.   The opioid epidemic is hurting every corner of this country, and  southern Nevada is no exception. We need to invest in local, community- based solutions to help people struggling with opioid abuse.   Unfortunately, local governments often have the fewest drug  prevention resources and funds, even though it is the local communities  on the front lines of this crisis.   In every State and congressional district, every day of the year,  there are first responders and paramedics treating overdoses and abuse.  Our bipartisan amendment will directly invest in local community  efforts to combat opioid abuse in Nevada and throughout this country.   Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
