 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the presumptive  Republican nominee for President.   Today, that presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, was in a New York  courtroom to face fraud charges for lying about his wealth. The $250  million lawsuit accuses the Republican leader of inflating the value of  his assets. He did it to get better deals on at least $300 million in  loans and insurance policies. Loans, I might add, that he refused to  pay back.   Trump even claims that his $18 million Mar-a-Lago estate is worth  $1.5 billion. The trial could force the Republican leader to pay  millions of dollars in fines. I remember when the Republican Party used  to fight for fiscal responsibility. Now, they bow to a man who cheats  on his taxes, steals from banks, fails to pay subcontractors, and  defrauds investors. That does not sound responsible to me, and it is  disgraceful behavior from a Presidential candidate.                            ____________________
