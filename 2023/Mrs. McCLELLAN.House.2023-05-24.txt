 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is just 8 days away from a  potential debt default, while House Republicans continue to hold the  American economy hostage.   As one of less than 7 percent of the Members of Congress who have  children under the age of 18, I am particularly concerned about the  impact that a default would have on our children, as Federal funding  for crucial government programs that impact them runs out.   In the Commonwealth of Virginia, 1 in 12 rely on SNAP benefits to put  food on the table, and a default would jeopardize those payments, as  well as access to free and reduced lunch programs.   Default is not an option, but the Republicans' extreme ransom note is  not a viable alternative, either. It would slash funding for our school  systems and leave 200,000 children without access to Head Start slots  and 100,000 without access to childcare programs.   In the Commonwealth, almost 6,000 children would be impacted. This  would severely undermine our children's education and make it more  difficult for parents to join the workforce and contribute to our  economy.   We must raise the debt ceiling now.                            ____________________
