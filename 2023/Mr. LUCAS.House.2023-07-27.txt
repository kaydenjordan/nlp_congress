 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. I thank  my fellow chairman and my fellow Member from the adjoining State of  Arkansas for yielding time to me to speak on this important piece of  legislation.   Oklahomans and those who call the West home are proud  conservationists and great stewards of our land. Sustainable, healthy  land is the lifeblood of our rural communities, and no one understands  that better than the farmers, ranchers, and landowners themselves.   When we work with and not against producers, we have seen the  impossible accomplished. For years, landowners have partnered with  local and State government and industry to increase the production of  energy and agricultural goods. They were able to do this all while  improving soil health and wildlife habitats, creating an environment  and an economy that is beneficial to both wildlife and the residents of  rural America.   My father used to say there is a fine line between doing something  for people and doing something to people. Let me be clear: Listing the  lesser prairie-chicken under the Endangered Species Act is government  doing something to people, not for them.   This listing creates unnecessary and burdensome restrictions on  Oklahoma's agriculture and oil and gas industries and limits our  ability as a country to provide for ourselves and the world. That is  why I support this resolution before us today.   This resolution ensures that U.S. Fish and Wildlife regulations do  not infringe on the property owners who live and work their land every  day.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
