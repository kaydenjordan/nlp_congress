 Mr. Speaker, on November 7, Utah will honor a  soldier's soldier.   For the past 7 years, the men and women of the Utah National Guard  have been inspired by Major General Jefferson S. Burton. General Burton  was chosen for his battle-tested grit and resolve.   In 2003, this fourth-generation Utahn led the 14-57th Engineer  Battalion into Iraq. Living under constant threat of IEDs and ambush,  General Burton was even tasked with luring the hyenas, bears, and lions  of the Baghdad Zoo back into their enclosures after the Iraqi  Republican Guard released them into the streets.   His troops tell me that General Burton is a leader who takes the time  to teach and mentor others, helping them recognize their own potential.   General Burton is highly educated. He is kind. He is deeply  spiritual. But what he values most is his wife, Charn, whose support  has allowed him to serve.   General Burton often tells his soldiers: ``I am asking a lot, but we  will accomplish the mission.''   After 37 years of service, we say to General Burton: Mission  accomplished.                            ____________________
