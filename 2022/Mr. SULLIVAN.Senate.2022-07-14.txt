 Madam President, I just had the opportunity to host a  lunch--the Thursday lunch--for a number of my Senate colleagues. This  is an opportunity that Senators get to essentially brag about their  State. It is kind of like what I do with the ``Alaskan of the Week''  speech that I give.   I know we have new pages here.   I am going to be putting out a Facebook post on the incredible bounty  that we just had at the lunch--salmon, halibut, peonies flowers, which  are now growing in abundance in Alaska. It was a really, really  incredible meal, if I do say so myself, from Alaskans. So we are going  to talk about that.   Next week I will be back to my ``Alaskan of the Week'' series, for  the new pages. I promise you, this is going to be your favorite speech  of the week because it is interesting, and it tells stories, and it is  exciting about what is going on in Alaska.   Madam President, I want to talk about two other issues today that I  care deeply about--I think most Senators do, and certainly Americans  do--and that is two things that our country desperately needs:  infrastructure and energy. Infrastructure and energy--and we all know  that this is what is needed.   We talk about it here a lot in the Senate. However, some, especially  in the Biden administration, talk a lot about these issues but, then,  when it comes to taking action, maybe not so much. Maybe that is  starting to change, maybe not.   But I am going to talk about something I introduced in the Senate  yesterday that is going to be action, especially on infrastructure. So  let's talk about infrastructure first.   Yesterday, I introduced a joint resolution of disapproval under the  Congressional Review Act--it is what we call the CRA--which will  nullify the Biden administration's new regulations that are remarkably  going to bog down  [[Page S3313]]  the ability to permit infrastructure projects. It is going to add to  the redtape that every single American who cares about this issue knows  is a problem, and it is a new reg from the Biden administration-- remarkably, because they supposedly are for infrastructure, and I am  going to get to that. It is a new reg to make it harder to build  infrastructure projects.   So let me unpack a little bit of that because it is something that I  think all Americans care about. I know they care about it, but it can  kind of be boring and technical, with permitting and things like that.   When the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, was passed in the  late sixties, it required an environmental impact statement, an EIS, as  we call these things. In the old days, you would do an EIS. It would  take about a year, maybe. You would get public input. It was maybe 100  pages. OK? The process worked. People were engaged. It didn't bog down  things, and you would have a couple of hundred pages that the average  American could read and then you would build, which is what we all want  to do in a responsible way.   Fast forward to today. NEPA has been completely abused. This is a  huge passion of mine because it hurts everybody. Too many people, too  many Americans now know the numbers: 4 to 6 years on average to  complete any EIS in America. Most cost millions of dollars. Most EISes  are thousands of pages so no one reads them. How can you read them? And  it is undeniably killing our ability to build infrastructure.   The only people, in my view, who really like this new system are, A,  radical far-left environmental groups that don't want to build  anything--OK, that is a group; it is not a big group in America, but,  unfortunately, they have a loud voice--and probably the Chinese  Communist Party. When they know they have to compete against us, they  love the fact that it takes 9 to 10 years to permit a bridge in the  U.S.A.   Let me provide some examples. GAO did a study quite a while ago on  new highway construction to build and design a new highway, 9 to 19  years, on average, in America. It is about 8 years, I think, for  Federal permits to permit a bridge--a bridge--in America.   The Gross Reservoir in Colorado, which is going to offer clean water  to the people of that State, it has been two decades--20 years--to  permit that important infrastructure project.   The California bullet train project--holy cow--approved in the  nineties and still not built. The Mountain Valley Pipeline in Virginia  and West Virginia, it began in 2015 with 20 miles left to complete. I  hate to say it. It will never be completed--litigation, back to the  courts, NEPA, radical enviros stopping it. This is not America. This is  not the way it should work.   My State, unfortunately, has been the epicenter of groups that try to  stop any resource development projects--any projects--a road, a bridge,  a gold mine. The Kensington Mine in Alaska now employs over 400 people,  average wage $110,000 per year. That is great money. It took almost 20  years to permit if you include the litigation--20 years. Who is that  benefiting?   I worked with the Trump administration on their NEPA Executive order.  I worked in the Environment and Public Works Committee on this  infrastructure bill that President Biden supported. We got good--not  great--but we got some pretty darn good permitting reform, based on  some of what we did in the Trump administration, to bring projects to  be able to build in a timely, efficient manner, not cutting corners.  There is one Federal Agency in charge of decision, time limits on NEPA  requirements to 2 years, limitations on pages for NEPA. These are  commonsense reforms. We got them into law. OK. That is pretty good.  Bipartisan. The President hailed this as one of his big signature  achievements. I voted for it, in part, because of NEPA reforms, because  of permitting reforms.   What am I upset about? About 4 months ago, the Biden administration's  Council on Environmental Quality not only revised the Trump Executive  order on permitting, which the average American Republican and Democrat  thought was good--they actually undertook new regulations for NEPA that  are clearly--clearly--intended to make it harder to permit  infrastructure projects, particularly energy infrastructure projects.   Just ask anyone. Go look at the regs. Go look at what they put out.  What I find remarkable is that the President let this come out of his  White House. He is supposedly ``Mr. Infrastructure,'' ``Mr. Building  Trades,'' ``Mr. Joe Six-Pack Union Guy.''   This is a product of the radical, elite, coastal Democratic special  interests that is going to make it harder to build things. That is a  fact. It is a sad fact, especially because a lot of us came together as  Democrats and Republicans to pass permitting reform.   So what did I file yesterday? A Congressional Review Act resolution  says that if Congress doesn't like a big regulation coming out of the  executive branch, we can vote to rescind it. We can vote to rescind it.  So, yesterday, I filed one of those resolutions targeting this new rule  from the Biden administration meant to slow down the building of  infrastructure.   Here is the thing. You don't see this a lot, but every single  Republican Senator is a cosponsor of my resolution--50--50 cosponsors  of our Congressional Review Act resolution on infrastructure.   The other good thing about the CRA law, Congressional Review Act law,  it is a privileged resolution. What does that mean? It means Majority  Leader Schumer, even if he doesn't like it, has to take it up.   Here is the other thing. Under the CRA law, you only need 51 Senators  51 Senators to make it pass the Senate. So my Democratic colleagues are  going to have a tough choice here. I don't think it should be tough. I  think it should be 100 to 0. If you want infrastructure for America and  you want to stand with the men and women who build things in America,  then you are going to vote for my resolution. Simple.   Let me quote the Laborers' International, LIUNA, the biggest  construction trade union in America, led by a great American, Terry  O'Sullivan. When the Biden administration was putting out their NEPA  rule, the laborers said: What are you doing? Here is our statement.  Here is what they thought about that rule:         Once again, communities in need of vital infrastructure and       the hard working men and women who build America will be       waiting as project details for infrastructure are       subjected to onerous reviews [by these new rules].    That is the Laborers'. Those are the men and women who build America.  Americans will continue to bear the expense of NEPA-related delays,  which cost taxpayers millions of dollars annually.   Lengthy review processes and unpredictable legal challenges which  will result from these new regs will have a chilling impact on private  investment and infrastructure.   That is what the Laborers' said.   This is going to be an interesting vote because I have said this a  number of times--I think some of my Democratic friends have gotten a  little upset with me, but I think it is a fact; it is certainly a fact  in Alaska--whenever the national Democrats have a choice between the  radical far-left environmentalists, the coastal elites, and the men and  women who build things and made our country great, they always choose  the radical environmentalists. I mentioned this in the Commerce  Committee hearing the other day. Some of my colleagues got a little  upset with me. I said: All right. Guess what I am going to have--a CRA.  I am going to put it on the floor, and it is going to be a test vote. I  know where 50 Republicans stand. We are going to stand with the men and  women who build stuff. If you support my CRA like the Laborers' do or  will, the resolution, you are going to support it. If you support  infrastructure for America, you are going to support our resolution. If  you support energy for America, you are going to support our  resolution. If you support the men and women who actually build stuff  in this country, good wages, you are going to support my resolution. If  you stand with the coastal environmental elites who want to shut down  this country, you will vote against it.   I think it is going to be really interesting to see what the men and  women of the U.S. Senate stand for: far-left environmentalists who just  want to stop anything and shut it all down or the men or women who  build stuff?  [[Page S3314]]    That vote is going to come in the next few weeks, and I am going to  be down here on the floor a lot talking about it. I hope my colleagues  do the right thing because we all know what the right thing to do is:  to move this country forward, to build on the infrastructure bill, and  to get working and support the men and women who do that hard work.                            ____________________     Madam President, I want to turn to energy now. You know  the President is in Saudi Arabia. There is a lot of irony here, I  believe, because his administration has clearly--clearly--made it  harder for Americans to produce American energy with American workers,  with American infrastructure. That is a fact. That is a fact, OK? I see  it in Alaska every day--every single day. The Federal Government is  trying to stop the production of American energy.   What are we seeing? Inflation, super high prices at the gas pump-- literally, everything. Senior administration officials are going to  Wall Street. Senior administration officials who are Federal regulators  for finance are all trying to choke off capital to the American energy  sector. It hurts my constituents. It hurts the country.   So the President is going to Saudi Arabia to beg them to produce  more. He should send an envoy to Texas or an envoy to Alaska and say:  Hey, how can we produce more here? How can we produce more here? I hope  they are starting to change their tune. I hope they are starting to  change their tune so that we don't need to beg the Saudis, dictators  like Iran and Venezuela, and all these other autocratic regimes in the  world to produce. We should produce it in our country. We have the  highest standards in the world by far on the environment--by far. It is  not even close. We have high standards of labor in the world.   The Biden administration, in my State, has been a disaster. They have  issued 26 Executive orders or Executive actions solely focused on my  State, solely focused on Alaska, none of which has been helpful.   Lately--lately--there has been discussion, constructive discussion,  on a big project in Alaska called the Willow Project. The Biden  administration is showing signs that they want to support it. That  would make sense. The country needs energy. This would be done in the  National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska set aside decades ago by Congress  for oil and gas development--again, the highest standards in the world.  I pitched the President on this project over a year ago in the Oval  Office. By the way, it has some of the lowest emissions in the world of  any big energy project. I am going to talk about who supports it.   This has been in permitting for years. I won't go through the  timeline, but this project, the Willow Project, has been in permitting  for years. We could start building it this winter. As a matter of fact,  we tried to start building it last winter.   Like I said, I pitched the President on this: 2,000 construction  jobs; enormous support from the building trades, labor unions; lowest  greenhouse gas emissions for a project this type and size in America.  And it would help us not have to go beg from other countries.   But there has been a lot of press in the last week on the Willow  Project. Of course, our mainstream media doesn't get it. They love to  tell their kind of slanted story on the Willow Project, so I am going  to push back. And, boy, if you are a reporter, I really hope you write  down some of the stuff that I am going to talk about here because it is  all factual. And with all due respect, most of you guys never write  about these things.   I am going to start with this chart. This is a really important chart  in my mind, and it is important because this chart goes to an issue  that really, really strikes to the heart and soul of why resource  development in my State in particular is so important.   This chart is from the American Medical Association, and it looks at  life expectancy from 1980 to 2014: 25 years. And in different parts of  America, you see different life expectancy in these different colors.  The blue, darker blue-purple is areas where life expectancy has  increased dramatically in the last 25 years.   Unfortunately, there is yellow, orange, and even red. Life expectancy  has slowed or even decreased in a few places. If you look at the map,  that is mostly due to the horrendous opioid epidemic that we had as a  nation.   But if you look at this chart, the one State where life expectancy  has increased the most, by far, is the State of Alaska. The one area in  the State of Alaska that has increased the most in terms of life  expectancy are many of our rural areas: North Slope Borough, Northwest  Arctic Borough, Aleutian Island chain--13 years, 13 years. In 25 years,  people's life expectancy went up that much.   I have asked many times my Senate colleagues, Give me a policy  indicator of success more important than are the people you  representing living longer. Give me one. There isn't one. That is about  as important as it gets.   And in my State, it has happened. It has happened. Why has it  happened? Why has it happened? Well, I will tell you why it has  happened. First, in a lot of these rural areas, unfortunately, the life  expectancy in the early eighties was quite low.   These are primarily Alaskan Native communities, and they had some of  the lowest life expectancies of any Americans--sometimes of any people  in the world--because they didn't have things, like good jobs and flush  toilets and clinics. They lived in real poverty. So we started really  low.   And then what happened? What happened that in these mostly Alaskan  Native communities people started living longer? I will tell you what  happened. They started getting jobs. Resource development happened,  responsible resource development: oil, gas, mining, fishing.   So when I talk about these issues, when Senator Murkowski talks about  these issues, it is not just some kind of pie-in-the-sky issue of oil  and gas. I mean, this is about life and death, which is why I come down  here a little bit riled up sometimes because people don't have a clue.  People don't have a clue.   The radical enviros who try to shut down the economies of my State  all the darned time and some U.S. Senators--primarily the senior  Senator from New Mexico--who come down here and try to shut this down,  they don't understand.   So people are living longer in Alaska, much longer, more than any  other part of the country because we have had responsible resource  development, which brings me back to Willow.   So, again, you will see all these articles in the Washington Post,  all these stories. Heck, there is three this week, I think, about this  one project. And they are all slanted. And you have got some Lower 48  environmental group in New York City or San Francisco--oh my gosh,  climate bomb--all this rhetoric that is hot air--pardon the pun--but  not accurate. Who is supporting this project? Who is supporting?   You have an incredible diversity of people supporting this project.  First, the unions, every major union in America--building trades, AFL- CIO--they are all supporting this project. They are all supporting this  project.   But what I really want to emphasize is another group that is very  special to me that supports the Willow Project. And you see here some  of the symbols of these groups right here.   Some are the Alaska Chamber, Oil and Gas Association, Resource  Development Council, but most of these symbols here are the Alaskan  Native people--the Alaskan Native people, the leaders of a really  important constituency in Alaska, the First Peoples of Alaska.   Why am I saying this? Because our national media never talks about  this, right? They will pick one group, one leader--oh, we are against  it--so they write about it. That is baloney.   The leaders of the Alaska communities, the Native communities are  overwhelmingly supportive of this project. And here is my point: This  administration loves to talk about environmental justice, environmental  equity, communities that have been discriminated against to make sure  they have access to proper environment, but you know what they do? They  have been doing it for a year-and-a-half. When they talk about  environmental justice, environmental equity, they always forget about  Alaskan Natives.  [[Page S3315]]  They purposefully forget about Alaskan Natives. I see it all the time.   They can't do it this time. This project--and come on, media, write  the story. This project has overwhelming support by the Native leaders  and Native communities in Alaska.   So if you are for environmental justice and racial equity, all the  things that the Biden administration says they are for, you better be a  Willow supporter.   And for those in the Biden administration, Gina McCarthy and others,  someone should ask her, Why are you discriminating against Alaskan  Native people, because that is exactly what you are doing.   So you have, right here, some of our Alaska Native leaders in this  statement:         The administration cannot proclaim to support meaningful       tribal consultation and environmental justice while at the       same time killing a critical resource [project] that supports       . . . the Inupiat communities of the North Slope [region].    That is right there from our great Alaska Native leaders, the Alaska  Federation of Natives. I have their letter. That is the group  representing every single Alaska Native organization in the State, the  biggest group in the State, fully supports the Willow Project.   The ANCSA Regional Corporation leadership fully supports the Willow  Project.   The Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope fully supports the Willow  Project.   Senator Murkowski just put out a press release.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senator Murkowski press release be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                       News Release,                                                  Lisa Murkowski,                                                      July 14, 2022.              Alaskans Voice Strong Support for Willow Project         Washington, DC--In case you missed it, U.S. Senator Lisa       Murkowski (R-AK) issued the following statement in strong       support of ConocoPhillips' Willow project, located in the       National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A), after the federal       Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published a draft       Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for it late last       week.        ``From day one, I've elevated the Willow project to the       Administration as my top priority, and I will continue to       hold them accountable to their commitment to see this       additional environmental review through so that construction       can begin this winter. Responsibly-developed Alaskan energy       benefits both our national security and American families who       are facing near-record energy prices,'' said Senator       Murkowski. ``The Willow project has gone through several       extraordinarily stringent environmental reviews and will       adhere to Alaska's world-class safety and environmental       standards. It's no wonder the project has such broad support       from Alaskans--including the Alaska Federation of Natives,       the Alaska AFL-CIO, the Alaska Chamber of Commerce, and       Alaska Native stakeholders across the North Slope.''        Willow is critical to Alaska's economy, throughput in the       quarter-full Trans Alaska Pipeline System, domestic energy       security, and making energy more affordable for families and       businesses. The project is estimated to provide up to 160,000       barrels of American oil per day at peak production; $10       billion in revenue for state, local, and federal governments       during its lifespan; 2,000 construction jobs, and 300       permanent jobs.        Following last week's announcement, a wide array of       Alaskans joined Senator Murkowski in voicing their continued       strong support for the Willow project and thanking her for       her longstanding advocacy of it. Murkowski encourages all       Alaskans to weigh in, in favor of Willow's final approval,       through BLM's 45-day public comment process.                           WHAT ALASKANS ARE SAYIN         ``RDC welcomed the news of the release of the Bureau of       Land Management's (BLM) draft supplemental environmental       impact statement for the Willow project,'' said Leila       Kimbrell, Executive Director for the Resource Development       Council for Alaska. ``After a delay to the project because of       an August 2021 court decision, RDC is pleased to see the       draft SEIS released in time to keep a winter construction       season and we thank Senator Murkowski for keeping pressure on       the administration to put this project back on track. We know       this will be a responsibly developed project, having already       undergone a rigorous multiyear environmental review. It's       time to move forward with a responsible domestic energy       project that will create thousands of jobs, generate tens of       billions of dollars, and strengthen our energy       independence.''        ``The Willow Project is critical to the economic well-being       of our region's eight Inupiat villages. Every delay in the       project also delays the economic, infrastructure and       employment benefits the project will bring to North Slope       communities and our people. ASRC extends our gratitude to       Senator Murkowski, Senator Sullivan and the late Congressman       Don Young for their unwavering commitment to moving the       Willow Project forward,'' said Rex A. Rock, Sr., President       and CEO of Arctic Slope Regional Corporation.        ``Thanks to Senator Murkowski for fighting for what is good       for Alaska and America; more domestic oil in the pipeline,       good jobs that support a family and lower fuel costs in our       future. Once again, Lisa gets it done. Alaskans should be so       proud of this tireless fighter for our state,'' said Joelle       Hall, President of Alaska AFL-CIO.        ``ConocoPhillips and many stakeholders, including residents       of the North Slope and across Alaska are committed to the       Willow project as it will supply much needed energy for the       United States, while serving as a strong example of       environmentally and socially responsible development that       offers extensive public benefits. The Willow project has       undergone an extensive and rigorous multi-year environmental       analysis, including extensive baseline scientific studies.       The project will also create employment opportunities for       union labor and contribute local tax revenue that benefit       communities on the North Slope, as well as significant state       and federal tax revenue for many years. ConocoPhillips thanks       the Alaska Congressional Delegation--Senators Murkowski and       Sullivan, and the late Congressman Young--for their       tremendous efforts in advocating for the Willow project,''       said Erec Isaacson, President of ConocoPhillips Alaska.        ``Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope supports the       development of the Willow Project. Responsible development       for our region will provide infrastructure, jobs and economic       growth for our tribal members. ICAS is pleased with the       environmental reviews that took place to ensure safe       development,'' said Morrie Lemen, Jr., Executive Director of       the Inupiat Community of The Arctic Slope.        ``The desperate need for the Willow project could not come       at a more critical juncture in time. Alaskans and Americans       across the country are paying record high energy prices,       while the more than 20 year struggle to get the Willow       project developed serves as a chilling reminder that what       stands between Americans and lower energy prices is nothing       but bureaucratic red tape. Meanwhile, this vital project that       can drive energy abundance, is tucked away in the NPR-A       because government can't get out of the way. We appreciate       Senator Murkowski's tenacity on this issue and we look       forward to working with her to rollback despotic       environmental regulations,'' said Bernadette Wilson, State       Director of Americans for Prosperity Alaska.        ``Energy security is vital to our country. Alaska has a       critical role and ability to provide needed energy. Among the       whole array of energy options, the Willow project can be a       shining example of success,'' said Julie Kitka, President of       the Alaska Federation of Natives.        ``The release of the draft environmental review for the       Willow project comes at a critical time for Alaska and the       nation. Along with the majority of Alaskans, the Alaska       Chamber is a steadfast supporter of responsible development       projects that provide jobs, economic opportunity, and       increased revenue to state, local, and federal governments.       Now, more than ever, the United States needs to increase       domestic energy supply and enact and defend sound policy that       encourages development of our natural resources at home. The       Chamber thanks Senators Murkowski and Sullivan for their       persistence in keeping the Willow project at the forefront of       the discussion with the Biden Administration and ensuring the       project receives due process,'' said Kati Capozzi, President       and CEO of the Alaska Chamber of Commerce.        ``Through the North Slope Borough permitting process we       exercise zoning and other oversight that has--in partnership       with the State and Fed's--led to some of the strictest       environmental regulations in our nation and one of the best       examples of responsible development in the world. Senator       Murkowski knows this and was a champion for our region on       endeavors like the Willow project. Willow will not only lead       to jobs, but better schools, health clinics, and       transportation infrastructure and we can't thank the Senator       enough for continuing to fight for the region and the       State,'' said D.J. Fauske, Director of Government and       External Affairs for the North Slope Borough.        ``It is encouraging to see the Bureau of Land Management       release the revised draft environmental review of       ConocoPhillips' proposed Willow Master Development Plan in       the National Petroleum Reserve, or NPR-A. AOGA and its allies       will be fully engaged in the public meetings to come, and we       encourage all Alaskans to learn more about the project's       benefits and participate as the process moves forward. Willow       represents a near-term opportunity to help return the United       States to energy independence at a time when our country       desperately needs more domestic sources of oil and gas. Of       course, a project the size of Willow will also boost Alaska's       economy, creating job opportunities and providing tax       revenues to state, local, and federal governments. Alaskans       have long supported development of our oil and gas resources.       Now is the time to speak up and let the federal government       know how those of us who call Alaska home feel about  [[Page S3316]]       projects like Willow: no one cares more about protecting our       environment or safely developing Alaska's resources than       Alaskans. Alaskans who want to be a part of this significant       step forward have a 45-day comment period to make their       voices heard,'' said Kara Moriarty, President and CEO of the       Alaska Oil and Gas Association.        ``The Willow project represents a valid compliment to       rising energy needs while contributing to the health, well-      being, security and self-determination of the region, state       and country. Regulatory process would be better served by       more effective implementation of process and less evaluation       by political trends,'' said Douglas Whiteman, Mayor of the       City of Atqasuk on the North Slope.     Madam President, Alaskans Voice Strong Support for the  Willow Project. She has a huge list of Alaskan Native groups and others  who are supporting the Willow Project.   I ask unanimous consent that the AFN letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                   Alaska Federation of Natives,                                                  February 23, 2022.      Re AFN Continued Support for the Willow Project.       Hon. Debra Haaland,      Department of the Interior.        Dear Secretary Haaland: On behalf of the Co-Chairs and       Board of Directors of the Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN),       I write to share our long-standing support for the Alaska       Willow Project in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPR-      A).        The Willow Project has undergone stringent environmental       permitting and a vigorous community engagement process. It       was planned based on the requirements of the 2013 NPR-A       Integrated Activity Plan under the Obama-Biden Administration       and Secretary Salazar with the highest standards for       environmental stewardship. The permitting and environmental       review process encompassed a period of well over two years       and included multiple rounds of public comment and public       meetings with Alaska Native stakeholders. AFN appreciates the       outreach and communication between ConocoPhillips and the       Alaska Native community and considers the process a model for       other development initiatives.        AFN understands that the need for a proactive whole of       government approach to deal with climate change; however       fossil fuels will be with us for quite some time to come, and       projects like Willow can help bridge the gap. As such,       delaying Willow any further will only hinder Alaska's       economic recovery. The Willow Project could jumpstart our       economy with thousands of jobs and be a model in community       and environmental stewardship for future opportunities.        Additionally, the international crisis in Ukraine       highlights the Willow Project's importance to our national       security. The looming invasion of Ukraine by Russia is       already stressing global energy markets. The Willow Project       is a critical opportunity for the U.S. to expand domestic       energy supplies and security while creating economic       opportunities to help Alaska recover from the pandemic. As       such, I strongly urge you to support the current record of       decision and allow the Willow Project to move forward as       planned and previously approved.        Thank you for your consideration. If you have questions,       please feel free to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                       Julie Kitka,                                                         President.     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the ANCSA  Regional Association letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   February 4, 2021.      Hon. Deb Haaland,      Secretary Nominee, Department of the Interior,      Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Nominee Haaland: The ANCSA Regional       Association (ARA) represents the twelve Regional Corporations       created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA)       which was approved by Congress and signed into law by       President Nixon in 1971. The Alaska Native Village       Corporation Association (ANVCA) represents 177 village and       urban corporations created by ANCSA. Together these       organizations represent over 150,000 Alaska Native       shareholders.        We write today to urge the Department of Interior not to       delay the ConocoPhillips Alaska Willow Project given the       exhaustive and thorough review process it has already       undergone, and the urgent need for vetted, economic       opportunities for safe development in Alaska.        ARA and ANVCA strongly support responsible resource       development in Alaska and are concerned about reports that       the DOI intends to, once again, review the EIS Record of       Decision (ROD) for Willow, which could delay or defer the       project's progress.        There is no basis for further review of the ROD, given the       extensive record of public hearings, documented BLM efforts       to address all issues raised through public comment,       completion of an in-depth environmental analysis, and the       over 270 stipulations and best management practices the       project will be required to follow. The Willow EIS was       performed under the rigorous process in place during the       Obama Administration, and was not expedited or granted any       special consideration. The EIS took more than two years to       complete and the report itself totals more than 2,600 pages       of in-depth analysis. Given the extensive nature of the       process used to perform the Willow EIS, we request that the       Department of Interior not delay the Willow project for       further unnecessary analysis, or political rhetoric.        The State of Alaska has been in recession for over five       years, well before the COVID pandemic hit, which then caused       further negative impacts in every industry important to our       state. The federal government should be looking at       opportunities to help Alaska respond to these impacts rather       than exacerbating them. Delaying a project like Willow, which       has already passed a rigorous EIS process, will cause ripple       effects throughout the Alaskan economy. This project will       support over 2,000 construction jobs and hundreds of long-      term jobs, while providing over $2 billion in revenues to the       State of Alaska and $7.6 billion in federal royalties. For       context, $2 billion is roughly the size of the current budget       deficit faced by our state. Revenues received by this project       allows our rural communities to receive continued support to       schools, health clinics and basic public services like water       and sewer treatments.        The Willow Project has passed every environmental and       community test put before it and would provide a much-needed       economic boost to Alaska. Delaying it any further will only       bring more harm to our state. It also harms the economy and       budget of the North Slope Borough, the local government most       closely impacted by the federal government's decision for       review.            Best Regards,      Kim Reitmeier,        Executive Director, ARA.      Hallie Bissett,        Executive Director, ANVCA.     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the ICAS  Community of the Arctic Slope be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   January 26, 2022.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Chairman Grijalva: It has come to our attention that you       are considering sending a letter to Secretary of the Interior       Deb Haaland opposing the Willow Project, a project located in       our region of Alaska. In your position as Chairman of the       House Natural Resources Committee, a committee that has       jurisdiction on issues related to the Indigenous Peoples of       the United States, we respectfully request that you meet with       and listen to the indigenous people of the North Slope of       Alaska before you take a position on the Willow Project.        The Inupiat of the North Slope have lived in the Arctic for       over 10,000 years. We are proud of our self-determination       efforts to ensure future generations of Inupiat continue to       reside in our communities and have access to essential       services. Without a stable economy, our communities will       suffer and so too will our ability to engage in Inupiat       cultural traditions, including a subsistence way of life.        The North Slope of Alaska spans an area nearly the size of       the state of Minnesota and within that expansive area, there       are eight Inupiat communities--Anaktuvuk Pass, Atqasuk,       Kaktovik, Nuiqsut, Point Hope, Point Lay, Utqiagvik and       Wainwright. None of our communities are accessible by road;       all supplies must be flown or barged in making the cost of       living extremely high, and economic opportunity generally       low. Our North Slope residents are keenly aware that advances       in our communities--running water, local schools, health       care, public safety, electricity, and more have come as a       result of the coordination and cooperation of Alaska Native       leaders and entities across the region.        As you know, fifty years ago, the Federal Government       directed Alaska Native people to organize in a new structure       of indigenous representation. The Alaska Native Claims       Settlement Act of 1971, commonly referred to as ANCSA, was a       dramatically different approach by the Federal Government to       Federal Indian policy Unlike the Lower 48 model of indigenous       representation that typically has a central entity on the       reservation, the Tribe, that administers the delivery of       services like healthcare, public safety, education, land       management and economic development to name a few, the       passage of ANCSA created a fragmented system of Alaska Native       representation and delivery of services.        Our region has a multitude of Alaska Native entities that       work together to effectively serve, provide for and enrich       the lives of the Inupiat people we represent. Our three       entities, the Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope (ICAS),       the North Slope Borough  [[Page S3317]]       (Borough) and Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC) are       three of those entities. While our roles are defined, our       constituencies overlap which is why we work closely together       to protect the cultural and economic interests of the North       Slope Inupiat.        Established in 1971, the Inupiat Community of the Arctic       Slope is a federally recognized regional tribal government       for the North Slope and represents over 13,000 Inupiat tribal       members. The mission of ICAS is to exercise its sovereign       rights and powers for the benefit of tribal members, to       conserve and retain tribal lands and resources including       subsistence and environmental issues, to establish and carry       out justice systems including social services under Inupiat       tribal law and custom, and to increase the variety and       quality of services provided to current tribal members and       for our future generations.        The North Slope Borough is a home rule government located       above the Arctic Circle that represents the roughly 10,000       residents in the eight communities of the region. The       Borough's jurisdiction includes the entire National Petroleum       Reserve--Alaska (NPR-A) and the villages within it--Nuiqsut,       Atqasuk, Utqiagvik, and Wainwright. In 1972, the Inupiat       people of the North Slope formed the Borough to ensure our       communities would benefit from oil and gas development on       their ancestral homelands. It was the first time Native       Americans took control of their destiny through the use of a       municipal government. The Borough exercises its powers of       taxation, property assessment, education, and planning and       zoning services. Taxes levied on oil and gas infrastructure       have enabled the Borough to invest in public infrastructure       and utilities, support education, and provide police, fire,       emergency and other services. Elsewhere in rural Alaska,       these services are typically provided by the state or federal       governments.        Arctic Slope Regional Corporation was incorporated pursuant       to the passage of ANCSA. ASRC is owned by and represents the       business interests of our approximately 13,000 Inupiat       shareholders, many of whom reside in the eight communities on       the North Slope. ANCSA extinguished aboriginal land title and       conveyed nearly five million acres of fee-simple land to ASRC       for the cultural and economic benefit of our Inupiat       shareholders. Mandated by Congress to not only operate as a       for-profit corporation but to serve the social and welfare       interests of the people it represents, ASRC is committed to       providing financial returns to our Inupiat shareholders in       the form of jobs and dividends, and to preserving Inupiat       culture and traditions.        Over the decades, and even more so today, we have seen       national environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs)       attempt to wear the mantle of protectors of Indigenous       interests in the U.S. Arctic--something that we, as elected       and appointed leaders of the Inupiat people of the North       Slope, find unacceptable. ENGO's continue to push a false       narrative to advance their agendas at the expense of the       Indigenous people and communities of the North Slope.        To fully embrace the Biden Administration's priorities of       racial equity, environmental justice and supporting       underserved communities, leaders must take the time to listen       to those they are aiming to serve, even if their perspective       may not fit the political narrative being pushed on a       national level.        We understand that your proposed letter not only requests       Secretary Haaland oppose the Willow Project, but it calls for       terminating the project in order to protect the resources       that support Indigenous communities. The Administration       cannot proclaim to support meaningful tribal consultation and       environmental justice while at the same time killing a       critical resource that supports our regional economy and the       Inupiat communities of the North Slope region. If the       contents of your proposed letter are true, this would be       highly offensive to our region's leadership.        ICAS, the Borough and ASRC support the development of the       Willow Project. Our region has a fifty-year relationship with       the oil and gas industry, which came as a result of the       Federal Government's desire to develop oil and gas resources       on our ancestral homelands. While initially wary of any       development on our lands, through open communication and       transparency in planning and Inupiat ingenuity, our       relationship with the oil and gas industry has turned into a       partnership. A partnership that has brought significant       economic benefits to the region that would have otherwise       been absent. The entities that represent the North Slope       Inupiat play an active role in oil and gas development       projects that take place in our region. Our region has shown       that responsible development and the continuation of our       Inupiat cultural traditions, including subsistence       activities, can effectively coexist while also providing the       means to deliver modern-day essential services such as police       and fire protection, pre-K-12 education and water and sewer       infrastructure (which again, are largely made possible       through responsible development of oil and gas resources on       our lands).        If you are truly concerned about curbing oil and gas       development, examine the massive imports of Russian oil       coming into the West Coast of the United States and also ask       why the Biden Administration has recently called for OPEC to       produce more overseas developed oil to stave off Russian       aggression in Ukraine. None of these countries have the same       stringent rules and regulations imposed on oil and gas       companies that operate in the U.S., including in our region       of Alaska. The North Slope region has developed our oil and       gas resources safely and for the direct benefit of our       Inupiat community and the nation.        We would be grateful and honored to have the opportunity to       meet with you on this topic and ask that you consider meeting       with us before sending a letter that does not align with the       interests of the Inupiat of the North Slope of Alaska.        If there are any questions we can answer for you or your       staff, or to schedule a time to meet please contact Bridget       Anderson, ASRC's Vice President External Affairs.            Sincerely,      George Edwardson,        President,        Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope.      Harry K. Brower, Jr.,        Mayor,        North Slope Borough.      Rex A. Rock. Sr.,        President and CEO,        Arctic Slope Regional Corporation.     Madam President, so here is my point: The next time the  media writes a big story on Willow and environmental justice and racial  equity--which they love to do--and Alaska, they need to include this.  This is the truth. They need to include the strong union support.   Go talk to the laborers, go talk to the building trades, go talk to  Sean McGarvey, Terry O'Sullivan. See what they think about Willow.   There is one group that doesn't like Willow. It is the same group  that doesn't like anything in America. It is the radical far-left  environmental groups that are trying to shut down my State and keep  Native Americans, Native Alaskans, impoverished in Alaska. I am not  going to let that happen.   Here is one final thing. It is funny, not funny--Amusing, not  amusing. Again, this is really important. This is about life and death.   You have all these stories about Willow in the national media, but  what really, really kind of burns me up is there is a story--you know,  they talk about the climate bomb, whatever the heck that means; it is  not factual. But the one story I never see about Federal lands--real  big increases in oil and gas production, real big increases in  emissions--that never gets written about, again for our friends in the  media--never--is what is going on in New Mexico, what is going on in  New Mexico.   Well, we know some of the Members, the senior Senator from New  Mexico, he loves to come after Alaska projects; I don't know why. Shut  them down. Maybe to divert the media's attention from what is going on  in his State. But I just want to give a couple stats.   Since 2019, New Mexico has increased production in its oil production  by 700,000 barrels a day. It is pretty impressive. They were at 800,000  barrels; they have increased by almost 700,000. They have increased  more than Alaska even produces in 3 years.   It is now the second largest oil producer in the country. The senior  Senator from New Mexico recently bragged that is up 400 percent. OK.  Good for him.   It is still amazing to me; he comes down here a lot, writes letters  to try to shut down my State. But, whatever, I don't go after New  Mexico. But I do want our friends in the media to just kind of ask the  questions. Boy, oh, boy, you want to talk about climate bomb: 700,000  barrels a day. They have more carbon emissions than Alaska by far.  Nobody is writing that story. But it is also how we do our  environmental standards in different States. My State has the highest  standards in the world on energy production--New Mexico, not so much.   Let me just give you a couple of examples: The average well in Alaska  is 28,000 barrels a day because it is conventional. We are actually-- the resource is so rich there, we are not fracking like they do in the  unconventional area. The average well in New Mexico produces 100  barrels--a hundred barrels to 28,000. So what does that mean? You have  to drill 280 wells in New Mexico just to reach the equivalent of one in  Alaska.   So the environmental footprint is much bigger. The carbon emission is  much bigger. New Mexico flares its gas. We reinject our gas--again,  highest environmental standards in the world.   We conduct our exploration and drilling activities only in the  winter. You have to build ice roads, ice pads. Zero impact. I used to  be in charge of this.  [[Page S3318]]    It is very expensive to do that. One little drop of anything--chewing  tobacco--on the tundra, you have to report it. So where is the story  about what is going on there?   Where is the carbon bomb story on New Mexico? Where is the story that  the Secretary of the Interior has directed almost half the Federal  permits to drill in the country to one State? Do you think it is  Alaska? No way. They are trying to shut us down.   You think it is Texas? Nope. North Dakota? Nope. It is New Mexico.  Golly gee, isn't that interesting?   I sure hope--look, it is terribly suspicious from my perspective that  one State has received more Federal energy permits in the last 15  months than all other States in America combined. The Secretary of the  Interior is from New
