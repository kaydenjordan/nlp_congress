 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the American farmer and  to deliver the 15th installment of my farm bill impact series.   The United States is the most food-secure country in the world thanks  to the strength and determination of American farmers, ranchers, and  agriculture producers. With America's robust resources, we have been  committed to ensuring food security at home and around the world, and  Kansas has been on the cutting edge of that effort for nearly a  century.   In September of 1953, Peter O'Brien, a farmer from Cheyenne County,  Kansas, stood up at his local county farm bureau meeting to share an  idea. He wanted to use Kansas grain to help hungry people around the  world. Over the next several months, today's Food for Peace program was  crafted. The following year, one of Kansas' favorite sons, President  Dwight D. Eisenhower, signed parts of the program into law. That was  the beginning of what is now a longstanding Kansas tradition of  commitment, care, and leadership in the international effort to address  global hunger.   Two weeks ago, I hosted David Beasley, the executive director of the  World Food Programme, in Kansas for an event to thank the American  farmer. Executive Director Beasley had just been in Egypt, Ethiopia,  and Rome, but he came to Kansas because he understands the impact that  farmers in my  [[Page H8513]]  State have had on international food aid. American farmers use their  resources to feed, fuel, and clothe the world, which is no small task.  It takes grit, determination, and a strong partnership between the  public and private sectors. The World Food Programme won the Nobel  Peace Prize in 2020, and it is the world's largest humanitarian  organization specializing in using American-grown commodities for  international food assistance. It is a great example of what we can  accomplish when public-private partnerships thrive.   Now, with the 2023 reauthorization of the farm bill upon us, we see  that the Kansas legacy of international food aid is alive and well.  Today, our country administers in-kind food assistance primarily  through farm bill programs, such as the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust  and the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program, just to name two.  These programs have an especially strong return on investment because  they support American agriculture producers today while greatly  reducing the need for conflict or war-related dollars tomorrow. In the  long run, these programs save the American taxpayer money. We know that  when food rations are accessible in developing countries, conflict  decreases. International food aid is, therefore, a way to stop wars  before they start.   I have the privilege and responsibility of advocating for Kansas' top  priorities in the farm bill. That means protecting crop insurance,  promoting trade, and ensuring that any oversight within the bill  doesn't needlessly handcuff American producers with red tape. Congress  must also ensure that international food aid programs remain strong in  the farm bill. Around the world today, hungry people facing starvation  in emergency situations rely on American farmers, who have provided  nutrition in the place of starvation, created careers of dignity in the  place of aimlessness, and secured peace in the place of war.   I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within  the bill that I believe Congress must understand and support to ensure  that agriculture thrives in America. The people who feed, fuel, and  clothe us all deserve our unwavering support.                            ____________________
