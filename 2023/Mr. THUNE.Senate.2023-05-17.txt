 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week is National Police Week, which is  a time set aside to honor the service of our Nation's law enforcement  officers, to show appreciation for the sacrifices they make to keep our  communities safe, and to pay tribute to those who have made the  ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.   Being a police officer is no easy task. An ordinary day for the men  and women in blue takes extraordinary character. It takes courage to  run toward danger, to take on the unknown. But if you ask a police  officer, he or she will usually say: It's just part of the job.   That job is a vital one.   I am profoundly grateful to the brave Americans who step up to  protect and serve in my State of South Dakota, in Washington, DC, where  the U.S. Capitol Police work to keep us, our staff, and our  constituents safe, and around the country.   There is no denying that law enforcement is a dangerous job. Police  officers face threats and confront suffering on a daily basis, and many  officers bear the visible and invisible wounds of their job. Some  officers make the ultimate sacrifice--laying down their lives to  protect their fellow citizens.   This year's National Police Week resolution honors the memory of the  443 law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty last  year as well as the 32 lost to date this year. And my thoughts and  prayers go out to their families and to their fellow officers.   Being a police officer has never been easy. Over the last few years,  however, steady criticism and vilification and the enduring ``defund  the police'' movement have made the job a lot harder and taken a  noticeable toll on morale.   Police retirements and resignations are up around the country, and  there aren't enough applicants to fill available openings. The police  department in Asheville, NC, is down 40 percent of its budgeted  positions. Cleveland, OH, has its smallest police academy class in 25  years--just nine recruits. And here in Washington, DC, the Metropolitan  Police Department has fewer officers than at any time in the last 25  years.   Meanwhile, crime continues to surge around the country. Here in DC,  violent crime is up 13 percent from the same time last year, and  property crime is up 30 percent over the same period. In Philadelphia,  retail and auto theft are surging. As one article recently noted, small  business owners are hoping the next mayor will make public safety a top  priority. Meanwhile, in Chicago, crime is up 42 percent compared to the  same time last year, driven, in part, by a staggering 131-percent  increase in motor vehicle theft. And the list goes on.   Surging crime is almost unquestionably being aggravated by the rise  of big city prosecutors who seem uninterested in actually prosecuting  crimes. Philadelphia's district attorney, for example, actually  campaigned on a platform of prosecuting fewer crimes. And then there is  the U.S. attorney for Washington, DC, who declined to prosecute two- thirds of arrests last year--two-thirds. DC police data say the average  homicide suspect has been arrested 11 times before he or she commits a  murder--11 times. Think about that.   Congress has the legal authority to block DC ordinances thanks to  Federal legislation rooted in the Constitution which gives Congress  legislative jurisdiction over the seat of the U.S. Government. When, in  the face of a crime surge, the DC City Council passed a law weakening  penalties for a number of crimes, Congress intervened and successfully  blocked the bill. And, yesterday, the Senate successfully passed  Senator Vance's legislation to block another DC City Council measure--a  measure that would make it more difficult for police officers to do  their jobs and could lead to the targeting of individual officers.   Between soft-on-crime policies and prosecutors and antipolice  rhetoric--too often amplified or accommodated by members of the  Democratic Party--it has been a difficult few years for police  officers.   The Biden administration has presented yet another challenge for law  enforcement--the crisis at our southern border that has raged for the  past 2 years thanks to the President's refusal to take border security  seriously. There have been a staggering 5 million attempted illegal  crossings of our southern border during the Biden administration, an  average of 6,300-some individuals per day, and that doesn't even count  the so-called got-aways, who are individuals the Border Patrol saw but  was unable to apprehend. And those numbers got even worse last week as  the Biden administration prepared to lift pandemic-era title 42  authorities, which allowed the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to  quickly turn back at least some individuals at the border.   Our Border Patrol agents and our Nation's border communities are  overwhelmed. Border Patrol agents in San Diego, last week, arrested an  Afghan national on the FBI's terror watch list, underscoring that the  immigration crisis directly affects our national security and public  safety.   Cross-border illegal activity is making life difficult for law  enforcement agencies around the country. I have talked to sheriffs in  South Dakota--about as far from our southern border as you can get--who  are dealing with fentanyl that has been trafficked across the border  from Mexico.   Last year, Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead estimated that 90  percent of fentanyl and meth in our State comes through Mexico, and  that trafficking is undoubtedly being facilitated by the chaos at our  southern border.   Despite the many challenges they face, particularly over the past few  years, law enforcement officials and officers continue working around  the clock to keep our communities and our country safe.   This week and every week, we need to honor their service and remember  their sacrifices. And this week and every week, we need to do the work  of ensuring that our laws and policies support our Nation's law  enforcement officers and their jobs, that our men and women in blue  have the tools and resources they need to enforce the law, and that  misguided policies don't endanger our officers and stand in the way of  public safety.

Madam President, today I recognize Gettysburg, SD,  which will  [[Page S1703]]  celebrate its quadridecacentennial on June 23-25, 2023. Gettysburg will  host many special events, including a parade, vendor fair, car show,  flag ceremony, banquet, and street dance.   Gettysburg is nestled in the middle of the breathtaking prairie,  approximately 15 miles from the mighty Missouri River in central South  Dakota. It has long been known as a tightknit agricultural community  with more than 1,100 residents, including many vibrant businesses and a  newly built hospital. Its nationally awarded school district is home to  the famous Potter County Battlers, although the phrase that is often  used is that these Battlers are from the ``Gettysburg where the battle  was not.'' Since its beginning 140 years ago, the community of  Gettysburg continues to serve as a strong example of South Dakota  values and traditions. Like countless other South Dakota towns, you  will find many neighbors coming together to lend a helping hand and  provide support for each other.   I offer my congratulations to the citizens of Gettysburg on the  quadridecacentennial celebration and wish them continued prosperity in  the years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
