 Mr. Chairman, I want to first thank my friend from Kentucky  for his leadership on this bill. The THRIVE Act is an important piece  of legislation, and I am proud to cosponsor it.   The National Institute on Drug Abuse has found that we lose about 115  Americans each and every day to the opioid crisis. These are our  brothers, our sisters, our friends, and our coworkers. This is a  national crisis, and inaction just won't change a single thing.   I have met with a number of people back home who told me that we need  to think about more than just the prevention and the treatment stage of  the opioid crisis, and they are exactly right.   When you hear people tell me this, it reminds me of a conversation I  had recently with David Kessler, who lives in my district and started  an organization called GRIP It based in Mocksville. Group classes, one- on-one coaching, and assistance with detox programs are just three of  the things that this group offers.   David has found evidence of a ``cultural method'' that works, and it  goes to show us that there are many different things that we could be  trying.                                time  1400    This brings me to the bill that we are voting on today, the THRIVE  Act, which is part and parcel of this approach. It would expand housing  options for individuals who are transitioning out of addiction  treatments and require continued support.   This is exactly the kind of policy that we need to be considering.  Housing is part of a foundation that helps former addicts get off the  streets and into a place that they can rise above poverty and  addiction.   Mr. Chairman, I want to make a larger point on this issue before I  close. There has always been and still is a stigma around drug  addiction. But if we want to make real progress on battling this  epidemic, we need to change the way we look at those who are suffering.  Rather than seeing them as liabilities, we need to see them as assets.   The THRIVE Act, by helping people transition from recovery to a home,  [[Page H5178]]  will do just that. And when they have a home, they will be more likely  to get a job and get back to being a contributing member of society.   Bold ideas are needed in the public space, and there is no doubt that  Mr. Barr's bill falls into this category.   I think Ronald Reagan said it best when he said: ``That what is right  will always eventually triumph. And there's purpose and worth to each  and every life.''
