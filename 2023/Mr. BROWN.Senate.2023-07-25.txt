 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize longtime friend  Amy Kaplan, who retired this month after a long career of service.   For the past 17 years, Amy has led the Jewish Federation of Cleveland  as the vice president of external affairs. She has been a staunch  advocate for Cleveland's vibrant Jewish community on a range of issues.   I was speaking to the Ambassador from Israel today, Ambassador  Herzog, about the vibrancy and the reach of the Cleveland Jewish  community; how proud I was to have interacted with them for so many  years.   Amy, herself, followed in her parents' footsteps when she joined the  Federation. Her mother was a staff member, and her father volunteered  there often. Amy shares their commitment to their community and to  their faith.   Her work has made a difference for so many Clevelanders in the  communities the Federation serves--those who are too often overlooked  and those who too often don't have a voice in our government.   She has worked with me and my staff to combat anti-Semitism,  strengthen Federal resources for our seniors, and to protect Medicaid  from cuts. She led advocacy efforts on bail reform, voting rights, and  gun violence, and oversees the Federation's community relations work.   Amy has ensured that the issues most important to the Cleveland  Jewish community are on the agenda.   She has been recognized over and over for her dedication to the  community. She was named a ``Difference Maker'' by the Cleveland Jewish  News, and she did it while caring for a family.   I hope in retirement, Amy will get to spend even more time with her  husband Ira and their children and grandchildren.   Amy will be missed at the Federation. I am confident this won't be  the end of her work with the Jewish community and won't be the end of  her positive impact on Northeast Ohio.   In his letter from the Birmingham jail, Dr. King wrote:         Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability.    Now, those were Dr. King's words, I would add, Progress rolls in  because of advocates and activists like Amy Kaplan who listen, who  learn, who work with communities to make a difference.   Congratulations, Amy, on your well-earned retirement. Thank you,  again, for your service to our community and to our State and wish you  the best in your retirement. We look forward to working with your team  to keep pushing for these important priorities and to make sure that  Cleveland's and all of Ohio's Jewish community continues to have a  voice in our government.   I yield the floor.
