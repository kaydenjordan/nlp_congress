 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize National Teach Ag Day.   National Teach Ag Day is for anyone who wants to celebrate school- based agricultural education, share the story of agriculture  education's importance and effectiveness in the United States, and  encourage students to consider careers as agricultural educators.   This year, we are celebrating 75 years of the National Association of  Agricultural Educators.   Madam Speaker, our agricultural educators are responsible for  cultivating and inspiring the next generation of agricultural leaders.  This happens in the classroom with extension programs or groups like  FFA and 4-H. By recognizing our agricultural educators, we can ensure  our students have knowledge and exposure to all the opportunities the  agricultural industry and sector have to offer.   Madam Speaker, I thank all the ag teachers and volunteers across the  country who help support our Nation's farmers, ranchers, foresters, and  producers.                            ____________________
