 Madam Chair, first, I am a proud cosponsor of  Representative Lipinski's amendment, which would direct an increase of  $15 million to Argonne National Laboratory's Leadership Computing  Facility.   The ALCF is a national scientific user facility that provides  supercomputing resources and expertise to the scientific and  engineering community to accelerate the pace of discovery and  innovation in a broad range of disciplines. This money will be well  spent.   A second amendment, offered by myself, instructs the National  Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to include  accelerator-driven systems in its evaluation of future nuclear  technology and fuel.   There is a bipartisan and bicameral interest in accelerating  investment in advanced nuclear reactors, which are walkaway safe and  proliferation-resistant and have the potential to burn or minimize  nuclear waste.   One proposed system uses a proton accelerator, a neutron spallation  target, and molten salt fuel, but it remains subcritical, thereby  greatly reducing the safety and security risks.   It can, without redesign, burn spent nuclear fuel, natural uranium,  thorium, or surplus weapons material, such as surplus plutonium. It  operates without the need for enrichment or reprocessing and may be  used to produce the tritium needed to maintain our stockpile.   Madam Chair, I thank my colleagues for their support.
