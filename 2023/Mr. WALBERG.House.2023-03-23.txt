 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the  Parents Bill of Rights Act. I thank Representative Letlow and Chair  Foxx for their leadership in defending the God-given rights of parents  and protecting kids as well.   Parental involvement in their children's education is paramount to a  student's success. However, in recent years, we have seen a push by  some to exclude parents from their children's education. This is why I  recently introduced the PROTECT Kids Act with Senator Tim Scott which  has been included as an amendment to H.R. 5.   The PROTECT Kids Act would require any Department of Education-funded  elementary or middle school to seek and acquire parental consent before  changing their child's pronouns or preferred name on any school form.   This provision is straightforward, common sense, and will safeguard  the critical relationship between parents, schools, and children.   When a child goes on a field trip or fails a test, their parents are  told and are often required to sign an acknowledgment or a permission  slip.   Why should relatively small things require notification but something  as significant as a child's pronouns or a change in accommodations can  be withheld from the people who raise and love them?   Recent polling shows this has the broad support of the American  people. Three-quarters of Americans believe schools should be required  to obtain consent from parents.   Parents have a fundamental right to raise and educate their children  how they choose. We must pass the Parents Bill of Rights Act to help  mitigate issues we have seen nationwide and to support parents who need  the support to do right by their kids as well.   On this side of the aisle, we believe this is the right way to go,  and we believe that in the end it will promote education, family, and  individualism as well.
