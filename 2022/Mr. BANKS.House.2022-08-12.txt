 Madam Speaker, yesterday, many of us celebrated the life  of Jackie Walorski at the funeral in her district. Today, we honor her  life on the floor of the House of Representatives, where she served for  nearly a decade.   Jackie was a giant in Indiana politics, and she had a giant impact  here in this institution, as well. Her lifetime of public service will  be long-remembered, from her time on the mission field in Romania, to  her time at the Indiana Statehouse, to the time that she spent serving  our Nation here with all of us.   She embodied public service and putting others before herself. Her  legacy, fighting for the unborn, for our veterans, and for the poor and  disabled, is a legacy that we will honor here for a long time to come.   We also honor the lives of Zachery Potts and Emma Thomson, two  staffers who should remind all of us of the sacrifices that our staffs  make to serve each of us in our important roles.   I also want to say to the family of Edith Schmucker, who was involved  in this tragedy as well, that we honor her life, the life of your loved  ones, as well.   Tragedies like this one remind us of how fleeting and fragile our  lives really are. But Jackie's life reminds us that we should live it  to the fullest, just as she did, and that is how we can honor her best.                            ____________________
