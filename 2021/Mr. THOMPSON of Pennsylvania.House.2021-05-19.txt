 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank  our men and women in uniform and remember those who gave their life for  this country.   The month of May is recognized as Military Appreciation Month, and we  have several days dedicated to honoring our servicemen and -women, as  well as their families.   May 7 is Military Spouse Appreciation Day. May 8 is Victory in Europe  Day, marking the end of World War II in Europe. May 15 is Armed  Services Day, where we thank Active Duty members from all branches of  the military.                                time  1130    But on the last day of May, we have our most solemn occasion,  Memorial Day, where we mourn those whom we lost in defense of this  Nation.   The tradition of Memorial Day dates back to 1864 in Boalsburg,  Pennsylvania. Three ladies decorated the graves of fallen Civil War  soldiers, and the custom has continued every year since then. Boalsburg  still puts on a traditional Memorial Day celebration, complete with a  parade, a community walk to the cemetery, speeches, military  reenactments, and much more.   In the days leading up to Memorial Day, many place flags or lay  wreaths at the graves of our soldiers. We gather with friends and  family to attend parades and special services to remember those lost.   As we take the time to thank our Active Duty members and remember the  fallen, we must also never forget the soldiers who have not returned  home.   As the father of a wounded warrior, I thank God every day he returned  home safely. Not every family has been as lucky, and we owe our  greatest efforts to recovering the brave men and women who made the  ultimate sacrifice for our country.  [[Page H2557]]    Currently, there are more than 80,000 American servicemembers who  remain unaccounted for, from World War II, the Korean war, the Vietnam  war, the Cold War, and the gulf wars. We must uphold our promise to our  POW/MIA who made the ultimate sacrifice and work to return these  members home to their families.   That is why today I am introducing the Prisoners of War and Missing  in Action Trade Agreement Resolution. As we develop trade ties in  regions where servicemembers once engaged in combat, we must make every  effort to guarantee these countries are active participants in aiding  in the recovery of our fallen soldiers. While several of these nations  have worked to assist in the research and recovery efforts, many  challenges still exist.   This resolution ensures that as we enter mutually beneficial trade  agreements, our trade partners will commit to the research and recovery  efforts of our Nation's missing servicemembers.   In addition, it also sends a message to the families of those who are  still waiting for their loved ones to return home. The United States  will uphold the eternal promise to our Armed Forces to always bring our  men and women home.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution,  especially in advance of Memorial Day weekend. As Memorial Day  approaches and we make plans to see family and friends and to attend  services and parades, let us remember that our freedom is not free and  we owe thanks to those who died in sacrifice.   May God bless them, and may God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize May as National Foster Care Month and to say thank you to  every parent, volunteer, and mentor who work with our foster children.   I am a proud member of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth and  had a foster brother growing up, who is still part of my family.   During this month, we renew our commitment to ensure that every child  has a safe and loving family.   I know firsthand how a supportive and loving home can make all the  difference in a young person's life.   There are over 460,000 children and youth in foster care. These  children and youth range from infants to 18 years old, when they age  out.   Foster youth who transition out of the foster care system without a  permanent home are at a higher risk of unemployment, poor educational  outcomes, health issues, early parenthood, long-term dependency on  public assistance, increased rates of incarceration, and homelessness.   Every child deserves a safe, supportive, and permanent family. We  have the responsibility to continue to create policies that will  improve the outcomes of the overall well-being of foster youth and  their families.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Louisiana for his leadership tonight and for hosting this Special  Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because it is time to get Americans back to  work. At the beginning of the pandemic, industries of all types were  desperately trying to keep their doors open and thousands of Americans  lost their jobs. Since then, Congress has passed measures aimed to aid  individuals and businesses, including five bipartisan relief bills,  which I supported.   Today, we are starting to return to normal. Businesses across the  country are opening their doors to pre-COVID operation levels. However,  these industries are facing a new challenge: Getting qualified  employees to return to work.   This is abundantly apparent in my district. The number one need of  businesses, both manufacturing and service industries, is qualified and  trained workers.   This past April, Clarion County held their annual career fair.  Employers from numerous sectors gathered and hoped to find employees of  all skill levels, great paying, family sustaining jobs available.  Sadly, the career fair lacked individuals ready to rejoin the  workforce.   Stories like this are, unfortunately, not unique. Right now, there  are more job openings in the United States than any point in our  Nation's history.   Mr. Speaker, as we continue to return to normal and more restrictions  are lifted, we must continue to follow the science and encourage  Americans to reenter the workforce. It is time to fully reopen America  for business and put Americans back to work.
