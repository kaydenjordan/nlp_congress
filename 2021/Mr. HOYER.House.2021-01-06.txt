 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the objection.    Madam Speaker, it is a sad day in America. It is a  wrenching day in America. It is a day in which our words and our  actions have had consequences of a very, very negative nature. We ought  to watch our words and think what it may mean to some.   My remarks were written before the tragic, dangerous, and  unacceptable actions--and ``unacceptable'' is such a tame word. My  remarks started with, ``Madam Speaker, the American people today are  witnessing one of the greatest challenges to our democracy in its 244- year history.''   Little did I know that this Capitol would be attacked by the enemy  within. I was here on 9/11 when we were attacked by the enemy without.   We need to all work together to tame and reduce the anger and, yes,  the hate that some stoke. What some--not all, Madam Speaker, but some-- in this House and this Senate are doing today will not change the  outcome of the election, which is the clear and insurmountable victory  of President-elect Biden and Vice-President-elect Harris. Instead, all  they will accomplish is to further the dangerous divisions.    This was written before this Capitol was assaulted, before this  democracy was put aside by thousands, encouraged by the Commander in  Chief.   Instead, all they will accomplish is to further the dangerous  divisions, as I said, among our people and energize conspiracy theories  stoked by our foreign adversaries, which seek to erode America's  confidence in our democracy and our system of free and fair elections.   I was here in 2000. I was strongly in favor of Al Gore for President,  and my candidate got more votes than the other candidate. His name was  George Bush, of course. And one of the saddest days was January 20th of  2001 when our candidate, who won the election, in my view, was not  elected. But it was also one of the proudest moments of my career  because the greatest power on Earth passed peacefully from Bill Clinton  to George W. Bush.   Not a shot was fired. Nobody assaulted this Caucus or this Congress  or this Chamber. Because we were not disappointed? No. Because we were  not angry? No. Because we believe in democracy. We believe in ``We the  people.''   One of the speakers, I think it was the Senator from Texas,  expressed: We are here for the people.   If those were the people, we are in a lot of trouble.   Our electoral system, our democratic system, however, did not break  under the strains of the misinformation, the claims of fraud, which  court after court after court have dismissed out of hand, not because  there was a little evidence, but because there was no evidence.   That is why we are the longest-lasting constitutional democracy in  the world. I hope all of us in this body are proud of that and  understand why that is the case. Because, as Dick Gephardt said on this  floor many years ago, democracy is a substitute for war to resolve  differences. It proved once more the ever-beating strong heart that  gives life to our Republic and our freedoms.   That strength, Madam Speaker, is derived in part from our institution  and our laws, but most importantly, it is powered by citizens' and  leaders' commitment to our Constitution. Not just us. We swear an oath.  But it is all of America.   Barack Obama spoke from that Chamber, and he said: I am going to be  taking another title next year--citizen.   And he was proud to take that. And every citizen needs to protect,  preserve, and uplift our democracy.   Some today did not do that, many today.   Sixty-eight years ago in Springfield, Illinois, Governor Adlai  Stevenson gracefully conceded his loss to General Dwight Eisenhower. He  said this: ``It is traditionally American,'' he told his deeply  disappointed supporters, ``to fight hard before an election.''                                time  2115    But then he added, it is equally traditional to close ranks as soon  as the people have spoken--not the Congress, not the electors, the  people have spoken.   That which unites us as American citizens is far greater than that  which divides us as political parties.   It was another man from Springfield, fourscore and 8 years earlier,  who won reelection to the Presidency in the national crisis that tested  our country and its democratic institutions, who pleaded even in his  hour of victory for the same spirit of reconciliation. That was the  party of Lincoln. That hasn't happened to this hour.   Lincoln said: ``. . . now that the election is over,'' he asked,  ``may not all, having a common interest, reunite in a common effort to  save our common country?''   Such is the duty of an American who stands for elections, or  participates in our politics, to be either humble in triumph or  gracious in defeat.   I have lost some elections--not too many--and I have won a lot of  elections. I hope that I have been gracious in defeat and humble in  victory. I hope that I put my State and my country first, not myself.   It is clear to all that the outgoing President has not followed the  path that Stevenson and Lincoln urged. So, we, the people--each one of  us represents about 750,000 to 800,000 people, some a few less. The  people, they have spoken in the way that our Constitution set for them  to be heard by us and by the country--they voted, and they voted pretty  decisively.   We, the people, together, must turn away from division and its  dangers.   The senior Member of our body,   Don Young from Alaska, spoke the  other day when we were sworn in and said: Ladies and gentlemen of this  House, we are so divisive that it is going to destroy our country. We  need to reach out and hold one another's hands.   We all have a title that we honor more than any other--perhaps  parent, perhaps husband. But we are all Americans. Not Americans-R; not  Americans-D. We are Americans.   Let us hope tonight that we act like Americans. Not as Ds and Rs, but  as Americans, just as Al Gore, just as Hillary Clinton, just as Adlai  Stevenson, just as Abraham Lincoln, who had won that election, of  course. But he had defeated people, and he said that is not the issue;  the issue is to reunite.   We, the people, must again be the strong heart of our American  democracy.   We, the people, on this day in Congress, must be agents of unity and  constructive action to face the grave threats that confront us and tell  those who would assault our Capitol: That is not the American way.   We, the Members of Congress, who swore an oath before God to preserve  and protect the Constitution of the United States and our democracy,  must do so now.   I don't usually read Senator McConnell's speeches, but I am not  speaking as a Democrat, nor was he speaking as a Republican just a few  hours ago.   ``We're debating a step that has never been taken in American  history, whether Congress should overrule the voters and overturn a  Presidential election.''   He went on to say that he supports a strong State-led voting reform.   ``The Constitution,'' he said, ``gives us here in Congress a limited  role. We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of elections  on steroids. The voters, the courts, and the States have all spoken.''   Five people said the election of 2000 was over. We didn't agree with  them. But Al Gore said: We are a nation of laws. Five people--yes, they  were members of the Supreme Court, but they were five people--said the  election is over. I sat on that podium and saw that power transfer to  George W. Bush.   McConnell went on to say: ``If we overrule them, it would damage our  Republic forever.''   He said that, McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, about 2  hours ago, 3 hours ago, now 4 hours.   He went on to say: ``If this election were overturned by mere  allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death  spiral.''   He concluded: ``It would be unfair and wrong to disenfranchise  American voters and overrule the courts and the States on this  extraordinarily thin basis. And I will not pretend such a  [[Page H87]]  vote would be a harmless protest gesture . . .''   How presciently he spoke. People who think that the election has been  stolen with some fraud, why do they think it? Because the Commander in  Chief said so, and they respect him and they follow him. And words  matter.   ``Pete,'' as he ended, ``I will not pretend such a vote would be a  harmless protest gesture while relying on others to do the right thing.  I will vote to respect the people's decision and defend our system of  government as we know it.''   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this objection, as McConnell  said, a danger to our democracy.    Madam Speaker, this would not be the time I would have  chosen, but it may be the last time that we are in session before the  new administration comes in.   We are losing an extraordinary young woman who has been with me for  over a decade and who is our floor leader, our floor director. All of  you know her. Her name is Shuwanza Goff, and she has been with me for a  significant period of time.   Shuwanza is a wonderful person. And the problem with having  wonderful, talented, good staff is that at an administration change,  they steal your people. It is just a terrible thing that happens. Two  of my staff, Shuwanza Goff and Mariel Saez, will be going to the  administration as well, and I have asked the administration to please  do not take any more of my people.   But Shuwanza Goff has just been extraordinary. Those of you who have  dealt with her understand how bright she is.  [[Page H113]]    That is the bad news, Madam Speaker, that they have taken her. But  the good news is, she is going to be the administration's  representative to the House of Representatives, so we are going to see  a lot of Shuwanza. I am sure she will be talking to both of us on both  sides of the aisle and urging us to vote one way or the other or  getting us information or doing all sorts of things that we might ask  her to do and that she would want to do for us.   I want to say, Madam Speaker, and I know you share my view, those of  us who have had an opportunity to work closely with Shuwanza, I love  Shuwanza Goff. She is just a wonderful spirit. She is smart. She knows  the rules. She knows the floor. I think Mr. McCarthy's and Mr.  Scalise's staffs would say the same thing if I had given them any  notice that we were going to do this, but I thought we had some time.   Shuwanza, I really do want to thank you, and we wish you the best of  luck. We know you are not going far. I know we are going to see a lot  of you, but we wish you great success in everything you do.   I tell my staff, Madam Speaker, that they can go off the payroll, but  they cannot go off the staff.   God bless, Shuwanza, and good luck.                                time  0322    At 3:22 a.m., the Sergeant at Arms, Paul D. Irving, announced the  Vice President and the Senate of the United States.   The Senate entered the Hall of the House of Representatives, headed  by the Vice President and the Secretary of the Senate, the Members and  officers of the House rising to receive them.   The Vice President took his seat as the Presiding Officer of the  joint convention of the two Houses, the Speaker of the House occupying  the chair on his left. Senators took seats to the right of the rostrum  as prescribed by law.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The joint session of Congress to count the  electoral vote will resume. The tellers will take their chairs.   The two Houses retired to consider separately and decide upon the  vote of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to which an objection has  been filed.   The Secretary of the Senate will report the action of the Senate.   The Secretary of the Senate read the order of the Senate, as follows:         Ordered, That the Senate by a vote of 7 ayes to 92 nays       rejects the objection to the electoral votes cast in the       Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for Joseph R. Biden, Jr., for       President and Kamala D. Harris for Vice President.    The VICE PRESIDENT. The Clerk of the House will report the action of  the House.   The Clerk of the House read the order of the House, as follows:         Ordered, That the House of Representatives rejects the       objection to the electoral vote of the Commonwealth of       Pennsylvania.    The VICE PRESIDENT. Pursuant to the law, chapter 1 of title 3, United  States Code, because the two Houses have not sustained the objection,  the original certificate submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  will be counted as provided therein.   The tellers will now record and announce the vote of the State of  Rhode Island for President and Vice President in accordance with the  action of the two Houses.   This certificate from Rhode Island, the Parliamentarians have advised  me, is the only certificate of vote from that State that purports to be  a return from the State and that has annexed to it a certificate from  an authority of that State purporting to appoint and ascertain  electors.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 6, 2021, on page H113, second column and third  paragraph, the following appeared: This certificate from Rhode  Island, the Parliamentarian has advised me, is the only  certificate of vote from that State that purports to be a return  from the State and that has annexed to it a certificate from an  authority of that State purporting to appoint and ascertain  electors.

Mr. President, the certificate of the electoral  vote of the State of Rhode Island seems to be regular in form and  authentic, and it appears therefrom that Joseph R. Biden, Jr., of the  State of Delaware received 4 votes for President and Kamala D. Harris  of the State of California received 4 votes for Vice President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there any objections to counting the  certificate of vote of the State of Rhode Island that the teller has  verified appears to be regular in form and authentic?   There was no objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Hearing none, this certificate from South  Carolina, the Parliamentarians have advised me, is the only certificate  of vote from that State that purports to be a return from the State and  that has annexed to it a certificate from an authority of that State  purporting to appoint and ascertain electors.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 6, 2021, on page H113, second column and sixth  paragraph, the following appeared: The VICE PRESIDENT.
