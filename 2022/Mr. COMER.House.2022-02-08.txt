 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, Americans hold the United States Postal Service in  extremely high regard, and that is for good reason. All rely on it for  our paychecks, medications, news, magazines, and correspondence with  loved ones. And now, more than ever, Americans enjoy the conveniences  of e-commerce no matter where they live in this great Nation.   The United States Postal Service is truly one of our prized national  assets. But, as we know, the Postal Service has faced financial trouble  for many years. Service delays stemming from an unreliable and outdated  delivery network, a drastic historical decrease in mail revenue, and a  sustained surge in labor-intensive packages, have all contributed to  the organization's struggles.   The rise and dominance of the internet has completely changed the way  people shop, pay bills, and generally communicate. It has changed in  ways that could not have even been envisioned in the 1970s, when  Congress established today's independently operated Postal Service.   We need to face the music. The days of letters alone driving the  Postal Service's revenue are not coming back. And with this national  pandemic, we have seen what happens when the Postal Service is stressed  to its operational limits.   The dual challenges of workforce shortages and a surge in package  volume across its delivery network plainly exposed the inability for  the Postal Service to adapt to modern challenges.   I stand here today, after more than a year of bipartisan work with my  colleague, Chairwoman Maloney, to call for the House to pass the  bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act of 2022. This targeted bill  addresses the immediate needs of the Postal Service to help it succeed  into the 21st century.   H.R. 3076 bolsters Postal Service-led operational reforms that are  already showing success with better revenue and delivery performance.   For example, the Postal Service saw one of the busiest holiday  seasons ever this past year. And even this current White House could  not ignore the fact that nearly 99 percent of consumers received their  packages on time or with minimal delays.   This was done under the leadership of Postmaster General DeJoy, and  in the face of constant challenges brought about by the pandemic and  the current political climate.   Coupled with the Postmaster General's ambitious and comprehensive 10- year reform plan are two legislative requests impacting the Postal  Service's ability to operate profitably in the years to come.   First, the well-intentioned 2006 legislative requirement that the  Postal Service prefund the retiree health benefits of all future  potential costs has proven unworkable and counterproductive.   H.R. 3076 repeals this requirement, while continuing to require  annual payments for what is owed to postal retirees. This helps  alleviate immediate financial stresses, while still protecting the  workforce's earned retirement health benefits.   Secondly, the Postmaster General has sought legislation to seamlessly  transition the postal workforce into Medicare upon retirement, rather  than continuing as the primary payer for retiree health benefits.   Congress has told the Postal Service it has to act like a business,  and this is  [[Page H1042]]  not something businesses do. Businesses offer secondary coverage to  wrap-around Medicare benefits, and that is what Congress should allow  the Postal Service to do as well. This is sensible policy in keeping  with the practices of private-sector businesses.   Postal Service retirees have been paying into Medicare their entire  careers and, next to the Federal Government itself, the Postal Service  is the largest contributor to the Medicare Trust Fund in the Nation.   Together, these two legislative provisions requested by Postmaster  General DeJoy are projected to help the Postal Service break even in  the coming years.   However, I have made it clear that Republicans need to see solutions  that would also allow the Postal Service to fundamentally improve its  business model. Our reform bill is designed around the Postal Service's  current operational reform plans.   Additionally, our bill makes sure Congress has key oversight tools.  For instance, our bill establishes a public-facing, online dashboard  with full local mail delivery performance data. This will provide  necessary transparency into the on-time delivery of mail, and equip  every House Member to conduct oversight of mail performance in their  local communities.   Congress should not be caught off guard as we were in early 2020 as  the pandemic accelerated performance problems in real time.   My colleagues should also consider what this targeted reform bill  does not do. Our legislation does not include draconian cuts to service  delivery, such as post office closures, or decreasing delivery to  residences.   Our bill keeps the needs of rural Postal Service customers front and  center. For instance, the bill codifies the 6-day delivery of mail and  packages, which provides assurance to businesses and rural communities  alike.   And importantly, our reform bill does all of this without taking the  easy approach of a bailout or increasing the budget. In fact, the bill  is projected to save over a billion dollars of tax funds over the next  decade, over a billion dollars.   Chairwoman Maloney and I have worked closely on receiving the input  from the Postal Service and industry groups large and small, and have  come to an agreement that we believe will have a real impact. I am very  proud of this product, this bipartisan work.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who has worked steadfastly and been on board  and had significant input in this bill from day one.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), the ranking member of the House  Administration Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), who also serves as ranking subcommittee  member on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong), who has been a strong supporter of reform  from day one.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alaska  (Mr. Young), the dean of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Tenney).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Garbarino).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank my House colleagues for their heartfelt remarks today.   Madam Speaker, America's most esteemed institution, the United States  Postal Service, is in trouble. Since the 1970s legislative reform,  Congress has expected the Postal Service to operate as an independent  and self-sufficient organization. However, for years, the Postal  Service has spent far more than it has brought in, and last year alone  lost over $9 billion. Many of these challenges are beyond the control  of prior Postal Service leadership.   The U.S. Congress has legally obligated the Postal Service to provide  universal mail service delivery. Today, that means delivery to over 160  million addresses. This is a massive and expensive undertaking that  cannot be glossed over. Additionally, as our Nation's population and  economy continues to grow, so will the Postal Service's ever-increasing  expenses.   H.R. 3076 does not change this universal service obligation, but we  risk having that difficult national conversation if we do nothing. The  price for inaction is a Postal Service that will eventually require  drastic service reductions, especially in rural, remote parts of  America, or continual taxpayer-funded bailouts, which no conservative  and no taxpayer should want. Neither are desirable options.   We have an opportunity to pass targeted legislation to relieve the  Postal Service of certain financial hardships and bolster its ambitious  structure reform initiatives.   This moment, with a bipartisan bill and bold Postal Service  leadership at the helm, may not be easily replicated in future years. I  urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3036.   Madam Speaker, before I yield back, I would be remiss if I didn't say  my grandmother spent her whole career as a rural mail carrier. Her name  was Maitred Witcher, and she had Route 1 in Red Boiling Springs,  Tennessee. I grew up with an appreciation for our mail carriers and I  appreciate all the hardworking employees of the U.S. Postal Service.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the amendment.   Madam Speaker, as we have worked together on the Postal Service  Reform Act over the past year, Chairwoman Maloney and I strove to fully  incorporate the legislative feedback we received from the relevant  agencies. This manager's amendment contains necessary technical fixes  to ensure the bill's requirements are efficiently and effectively  implemented.   For instance, it ensures that the U.S. Postal Service, and not the  American taxpayer, fully cover the implementation costs of the Office  of Personnel Management, Social Security Administration, and Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid Services.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman and the Committee on Oversight  and Reform staff for working diligently with me to make sure this bill  is done right.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
