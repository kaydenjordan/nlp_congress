 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member.   Mr. Chairman, this bill is a setback because it allows the American  public to be subject to rip-offs. It allows you to be ripped off when  you get your auto loan. Without your knowing it, it will allow you to  pay a higher amount than you should be paying.   It allows you to, without your consent, have the money that you place  in the bank be taken away from your account, moved over to another  place, and used to gamble; if they win, they keep the profits--all done  without your consent.   It allows, without your knowledge, the person that you are working  with to invest your pension and to put his interests ahead of your  interests.   This is a rip-off bill. We should not support it. The American  consumers are placed at risk. This is the time to stand. We must say  ``no'' to H.R. 10. It is, indeed, the wrong choice.
