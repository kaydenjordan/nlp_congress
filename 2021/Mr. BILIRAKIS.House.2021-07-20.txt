 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I had hoped to stand before you today urging my  colleagues to support this legislation. Sadly, I must oppose because  the expansive authority included here goes way beyond the new agency  power I and my colleagues were willing to put into statute to ensure  the FTC has the ability to get financial restitution to constituents  who were victimized by scams as quickly as possible. So, we do agree on  the concept but not the details.   Instead, this bill before us will provide the FTC with new  authorities that far outpace the need supported by a consensus of the  FTC Commissioners.   Even more concerning, Mr. Speaker, as we heard from the former head  of the FTC's Consumer Protection Bureau, who testified before our  subcommittee, it signals a return to the broad overreach we saw with  the FTC in previous decades, a situation so bad that a Democratic  Congress crippled the FTC's funding and stripped it of its authority at  that particular time. But, alas, here we go again. History is repeating  itself if this piece of legislation is passed.   Separately, H.R. 2668 has been riddled with process fouls and has  ignored well-founded concerns from Republicans, including the lack of  needed transparency reform and the lack of a national privacy standard,  which will protect consumers. We are overdue for this, and we must have  a national privacy standard as soon as possible, Mr. Speaker.   I have heard from my colleagues. They claim this bill only  establishes a statute of limitations, but that simply is not the case.  In fact, if you listened to the rhetoric from my Democratic colleagues,  you would believe this bill was narrowly targeted at fraudsters and  scammers, but that is not the case.    Under this bill, the FTC could obtain billions in penalties without  ever proving that the alleged company ever knew or intended to mislead  at all.   The Supreme Court ruled 9-0, a unanimous decision, that the FTC never  had the authority to grant monetary relief under 13(b). Even the  liberal Justices of the Court, Mr. Speaker, said that 13(b) was only  designed for injunctive relief. We all agree on that.   So, let's fix it for the benefit of our consumers and any future  victims. Let's make sure that they get the restitution they deserve.   An important principle of the American justice system is that the  harsher the penalty is, the more due process is needed. So while I do  agree with my Democratic colleagues that 13(b) provides sufficient due  process for injunctive relief, the new authorities this legislation  bestows on section 13(b) does not, however, provide enough due process  if the penalty is monetary relief.   Perhaps therein lies my colleagues' true intent. This legislation is  not really to fix a problem or restore a power but instead aims to  grant the FTC with brand-new and unchecked authorities, rivaling those  of the 1970s, to seek financial penalties for what it alleges is fraud  and anticompetitive acts through section 13(b) of the FTC Act.   To those listening today, do not be fooled by the title of this bill.  I believe it is irresponsible that the Consumer Protection and Recovery  Act grants these new authorities without any guardrails to ensure due  process remains a foundational American principle or to protect  American companies from egregious enforcements that are not intended to  protect consumers or help them recover from the harm of bad actors.   We all want to go after the bad actors, Mr. Speaker, but there must  be due process.   Now, if it is a clear-cut case of fraud, like Volkswagen, then I  agree that we should be able to use 13(b) to seek monetary relief, and  my amendment captures such acts. That is the exception to the legal  standard.   But if the FTC has to look back 10 years--and that is what we do with  this particular piece of legislation, if it passes--and not have to  prove there was deceptive intent, as there was in Volkswagen, then we  need to ensure due process before the FTC can take money from small  businesses and entrepreneurs.   I feel that that is only fair. That is why I was proud to offer a  compromise during our Energy and Commerce Committee markup, which was  the only portion of the markup that received bipartisan support. My  amendment was the only one that received bipartisan support, and I  believe it is fair and reasonable.   My amendment struck the right balance between providing the FTC with  the new authorities to go after bad actors but also placed much-needed  guardrails to keep the FTC from short-circuiting due process and  seeking disgorgement from small businesses unaware of any potential  violation.   Our small businesses are struggling, and those that conduct bad acts  should be punished, absolutely should be punished. There should be  restitution for the victims. But our innocent small businesses are  having a hard time as it is.                                time  1645    One of my Democratic colleagues even commented that to go from 5  years to 10 years will increase the cost of businesses' errors-and- omissions insurance policies. We must consider that as well.   Now, combine that with no standards attached to the behavior in  question,  [[Page H3732]]  and we will see even more inflation, ultimately hurting our small  businesses and allowing the big guys to pass on the cost to  constituents, which they most likely will do. They have the lawyers on  their side, so they will pass the costs on to the constituents. We  can't have that.   Without these guardrails, the FTC will create a ripple effect that  will kill small businesses, unfortunately, innovation and ingenuity,  while raising prices in our economy.   My amendment found the right balance, I believe, on the statute of  limitations to ensure businesses are not blindsided by the assertion of  claims long after the potential conduct, when evidence may no longer be  available or is stale, and it is only right. Five years--I would even  compromise and go a little higher, but the information must not be  stale. I would say in most States, and also DOJ in some criminal cases,  the statute is roughly 5 years. In most States, approximately 5 to  maybe 7 years, at the most.   While shortening the statute, it also provides the FTC with a unique,  equitable tolling period to allow the FTC the ability to seek monetary  relief beyond the 5-year statute of limitations in the case of  intentionally deceptive or fraudulent conduct. This addresses examples  of the fraudulent behavior you will hear from my Democratic colleagues,  when the FTC failed to act in a timely fashion. The tolling language is  in my amendment.   Despite receiving bipartisan support, the majority rejected this  amendment. One can only wonder if this is because it stands in the way  of remaking our entire country into a managed economy and one that,  again, strips due process rights from its citizens. I hope that is not  the case.   Mr. Speaker, as I have said before, Republicans and Democrats both  want to protect consumers. We were in Rules yesterday, and we both  agreed on that; we want to protect our consumers, and we want to make  sure that they get the restitution that they deserve.   I have stayed at the table to negotiate this and even offered an  amendment that went a step further than the one I offered in committee.  Unfortunately, it fell on deaf ears. The Rules Committee did not make  my or any other Republican amendment in order today, ignoring our  serious concerns.   We were concerned about pending cases, to make sure that the FTC had  the time to look at all the pending cases, and that would make an  exception to the statute of limitations, the 5 years. I think we  thought of everything.   To my colleagues, let's work together and properly empower the FTC to  protect constituents and pass a national privacy standard. This is our  opportunity. As a matter of fact, the Senate is working on a bill that  includes a privacy standard; a 13(b) fix, but also a privacy standard.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this particular piece of legislation. I want  to get back to the table and get this right.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg), my good friend and a great Member. Michigan is  the home of Tom Brady; at least he went to college there, a great  American. Mr. Walberg is also a great American.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Pence), a great member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), our great ranking  member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I will continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we need due process in this particular bill. I believe  that this bill is incomplete. We do have to protect the honest small  businesses in this country. As a matter of fact, I heard just  yesterday, from over 100 small businesses, and they have real serious  concerns, legitimate concerns about this particular bill. This bill is  not ready for prime time at this particular time. As I said, it is  incomplete.   Mr. Speaker, we must go after the bad actors. There must be  restitution for our victims--there is no question--but it has to be  fair, with a fair and reasonable legal standard.   Mr. Speaker, on that particular note, with regard to the legal  standard, former head of the FTC Consumer Protection Bureau and  committee witness, Dr. Howard Beales stated that a reasonable person  standard was an appropriate standard to include in any restitution or  disgorgement legislation.   He testified that this will ensure that the FTC focuses its efforts  on bad actors, not honest small business people, but bad actors when  using its limited resources to bring these claims.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the underlying  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise for this Special Order to  commemorate the 47th anniversary of the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey,  and to further call attention and demand action on the continued  Turkish settlement of Varosha.   On July 20, 1974, a very sad day, Turkey invaded the Republic of  Cyprus and violently captured the northern part of the island and  established a heavily armed occupation force that continues to control  nearly 37 percent of Cyprus' territory.   As a result of this flagrant violation of international law, 160,000  Greek Cypriots, 70 percent of the population of the occupied area, were  forcibly expelled from their homes. In addition, approximately 5,000  Cypriots were killed, including five Americans, Mr. Speaker, of Cypriot  descent.                                time  1845    More than 1,400 Greek Cypriots remain missing since the Turkish  invasion, and their fate is still unknown.   Greek and Turkish Cypriots were forcibly divided along ethnic lines  and remain so to this day. It is utterly baffling why over the past 47  years the U.S., the E.U., the U.N. and the international community writ  large have failed to take meaningful action against Turkey for the  invasion and subsequent occupation of Cyprus.   Indeed, lack of action has emboldened Turkey to treat the occupied  north of Cyprus as an unannexed province of Turkey where Erdogan seeks  to, among other things, build a presidential palace, presumably as a  precursor to the caliphate he expects to lead.   Decades of failed reunification attempts have jaded even the most  optimistic of us.   Today, after President Erdogan defied warnings from the U.S. and the  international community, as well as U.N. Security Council resolutions  and went ahead and changed the status of Varosha, there can no longer  be any doubt that with Erdogan leading Turkey and Ersin Tatar leading  the Turkish Cypriot community, there will be no Cyprus solutions,  sadly.   The tragic story of Varosha is perhaps the true embodiment of the  permanent harm Turkey's direct interference has had on the island. Once  holding international renown as a premier tourist destination, it has  fallen into a state of dilapidation--sadly, Mr. Speaker, and I did  witness it myself--after its lawful inhabitants were forced to flee in  the face of the Turkish invasion.   Varosha, particularly the resettlement of its lawful inhabitants, has  long been a central issue in the negotiations for Cypriot  reunification. However, Turkey continues to unilaterally threaten the  noble dream of one people, one border, one Cyprus.   Unfortunately, it was not by coincidence that Erdogan chose this  day--the anniversary of the fateful Turkish invasion of Cyprus--to take  this illegal action. I emphasize ``illegal,'' Mr. Speaker.   Although the events of the Turkish invasion 47 years ago are not new,  I feel it is important that the severity of the invasion and its  lasting effects are not understated or forgotten. We must never forget.   It was then, the Turkish forces ethnically cleansed and then fenced  off the beautiful area of Varosha, holding it hostage for decades as a  bargaining chip in reunification negotiations. All despite the two  Cypriot communities' intention to reach an agreement on the  resettlement of its lawful inhabitants. The 1979 High Level Agreement  made it clear that the resettlement of Varosha was a unified Cypriot  priority, that both sides were open to such acts of goodwill, and that  the United Nations should play a role in the resolution of the Cyprus  problem.   However, the status quo radically changed in 2019 when the Turkish  occupation authorities announced their intention, sadly, to open  Varosha to Turkish settlement, directly contradicting the United  Nation's role and legitimacy on the issue, specifically U.N. Security  Council Resolutions 482, 550, 789, and 2483.   Back in October of 2019, I even wrote that the Turkish settlement of  Varosha would be a step in the completely wrong direction of what the  Cypriot people want--and I have spoken to the Cypriot people--which is  the eventual reunification of Cyprus.   The Republic of Cyprus continues to maintain the return of Varosha as  a  [[Page H3741]]  cornerstone of confidence building measures with the Turkish Cypriots,  including joint ventures seeking to restore the dilapidated city.   Indeed, the present government of the Republic of Cyprus proposed a  confidence building measure that would have turned Varosha over to U.N.  control and allowed the Turkish-Cypriot port Famagusta to trade with  the world under E.U. designation.   And Famagusta is a wonderful place. I had relatives that had to leave  during the invasion in 1974, Mr. Speaker. They lost their homes, they  lost their livelihoods, and they moved to Athens. But, again, a  beautiful place, and it is a very sad situation. And it is action we  need, not words, and that is why I am here tonight, Mr. Speaker, to  educate the American public and the Members of Congress.   So the Erdogan government, Mr. Speaker, and the Turkish occupation  authorities in Cyprus rejected this win-win proposal and decided to  keep this one time jewel--and it is a jewel--of the eastern  Mediterranean sadly, a ghost town.   Turkish Cypriots, in particular, want to be part of the E.U. and  share in all the economic benefits that their compatriots, the Greek  Cypriots, enjoy. We support them in their efforts and condemn Erdogan  for using Turkish Cypriots as pawns. That is exactly what he is doing.  He is using them as pawns to help bolster his dismal record on Turkey's  economy.   The world knows that Erdogan is desperate and trying to distract from  his failed leadership in Turkey. With his sinking poll numbers, Erdogan  must shore up his nationalist base ahead of Turkey's 2023 election.  That is what this is all about. That is why he has converted his  rhetoric into action and moved to reopen parts of Varosha for Turkish  recreation and tourism. It is outrageous, and it must be stopped.   We need to speak up now before it is too late, and fight for the  dream and hope of an eventual Cypriot reunification. These are our  allies. These are great allies, Mr. Speaker.   The United States, the U.N., the E.U. cannot simply continue to just  simply offer its sentiments and vocal displeasure. They must match  their displeasure with action, not limited to U.N. management of  Varosha as outlined in U.N. Security Council Resolution 550, diplomatic  isolation, or sanctions, not limited to just that.   The permanent Turkish settlement of Varosha without justice to the  Cypriots who had their homes unlawfully taken from them should be the  final red line for the international community that cannot be crossed.  We, the international community, have an opportunity and an obligation  to stand and fight for justice for our ally, the Cypriot people.    The Cypriot people have a right to their dream of a united Cyprus  without direct interference from the Turks, and the displaced Cypriots  are entitled to return to their homes in beautiful Varosha.   The United States must take real action and let Erdogan know in very  clear terms that the U.S. will no longer put up with the blatant  exploitation of the Cypriot people. And that is what it has been all  these years.   Last week, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators led in part by my good  friend, Marco Rubio, called for the Biden administration to pursue  multilateral sanctions if Turkey changes the status of Varosha. Senator  Menendez has also been a great leader in this area, too.   Turkey crossed that Rubicon today. And like it did when we warned  them not to go ahead with the Russian S400 purchases, they thumbed  their nose at the United States Congress, the State Department, and the  White House.   It is time that Turkey be held accountable for acting contrary to  U.S. policy, U.S. interests, and U.S. law. And I ask this House to echo  the call by the Senators asking the Biden administration to pursue  multilateral sanctions in response to Turkey's flagrant violations of  international law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
