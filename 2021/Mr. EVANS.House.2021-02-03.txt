 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to observe National Gun Violence  Survivors Week.   During this pandemic, gun violence has increased in many communities,  including my city of Philadelphia. We suffered 50 homicides last month  alone.   We must pass reforms like universal background checks and closing the  Charleston loophole. The House acted in 2019, but the Senate did not.  While these bills would not stop 100 percent of shootings, they would  certainly save some lives.   We must also help the victims and the survivors of this violence. Too  often, they don't know where to turn or what kinds of things or help  are available. That is why Senator Casey and I will soon reintroduce  our Resources for Victims of Gun Violence Act.   In the last session, we had nearly 80 cosponsors in the House. I  invite you  [[Page H284]]  both, new and returning Members, to add your name. Our fellow Americans  need our help.                            ____________________
