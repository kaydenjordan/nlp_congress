 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  my friend, Susan Lott Clark of Waycross, Georgia.   Susan was born in May of 1925 in Waycross, Georgia. She graduated  from Waycross High School, then went on to Wesleyan College, Emory  University, and the University of Georgia.   She married Dr. William Clark, Jr., an ophthalmologist, and then  settled back down in her hometown in 1958. Susan stayed active in the  local Methodist Church. She taught Sunday school there and even  coauthored a book called ``The History of First United Methodist  Church.''   As well as her church activities, Susan founded the Okefenokee  Heritage Center and the Southern Forest World Environmental Center.   In 2008, Susan went on to spearhead the movement to add Lott Cemetery  of Waycross to the National Register of Historic Places.   At 92, Susan went on to publish her autobiography, ``Let's Talk About  Me,'' which gives an illuminating look back on her life.   She was the recipient of many awards during her life, including the  Waycross Woman of the Year Award, the Wesleyan College Alumnae Award  for Distinguished Achievements, and Wise Owl Award for leadership in  Georgia Forestry.   My thoughts and prayers are with the entire Clark family during this  most difficult time.                            ____________________
