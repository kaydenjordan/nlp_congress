 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, The U.S. Infrastructure system is in  critical need of an upgrade. In February 2021, the American Society of  Civil Engineers (ASCE) graded 11 of 17 infrastructure categories a D+  or worse. Systems across the Nation are in dire need of repair,  including our bridges, public transit, roads, and schools.   A recent study by the Center of Education and the Workforce at  Georgetown University estimated that a $1.5 trillion infrastructure  investment would create 15 million new jobs. Nearly half of these would  require training past the high school level. Even without a significant  investment, though, infrastructure industries are already struggling to  meet workforce demands. Though the need to invest in infrastructure  goes back decades, there's renewed momentum today, especially as more  than 10 million people remain unemployed across the country as a result  of COVID-19, exacerbating the already historic inequities that have  limited women and people of color from accessing these jobs.  Investments in infrastructure skills training must serve people of  color, women, and other communities who have historically been excluded  from good careers in infrastructure.   Industry and sector partnerships are a proven strategy for helping  workers prepare for jobs that lead to strong career pathways and  helping businesses find skilled workers. Congress requires states and  local areas to support the development of these partnerships under the  Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), but no dedicated  funding has been provided for these activities.  [[Page S1897]]    For workers, especially those underrepresented in infrastructure  industries, support services like career counseling, child care, and  transportation can often be the key to succeed in work-based learning  programs. Providing these services may be outside the capacity of a  business. Industry partnerships bring business together with community  and human service organizations that can make these connections for  workers and drastically improve their ability to succeed in training  and meet business demand for skilled workers.   This is why I am pleased to introduce with my colleague, Senator  Portman, the Building U.S. Infrastructure by Leveraging Demands for  Skills Act, or BUILDS Act. The BUILDS Act creates a grant program that  would support industry and sector partnerships working with local  businesses, industry associations and organizations, labor  organizations, state and local workforce boards, economic development  agencies and other partners engaged in their communities to encourage  industry growth, competitiveness and collaboration to improve worker  training, retention and advancement in targeted infrastructure  clusters. Additionally, businesses and education providers would be  connected to develop classroom curriculum to complement on-the-job  learning and workers would receive support services such as mentoring  and career counseling to ensure that they are successful from the pre- employment to placement in a full-time position.   As we prepare to tackle critical infrastructure needs nationwide,  it's vital we also support a skilled workforce that can take on this  task. This bill will help foster strong industry partnerships and  career pathways in infrastructure fields to ensure we can train and  upskill workers for millions of good-paying jobs and also strengthen  our economy as we begin to recover from COVID-19. I hope that my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle consider the BUILDS Act as a  necessary component to any investment in our nation's infrastructure.                                  ______                                         By Mr. McCONNELL:   S. 1091. A bill to designate certain future interstates and high  priority corridors in Kentucky, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Environment and Public Works.
