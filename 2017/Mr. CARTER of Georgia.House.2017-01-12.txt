 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Deb  Thompson, who recently retired as general manager of WSAV News Station  in Savannah, Georgia.   Ms. Thompson began working with WSAV in 2005. She moved to Savannah  from Dallas, Texas, and started her outstanding career bringing news to  our local community as a sales manager for the station.   Her dedication and passion for the Savannah community made her a  perfect fit for the job, and she quickly moved to general manager of  WSAV in 2009. An example of this passion was  [[Page H454]]  showcased when she was arrested in March of 2016, as part of the  Muscular Dystrophy Association's Lock-Up event to help combat  neuromuscular disease. The money that Ms. Thompson raised for bail  helped two local children attend an MDA summer camp that gives children  with muscle-debilitating diseases the best week of the year.   Ms. Thompson was also instrumental in expanding WSAV's news coverage  from 17 hours per week to 30 hours per week and creating a 10 p.m.  program reaching a much broader audience.   I am proud to recognize her today for all of her hard work and  dedication to southeast Georgia. I wish her the best of luck in the  future.                            ____________________
