 Madam Speaker, one word. Heartbreaking. This legislation  my Democrat colleagues are trying to enact is just plain old  heartbreaking.  [[Page H5147]]  History will not look kindly on this abortion on demand legislation.   Let me be clear. This is not about healthcare. This goes far beyond  the guise of healthcare. This, in fact, is infanticide. A society is  judged by how they treat the most vulnerable among us by God, and God  will judge us.                                time  1000    That is why we must always stand for life, both the born and, of  course, today we are talking about the unborn.   As a father of four, a grandfather of eight with one on the way,  protecting life will always be my priority, and I urge a ``no'' vote on  H.R. 3755.
