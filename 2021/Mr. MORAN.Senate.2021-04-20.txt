 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life and  memory of Austin Sorensen Klein, a son, younger brother, and friend  gone too soon. Austin's loved ones remember him as a young man full of  energy, talent, and passion for trying and conquering new things.   Austin loved to sing. He was known throughout the Overland Park  community as a vocal talent. After winning the 2015 KC Superstar  competition, he went on to pursue music through the men's glee club at  the University of Notre Dame and then the a cappella group at the  University of Texas-Austin. Anyone who knew Austin and heard him sing  will remember his sonorous voice and how his joy for music was  contagious.   Austin was a kind, intelligent, patient young man who loved to learn  and loved even more to make people laugh. He was a reader and, in many  ways, a budding philosopher. Austin enjoyed traveling with his close  family; they hiked the Black Hills and Yellowstone, toured Disney World  and Washington, DC, and explored Europe, Australia, and New Zealand  together. I know his parents Greg and Sue, who are dear friends to me  and Senator Thune, and his brothers Kevin and Keith will treasure these  memories forever. Our community hurts with them as they navigate life  without their beloved son and brother.   After a brief but remarkable life, Austin passed away on March 3,  2021. I want to extend my sincerest condolences to the Klein family and  Austin's friends who mourn as they miss and remember Austin's voice,  his laugh, and the joy he brought to everyone he knew. May we all learn  from Austin's example to live every day to the fullest, hold close  those who are dear to us, and do the things we love most.                            ____________________
