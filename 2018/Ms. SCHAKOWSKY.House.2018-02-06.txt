 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I rise in opposition to H.R. 772.   This bill is completely unnecessary, overly prescriptive, and would  deny consumers critical information about the food that they eat.   At a time when our country is facing an obesity epidemic--I would  say, really, crisis--we should not be undermining efforts to educate  consumers about the nutritional value of foods, including calories.   As a country, we pay a high price for obesity. It is estimated that  medical costs for obesity top $190.2 billion, annually. Childhood  obesity alone is responsible for $14 billion in direct medical costs.  We should be embracing efforts to reduce this enormous cost to our  healthcare system. A Harvard study found restaurant menu labeling could  prevent up to 41,000 cases of childhood obesity and could save over  $4.6 billion in healthcare costs over 10 years.   So if you want to eat pizza and fries, that is great, but why not  have the opportunity to know how many calories are in that pizza and  fries? You should be able to have that information. More information  for consumers is a good thing.   The menu labeling law that passed in 2010 requires chain restaurants  with 20 or more locations to provide consumers with basic nutritional  information like calorie content for standard food and beverage items  on menus. Since then, the FDA has been working to implement this rule  only to face numerous delays along the way.   Research has shown that calorie information can help people make  healthier choices, and 80 percent of Americans support providing this  type of calorie information on the menu. But far from common sense, the  legislation we are considering today would undermine the law. H.R. 772  takes us backwards by undermining the law and further delaying consumer  protections.   This is not about flexibility. This bill just gives cover to bad  actors and special interests that do not want to comply with the law.   First, it would allow food establishments to display calorie  information in ways that would only serve to confuse and mislead  customers. It allows the food establishment to set arbitrary serving  sizes and cut the calorie count way below what a normal person would  eat. Without standardized calorie reporting for menu items, people will  have a tough time figuring out and computing nutrition information and  comparing across items. It is deceptive to label an entree or a muffin  as multiple servings because we all know that they are mostly consumed  by one person in one sitting.   Second, it would deny consumers the opportunity to view calorie  information and other nutritional information regardless of how or  where they purchase food from a chain restaurant. Not only does it  allow deceptive serving size manipulation, this bill would allow food  establishments to make that information difficult to find. Calorie  labeling is not useful if it is posted somewhere that it will not be  seen.   Provisions in this bill would deny customers nutritional information  from not only inside a pizza chain, but inside fast-food and other  chain restaurants if the majority of their orders are placed offsite,  like on the telephone or online.   For example, under this bill, a restaurant or similar retail food  establishment could have the option to only list nutritional  information online or via some other remote-access menu, thereby  denying consumers who order in a brick-and-mortar location access to  the information. Speed limits are not useful if they are hidden on a  highway, and calorie counts cannot help if they are concealed from the  public.   Finally, it has been nearly 8 years since the original menu labeling  requirements were passed, but this bill would once again delay the  final menu labeling rules and send the FDA back  [[Page H817]]  to the drawing board. The FDA has already put forth a proposed rule,  solicited comments, and worked with stakeholders to finalize the menu  labeling rule.    In fact, just this past November, FDA published new draft guidance  intended to help answer any of the outstanding questions regarding  compliance. This guidance included sample menus and pictures to help  food establishments tackle how to label for a variety of ingredients  like multiple pizza toppings.   This rule has been delayed long enough. The final menu labeling  regulations should go into effect as scheduled in May of this year.  Countless businesses, restaurants, and other retail food establishments  have already invested time and money into compliance with the current  menu labeling rules, and it would be irresponsible to further delay  implementation of this important rule.   This bill is another handout to businesses and an affront to  consumers. It will keep consumers in the dark about the nutritional  information that they need and create consumer and industry confusion.   H.R. 772 would weaken an important tool intended to help Americans  make informed food choices at a time when obesity and other nutrition- related health problems are at crisis levels. That is why countless  consumer and public health organizations oppose this bill, including  the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the American  Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American  Nurses Association, Center for Science in the Public Interest,  Consumers Union, and the Trust for America's Health. All of these  health organizations oppose this legislation because it is not good for  the health of our country or for consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Illinois has 23 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for  yielding the time.   Let me, first, dispel a couple of myths that have been suggested on  the floor of the House.   One myth has been that small businesses are negatively impacted by  the menu labeling requirements. Small businesses are unilaterally  exempt from menu labeling requirements. The rule only applies to  ``covered establishments,'' meaning those that have 20 or more  locations. This rule does not and never was intended to apply to small  businesses. That is misinformation being given out by the majority.   The second item which I just heard momentarily about, penalties, menu  labeling will be subject to the exact same mechanisms and penalties as  those for packaged food. The FDA has maintained its commitment to  compliance, outreach, and education and has waived enforcement for the  first year.   Additionally, numerous State and local governments have menu labeling  requirements, and not one chain restaurant has faced criminal  liability--once again, misinformation being distributed by the  majority.                                time  1300    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this special interest-driven  attack on popular and necessary menu labeling rules.   When we crafted the health reforms in the Affordable Care Act, we  kept several critical goals in mind. We aimed to slow the staggering  growth of healthcare spending, make preventive and wellness care more  central to our health system, and give Americans access to more data so  that they can make their own informed healthcare decisions.   Menu labeling is an essential tool to meet all three of those goals.  That is why I have been a longtime champion of menu labeling, and I  fought hard to secure its inclusion in the Affordable Care Act.   Congress passed standardized menu labeling in 2010. The goal was to  arm Americans with the information they need to make informed  nutritional decisions for themselves and their families.   The language was built on consensus and compromise. It was worked out  between a variety of interests, including industry partners and the  National Restaurant Association.   Industry has already had nearly 8 years of input for the  implementation of the labeling rule, yet, with this misguided bill,  certain sectors of the industry will tear down the progress that we  have made. This bill would roll back and weaken this crucial step to  combat the obesity epidemic in the United States. This is obstruction.  American families are paying the price in their healthcare costs.   In 2015, sales at restaurants and bars surpassed spending at grocery  stores for the first time. In a typical day, one-third of our children,  4 in 10 adolescents, and one-third of adults eat at a fast food  restaurant. Americans are eating, on average, one-third of their  calories outside of the home. Nutritional information must be made  readily available where the consumer is at the point of purchase.   A health impact assessment from Los Angeles County found that menu  labeling could avert 40 percent of the 6.75 million-pound average  weight gain in the country. You think of that in terms of healthcare  costs and the impact that decrease would have.   Our children are especially at risk. Today, more than one-third of  our kids  [[Page H818]]  and adolescents are overweight or obese. Children eat more than twice  as many calories at a restaurant than they do at home. They consume  less nutrients and more saturated fats. The impact on our kids alone  should be reason enough to oppose a measure that undermines a  consumer's ability to make informed, nutritious choices at mealtimes.   Menu labeling is popular. In a national poll, over 80 percent of  Americans support menu labeling in chain restaurants. Over 100  nutrition and health organizations support menu labeling. Chains from  Starbucks to Panera Bread to McDonald's are already implementing menu  labeling. The rest of the industry must follow suit.   Consumers have a right to make an informed decision. It is  disrespectful for the industry and their partners to argue that the  American people cannot understand menu labeling. Give people the  ability to make their choice.   You go in to eat, it has been a great day, you look at the board, you  see something that you want, you look at the calories and say: Today, I  think I will watch my calories. You order accordingly.   Other days, it is a bad day. You go in and you throw caution to the  wind. You say: I am going to order whatever I can, no matter what the  calorie count is.   This is about the right to choose and freedom of choice. That is what  we are talking about here today. This bill denies consumers the right  to nutritional information at that point of purchase. Even if 49  percent of orders are placed from in-store menus, food establishments  could bury menu labeling online.   Multiple studies have shown that providing calorie menu labeling  information can help Americans make lower calorie choices, but they  cannot do this if they do not have the information they need.   This bill increases consumer confusion and allows restaurants to list  deceptive portion sizes, listing an entree as multiple servings even  though these items are most often consumed by one person.   It weakens enforcement and consumer protection, completely removes an  establishment's incentive to comply with the menu labeling  requirements, and removes the ability of individuals to hold retail  food establishments accountable for violations to the food labeling  law.   The existing law is already extremely flexible. I said restaurants  with less than 20 locations. Mom-and-pop small businesses are excluded.  I don't believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle understand  that. Read the legislation.   Let me mention something which has been very interesting, and that is  about pizza companies. I come from New Haven, Connecticut, an Italian- American neighborhood. I know something about pizza.   What we have done with the industry is to work with them. The FDA  opened the door to allow them what they asked for: to give a range of  calories on a slice of pizza. They have done it.   These are FDA charts which demonstrate how easily you can put a label  on the food so that people understand what the calories are. I will  show this one. Calories are listed per slice. That is what the industry  wanted. That is what we did. They have the ranges that they have for  their various toppings.   Don't let the other side sell you a bill of goods. The FDA has  conceded that they can list the calories in a single slice rather than  an entire pizza.   This all illustrates that the Food and Drug Administration has  already been working closely with the industry to address their  concerns. We should let them work through this process, rather than  complicating it with legislation that, in fact, would harm what we have  been doing, what we have worked on all these years: meaningful,  impactful work on menu labeling with a single stroke.   This is a special interest-driven bill. It is not the answer. I urge  my colleagues to oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a document that outlines the  myths that are perpetrated by the majority and what the underlying  facts are.                     Busting the Myths of Menu Labeling         The Menu Labeling Rule provides consumers with nutritional       information on the foods they purchase. This crucial       information would give Americans a tool to make healthy       choices. Nevertheless, the lobbying of special interest       groups has resulted in H.R. 772, a bill based on nothing more       than misleading myths.        MYTH No. 1: Small businesses are negatively impacted.        Small businesses are unilaterally exempt from menu labeling       requirements. The rule only applies to ``covered       establishments,'' meaning those that have 20 or more       locations. The rule does not, and never was intended, to       apply to small businesses.        MYTH No. 2: Labeling requirements are burdensome and       difficult to comply with.        In reality, nutritional labeling requirements are       straightforward and easy to implement, which is why numerous       food retailers are already labeling calories on their menus.       Furthermore, FDA has sought eight years of industry input       which has resulted in the most flexible disclosure       requirements to date. Nutritional information for complex       menu items can be disclosed in ranges, without the need to       estimate exact calories for various combinations.        MYTH No. 3: Labeling requirements only create consumer       confusion.        The Menu Labeling Rule actually reduces consumer confusion       by providing nutritional information at the point of       purchase, and ensures that portion sizes are listed       realistically. The rule will allow for a standard nutritional       information format which will facilitate consumer       understanding. Without it, consumers will be subject to       deceptive portion sizes which can lead to them making       misinformed decisions based on misleading information.        MYTH No. 4: Enforcements and penalties for noncompliance       are harsh and unreasonable.        Menu labeling will be subject to the exact same mechanisms       and penalties as those for packaged food. FDA has maintained       its commitment to compliance outreach and education, and has       waived enforcement for the first year. Additionally, numerous       state and local governments have menu labeling requirements,       and not one chain restaurant has faced a lawsuit.        MYTH No. 5: Menu Labeling Requirements are unpopular among       American consumers.        Consumers have unequivocally maintained their support for       menu labeling, with a recent poll showing support as high as       80 percent among Democrats, Republicans and Independents.       Moreover, more than 100 public health organizations and       health professionals have voiced their opposition to H.R. 772       because it would ``undermine congressional intent to provide       access to calorie labeling in a broad range of chain food       service establishments.''        Congressional Republicans have yet again bowed to special       interest and created a carve-out for big food corporations       who do not have the best interests of Americans at heart.       Overwhelmingly, consumers want to know the nutritional       information of the foods they are eating.        Please oppose H.R. 772--as well as any efforts that seek to       undermine consumers.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cardenas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cardenas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume while I am waiting for an additional speaker.   I want to hold up this board. This is an example that the FDA gave to  businesses on how they could easily--we see all kinds of signs like  this. Sometimes it is the price at the end of the item, and, in this  case, it would be the calories.   So it talks about a slice of pizza. Now, I am feeling kind of chunky  today, and I go into the pizza parlor, and it says that for cheese  pizza, for th original, it is about 200 to 240 calories; for the thin  and crispy, 150 to 190 calories; and for pan--now, we love our pan  pizza, our deep-dish pizza in Chicago, but that is 260 to 300 calories.    So I am thinking: Yeah, I want pizza, but I think I am going to go  with the thin and crispy, which is going to save me at least 110  calories.   Now, what do I want on top? I am looking now at all the things, the  meats and the veggies that can go on top, and each one of them has  calories per slice listed there. Simple. I am a pretty good--you know,  I can do math pretty well, and I can also compare. Do I want something  that is up to 50 calories or something that is 20 calories? And I can  look at this sign and make a decision for myself.   This is not too cumbersome. This is something that could easily be  displayed. I go to a lot of restaurants that already are in compliance  and have the calories, and if I am like between the pasta and the  salmon--and, again, I want to make that decision. It is good for me to  know what is the real difference in calories.   I want to say, I started out as an activist in the grocery store. I  was a very, very young housewife many years ago, 1970, when a small  group of women got together. We called ourselves National Consumers  United because we wanted to know how old our food was in the grocery  store.   Everything was code dated. You couldn't tell how old the food was,  and we were actually told that if we didn't like it, we could shop  somewhere else. Well, we started cracking the codes like detectives,  pushing the stock boys--and they were all boys--against the shelf, and  they were telling us how they put the old stuff in front and the new  stuff in the back.   Finally, we were able to get one of our retailers to say: Come to  Jewel; our food has freshness dates. And people loved it. And it turned  out that, even over the initial opposition from the retailers, it was  good for them, because people appreciated that and went to their  stores.   Now, those dates on food are ubiquitous. Customers like it, retailers  like it, it is better, and this would be yet another thing that we  could do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pallone), the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to--you know, your friends at Jimmy John's are  not  [[Page H821]]  going to go to jail. In fact, just this past November, in new  supplemental draft guidance, FDA explained that the agency, ``does not  intend to penalize or recommend the use of criminal penalties for minor  violations.'' The FDA went on to explain that minor violations would  include inadvertently missing a calorie declaration for a standard menu  item on the buffet; minor discrepancies in the type, size, color,  contrast of calorie declarations; minimal variations or inadvertent  error that would only minimally impact the calorie declaration, such as  adding extra slices of pepperoni or an extra dollop of ketchup. This is  just not going to happen.    Let me just say, in closing, the law that Congress passed almost 8  years ago--so the calls for more time is just ridiculous--should be  allowed to go into effect. It is long past due. This is about freedom,  about freedom of consumers to make informed choices.   I know my friends across the aisle talk about freedom all the time.  This is about freedom to make choices that will help you. Empowering  consumers to make informed decisions that benefit their health is  exactly what the current law allows. H.R. 772 would undermine that  important goal.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
