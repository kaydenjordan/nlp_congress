 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, just this morning, a newspaper here on the  Hill had an article with the headline ``Experts find tax plan riddled  with glitches.'' That is because, without a single hearing on the  legislation, last week the majority rushed through a complete overhaul  of America's Tax Code for the first time in 31 years, and we never had  the opportunity to have full consideration of the merits of the  proposal. We have now discovered that they have even screwed up the  research and development tax credit, which is something American  businesses rely on every single day.   This process, I am sad to say, was no accident. Had we had time to  digest and debate this bill in the full light of day, it would have  never withstood public scrutiny. My hope is that over the coming week  or so, when the American public can actually see what is in this bill,  it will not withstand their scrutiny.   Instead of making an honest case to the people, which they deserve,  the proponents of this bill have sold this legislation not based on  what is actually in this bill but with falsehood after falsehood.   First, they claim that the tax cuts wouldn't benefit the wealthiest  Americans. Last week in Missouri, President Trump said:         This is going to cost me a fortune. . . . This is not good       for me.    That was entirely consistent with a conversation that I was part of-- which has also been reported publicly, so I am not revealing any  confidences--when the President called in from Asia to a room full of  Senators and said that this tax bill is so bad for the rich, that he  had to throw in the estate tax on top of it in order to give wealthy  Americans something, and he continues to perpetuate this myth in front  of the American people.   The reality is that under this plan, the 572,000 taxpayers in America  who are fortunate enough to make $1 million or more will have an  average tax cut of $59,000. By 2027, 62 percent of the benefits in this  plan will go to the top 1 percent--those with an income level of over  $2 million. As I said on the floor last week, we are borrowing $34  billion from our children to give to the approximately 500,000  taxpayers in America who are lucky enough to earn more than $1 million.   The point I want to make today is, that claim is false.   They also say that this plan is focused on the middle class. Last  week, President Trump said: ``The beating heart of our plan is a tax  cut for working families.'' Under this plan, in the first and best  year--and when I say ``best year,'' this means the year that the tables  look the best for the Republican argument, for the sponsors of the  bill. Every year after that, it gets worse. The 90 million taxpayers in  America who make $50,000 or less will get an average tax cut of $160 a  year. That is what they will get on average. Millions of middle-class  taxpayers, under this bill, will actually see a tax increase if this  law passes, and that number will grow over time. So it is not true that  this is a middle-class plan. This is a tax cut for the wealthiest  Americans masquerading as a middle-class tax plan.   They have passed around a few crumbs to the middle class and said:  You should be satisfied with this. We promise you that you will benefit  from the trickle-down benefits of the massive tax cut we are paying for  by borrowing from our children.   The next thing they say is, we will supercharge economic growth, and  that will lead to more jobs and higher wages. But today corporations  are sitting on record amounts of cash. The highest income Americans are  earning a larger share of income than at any point since 1928, right  before this country fell into the Great Depression.   I was in business for a long time, and I believe in our capitalist  system. I believe that people who do well and are successful are living  the American dream. But the argument that these businesses and high- income households need a tax cut just doesn't add up.   On the other hand, most Americans have not had a pay raise in a  generation, even as the cost of housing, healthcare, childcare, and  higher education climb ever out of reach every year. Helping these  Americans is not only the right thing to do, but if you want to jump- start the economy--these are the customers who shop at businesses--this  bill does nothing to address their needs.   Bank of America recently surveyed companies to ask what they would do  with their tax cuts. A vast majority said they would use the money to  pay down their debt and buy back shares. At least corporate America is  being honest about what they will do with this bill, unlike politicians  in Washington. Neither of that does much for workers. Maybe that is  why, in the full glare of the TV lights--again, you can't make it up.  It is not fake news. When President Trump's top economic adviser, just  before we were having a vote on this bill, asked a room full of CEOs to  raise their hands if they plan to reinvest the tax cuts, hardly any  did. He asked, why aren't hands up? According to Goldman Sachs, the  effect on economic growth in 2020 and beyond ``looks minimal and could  actually be slightly negative.''   Fourth and finally--and this is the one that is in some ways most  galling--they claim the tax cuts will pay for themselves. They said  that in 2001 when George Bush first cut taxes, that it would pay for  itself. It is exactly the same rhetoric we are hearing today--no  difference. Some of the people are different. Some of the people are  the same. Guess what. In 2001, after those cuts, the deficit rose. Then  they cut taxes again in 2003, and the deficit rose.  [[Page S7867]]    I remind us all that when George Bush became President, Bill Clinton  had left behind not a deficit but a surplus--a $5.6 trillion surplus  projected over 10 years.   Every credible analyst who has looked at this bill has said these tax  cuts will not pay for themselves. In the face of that history and in  the face of the experts, they continue to maintain that they will pay  for themselves.   It seems to me that if you think the best thing we can do with this  money and the best thing we can do to deal with this massive deficit is  to cut taxes for the wealthiest people in America, you should pay for  it. Pay for it. We can't get the Children's Health Insurance Program  passed--which is a drop in the bucket compared to this--because it has  been hard to find a pay-for. We can't get the disaster assistance that  so many of our States need because it is so hard to pay for. If you  have conviction that this really is going to do what you are going to  say it is going to do, pay for it. Don't borrow the money for this.   If we are actually going to borrow $1.4 trillion from our children,  then it would seem to me that we should have the decency to at least  invest in their future.   It seems Washington has the money to spend $83 billion to cut taxes  on estates worth over $11 million--which is what they call the death  tax, which now applies to estates worth over $1 million--but it can't  lift a finger to do something about the fact that today in America,  just 9 out of 100 kids born into poverty will complete college.   We apparently have the money to give the wealthiest Americans a  $59,000 tax cut, but we don't have the money to extend reliable high- speed broadband to rural America, which would cost about $40 billion-- less than 3 percent of the entire cost of the bill.   Apparently, Washington has the money to borrow $1.4 trillion from our  children, but we don't have $8 billion to pay for the Children's Health  Insurance Program, which covers 9 million kids and pregnant women who  cannot afford private health insurance.   We care enough, it seems, about special interest carve-outs that we  made in the dead of night as a way of passing this tax bill by getting  this vote based on that tax break and this vote based on that tax  break, but we cannot lift a finger to tackle the opioid epidemic  ripping across our country and claiming 50,000 lives a year.   Every year I come to Washington and hear from my colleagues on the  other side that we don't have the money to prevent forest fires across  the West, to keep rural schools open, or to find $400 million for the  Arkansas Valley Conduit and bring clean drinking water to some of the  poorest counties in Colorado. Now, they have spent $1.4 trillion not to  invest in the health and opportunity of our communities but to fritter  it away on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. If Republicans pass  this flawed, partisan, budget-busting bill, do not ever, ever let them  say to you that we don't have the money to tackle the challenges that  are most meaningful to our communities.   We should have passed a bipartisan bill to begin with. We could have  crafted a bipartisan bill. I believe the corporate rate is too high and  isn't competitive. I believe that. I know there are people on the other  side who, like Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Lee, believe we should  increase the child tax credit for middle-class families and for  families who are poor.   We had an opportunity, if we were faithful to the rhetoric I heard  around this place for years, to actually remove special interest  loopholes, focus on the middle class, and not add to our debt. For  years, on the corporate side, I have heard people say we are going to  broaden the base and reduce the rate. Instead, we are lowering the rate  without cleaning up the code. A once-in-a-generation opportunity, after  31 years, and we say, you know what, we are going the leave those  loopholes in place, and we are going to lower the rate. Forget about  broadening the base.   The same thing is true on the individual side. It is adding  complexity to our code. All this stuff that they are doing on these  passthroughs is going to add complexity and require more accountants  and more lawyers for people to fill out their tax return. This is all  as a result of the majority wanting to go it alone. When you don't look  for votes from the other side, it means you are going to be stuck with  the most extreme wing of your party. When you don't have to make a  compromise because you are reaching across the aisle, it means the  people who are the most absolutist on your side get their way. That is  what happened here.   Furthermore, there are no hard decisions made in this bill. This is  another example of Washington, unlike county commissioners, city  council people, superintendents, mayors, and Governors, who actually  have to make hard choices year in and year out to make their budgets  work--this place always finds the path of least resistance. Forget  about broadening the base and closing loopholes. We are going to give  you a tax cut because it is easier.   I really hope that over the next week, the American people learn what  is in this bill. If they do, I think we will have the chance to defeat  it and then pass a bipartisan bill, which actually cleans up the code,  lowers the corporate rates to make it more competitive, and enhances  the child tax credit to give the American people who work for a living  a tax cut.   Do you know what else we could do? We could invest in our  infrastructure to create American jobs here and be able to help ensure  this generation of Americans does what previous generations of  Americans have done, which is to invest in the next generation, to make  sure they have more opportunity, not less. This bill is the worst of  all worlds from the perspective of the high school students I met with  before I came to the floor. Not only are we not investing in them, we  are borrowing the money from them. This is no different than any one of  us living in a house and sticking our kids with the mortgage. That is  what is happening as a result of this bill, and we should defeat it.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.                               Compound Motion    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its  amendment, agree to the request of the House for a conference, and  authorize the Chair to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  on the pending compound motion occur at 3 p.m. today; further, that if  the motion is agreed to, Senators King and Stabenow each be recognized  to offer a motion to instruct conferees, and that the Senate vote on  the motions in the order listed with no intervening action or debate;  further, that there be 2 minutes of debate between each vote, equally  divided in the usual form; finally, I ask that following disposition of  the Stabenow motion, the Senate stand in recess until 5:10 p.m. to  accommodate an all-Members briefing.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, I wish to recognize and thank a dedicated  community leader and civil servant, Charlotte Bobicki. She served as my  regional representative in Alamosa, CO, and the San Luis Valley for 8  years.   Charlotte began her career as a first grade teacher in Albuquerque,  NM. In the early 1960s, she taught second grade in Yellow Springs, MD,  while her husband, Tom, served in the Army at Fort Detrick, MD.   In the late sixties, Charlotte and Tom returned to Alamosa, CO, where  she was born and had attended college. Charlotte taught fifth and sixth  graders at Alamosa Evans Intermediate School. She then worked with  special education students before transitioning to Alamosa Middle  School, where she taught math and science and served as the assistant  principal. Later she became principal at Polston Primary School.   In 1997, Charlotte was elected as an Alamosa County Commissioner,  where she served two 4-year terms. In 2005, Senator Ken Salazar hired  her as his regional representative in Alamosa. When I was appointed to  the Senate, I asked Charlotte to continue as the regional  representative to Alamosa for the San Luis Valley, and she has served  in that role for the last 8 years. Since  [[Page S7890]]  then, I have repeatedly relied on her counsel and deep knowledge of the  valley.   Her relationships and devotion to the community have been invaluable,  and I will miss her insights and perspective. It has been an honor to  work with Charlotte, and I wish her a long and happy retirement. I know  our friendship will continue for years to come.                            ____________________
