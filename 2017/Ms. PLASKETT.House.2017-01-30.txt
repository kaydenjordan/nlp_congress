 I thank Mr. Veasey.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, my  friend and colleague, the Honorable Cedric Richmond, for his continued  leadership of this caucus and of his leadership on the issues impacting  Black America and other minority communities across this great Nation.   Indeed, this evening, we are discussing not only minorities in this  country, but those who are downtrodden and other individuals around the  world who look to America for refuge, strength, and democracy.                                time  1930    I also thank my colleague, the Honorable Marc Veasey of Fort Worth,  Texas, for joining me in chairing this evening's Special Order hour,  and also my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues who are joining us  this evening to speak on these important issues.   Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to speak to those two very important  issues that go to the fabric of our founding: our ability to grow,  diversify as a Nation, by bringing in the tired and the poor, the  innovators, the ones who bring new changes to this country, and  continue its dynamic growth, as well as voting rights.   Last week, President Trump--among a number of other things--expressed  unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2016  Presidential election. The remarks that we heard would appear to be  inaccurate, reckless, and dangerous to our democracy in some of our  opinions.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I are here this evening to highlight  the real voter fraud in this country, and that is the continued  attempts to suppress minority voting rights across many States as well  as the outright denial of the right to vote for millions of Americans  living in the territories.   I want to underscore that the fight for equal voting rights for  minorities in this country did not end with the passage of the Voting  Rights Act.   In fact, today, more than 50 years after our esteemed colleague John  Lewis and others courageously marched on Selma, we have seen the United  States Supreme Court strike down one of its most important protections.   Within hours of that decision, States were already moving forward  with restrictive voter ID laws, which had already been rejected as  discriminatory under the Voting Rights Act.   Six of the 16 States that passed voter ID laws since 2010 have a  documented history of discriminating against minority voters.   The State of Alabama, in 2014, began enforcing a controversial voter  ID law that required voters to show a State-issued ID in order to vote,  and then announced plans to close 31 driver's license offices--most of  them, ironically, in rural, impoverished, majority Black counties-- making it even harder for residents to get the most common form of ID  used to vote.   In addition to the Supreme Court's action, a Federal Court in a 2015  ruling used a racist, century-old opinion of the Supreme Court to  uphold the denial of voting rights to American citizens in my home  district of the United States Virgin Islands, and the citizens and  residents of America's island territories.   They are called the insular cases, and the opinion was authored,  ironically, by the same justice who wrote Plessy v. Ferguson.   March marks 100 years that my district has been a part of this  country, but our service dates back to its very founding through the  Virgin Islander and Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. He would be, I  think, very upset to find out that people from the island in which he  came could not vote for their President and Commander in Chief, even  though the Virgin Islands and the territories have the highest rates of  military service in the United States and have exponentially higher  rates of casualties per capita in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We  believe we have earned the right to take part in this democracy.   In another example, last year, a Federal appeals court decisively  struck down a North Carolina voter identification law and noted its  provisions deliberately ``target African Americans with almost surgical  precision.'' That is a quote of the court in an effort to depress Black  turnout at the polls. That, to me, sounds like voter fraud and voter  suppression.   Mr. Speaker, these are just a few examples of the real voter fraud  happening across this country.   The members of this caucus continue to work to ensure that all  American citizens, regardless of their race, income or location, can  participate in this great democracy; and we implore the President to  direct his efforts to investigate voter fraud at these and other  issues.   We want to, as the Congressional Black Caucus, address another issue,  because we don't just represent African Americans or minorities here in  this country. We want to address an issue that is of great concern to  me and members of this caucus--and as demonstrated by massive protests  this weekend and right across the street here this evening at the  Supreme Court--the concern of a large majority of America, and that is  the President's executive order to ban refugees entering into this  country.   Banning entry to people fleeing persecution is perhaps as  diametrically opposed to the foundational fabric of this country as you  can get.   Mr. Speaker, not only is the President's refugee ban mean-spirited  and misguided, it undermines our democracy, undermines our efforts to  thwart terrorism, and is an affront to all who have sacrificed to  defend it.   Viewing all refugees fleeing as suspects shows an extremely myopic  understanding of the real threats and plays to extremist propaganda.   The refugee ban will not make us safe. It would have done nothing to  prevent the 9/11 terrorist attacks, nor the others that followed. The  terrorists of those attacks were American citizens, some of whom were  even on the terrorist watch list and still allowed to legally purchase  deadly weapons used to carry out their terrorist plot.   If this President and Congress want to protect the American people  from terrorism, they should pass the no fly, no buy legislation that  House Democrats stood to support.   Mr. Speaker, there are many of my colleagues here this evening who  would love to speak on this issue.
