 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas and our  co-anchors. I want to thank our Chairwoman, Congresswoman Beatty;  Congresswoman Sewell, as well; and to all who have participated  tonight. Thank you, Brother Torres, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of my colleague and friend, my hero, a  hero to all of us, John Lewis, and to mark the anniversary of the  Bloody Sunday march.   When our country was founded almost 250 years ago, African Americans  were denied full access and participation in society, and we have been  fighting to rectify these wrongs ever since. Among the most important  influential agents of this mission was John Lewis, the conscience of  this Congress; a mastermind of good, good, good trouble; a courageous  and compassionate man who gave everything, including his blood and his  body, to the civil rights movement.   From Selma to the U.S. House, John wasn't afraid to put everything on  the line for what he believed in. Fifty-six years ago, he marched so  that people who look like me could be full participants in our society.  Fifty-six years later, we are still fighting to be seen, to be heard,  to be counted in our democracy, a democracy that we helped to build.   For centuries, this country has made promises to marginalized  communities that have gone mostly unmet, promises of freedom, equality,  and access to opportunity.   In my home State of North Carolina, discriminatory voter regulations  plague our past and even our present. Most recently, we have  experienced a decade of voter suppression laws that target minority  voters with surgical precision and illegally gerrymandered maps that  have thrown our election into chaos. Voting in North Carolina has never  been treated as it should be, as a fundamental right for all citizens.  The For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act  will address this by cleaning up corruption in Washington and returning  us to a government of, by, and for the people.   H.R. 1 will protect and expand voting rights, restore integrity to  government, and put the priorities of the American people ahead of  special interests. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act  provides the tools to address discriminatory election practices and  will protect all Americans' right to vote.   These important bills are critical first steps toward healing our  democracy. I won't allow voter suppression to continue to be the norm  in North Carolina or in our Nation. That is why we must honor our  friend John's legacy by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act and sending both of these bills to the President's  desk.   Our power, our message.                                time  2100
