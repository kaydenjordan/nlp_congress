 Mr. President, Rod Rosenstein's nomination to be Deputy  Attorney General comes at a unique moment in history and critical  juncture for the Department of Justice, as well as for this country. It  has been 44 years since the Senate considered a Justice Department  nominee who will be in charge of an active criminal investigation into  a sitting President's  [[Page S2513]]  campaign and administration. Since the Judiciary Committee reported Mr.  Rosenstein's nomination to the Senate earlier this month, further press  reports underscore how important it is that we have an independent and  impartial investigation into Russian interference in our elections and  connections with the Trump campaign and administration.   In just the past 3 weeks, we learned that a notable Trump campaign  adviser was reportedly the subject of a FISA warrant. CNN reported that  this adviser was among those who ``Russian operatives tried to use . .  . to infiltrate the Trump campaign.'' The AP reported that Paul  Manafort, who worked for free as the Trump campaign chairman,  previously received at least $1.2 million for consulting work on behalf  of a Ukrainian ally of Russian President Putin. That is in addition to  reports that Mr. Manafort earned $10 million per year for secret work  on behalf of Vladimir Putin. We learned that President Trump's first  National Security Advisor ``failed to list payments from Russia-linked  entities'' on his financial disclosure forms. We also learned that the  President's son-in-law and top adviser failed to disclose meetings with  the Russian Ambassador and other officials on his application to obtain  top secret security clearance--just like when the Attorney General  provided false testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in  response to questions from me and Senator Franken about his own Russian  contacts.   If confirmed, Mr. Rosenstein will assume leadership of the sprawling  investigation into Russia's multifaceted attempts to interfere with our  elections, an investigation that embroils not only individuals in the  Trump campaign, but also those who are now in the President's Cabinet  and senior officials in the White House. Attorney General Sessions was  forced to recuse himself from this investigation after the press  revealed that he had misled the Judiciary Committee and the American  people about his connections to Russian officials and agents. There is  no question that the Attorney General's recusal was required--and  should have happened on day 1 after assuming office. Justice Department  regulations required him to recuse himself because of the integral role  that then-Senator Sessions played in the Trump campaign and his  continuing contacts with those directly under investigation. These  Department of Justice regulations protect the impartiality of all  Justice Department investigations.   The Justice Department's regulations regarding appointment of a  special counsel are equally significant. These regulations direct  appointment of a special counsel when there is ``a conflict of interest  for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances'' and ``it  would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel  to assume responsibility for the matter.'' The current situation  unquestionably meets that standard. Mr. Rosenstein acknowledged at his  confirmation hearing that it would be an unusual challenge to lead an  investigation that potentially includes the Attorney General, his  direct supervisor. This investigation now not only includes Mr.  Rosenstein's potential boss, but also several others inside the White  House. Americans deserve an investigation that is independent and  inspires public confidence, and that requires appointment of a special  counsel who is free from political influence. This issue is too  important for us to skew for partisan motivations. Country must come  before party, and I hope and trust Mr. Rosenstein will understand that  if he is confirmed.   We know that this administration and this President have already  interfered with the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into  Russian activity and connections to the Trump campaign. Devin Nunes,  the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, recused himself from  his own committee's investigation after what Ryan Lizza of the New  Yorker called a ``coordinated effort between the Trump Administration  and [Chairman] Nunes . . . to manufacture a fake scandal'' in order to  distract from, as well as obstruct, any real investigation. Earlier  this month, President Trump even said that ``it's not too late'' to  fire FBI Director Comey. This administration cannot be trusted to  respect the independence of any investigation, which is why we need an  outside special counsel. Whoever assumes the role of Deputy Attorney  General in this administration will face extraordinary tests of  integrity. Mr. Rosenstein has a reputation for integrity that is  unusual for this administration's nominees, and I hope he is up to the  challenge.   We already know from the intelligence community's public report that  Russian President Putin waged a multifaceted influence campaign to  delegitimize Secretary Clinton and help Donald Trump win the  Presidency. Worse, he intended to undermine public faith in our  democratic process. This interference did not end on November 8th. It  is ongoing and, according to the intelligence community, President  Putin will continue using cyberattacks and propaganda campaigns to  undermine our future elections--but there is still much we do not know.   We need a thorough, independent investigation. President Putin's goal  last year was to undermine our democratic institutions--to corrode  Americans' trust and faith in our government. If we do not get to the  bottom of Russian interference, he will have been successful, and he  will no doubt do it again. I hope that Mr. Rosenstein will do the right  thing and appoint a special counsel to lead a truly independent  investigation--one in which all Americans can have confidence.   If confirmed, Mr. Rosenstein will face other critical tests as well,  including whether he will continue to support the Justice Department's  Smart on Crime initiative, focusing the most serious criminal penalties  on the most serious offenders. With his 27 years of experience in the  Justice Department, I hope that Mr. Rosenstein will be an independent  check on the excesses of this administration, which has already sought  to undermine the principle of judicial review. He has served as U.S.  Attorney under both Democratic and Republican administrations, so I  hope that, as Deputy Attorney General and as Acting Attorney General in  matters relating to the Trump campaign, he will remember that he is not  the President's attorney, but the people's attorney.    Mr. President, tomorrow, April 26, is World Intellectual  Property Day, an opportunity for people around the world to appreciate  and learn about the role of intellectual property rights in promoting  innovation. Our Founders believed that the right to enjoy the benefit  of one's own inventions was so important to the progress of science  that they included it in the Constitution. More than 200 years later,  limited exclusive rights for inventors continue to incentivize the  research and development and make the United States the global leader  in innovation.   In the spirit of this year's theme, ``Innovation--Improving Lives,''  I am proud to partner with Senator Grassley to reintroduce the Patents  for Humanity Program Improvement Act. Patents for Humanity is a perfect  example of how intellectual property rights encourage inventors to  develop creative solutions to some of the world's most pressing  humanitarian challenges.   Since 2012, the Patents for Humanity Program of the U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office, PTO, has honored patent holders whose inventions  apply cutting-edge technology to meet global challenges in medicine,  nutrition, sanitation, energy, and living standards. The winning  inventors receive a certificate to accelerate future PTO processes,  such as a reexamination or additional patent applications. The Patents  for Humanity Program provides an important incentive for talented  innovators to use their expertise and intellect to enhance the public  good.   The winners of the Patents for Humanity Program have addressed some  of the toughest challenges in the developing world. One lab developed a  vaccine cooler that has been used in the fight against the Ebola virus.  A nonprofit organization created a strand of rice enriched with vitamin  A to prevent a nutritional deficiency that is the leading killer of  children globally. A social enterprise made a low-cost solar light that  can replace dangerous kerosene lamps in areas without electricity.  These life saving inventions are exactly the kind of innovations that  our intellectual property system should incentivize.   In 2012, the Director of the PTO testified before the Judiciary  Committee that Patents for Humanity would attract even more innovators  if the winners could transfer their acceleration certificates to a  third party. Frequently, successful small businesses and individual  inventors are unable to continue their projects or are prevented from  taking advantage of the accelerated process because of acquisitions and  reorganizations. Transferability of the award certificates would  increase the incentive for these small businesses and individuals to  develop innovative technologies that would benefit the public and  international development.   This bipartisan legislation would allow Patents for Humanity winners  to transfer their acceleration certificates. This straightforward,  common sense reform to the Patents for Humanity Program passed the  Senate by unanimous consent last Congress. I am hopeful that it will  again this Congress and that we can finally enact into law this simple  improvement to a successful program. We should take every opportunity  we can to encourage and support enterprising Americans with bright  ideas that will benefit both our country and the world.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Perdue, Mr. Paul,          and Mr. Lee):   S. 932. A bill to amend the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to  provide that any estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office  or the Joint Committee on Taxation shall include costs relating to  servicing the public debt, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  the Budget.
