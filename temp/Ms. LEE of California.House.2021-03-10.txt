 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  rescue plan.   I thank Chairman Yarmuth, the Speaker, and all the committee chairs  for this historic and transformative bill.   We have struggled through a year of gross neglect. People have  suffered. They have died. They have lost their jobs and businesses.  Families are living on the edge. But today, thank God, help is on the  way.   We included provisions to ensure that communities of color  disproportionately impacted by the virus get the care and vaccines they  desperately need.   We included support for State and local governments, for our  essential workers, resources to help our schools open safely, child tax  credits that will cut child poverty in half, and investments to crush  the virus worldwide.   We will, however, continue to fight for a $15 minimum wage to lift  low-income people out of poverty.   I ask for an ``aye'' vote.
