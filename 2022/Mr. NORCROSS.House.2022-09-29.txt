 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my late  Congressman and Governor, Jim Florio, a dedicated public servant who  cared deeply for those in New Jersey and the Nation.   He served our country in the Navy. He continued that service when he  returned home in the New Jersey Assembly for 4 years, followed by 15  years in this House of Representatives. Then, he returned to our State  to become the 41st Governor.   He was an environmentalist long before it was popular. Here in  Congress, he authored the Superfund Act, one of the most remarkable  pieces of legislation in terms of cleaning up hazardous sites across  the country. As Governor, he signed the Clean Water Act, one of the  strictest in the Nation at the time. Combined, these achievements saved  countless lives across this great country.   He did not work through political division but by doing what he knew  was right. That is why he received the Kennedy Profiles in Courage  Award.   On behalf of myself, the State of New Jersey, and the Nation, we are  grateful for his service to our State. We lost one of the greatest  champions, and he will be missed by all who had the honor of knowing  him. My deepest sympathies to his family, his loved ones.                            ____________________
