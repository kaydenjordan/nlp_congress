 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance  of buying American-grown flowers. Whether it is celebrating a wedding,  a graduation, or sending condolences, flowers have been used to mark  significant occasions for thousands of years. I have seen the value  this industry adds to our economy and communities during my visits with  our hardworking central coast growers.   The cut-flower industry generates thousands of jobs and produces  significant economic activity each year through flower farmers,  distributors, and florists.   California grows an astonishing 70 percent of American-grown flowers,  and yet only a fraction of the flowers sold across the country were  grown here. That must change.  [[Page H3919]]    Last week, Senator Feinstein and I introduced a resolution to  designate July as American-Grown Flower and Foliage Month to encourage  consumers to shop local and buy flowers with a certified American-grown  label. By passing H. Res. 542, we will honor the beauty this industry  brings to our homes year-round and help keep our American-grown flower  industry prosperous.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.                            ____________________
