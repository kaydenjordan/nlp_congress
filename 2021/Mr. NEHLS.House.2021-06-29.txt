 Mr. Speaker, the Biden border crisis continues raging on  our southern border. Cartels are getting rich, migrants are getting  abused and assaulted, and Americans are becoming victims of crime.   With the record number of illegal aliens attempting to flood across  our border, what has the Biden administration done?   Nothing.   For months now, the Biden administration has been denying this crisis  exists; telling the American people there is no crisis; telling the  American people the border is closed. But we all know better.   I saw it myself firsthand when I visited Del Rio, Texas, a place  where every day, around 3:00 p.m., buses pulled up to the Mexican side  of the border and unloaded hundreds of illegal aliens. They then wade  through knee-high water of the Rio Grande and into our country. Once  they arrive on the American side, they are promptly picked up by Border  Patrol agents in air-conditioned vans, given a wristband, and away they  go to a city near you.   This happens tens of thousands of times every single day and there is  no end in sight, not until we revert to Trump's policies.                            ____________________
