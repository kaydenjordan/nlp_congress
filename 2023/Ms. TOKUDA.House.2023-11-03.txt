 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of one of  my favorite Republicans and former colleague, the late Hawaii State  Senator Sam Slom.   There is much to be said about the boy from Allentown, Pennsylvania,  who found his way to Hawaii in the sixties and made our islands his  home.   For 20 years Sam represented East Honolulu's ninth senatorial  district, and for almost one-half of that time, he was the sole  Republican member of the Hawaii Senate.   He read every bill and every resolution, and he defied time and space  to try to attend every committee meeting and vote, earning the self- imposed nickname ``the Lone Ranger.''   I had the honor and privilege of serving alongside Sam. Yes, we  disagreed on many things, but more often than not, we saw eye to eye,  especially when it came to lowering costs for working families and  being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.   Sam was a statesman to the very end, and given the partisan times we  find ourselves in, I truly miss my friend.   Mahalo, Sam, for your service and your friendship. As the Lone  Ranger, you challenged our minds and won our hearts.                            ____________________
