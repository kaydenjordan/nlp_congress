 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  the rule and passage of H.R. 393, to allow retired General James Mattis  to become our Nation's 26th Secretary of Defense.   First of all, I would like to say that I believe civilian control  over our military is one of the pivotal principles of our Republic.  This body must ensure that our military leaders remain accountable to  civilian authorities lest we put our hard-won liberties at risk.   That is why, before I decided to vote for this waiver, I had to  answer two very important questions. First, does the appointment of  James Mattis present any threat at all to the concept of civilian  control of our military?   The answer is clearly no. James Mattis has demonstrated his openness  as a straight shooter throughout his long career. I am confident he  will continue to candidly face the problems in the Department of  Defense and be a positive force for change.   It is James Mattis' record of reform-minded openness, his scholarly  understanding of history and military matters, and his almost 4-year  separation from defense interests, that assures me that this waiver, as  a unique measure, poses no risk to civilian control of the military.   The second question, then: Is the appointment of James Mattis worth  waiving the 7-year requirement?   The answer is clearly yes. The United States Armed Forces are at a  pivotal moment in their history. After 8 years of neglect under this  administration, our military has been brought to its lowest point in  the past 4 decades.   James Mattis has the experience, knowledge, and leadership skills to  rally the services while they rebuild for the next 4 decades. He will  start on day one with a strong grasp of the challenges facing our  military and with the ideas to meet those challenges. That is why I  support this one-time waiver, which will allow James Mattis to serve as  our Nation's 26th Secretary of Defense.
