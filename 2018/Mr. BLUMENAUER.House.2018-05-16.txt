 Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed listening to my colleague from  California talk about his deep concerns and reservations about the farm  bill that is slowly grinding its way, perhaps, toward the floor being  considered today by the Rules Committee.   While we have somewhat different perspectives and different  districts, we are united in the fact that this farm bill does not  remotely reflect the needs of the American public. One of the problems  is that we fail to address the disparate array of subsidies under the  farm bill, benefiting a few States, a few districts, a few types of  farming operations, and ignoring the rest.   The famous nutrition professor, Marion Nestle, of NYU has written a  great essay, ``The Farm Bill Drove Me Insane,'' dealing with her  attempts to try to understand and rationalize it.   One of the most memorable portions is how she describes what an  American diet would look like if it was based on the way that our farm  bill subsidies are arrayed. The diet would consist of a giant corn  fritter because 78 percent of the farm bill resources goes to the  production of industrial corn and soy, not fruits and vegetables, which  would be a tiny microscopic part of that plate. There would be a little  hamburger patty because that is less than 5 percent, and there would be  a little cup of milk. And she points out that that meal, based on the  farm bill allocation, would be accompanied by a giant napkin because 13  percent of the farm bill is allocated to cotton subsidies.   The farm bill shortchanges the vast majority of American farmers and  ranchers, who are not heavily subsidized, who produce food--the fruits,  vegetables, and orchard, products that deal with nurseries. The  majority of States and the majority of farmers and ranchers are shut  out.   There is an area of crop insurance subsidy. I will tell you, I was  stunned when I read the Statement of Administration Policy because they  are concerned with two areas, one dealing with a necessary subsidy for  people with nutrition assistance. They are afraid that a few poor  people would have access to lower cost food through the Food Stamp  program. They want to crank that down, limit it, and force people to  work.   Well, if you look at the farm bill that they are supporting, they are  doing nothing to encourage wealthy farming interests to rely less on  subsidization. They are concerned about expanding the subsidizes for  people under the SNAP program.   At the same time, we are given a farm bill that explodes the limits  on the amount of subsidy that can flow to wealthy farming and ranching  interests, and it expands the subsidy so that nieces and nephews and  cousins are eligible. People who aren't working on the ranch are  somehow eligible for Federal largesse, but they would deny hungry  people, or near hungry people, low-income people, that same sort of  benefit.   There are also concerns that they want to crank down on the  environmental programs; they want to make them more productive. Yet  this farm  [[Page H3984]]  bill ignores the fact that we right now do not have enough money for  the conservation programs to help farmers and ranchers who want to  improve the environment.   Only one in four grants gets funded, some of them swallowed up by big  industrial agricultural interests that could afford to take care of  their own environmental problems. But more telling is that they allow  payment for things that don't even improve the environment.   Why allow large agribusiness to compete for scarce environmental  funding for things like hog lagoons and fences. That is the cost of  doing business. That doesn't improve the environment.   Mr. Speaker, I have introduced legislation that would correct this in  terms of cutting down, capping, and containing unnecessary subsidies;  reducing overly generous crop insurance; and making conservation  programs performance driven. I hope the day will come when we might be  able to debate something like that on the floor of the House.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in  allowing us to join in this conversation, and I strongly identify with  what the Representative from the other Portland just said.   In fact, North Haven, I am reflecting right now that, in 3 short  months, during the summer recess, I plan on sitting on a deck looking  out at North Haven and enjoying looking for those eagles that have been  rescued and are very much in evidence in her beautiful part of the  country.   She is not just an advocate for the environment and for agriculture;  she is a practitioner. And I have had an opportunity to tour her  magnificent farm in North Haven that is really a model of  sustainability, showing really what value-added agriculture is,  reclaiming the history of that island in terms of the bounty of the  land.   But that doesn't happen by accident. It takes commitment and  followthrough and, step by step, trying to harness the forces of sound  agricultural policies, good environmental stewardship to be able to add  value while it protects the environment.   So I am looking forward to seeing her handiwork again this summer,  and I deeply appreciate her leadership tonight in terms of the  environment, what she cares about in terms of nutrition, celebrity  chefs. There are a whole range of things, and it underscores why we are  here talking about the farm bill.   It is the most important legislation that most Americans pay no  attention to. It is the most important piece of legislation that,  sadly, few in the House of Representatives really drill down and look  at what is in it. It will be the most important health bill that this  Congress will pass or consider for the remainder of this session. We  still subsidize a diet that makes Americans sick, paying too much to  the wrong people to grow the wrong food in the wrong places, and it is  the most important environmental bill, bar none.   If you care about emissions of greenhouse gasses, the agriculture  sector plays a role--9 percent, it is claimed statistically. But if you  factor in all of the inputs in terms of pesticides and transportation,  refrigeration, you will find that it is far greater than that, and  these are elements that are within our control.   The gentlewoman referenced the conservation programs. It is  interesting to me, in reading the guidance that the  [[Page H4134]]  administration has put out about the farm bill and what they tout, they  want to promote independence. They don't want to support dependency.  They want to have higher performance standards for projects that they  are involved with, yet the farm bill that is being considered now by  the Republicans undercuts performance standards.   When we eliminate, as the gentlewoman said, the Conservation Reserve  Program, only one out of four conservation grants is currently funded.  There is not enough money, and they are going to reduce it $1 billion  more while eliminating the Conservation Stewardship Program. It is also  stunning when there is an opportunity to provide performance standards  for conservation.   I have offered an amendment before the Rules Committee that would  apply conservation standards, that you get conservation funding if you  produce results. But that is not the way it works now.   The EQIP program, which hands out grants to help farmers improve the  environment, you look at the practices that are authorized under this  bill, that are funded under this bill, there are six or eight of them  that actually hurt the environment. They are not required to enhance  their environment. We pay for things like fencing and hog lagoons for  big operations that ought to be able to pay their own way, and they  take that money that would be available to other farmers and ranchers  to be able to fund programs that would actually enhance the  environment.   I deeply appreciate the gentlewoman's leadership, and I appreciate  what my friend from Colorado has offered up. We have other colleagues  here who have some things to say. I will hang tight for a moment in  case we run out of speakers, but I want to cheer folks on because it is  time that we put the spotlight on this egregious bill, the King  amendment, the lack of accountability, and wasteful spending.                                time  2015     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  appreciate that.   It has been fun working with Congresswoman Pingree, with my friend  Ron Kind, looking at these programs over the years.   There is a great essay written by Marion Nestle, an author, a  professor of nutrition at NYU, and the title of the essay is ``The Farm  Bill Drove Me Insane.'' As she tried to actually teach a class about  the farm bill to graduate students, she dove into it and found that it  was just hopelessly complex.   What I appreciate about working with the gentlewoman from Maine and  the gentleman from Wisconsin is it doesn't have to be that complex.   We ought to be able to strip this away, have a full and honest  debate, and get to the basics that make the most difference for the  American public.   Hopefully this thing will collapse, and we will have some time this  year to work on it and make it better.
