 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of an amendment to  the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations  Division that seeks to increase support for water reclamation projects.   Millions of people and businesses throughout our country are able to  enjoy a stable water supply thanks to this vital infrastructure.   One example is the Equus Beds Aquifer Recharge, Storage and Recovery  project in Wichita, Kansas.   Equus Beds provides the main water supply for nearly 500,000 people  in Wichita and the surrounding region.   In addition to servicing citizens, it is also vital for businesses  and farms throughout the entire area that includes cities such as  Wichita, Halstead, Newton, Hutchinson, McPherson, Valley Center and  others.   Equus Beds became a key component of Wichita's Integrated Local Water  Supply Plan in 1993, when it was determined that the city's water  supply would not meet demand by the year 2015.   Thankfully since its implementation, the Equus Beds Aquifer has  recharged 2.5 billion gallons of water to continue meeting the region's  needs.   Clearly, water reclamation projects like Equus Beds are critical to  sustaining the economy and quality of life in Wichita and throughout  our country.   Today I urge support for amendment 95 to H.R. 2740 to increase  support in the bill for water reclamation projects like the Equus Beds  Aquifer.   I ask my colleagues to approve this amendment en bloc.
