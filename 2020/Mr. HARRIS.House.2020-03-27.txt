 Mr. Speaker, we are here a week too late, not because we  didn't know what our citizens and businesses needed, but because too  many in the congressional swamp felt that you never let a serious  crisis go to waste: filling this important bill with pork and earmarks,  like $25 million to the Kennedy Center, $57 million to NPR, $75 million  to the National Endowment for the Humanities instead of more masks and  ventilators.   But, Mr. Speaker, many Americans do need our thanks:   Thank you to the frontline healthcare workers who selflessly and  compassionately care for victims of the Wuhan virus.   Thank you to President Trump for his leadership and for his  transparency with the American people in this time of crisis.   Thank you to my anesthesiologist colleagues who have stepped up to  the challenge. They are trained in intensive care, and the ventilators  on their anesthesia machines could prove critical if this fight  escalates.   Finally, thank you to all those Americans who followed the  President's recommendation on 15 Days to Slow the Spread of the Wuhan  virus.
