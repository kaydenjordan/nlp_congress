SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act may be construed as conferring upon any       person, State, local, or Tribal government the authority to       determine the safety of any AAM operation or the feasibility       of simultaneous operations by AAM and conventional aircraft       within any given area of the National Airspace System.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 6270, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6270, legislation sponsored by  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen) and the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).   With the recent passage of the landmark Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act, Congress renewed its commitment to robust Federal investment  in the Nation's airport infrastructure to address the rising demand for  air travel. As the needs of the traveling public evolve, we must build  on this momentum to leverage innovative aviation technologies, such as  advanced air mobility, called AAM, to help address future challenges.   The success of these efforts depends on early and consistent  engagement with State and local communities to ensure that AAM  infrastructure is safely integrated into the national airspace system,  accessible to all, and built to the appropriate Federal standards.   H.R. 6270 continues Congress' thorough oversight of the emerging AAM  industry and helps local communities across the country prepare for and  take advantage of the tremendous potential of this technology.   The bill invests $25 million to establish a 2-year U.S. Department of  Transportation pilot program to fund comprehensive planning grants for  State, local, territorial, and Tribal governments to prepare for the  deployment of AAM vertiports and related infrastructure in their  communities.   These comprehensive plans may include details on potential vertiport  locations; physical and digital infrastructure needs; potential  environmental effects; connectivity to existing transportation systems;  and strategies to ensure community engagement and equity.   The bill's pilot program would also provide limited funding for some  public vertiport construction activities, such as design, bidding, and  environmental study activities, only after the FAA has certified at  least two AAM aircraft models, issued airworthiness determinations for  at least two AAM operators, and published an advisory circular on  vertiport design and performance and siting standards, among other  criteria.   H.R. 6270 has the support of cosponsors from both sides of the aisle  and the endorsement of several organizations representing the U.S.  aviation and aerospace sector, and State and local governments.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bipartisan legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to reiterate, we have an emerging technology. For once,  we need to get ahead of the curve, including the FAA, so that we are  not impeding the tremendous potential of AAM across so many sectors and  virtually every community in America.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 516) to plan for and coordinate efforts to integrate advanced  air mobility aircraft into the national airspace system, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 516         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 516, the Advanced Air Mobility  Coordination and Leadership Act.   Last November, this Chamber took a critical first step in fostering  innovative advanced air mobility, AAM, in the U.S., by passing with an  overwhelming majority, H.R. 1339, companion legislation also titled  Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act.   That bill would establish an interagency working group comprised of  the Federal Government, States, localities, the aviation industry,  labor unions, and other key stakeholders to plan and coordinate efforts  to safely integrate AAM operations into our airspace system.   Today, we are one step closer to making what was once only thought of  as a figment of the imagination--as people used to refer to flying cars  and things like that. S. 516, as amended, reflects a bipartisan,  bicameral agreement that will make this a reality.   It will require the development of an AAM National Strategy; include  a Government Accountability Office study on the interests, roles and  responsibilities of Federal, State, local, and Tribal governments  affected by AAM aircraft and operations; and direct the Department of  Transportation to conduct an evaluation of whether the AAM working  group should be terminated after the group submits its required  recommendations to Congress. It will incorporate relevant language and  technical corrections from H.R. 1339; and clarify the key stakeholders  with whom the new AAM working group will collaborate.   The Federal Government industry stakeholders alike recognize the  potential for AAM aircraft to alleviate traffic congestion, reduce the  current burden on surface infrastructure, create good-paying U.S. jobs,  and provide a more environmentally sustainable mode of daily  transportation.   As these new aircraft emerge in an already complex national airspace,  we must be certain that they are safe for  [[Page H5456]]  those on board, those on the ground, and fully and safely and  effectively integrated into the national airspace system.   The interagency working group and subsequent AAM National Strategy on  safety, security, and infrastructure will help support the development  and deployment of AAM and advance U.S. leadership in this growing  global industry.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsors of the original House bill,  Representatives Sharice Davids and Garret Graves, for their bipartisan  effort.   Mr. Speaker, I support S. 516, as amended, and I urge all my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have just heard the bipartisan consensus expressed by  the two speakers on that side about the looming extraordinary  importance of this industry and how we have to get it right as we move  forward to not impede it but also to protect safety.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly recommend this legislation to my colleagues,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2020) to provide for an online repository for certain  reporting requirements for recipients of Federal disaster assistance,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2020         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Post-Disaster Assistance       Online Accountability Act''.       SEC. 2. SUBPAGE FOR TRANSPARENCY OF DISASTER ASSISTANCE.         (a) Establishment of Repository for Reporting       Requirements.--The Director of the Office of Management and       Budget, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury       and the head of each covered Federal agency, shall establish       a subpage within the website established under section 2 of       the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of       2006 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note) to publish the information       required to be made available to the public under this       section.        (b) Submission of Information by Federal Agencies.--Not       later than 30 days after  [[Page H5457]]       the end of a calendar quarter, each covered Federal agency       that made disaster assistance available to an eligible       recipient during such quarter shall, in coordination with the       Director of the Office of Management and Budget, make       available to the public on the subpage established under       subsection (a) the information described in subsection (c),       and ensure that any data asset of the agency is machine-      readable.        (c) Information Required.--The information described in       this subsection is, with respect to disaster assistance       provided by the covered Federal agency--        (1) the total amount of disaster assistance provided by the       agency during such quarter;        (2) the amount of disaster assistance provided by the       agency that was expended or obligated to projects or       activities; and        (3) a detailed list of all projects or activities for which       disaster assistance dispersed by the agency was expended,       obligated, or used, including--        (A) the name of the project or activity;        (B) a description of the project or activity;        (C) an evaluation of the completion status of the project       or activity;        (D) any award identification number assigned to the       project;        (E) the Catalog for Disaster Assistance number assigned by       the Federal Emergency Management Agency;        (F) the location of the project, including ZIP codes; and        (G) any reporting requirement information being collected       by a covered Federal agency with respect to that agency's       disaster assistance.        (d) Guidance.--Each covered Federal agency, in coordination       with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and       the Secretary of the Treasury, shall issue such guidance as       is necessary to meet the requirements of this Act.        (e) Agreement With Private Entity.--The Director, if       necessary for purposes of transparency, may enter into an       agreement with a private entity, including a nonprofit       organization, to develop the subpage required under this       section.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act, the following definitions apply:        (1) Covered federal agency.--The term ``covered Federal       agency'' means--        (A) any agency providing assistance under the Robert T.       Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42       U.S.C. 5121 et seq.);        (B) the Small Business Administration; and        (C) the Department of Housing and Urban Development.        (2) Disaster assistance.--The term ``disaster assistance''       means any funds that are made available by the Federal       Government in response to a specified natural disaster,       including--        (A) any assistance provided by the Administrator of the       Small Business Administration as a result of a disaster       declared under section 7(b) of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 636(b));        (B) any assistance provided by the Secretary of Housing and       Urban Development for--        (i) activities authorized under title I of the Housing and       Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.)       related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration       of infrastructure and housing, and economic revitalization in       the most impacted and distressed areas resulting from a major       disaster declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster       Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.);       and        (ii) flood insurance coverage provided under the National       Flood Insurance Program pursuant to the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.); and        (C) any assistance provided under the Robert T. Stafford       Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121       et seq.).        (3) Eligible recipient.--The term ``eligible recipient''--        (A) means any entity that receives disaster assistance       directly from the Federal Government (including disaster       assistance received through grant, loan, or contract) other       than an individual; and        (B) includes a State that receives disaster assistance.        (4) Specified natural disaster.--The term ``specified       natural disaster'' means--        (A) a fire on public or private forest land or grassland       described in section 420 of the Robert T.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2020.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2020. This bill would create a  new online system for tracking Federal disaster projects and  assistance.   When a major disaster strikes, the American people should know how  and where their disaster funds are being spent without wading through  reams of governmental paperwork. This legislation simplifies the data  collection process for Federal disaster recovery projects.   To increase transparency to the public, the bill would also create a  page on USAspending.gov where everyone can track agency disaster  recovery activities and the amount of assistance expended by an agency  on a quarterly basis. Federal agencies need to be held accountable to  the victims of disasters so that they can have peace of mind when they  are at their most vulnerable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides to join me and  support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Small Business,                                      Washington, DC, June 10, 2022.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio: I am writing with respect to H.R.       2020, the ``Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability       Act''. Thank you for consulting with the Committee on Small       Business regarding the matters in H.R. 2020 that fall within       the Committee's jurisdiction.        As a result of your consultation with us on this measure       and in order to expeditiously move the bill to the floor, I       forego further consideration of H.R. 2020. The Committee on       Small Business takes this action with our mutual       understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues that fall within our       jurisdiction. Further, I request your support for the       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from the       Committee on Small Business during any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming our understanding regarding H.R. 2020 and would       ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Committee Report and the Congressional Record       during floor consideration of the measure. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                                Nydia M. Velazquez,      Chairwoman.                                   ____           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, June 10, 2022.      Hon. Nydia M. Velazquez,      Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ms. Velazquez: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2020, the Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability       Act. I appreciate your decision to waive formal consideration       of the bill.        I agree that the Committee on Small Business has valid       jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important       legislation, and I further agree that by forgoing formal       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Small Business is       not waiving any jurisdiction over any relevant subject       matter. Additionally, if requested I will support the       appointment of conferees from the Committee on Small Business       should a House-Senate conference be convened on this       legislation. Finally, this exchange of letters will be       included in the Congressional Record when the bill is       considered on the floor.        Thank you again, and I look forward to continuing to work       collaboratively with the Committee on Small Business on this       important issue.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, as the gentleman has just said, having some  transparency when you have a number of Federal agencies coming into a  community that has just been devastated, whether it is in my region by  wildfire or on the Gulf Coast by a hurricane or in the Midwest and the  South by tornado, people need timely and good information about how the  disaster relief is flowing from the Federal Government, in what  amounts, and to what places so that there can be actual oversight by  people who were directly impacted by the disaster.   That is why I believe this legislation has tremendous merit. I  recommend that my colleagues lend their full support to it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE, Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2020,  the ``Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act.''   H.R. 2020 is a bipartisan initiative to establish an online  repository for reporting requirements for recipients of Federal  disaster assistance.   I would like to thank my colleague, Delegate Gonzalez-Colon, for  introducing this legislation to increase transparency of post-disaster  assistance.   The Office of Management and Budget (0MB) along with the Sectretary  of the Treasury and the head of each covered Federal agency will  collaborate to create a subpage within the website,  www.usaspending.gov, to make the following information available to the  public:   Total amount of disaster assistance provided by the agency during  quarter;   Amount of disaster assistance provided by the agency that was  expanded or obligated to projects or activities; and   Detailed list of all projects or activities for which disaster  assistance dispersed by the agency was expended including:   Name and description of project or activity;   Evaluation of the completion status;   Any award identification number assigned;   Catalog Disaster Assistance number assigned by FEMA;   Location of the project, including zip codes; and   Any reporting requirement information collected by a covered Federal  agency with respect to that agency's disaster assistance.   H.R. 2020 will require the submission of information by covered  federal agencies every 3 months.   When enacted, H.R. 2020 would include natural disasters that are  major disasters or emergency declared by the President as well as any  other natural disaster made by the Federal Government.   Within the past decade, we have witnessed an increase in the number  of natural disasters and extreme weather as a result of climate change.   In 2021, the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information  (NCEI) found that the United States experienced 20 separate billion- dollar weather and climate disasters.   Houston alone has been the site of 7 federally declared disasters  since 2015 notably including Hurricane Harvey and Winter Storm Uri.   The growing number of natural disasters makes this legislation  increasingly relevant to maintain accountability of post-disaster  funds.   H.R. 2020 creates a necessary online reference portal that will be  accessible by mayors, legislators, and residents to know the status of  funds and their use.   These funds are vital to communities devastated by natural disasters  and it is important that we ensure the funds are used for their  assigned use.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2020.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7211) to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act, review a final rule of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7211         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small State and Rural Rescue       Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF SMALL STATE AND RURAL ADVOCATE.         Section 326(c) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief       and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5165d) is amended--        (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (2);        (2) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and        (3) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:        ``(3) assist States in the collection and presentation of       material in the disaster or emergency declaration request       relevant to demonstrate severe localized impacts within the       State for a specific incident, including--        ``(A) the per capita personal income by local area, as       calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis;        ``(B) the disaster impacted population profile, as reported       by the Bureau of the Census, including--        ``(i) the percentage of the population for whom poverty       status is determined;        ``(ii) the percentage of the population already receiving       Government assistance such as Supplemental Security Income       and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits;        ``(iii) the pre-disaster unemployment rate;        ``(iv) the percentage of the population that is 65 years       old and older;        ``(v) the percentage of the population 18 years old and       younger;        ``(vi) the percentage of the population with a disability;        ``(vii) the percentage of the population who speak a       language other than English and speak English less than `very       well'; and        ``(viii) any unique considerations regarding American       Indian and Alaskan Native Tribal populations raised in the       State's request for a major disaster declaration that may not       be reflected in the data points referenced in this       subparagraph;        ``(C) the impact to community infrastructure, including--        ``(i) disruptions to community life-saving and life-      sustaining services;        ``(ii) disruptions or increased demand for essential       community services; and        ``(iii) disruptions to transportation, infrastructure, and       utilities; and        ``(D) any other information relevant to demonstrate severe       local impacts.''.       SEC. 3. GAO REVIEW OF A FINAL RULE.         (a) In General.--The Comptroller General shall conduct a       review of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's       implementation of its final rule, published on March 21,       2019, amending section 206.48(b) of title 44, Code of Federal       Regulations (regarding factors considered when evaluating a       Governor's request for a major disaster declaration), which       revised the factors that the Agency considers when evaluating       a Governor's request for a major disaster declaration       authorizing individual assistance under the Robert T.       Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42       U.S.C. 5121 et seq).        (b) Scope.--The review required under subsection (a) shall       include the following:        (1) An assessment of the criteria used by the Agency to       assess individual assistance requests following a major       disaster declaration authorizing individual assistance.        (2) An assessment of the consistency with which the Agency       uses the updated Individual Assistance Declaration Factors       when assessing the impact of individual communities after a       major disaster declaration.        (3) An assessment of the impact, if any, of using the       updated Individual Assistance Declaration Factors has had on       equity in disaster recovery outcomes.        (4) Recommendations to improve the use of the Individual       Assistance Declaration Factors to increase equity in disaster       recovery outcomes.        (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the  [[Page H5459]]       Comptroller General shall submit to the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on the review       required under this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 7211.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7211. This bill amends the  Stafford Act to expand the responsibilities of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency's Small State Rural Advocate so they can better  assist smaller States and rural communities that have difficulty  dealing with the forms and all the requirements to apply for disaster  funding.   When disaster strikes the heart of a small or rural community, a  significant percentage of the overall infrastructure or housing stock  is often damaged or destroyed. However, the community's size may make  the total dollar amount of damage seem too low for FEMA to authorize  Federal assistance.   This legislation will enable the Small State Rural Advocate to better  help States demonstrate localized impact when applying for Federal  disaster aid. It also directs the advocate to consider factors such as  the impacted jurisdiction's per capita income and poverty status, among  other factors.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I urge my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to join me in support of this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, thank the gentleman from New York for his  leadership on this issue and his friendship on the committee. We are  both moving on to maybe greener pastures, but this is an important  piece of legislation as part of his legacy. There is much more to it,  but at this point, this will be something that will help people around  the country.   I lost the entire town of Blue River in my district in the Labor Day  fires just 2 years ago. We had winds that we had never experienced  before, gusting up to hurricane force down and out of the Cascade  Mountains. A power line broke and started an inferno that moved at an  incredible pace down the valley.   We are lucky a lot of people didn't die. The evacuation--there is  only one way in and one way out of that town, and it is a miracle that  more people weren't trapped. It was an extraordinary effort.   The town, except for the high school, which was a little way out of  town, was totally devastated. They are now struggling back. They didn't  have any technical expertise, in terms of a professional city manager  or a grant writer or anything like that.   The State has rendered a lot of assistance to them, as has the county  and as has the regional FEMA office. So, they are beginning to rebuild.  This legislation will make it a lot easier for communities like that in  the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3580) to amend title 46, United States Code, with respect to  prohibited acts by ocean common carriers or marine terminal operators,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3580         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ocean Shipping Reform Act of       2022''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES.         Section 40101 of title 46, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:        ``(2) ensure an efficient, competitive, and economical       transportation system in the ocean commerce of the United       States;'';        (2) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``and supporting       commerce'' after ``needs''; and        (3) by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the following:        ``(4) promote the growth and development of United States       exports through a competitive and efficient system for the       carriage of goods by water in the foreign commerce of the       United States, and by placing a greater reliance on the       marketplace.''.       SEC. 3. SERVICE CONTRACTS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 3580.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3580, the Ocean Shipping  Reform Act of 2022, bipartisan and bicameral legislation to strengthen  our Nation's supply chain and address unfair shipping practices, which  became broadly apparent during the pandemic.   Once again, we have come together to find common ground to address  the needs of the American people. I particularly want to express great  appreciation for the extraordinary leadership of my colleague from  California,   John Garamendi, and Dusty Johnson, for their tireless  work fighting for this legislation.   I would also like to acknowledge Sam Graves, the ranking member of  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Coast Guard and  Maritime Transportation Subcommittee Chairman Salud Carbajal, and Coast  Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee Ranking Member   Bob  Gibbs. Their contributions were many, and I appreciate the time they  took to work with all the stakeholders.   The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the practice of business worldwide,  perhaps permanently. It shuttered factories, changed consumer demand,  and inundated our ports with containers. In no other time have we had  such an unprecedented need for a resilient supply chain, yet if  anything, the trials of the past 2 years have highlighted the  inefficiencies of our transportation system, both domestically and  internationally.   One response will be, hopefully, with the COMPETES Act, to onshore  critical industries and components in the future. But the other is to  deal with the inefficiencies of the existing system during that  transition.   The importance of the maritime sector as part of America's supply  chain cannot be overstated. $4.6 trillion in activity takes place  annually at all the U.S. seaports.   Despite historic demand and profit levels, we have been alerted to  instances of large ocean carrier conglomerates taking advantage of  American exporters and importers. In fact, the three largest shipping  conglomerates in the world enjoyed more profits last year than the  total of their profits in the previous decade. We might call that price  gouging.   Foreign-flag commercial carriers transport more than 98 percent of  U.S. foreign commerce. Again, we need more significant steps to rebuild  a U.S. maritime industry so, as a maritime nation, we are not dependent  upon Communist China and other places, a whole bunch of developing or  even nonexistent countries with flags of convenience that are  substantially under the thumb of the Chinese.   Foreign-flag commercial carriers transport 98 percent, as I said,  which means we must be robust in our approach to the oversight and  enforcement of trade to secure fairness and economic prosperity.   The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 gives the Federal Maritime  Commission updated authority to protect exporters, importers, and  consumers from unfair practices by expanding its oversight and  enforcement capabilities, and it amends title 46 to increase penalties  for retaliation against shippers and encourage reciprocal trade. It  ensures that ocean carriers cannot refuse U.S. export cargo bookings  for arbitrary reasons and makes several reforms to the way carriers  levy detention and demurrage charges.   These reforms include requiring written confirmation that the fees  charged are fair and comply with Federal regulations and establishing  that shippers have straightforward and appropriate recourse in the  event of improper detention and demurrage charges or other unfair  shipping practices.   This legislation also authorizes funding levels that would adequately  equip the Federal Maritime Commission to utilize its expanded oversight  and enforcement capabilities. Specifically, the legislation increases  the FMC's authorization from $32.9 million in 2022 to $49.2 million in  fiscal year 2025, a 50 percent increase over 4 years.   This increase would ensure that key leadership positions remain  filled at a time when one in five current FMC employees are eligible to  retire and allow for the hiring of additional staff to improve the  Commission's enforcement actions and provide timely informational and  dispute resolution assistance to consumers.   The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has held multiple  hearings focusing on relieving the strain on our supply chain. One  recommendation we heard repeatedly is that increased data transparency  and information sharing are essential to reducing lag time at trade-off  points in the supply chain.   The supply chain consists of thousands of moving pieces--vessels,  trucks, trains, planes--that are controlled by small teams of people  making their decisions about cargo loading, timing, and routes based on  weather, pricing, and other factors. We need to make it easier for all  players in this system to talk to each other and share real-time  information with their supply chain partners so that the goods keep  flowing even when a shipper's transit plans change.   This bill works in harmony with actions taken by President Biden, the  Department of Transportation, and the Department of Homeland Security  to make pathways for the shipping community to improve its internal  communication and, in turn, relieve congestion at ports.   In closing, I stress that this legislation is vital for ensuring fair  and efficient shipping, which is integral to the well-being of our  economy.   Allow me, once again, to thank Representatives Garamendi and Johnson  for their leadership. I look forward to unanimous passage in the House,  even if a vote is called for.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi), who played a very principal role in this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I thank him for the  colloquy.   Yes, I totally agree with the gentleman from South Dakota's  understandings with respect to any additional promulgated rules  pursuant to section 7 and to the May 18, 2020 rule now in place.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time because I  had one additional speaker, but I think he is delayed in transit.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will just expand a little bit on the gentleman from  California when he raised the MFN for China in 1990, most-favored- nation status. Until then, we had been able, on an annual basis, to  threaten China with substantial retaliation restrictions if they  violated international norms in trade.   The Clinton administration mistakenly felt that if the Chinese were  given most-favored-nation status and put into the World Trade  Organization that somehow they would reform their practices. They  haven't; they didn't; they won't.   Interestingly, I was cleaning out a drawer in my desk today and came  across a headline story where it said, ``DeFazio predicts the largest  export to China will be U.S. jobs,'' and it has been. We have  hemorrhaged hundreds of thousands, millions of good, family-wage  manufacturing jobs in this country, developed extraordinary dependence.   The Senate version of the COMPETES Act, thanks to Senator Toomey,  would actually make us more dependent on China, do away with all  tariffs, including on medical protective gear and other things.   Did we learn nothing during this pandemic?  [[Page H5467]]    This bill is just one first step in beginning to reestablish the  United States' competitive position in the world with free and ``fair''  trade--fair, underlined eight times--including the shipping companies  and those who utilize or dominate those shipping companies.   This is critical legislation. I am hoping that we can make even more  progress in the COMPETES Act on the Senate side and not adopt their  pathetic, total kowtowing to China.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
