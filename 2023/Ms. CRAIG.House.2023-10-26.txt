 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome our guest chaplain,  Reverend John Matthews. I thank Reverend Matthews for that beautiful  and hopeful prayer at the conclusion of a tumultuous time in this  Chamber.   Reverend Matthews has served as a United States Army chaplain and as  a police chaplain. He has been a pastor at Trinity Lutheran Church in  Moorhead, Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Brooklyn Park, and  Memorial Lutheran Church in Afton. Finally, he has pastored over me and  my family at Grace Lutheran Church in Apple Valley.   John built bridges across religions during his career, as well as  assisting in the drafting of ``A Declaration of the Evangelical  Lutheran Church in America to the Jewish Community,'' which is now part  of the permanent display on anti-Semitism at the United States  Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.   It is my honor to represent Reverend Matthews and his family, and I  thank him for his contributions to our community.                            ____________________
