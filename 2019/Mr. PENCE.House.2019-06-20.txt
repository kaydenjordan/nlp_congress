 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to increase  funding for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine broadband grant  program.   Currently, over 14 million Americans living in rural communities  still lack access to basic broadband service. Specifically, the rural  broadband grant programs at USDA help Americans tap into telehealth  technology, distant learning education, and internet-based agribusiness  that our farmers desperately rely on to remain competitive.   In my district, the DLT grant program has been successful at linking  teachers in one area to students in another. Last year, almost half of  the funds from the DLT program were used to combat opioid and substance  abuse.   The ongoing opioid crisis is still wreaking havoc on communities  across America, and this is not the time to cut corners on programs  that address this problem. We must support efforts to help people  seeking treatment for and prevention of opioid use.   My amendment, which is fully offset, will increase funding for the  DLT program by $25 million so that more communities have access to  healthcare, education, government services, and business opportunities.  Without broadband access, entire communities are being left behind.   Madam Chair, I am thankful this issue has remained a bipartisan  priority, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Baird), my esteemed colleague.    Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment to close the digital divide in rural America.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
