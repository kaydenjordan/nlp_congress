 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2420) to establish within the Smithsonian Institution the  National Museum of the American Latino, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2420         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Museum of the       American Latino Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States is a symbol of democracy, freedom,       and economic opportunity around the world, and the legacy of       Latinos is deeply rooted in the very fabric of the history,       democracy, freedom, and economic opportunity of the United       States.        (2) There exists no national museum within the Smithsonian       Institution that is devoted to the documentation and       explication of Latino life, art, history, and culture.        (3) The establishment of the National Museum of the       American Latino will be consistent with the purposes of the       Smithsonian Institution, created by Congress in 1846, ``for       the increase and diffusion of knowledge''.        (4) The National Museum of the American Latino--        (A) will be the keystone for people in the United States       and other Smithsonian Institution visitors to learn about       Latino contributions to life, art, history, and culture in       the United States at its signature location on the National       Mall; and        (B) will serve as a gateway for visitors to view other       Latino exhibitions, collections, and programming at other       Smithsonian Institution facilities and museums throughout the       United States and the territories of the United States.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2420.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, this bill and the creation of the National Museum of  the American Latino has traveled a long road, stretching back to 1994  and, legislatively, back to 2003, 17 years ago.   In 1994, the Smithsonian Institution Task Force on Latino Issues  issued a report, titled, ``Willful Neglect: The Smithsonian Institution  and U.S. Latinos.'' This report concluded that ``because of both  indigenous roots and Spanish heritage, Latinos predate the British in  the Americas. They have contributed significantly to every phase and  aspect of American history and culture. Yet the Smithsonian Institution  almost entirely excludes and ignores Latinos in nearly every aspect of  its operations.''   In 2003, our former colleague Representative Xavier Becerra  introduced a bill to establish a Commission to Study the Potential  Creation of the National Museum of the American Latino. Language  establishing this Commission was finally enacted in 2008.   In 2011, the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of the  National Museum of the American Latino issued its report. The  Commission reported that ``the time has come for the creation of the  new museum on The National Mall'' that ``reflects the contributions of  Latinos in every aspect of American history and culture.''   Since then, our colleague, Representative Jose Serrano, has carried  this legislation, and fought tirelessly to ensure American Latinos, our  history, our culture, and our contributions to this Nation are  recognized on The National Mall.   Representative Serrano has spent a career championing the civil  rights and civil liberties of all Americans; first, in the New York  State Assembly, where he served for 16 years, and then in the House,  where he served for 30 years. He has educated us on everything from  Puerto Rico to New York, to the story of American Latinos, to, yes, a  little bit of Sinatra, too.   I remember a committee hearing last year, shortly after  Representative Serrano announced his retirement, where he told the  committee: ``If you want to give me a going away present that I will  cherish forever, give me a museum.''   It is true that there are plans to open the Molina Family Latino  Gallery at the American History Museum, which is a step in the right  direction. But to once again quote Representative Serrano: ``No matter  how hard we try, hundreds of years of history, art, and culture cannot  be contained in one 4,500-square-foot exhibit. We deserve a dedicated  museum of our own in the heart of Washington, D.C. We need a Latino  Museum.''   Mr. Serrano is right: We need a Latino  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cardenas), a strong supporter of the legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), a key advocate and champion of this  legislation, and chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of our Caucus and an  incredible advocate and supporter for years of this piece of  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I would inquire how much time remains on  each side.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary Committee and a key  advocate for civil rights.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cisneros).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar), another strong advocate of the legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for  his support of this legislation, and the gentleman from Texas, who  never misses an opportunity to give shout-outs to San Antonio and the  individuals associated with this who are from San Antonio.  [[Page H3872]]    I should also thank Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren from the House  Administration Committee, who worked with Mr. Davis and who guided this  legislation through the committee so we can have an opportunity to vote  on it.   This is truly a bipartisan piece of legislation, and I tip my hat to  Mr. Hurd and Ms. Herrera Beutler for whipping votes and getting some  colleagues to be supportive as well and, as Mr. Hurd mentioned, the  Friends of the American Latino Museum, an outside group that has been  supportive of this legislation in a key way and stands ready to work  with us to accomplish this mission.   As my colleagues have said, the time is now. It is important to pass  this piece of legislation. It is important to start this process and to  recognize the rich contributions that Latinos have made to American  history.
