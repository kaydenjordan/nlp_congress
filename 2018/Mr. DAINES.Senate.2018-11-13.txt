 Mr. President, on the heels of Veteran's Day and in honor  of President Trump's designating November 2018 as National Veterans and  Military Families Month, I have the distinct pleasure of recognizing  Jason Gleason of Great Falls, MT, for his  [[Page S6909]]  dedication to serving veterans in North Central Montana.   Jason serves as a nurse practitioner in the Great Falls VA Community  Based Outpatient Clinic and has become one of the most sought-after  experts in veterans' healthcare. A veteran himself, Jason spent 20  years in the Montana Air National Guard, retiring as lieutenant  colonel.   During his time in the Guard, he served as officer in charge of  health promotion, medical readiness, staff development, and as  assistant chief nurse, where he gained a great deal of knowledge and  experience caring for fellow servicemembers.   Jason retired from the Air National Guard in 2015, and since then he  has dedicated himself to providing exceptional healthcare to Montana  veterans. He has built and maintained a patient panel that is at 110  percent capacity and has 1,000 patients. When another provider recently  retired, he stepped up and took over the patient panel and provided  care to another 556 veterans.   Jason has worked to improve the overall Montana VA system. He has  recruited and mentored other nurse practitioners, which helped fill  critical positions in the VA system. Jason also participated in a VA  residency program that trains providers to better serve our women  veterans.   In 2011, he experienced a deep personal tragedy when his wife of 16  years, Heather, passed away from a stroke, leaving him a widower with  three children. After his wife's death, he dedicated himself to  becoming an expert on strokes.   He regularly speaks to healthcare providers across the country about  stroke prevention and treatment and received the Montana State  Department of Health and Human Services Stroke Hero of the Year Award.   Montana is incredibly lucky to have a healthcare professional like  Jason Gleason serving our veterans. He is truly an excellent example of  someone who puts service before self. He understands that his service  to our country did not end with his service in the military.   I want to personally congratulate and thank Jason for his excellent  work.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 3 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
