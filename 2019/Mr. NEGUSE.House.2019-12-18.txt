 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Nadler and Speaker  Pelosi for their leadership and their moral courage.   Today, the House of Representatives is debating whether to take the  rare step of voting to impeach a President for only the third time in  our country's history. Unfortunately, President Trump has left us no  choice.   The fact of the matter is that the President abused the power of his  office and invited a foreign country to interfere in our elections. In  so doing, he undermined the sanctity of the free and fair elections  upon which our Republic rests.   Making matters worse, over the past several months, President Trump  and his administration have done everything they can to prevent  Congress from uncovering the truth.   Let us be clear, in the history of our Republic, no President has  ever obstructed Congress like this before.   During the Watergate investigation, as my colleagues well know:   President Nixon's chief of staff testified before Congress; President  Trump's chief of staff refused.   President Nixon's counsel testified; President Trump's counsel  refused.   White House aides close to President Nixon testified; President Trump  refused to allow any aide who may have knowledge relevant to this  investigation to testify.   Simply put, his administration has engaged in a wholesale obstruction  of Congress, and that is exactly why we are considering not just one  but two Articles of Impeachment before the House today.   Every Member of this body has a responsibility to uphold our  Constitution, to defend our Republic, and, when necessary, to hold the  executive branch accountable. We are exercising that responsibility  today.  [[Page H12140]]    Mr. Speaker, therefore, I will vote ``yes'' on both articles because  it is what the Constitution requires and what my conscience demands.
