 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday the House passed an amended  version of the continuing resolution to sustain government funding and  sent it here for our consideration. In addition to giving the entire  Federal Government the necessary resources to operate into the new  year, this legislation also provides much needed investments in  disaster relief for hard-hit communities and in our national security,  particularly the integrity of our borders.   In my view, this legislation would be quite uncontroversial in a more  normal political moment--in a moment when both parties put the obvious  national interest ahead of any personal spite for the President.   I support the additional border security and disaster aid that the  House added to the bill, and I am proud to vote for it. It is not a  radical concept that the American people's government should be able to  control the people and the goods that flow into our country. It is not  a radical concept that physical barriers play an important role in  achieving security--unless there is a caucus of lawmakers who go to bed  at night with their front doors wide open that I am not aware of. What  is radical, what is way out of the mainstream, is this absurd premise  of the open-borders far left that achieving basic stability and law  enforcement on our southern border is somehow in itself without  compassion or discriminatory or immoral.   Fairness and compassion don't mean enforcing only some of our laws  halfheartedly; fairness and compassion mean that we fulfill our  governing duties for the American people. If we continue to throw up  our hands and tolerate a status quo that is allowing too many drugs and  dangerous criminals to travel freely into our land, then this Federal  Government is not doing its duty.   The facts are clear on this. The need for greater security on our  southern border is not some partisan invention; it is an empirical  fact, and the need is only growing. Apprehensions along the border have  nearly doubled in the past year. The men and women of the Border Patrol  are encountering greater numbers of gang members and individuals with  criminal histories, more family units, more seizures of cocaine and  fentanyl.   This is a real crisis. The implications for American communities, for  vulnerable children, and for Border Patrol units that are already  stretched thin are very real.   There is no bright line of principle that sets this request for  border funding apart from similar requests that many Democrats have  supported in the past. A lot of them have supported this in the past.  There is no sharp distinction between the proposal my friends across  the aisle have decided to oppose today and proposals they have been  happy to endorse in the past. All that has really changed are the  political winds way over on the far left. That is what has changed.   So let's not end this year the way we began it--with another shutdown  over the issue of illegal immigration. Remember this back in January?  It was all because the Democrats were unwilling to support commonsense  measures to address it. Let's advance this legislation. Let's pass it.  Let's finish our work for this year. Let's secure our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the  Senate the House message to accompany H.R. 695, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.    Mr. Vice President and colleagues, here where we are.  It is now clear there are enough votes to proceed to the pending  legislation on government funding, disaster relief, and border  security.   Within the Republican conference, there is strong support for the  President's reasonable request for more resources to tackle the urgent  situation at our southern border. Republicans support the House-passed  bill, which includes additional border security funding. We are also,  however, eager to complete the remaining appropriations bills that the  Senate has already passed.   However, obviously, since any eventual solution requires 60 votes  here in the Senate, it has been clear from the beginning that two  things are necessary: support from enough Senate Democrats to pass the  proposal at 60 and a Presidential signature.   As a result, the Senate has voted to proceed to legislation before us  in order to preserve maximum flexibility for a productive conversation  to continue between the White House and our Democratic colleagues. I  hope Senate Democrats will work with the White House on an agreement  that can pass both Houses of Congress and receive the President's  signature.   Colleagues, when an agreement is reached, it will receive a vote here  on the Senate floor.                               Motion to Concur     Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment  to H.R. 695.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion is pending.   The Democratic leader.    I expect my friend from Tennessee is going to make  this point in a moment, but if ever there were a stressful moment for  the tradition that even though it was possible to filibuster the  Executive Calendar, it was not done, would my friend agree that it  would have to be the Clarence Thomas nomination for the Supreme Court?    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 148,  which was received from the House.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
