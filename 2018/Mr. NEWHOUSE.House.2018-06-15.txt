 Mr. Speaker, in America, 91 people die every day from  an opioid overdose. According to the  [[Page H5222]]  Washington State Department of Health, from 2012 to 2016, almost 300  people in my Fourth Congressional District died from an opioid-related  death. These alarming statistics demonstrate the desperate need for the  35 bills we passed this week in regard to this crisis.   I recently hosted an opioid summit in my district where I heard from  constituents, Federal officials, law enforcement, and health  professionals about the impacts this epidemic has in central  Washington. One constituent bravely shared the story of her son, Eli.   Eli was exposed to opioids in high school. He struggled with  recovery, and despite support from his family, it was difficult to find  help. His addiction did not let him live out his full potential, and he  ultimately passed away in 2014 at the age of 22 years old.   Unfortunately, there are many more stories like Eli's. We must put an  end to this epidemic which is why I am proud to support the important  legislation Congress is working on. By improving access to treatment,  prevention practices, and law enforcement, we are saving lives.                            ____________________
