 Mr. President, you may have presided before, but you  haven't presided when I have spoken on the floor, so it is great to  welcome you, as both my colleague and the Presiding Officer, and I am  glad to be working with you and glad we are both here today.   We are both here today at a time when the American people really  expect the government to work; the American people really expect people  in Congress to be able to find middle ground. For too long we have been  stuck--frankly, on both sides of the aisle--with too many people who  ran for office saying: If I don't get what I want--I just don't want  anything to happen unless it is exactly what I want. The best I can  tell, that doesn't work anywhere. If you are getting what you want  wherever you are working, wherever you are living, wherever you are  going to church, there is probably something wrong with you. Democracy  is about compromise.   I think one of the great fallacies of the second option we will have  today is that it is designed to keep the government open for 2 weeks at  last year's spending levels, and then, at the end of 2 weeks--I don't  know what happens then. There will be no information that Members of  the Senate and the House will know 2 weeks from now that they don't  know now. There is nothing that could be debated or discussed in the  next 2 weeks that couldn't be discussed in the next 45 minutes.   I think it is pretty clear to the American people that this has  boiled down to a fight in which we need to reopen the government and,  frankly, we need to secure the border.   I just heard our good friend, our colleague from Virginia, say that,  generally, his side of the aisle has been better than our side of the  aisle at securing the border. I don't think that is necessarily true,  but I am glad to concede that if our friends on the other  [[Page S548]]  side want to step up and work with us to secure the border--fine.   I will also point out that securing the border for the last four  Presidents has meant building barriers, and every time that happened,  those barriers worked.   When President George H.W. Bush built a barrier south of San Diego,  the detentions of people coming across the border decreased by 95  percent. That is really the only way we have of measuring whether this  was better before the barrier or after the barrier. When you have 95  percent fewer people coming across and being detained, something must  be working.   President Clinton built a barrier at El Paso, and detentions went  down 95 percent. President George W. Bush built a barrier at Yuma, and  detentions went down 90 percent. When you have a 90- or 95-percent  solution, you should be able to make that solution a part of moving  forward to solve the problem.   The President has come, in my view, quite a way. He has gone from a  big wall all along the border to a barrier only where a barrier makes  sense. The President would like to add 10 or 20 percent to the barriers  already built by all four of his predecessors. I don't see why some  movement in that direction can't be part of what we get done.   The shutdown has gone on too long. It has been played out way too  much in the public and way too little with Members of Congress trying  to get together and work this out. People who need government services  aren't getting those services. In many cases, people providing the  services that are essential are providing those services and not  getting paid. People who would like to be at work are at home.   Unlike any other time when the government has been shut down,  Congress has said in advance that everybody will get paid, eventually.  So the traditional worry about whether you will get paid, whether your  income is there, is gone. But the pay is not there at the time it is  expected to be. Normally, if you went to work for government at any  level, you didn't go to work for government to get wealthy; you went to  work for government because that was a secure job. So we have  eliminated for too many people the security of one of the reasons they  took a government job rather than a job that might lead to some more  financially satisfactory destination--or might not. The whole reason  they did this, in many cases, is they knew that check was going to  come. It is not coming.   The bill the President proposed keeps the government open with new  priorities--largely agreed to already by the House and the Senate-- until September 30. So 2 weeks from now, we wouldn't face this exact  same problem again. It does things I think need to be done to create  more security for kids who were brought here as children and grew up  here. I think this is a 70- or 80-percent issue in the country that all  of us understand--that if you were brought to this country as a young  child, if you grew up here, if you haven't gotten in serious trouble,  not only should you be able to stay, but we should want you to stay.   We need that kind of vitality in our country. The President said he  would like to see a final appropriate solution on that. This bill  creates a 3-year opportunity, much like--I think it was the BRIDGE Act  that was sponsored by people on both sides of the aisle who would have  said let's settle this for a while as we try to come to a further  conclusion; the same kind of 3-year structure for people who were here  because we decided we needed to give them asylum. We need to figure out  how to deal with that on a long-term basis, but 3 years not only puts  it through this Congress, it puts it a year into the next Congress and  the next Presidential administration.   Some of us need to be focused on getting this job done. I think this  bill does that. It is not perfect. I never voted for a perfect bill. I  introduced two or three perfect bills, but I have never gotten to vote  for a perfect bill and don't expect to. This is not our job. Perfect is  not our job. Our job is the possible. I think the President has  actually shown more flexibility than our friends on the other side.   If you don't like some of the things the President has proposed, the  response is not this is a nonstarter. The response is to make it a  starter. The response is, if you don't like something about what we are  doing for deferred action on kids who were brought here, what would you  do to make that better?   The President's proposal goes a long way toward solving these  problems. Most importantly, it opens the government immediately. It  assures that will be the case until we get to the beginning of the new  spending year on October 1, and it meets the government's obligation to  secure the border.   Nobody expects it to be impossible for anybody to ever get over the  border in any way, but people do expect to have the kind of border  security we can afford. I think the proposals the President makes does  that.   We need to be more concerned about our ports of entry. We need to be  more concerned about things and people coming across the border who  shouldn't come across the border or people being brought across the  border for purposes they do not want to be part of.   This is an important moment. We need to get this job done. The two  votes today will indicate whether we want to get this done on a long- term basis and get back into the regular basis of government or whether  we want to get this done for a couple of weeks, assuming somehow there  are going to be dramatically new facts on the table in the next 2 weeks  that are not there now. I don't believe that is the case. I am going to  vote for the bill that gets the government open again and lets us get  started with the work of how to fund the government on October 1 of  this year, not how to fund the government right now. I think the other  bill does not get us anywhere but right back to where we are 2 weeks  from now.                         Unanimous Consent Agreement    I have a couple of things I need to point out; one is, Mr. President,  I ask unanimous consent that the filing deadline for second-degree  amendments for the cloture motion specified in the order of January 22  occur at 2:20 p.m. today.    With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a  quorum.
