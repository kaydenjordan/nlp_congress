 Mr. President, let me congratulate my colleague from  Oklahoma for a very fine statement, and let me associate myself with  each and every word and each and every fact he outlined in his very  fine statement, and also with the remarks of my friend from Missouri  who went before him. I appreciate their leadership on this issue.  [[Page S4393]]    Let me, at this point, also give a salute to the First Amendment of  the Constitution of the United States, to the right of freedom of  speech, which we have seen exercised in this building and in this  Nation during the course of this debate, and the freedom granted to  petition the government for address of grievances. We have seen  examples of that. They have been on full display in this healthcare  debate, a phase of which will come to a close I hope this evening.   Let me give a shout out to our staff members. They have fielded  thousands, if not tens of thousands, of phone calls, letters, emails,  and visits from Americans exercising their rights under the First  Amendment. Americans have come to their Capital City, almost all of  them in an appropriate and nondisruptive way--sometimes intense, for  sure--expressing their opinions but also in display of their First  Amendment rights.   After all the debate, all the conversation, and all the exhortation  on this issue, we have seen a lot of things said from the floor and a  lot of things said on the news media that have amounted to a matter of  opinion. But here is one thing I know for a fact. For four straight  elections--2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016--Republicans ran on a promise to  repeal and replace ObamaCare. We ran on that platform, and for four  straight elections Republicans prevailed at the ballot box on the  strength of that platform. I know that for a fact, and this I believe.  Millions of Americans are at work today or at home or getting home from  their offices, from their shops, from their factories. They are turning  on the media. They are checking online. They are turning on the radio.  They are wondering if a campaign promise is going to be kept by this  party to which they have given the reins of government in four straight  elections.   We are close to keeping that promise. We are closer than we have ever  been, and we can take a big step tonight on making good on that  promise. That is not just a matter of keeping a promise, but I will say  to my colleagues that it is important this platform be honored.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 additional  minutes if there are no other people on the other side asking for  consent.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    So we are keeping a promise, but there is a lot more to  it, as my friend from Oklahoma outlined, not only in fact but also in  stories from honest-to-goodness Americans.   This debate is about keeping Americans from hurting, about relieving  the pain that this 2009 ACA has caused people to have. They were told  they could keep their doctors. They wanted to keep their doctors, and  it turns out they lost their doctors. They were told they could keep  their healthcare plans. They liked their healthcare plans, and, in  fact, they were not able to keep their healthcare plans. They were told  their premiums would go down, and we have seen chapter and verse--as  the gentleman from Oklahoma so forcefully outlined--of the dramatic,  drastic, unspeakable increase in premiums that Americans have  undergone. They were told they would have choice when it came to health  insurance, and they have not had that choice. They have lost their  freedom to make their own healthcare decisions, and that has been  sacrificed in favor of a big government approach. So people are  hurting, as has been explained on the floor tonight.   Families in my State who do not have employer-based health insurance  are paying nearly $3,000 more per year in premiums than they did 4  years ago. In my State, it is a 116-percent increase in premiums under  the Affordable Care Act over this short period of time. I guess we  should be thankful we are not the 201-percent increase in premiums that  our neighbors from Oklahoma have, or the 223-percent increase in  healthcare premiums that our neighbors across the line in the State of  Alabama have. But still, it is pretty bad wherever you go, and they  were told and this program was sold on a promise of reducing healthcare  premiums.   As has also been pointed out, 6 million independent-minded Americans  have just said: I will not purchase this required insurance. I will pay  the penalty, instead. The Supreme Court says it is a tax. We know it is  a penalty. It comes right out of their pockets. They are doing that  many times because they are independent-minded but many times because  it is the only thing they can afford.   So Americans are hurting. Americans from Missouri, Oklahoma, and  Mississippi are hurting, and they are hurting all across America. My  Republican colleagues know this. My Democratic colleagues know this.   They say: Well, the ACA needs adjustment. It needs some help.   But what is their solution? I think we are beginning to know, based  on statements made and based on information coming forward, that our  Democratic friends really want a single-payer system. That is their  solution to the failed ObamaCare system we have now--a British-style,  European-style, government-run insurance-for-all program. I don't think  we need that in America. I don't think that is what Americans thought  they were getting.   My wife and I have never moved our family to Washington, DC. We have  kept our home on the same street in Tupelo, MS, the whole time. We  raised our kids in Mississippi. When the last bell rings this weekend,  I will be on a plane back home to my State, moving around the State,  talking to Mississippians, speaking to people who gave me this great  opportunity to serve in this great body and this great system of  government.   I want to be able to tell them when I go home after this vote that I  have taken a big step in keeping the Federal Government out of the  business of deciding healthcare for their families. I want to be able  to tell them that they are now going to have more options to choose the  plan that works for them. I want to tell people back home who put me in  office that we put more power in the hands of the States, not unelected  Washington, DC, bureaucrats. I want to be able to tell them we passed a  bill that, as my friend from Oklahoma says, answers their concerns  about preexisting conditions and takes care of those people with low  incomes who need assistance in buying insurance. I want to assure the  people back in my home State and all across America, as my friend from  Oklahoma just did so eloquently, that the Medicaid Program will  continue. As a matter of fact, it will continue to grow, but at a rate  that is more sustainable, so we can afford it today and so we can  afford the Medicaid Program in future generations.   This has taken long hours of give and take. It may take more long  hours in debates tonight and in a conference with the House, but we can  get there. I see the solution formulating, and I am as optimistic as I  have ever been that we will be able to keep this four-election promise  we made.   These reforms are now within reach. We should take advantage tonight  of this opportunity to deliver on what was promised to the American  people, to relieve Americans who are hurting from the current ObamaCare  system, and to give them a better opportunity for affordable and  accessible healthcare.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dave  Zwirblis, Shane Stoughton, and Neal McMillan, congressional fellows in  my office, be granted floor privileges for the remainder of the 115th  Congress.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
