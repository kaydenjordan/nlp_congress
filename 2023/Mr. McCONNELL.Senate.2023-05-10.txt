 Mr. President, I was glad to attend yesterday's White  House meeting in solidarity with Speaker McCarthy. Unlike the White  House, the Speaker has been handling the debt limit in a responsible  fashion.   Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans have passed the only  legislation currently in existence that prevents default. He spent  months waiting for President Biden to come to the table. But the White  House has wasted 3 months--3 months wasted. The President of the United  States has been MIA.   So let's hope yesterday was the start of the administration accepting  the reality of our situation. Everybody knows there is only one way to  defuse the looming crisis, the normal and routine thing--spending  negotiations between the President and the Speaker.   The American people voted for divided government. President Biden  refusing to compromise is really not an  [[Page S1579]]  option when you have a divided government. Unconstitutionally acting  without Congress is also not an option. There is exactly one way--just  one way--to prevent a pointless, avoidable crisis: the bipartisan  negotiation that Speaker McCarthy has been calling for since way back  in February.   Seven of the last 10 debt limit hikes came with a bipartisan deal on  spending levels. Let me just say that again. Seven of the last 10 debt  limit hikes came with a bipartisan deal on spending levels.   Just 4 years ago, we had today's situation in reverse. What happened?  Secretary Mnuchin was sent to negotiate with Speaker Pelosi. They  struck a caps deal, and the debt limit was addressed. It was exactly  the situation we have now, in reverse.   Yesterday's meeting was an overdue first step. I hope President Biden  has begun to wake up. Even rank-and-file Democrats in the House and  Senate say the President's refusal to negotiate has been untenable.   The Democrats can't waste any more time. The White House has to stop  sleepwalking towards default and reach a spending deal with the  Speaker.
