 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call out a growing  insidious threat to women.   There are bills in at least eight State legislatures that would  outlaw abortions if a heartbeat can be detected. Typically, this is at  about 6 weeks of a pregnancy, though it can be earlier.   Six weeks is before many women even know that they are pregnant,  effectively taking away their right to choose whether or not to begin  or expand their family.   These laws are cruel. They are also in direct violation of the  Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, a precedent that has stood for  over 45 years.   That is the point. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant recently signed  into law one of these bills, and he did so knowing it was  unconstitutional. He even admitted he was signing this bill for his own  religious reasons knowing that it was likely to be challenged. He wants  to see it go to the Supreme Court because he wants credit for trying to  overturn Roe v. Wade.   But the women of this country will not go back. We have fought tooth  and nail to obtain our rights in this country. Those who believe women  will give up their right to control their own bodies will quickly learn  that that are sorely mistaken.                            ____________________
