 Madam Chair, I thank my friend from Rhode Island, a great  champion for consumers, for yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of the FAIR Act to protect Americans  from forced arbitration agreements. These agreements, too often, are  the result of power imbalances that block claims from judicial remedies  in employment, consumer, antitrust, and civil rights disputes.   The FAIR Act is critical for protecting the rights of women, in  particular, who have faced gender discrimination and sexual harassment  in the workplace. We have all heard the disturbing reports of tens of  thousands of women employed at one large company who alleged that they  were paid less than their male colleagues. They were passed over for  promotions to management positions multiple times in favor of men with  less experience. They faced unwanted sexual advances and attempted  assault at company meetings. At least one Floridian was fired after she  reported one of her superiors tried to kiss and touch her against her  will.   Employees who face mistreatment deserve justice and they deserve  their day in court. Making forced arbitration a condition of employment  takes away their day in court and it frustrates the pursuit of justice.    Forced arbitration provisions strip employees of their  rights. They ensure that employees are no match for their employers  when it comes to reporting discrimination and harassment.   Today, this House of Representatives has the opportunity to restore  the rights of all workers to seek justice and public accountability.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support and pass the bipartisan  FAIR Act.
