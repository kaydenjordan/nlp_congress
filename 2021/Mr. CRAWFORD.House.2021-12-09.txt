 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose this insane piece of  legislation House Democrats are proposing.   This bill is yet another further attempt by the chairman of the House  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Adam Schiff, to  retroactively attack President Trump, even after the Democrats' Russian  collusion allegations have been repeatedly debunked.   I want to specifically bring attention to Title XIII of this  ridiculous bill. This provision requires employees, officials, and  agents of a Presidential campaign to report foreign national contact  and/or contributions to the FEC and to the FBI. The FBI is then  required to provide notice to the campaign and to the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence, or HPSCI, as we call it.   Sound familiar? The FBI would be required to work with HPSCI on  counterintelligence investigations into political candidates. What  could possibly go wrong?   This provision is designed to further the Democrat-led FBI scheme  against Republican Presidential candidates, just as they did with  President Trump.   Here's how it would work: First, if a foreign government contacts a  Republican campaign, the Republican campaign, in compliance with the  proposed law, reports the contact to the FBI. Then the FBI notifies  HPSCI Democrats, and somehow the media miraculously finds out about it  and runs story after story about the Republican campaign colluding with  the foreign government.                                time  1245     Lather, rinse, repeat. I am not sure if anyone has told  Chairman Schiff and House Democrats yet, but Donald Trump is,  unfortunately, no longer President. Time to stop living in the past.   The clear intent of this bill is to weaponize the Federal Government  bureaucracy against Republican candidates. If this legislation becomes  law, Madam Speaker, don't be surprised if we see Russian hoaxes every 2  years.
