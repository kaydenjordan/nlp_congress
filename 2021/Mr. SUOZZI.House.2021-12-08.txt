 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and everyone who has  worked so hard on this, including Chairman McGovern.   Mr. Speaker, I stand before you as chair of the Congressional Uyghur  Caucus and as a member of the Congressional-Executive Commission on  China to support passage of the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor  Prevention Act.   We need to wake up from our torpor. It has been reported for years,  but I don't think most Americans realize exactly what is going on in  China.   It was almost 50 years ago that Nixon went to China, and we have  always believed that the more the Chinese Government and the people  were exposed to the United States and the West, our way of life, our  democracy, and our economic system, the more they would become like us,  the more they would adopt concepts of freedom of expression, free  markets, and minority rights.   Well, that simply hasn't happened. Everyone in this body has seen  reliable reports and clear documentation of crimes against humanity:  forced labor, forced sterilization, mass surveillance, government-run  detention camps, mass detention, sexual violence, and torture against  the Uyghur people.                                time  1345    The Chinese Communist Party is even forcing people to eat pork during  Ramadan, even though it violates people's religion.   It is hard to imagine that in today's world, that forced labor camps  are happening, and we know about it. And today, we are standing up to  do something about it.   The Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable. We have rules  in place now that say you can't use forced labor. But this bill is a  major step forward in mandating that everything that comes out of  Xinjiang in China will be presumed to be using forced labor and,  therefore, ineligible to be sold into the U.S. supply chain. This is  going to have a tremendous impact.   An overwhelming amount of cotton in the world comes from China, for  example. Mr. Speaker, 84 percent of that cotton that comes from China  comes from the Xinjiang region. Some people are going to say, Oh, my  gosh, if we don't do business with Xinjiang, then the cost of products  are going to go up. Well, that is too damn bad. This should shock  everyone's conscience.    Mr. Speaker, we have to do everything we can to stand up  for our values. The world is watching us, and it starts with the Uyghur  Forced Labor Prevention Act becoming law. Let's do this, and let's do  it together.   We recognize here in our country that we went through a period of  slavery. That is why it is so offensive to us now to see slavery  actually happening in the world as we speak, where both  administrations, the prior administration and this administration, have  both said this is genocide. Standing up together in a bipartisan way is  so important.
