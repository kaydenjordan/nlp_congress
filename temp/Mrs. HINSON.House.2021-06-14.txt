 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call for immediate  consideration of my See the Crisis Act. This legislation would prevent  Vice President Kamala Harris from using taxpayer dollars to travel  internationally before seeing the southern border crisis firsthand.   Vice President Harris was named as the administration's point person  on the illegal immigration crisis at our southern border 80 days ago,  and this crisis is worsening by the day. Yet the Vice President has  refused to go to the border herself and talk to the brave law  enforcement officers, the men and women who are fighting this on the  front lines.   This out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach is a disgrace, Madam Speaker,  but let's back up and look at how this crisis has developed on the  Biden administration's watch.   On day one of this administration, President Biden stopped  construction of the border wall. Shortly after, he reinstated catch- and-release. Now, this turned on the green light at our border. It  incentivized the historic surge of illegal immigration that we are  currently experiencing in this country.   Open border policies are music to the ears of the cartels, the drug  smugglers, and the traffickers who make their living on human  suffering. Make no mistake, business is good for cartels and drug  smugglers under this administration right now.   Snuck into this rule here tonight is a provision to set the spending  levels for Congress, and these historic spending levels rise in nearly  every category except for one, the Department of Homeland Security.  This sends a pretty clear message to the cartels that the U.S.  Government doesn't think it is a priority to stop them.   Madam Speaker, I recently visited the border to see the crisis for  myself, hear what those on the front lines are facing every day. They  told me they are completely overwhelmed. There are major  vulnerabilities along our border. These are vulnerabilities that the  cartels and the drug smugglers are exploiting every day.   Border Patrol officers are apprehending sex offenders, gang members,  even people on the terrorist watch list trying to come into our country  illegally, and these are just the people that they are catching. Deadly  drugs are pouring across the border in droves. Fentanyl seizures at the  border have increased by 233 percent this year. 233 percent.   When I was at the border I heard from both Democratic sheriffs and  Republican sheriffs about these devastating realities and the damage  that is being inflicted on our communities.   But apparently, even as the administration's point person on the  illegal immigration crisis, hearing from those on the ground is too  much to ask for the Vice President.   She has been the border czar for 80 days. She has been to yarn shops,  she has been to bakeries, and she just flew right over the crisis at  our southern border to meet with foreign countries, with the taxpayers'  checkbook in hand.                                time  1745    When asked why she hasn't visited the southern border, she laughed.  She laughed, and this is not a laughing matter.   The border crisis impacts the safety and security of every Iowan, of  every American. Every State is a border State right now.   As Members of Congress, regardless of our party, it is our job to  hold the administration accountable when it is failing the American  people.   Right now, Vice President Harris, Madam Speaker, is failing the  American people. She is failing law enforcement at the border. She is  failing the families who will suffer because of the drugs coming across  our border and falling into the wrong hands.   Vice President Harris needs to see the crisis for herself and take  action. That is exactly what my See the Crisis Act will force her to  do. This bill will prevent the Vice President from traveling  internationally on the taxpayers' dime until she visits the southern  border and reports back to the American people on how the  administration will secure our border.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  tonight to join me in defeating the previous question and holding this  administration accountable for the border crisis.
