 Mr. Speaker, what can you say about Don in 30 seconds? I  always saw him as a captain, the tugboat captain, the captain of the  ship.   Don was the captain of this ship, this great institution, the House.  Don was rough on the exterior like his State, rugged and larger than  life, but he had a heart for serving others.   I will never forget going to the White House when we signed the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act into law. ANWR opened up. He did a little jig in  front of the White House. I think that may have been one of the days he  broke his promise of maybe having a little drink.    But I will say this: I will always cherish my last day in the House  sitting right next to him. The very last day, we were here for an hour  talking about this great institution, talking about our families, what  is important in life. Little did I know that the next day he would be  lost.    Madam Speaker, let me say in closing, Don planned to  serve in Congress until God or the voters decided it was his time. It  is no coincidence that God called him home on his 49th year in Congress  as a Representative for the 49th State.   May God hold Don in the palms of his hands.
