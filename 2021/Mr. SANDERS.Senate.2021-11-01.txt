 Madam President, I rise today to honor the memory  of Dexter Randall of Newport Center, VT. In Dexter's passing, Vermont  and the Nation has lost a great champion for farmers.   Dexter was born in Lyndon, VT, in 1945 but spent most of his life  with his family on their farm in Troy, VT. On September 3, 1971, he  married Alice Gilman, who we sadly lost a year ago, on June 2, 2020.  Along with their five children--Lisa, Justin, Jordan, Irene, and  Jason--Randall and Alice ran their small organic dairy farm for 37  years before Justin and Irene took over operations.   While Dexter was first and foremost a farmer, he was also a public  servant. In the Northeast Kingdom, an area of the State often known for  more conservative points of view, Dexter charted a unique political  path, serving as a Progressive State representative with a strong  independent streak. Dexter felt that his political philosophy was not  all that different from that of his father, who had been a Republican,  but that the Vermont Republican Party of earlier generations had  undergone significant change. During his time in and out of the Vermont  Statehouse, he was an unwavering voice for farmers and small family  farms, fighting for fair milk prices and to safeguard Vermont's  agricultural heritage.   Both in elected office and during his 30 years on the board of Rural  Vermont, Dexter showed a fearlessness in advocating for bold policy  change. He understood that in order to save family farms and ensure the  future of agriculture in Vermont, we needed to fundamentally rethink  agricultural policy and fight against corporation consolidation. He was  at the center of some of the biggest agricultural debates of his time,  including the creation of the New England Dairy Compact and fighting to  protect farmers from the corporate greed of companies producing  genetically modified organism--GMO--seeds. Dexter's work was not  limited to Vermont. In 2006, he traveled to Mali to learn how U.S.  policies impact Africa's agricultural sector. On this and many other  topics, Dexter demonstrated an ability to translate complex policy  issues into plain language, making it easy for his constituents to  understand and relate to.   Caring for the land was at the heart of Dexter's work. Despite  farming being more than a full-time job, he was active with the  Missisquoi Basin Association, the American Devon Cattle Association,  the Orleans County Natural Resources Conservation District, and the  Vermont Center for Sustainable Agriculture. At a time when agriculture  and environmental protection were often pitted against one another,  Dexter showed that farmers can and often are strong conservationists  and excellent stewards of the land.   When I first met Dexter 35 years ago, his reputation as a fearless  champion for rural Vermonters and farmers preceded him. Some probably  would have considered us to be unlikely friends; he was a dairy farmer  in a remote part of the State, and I was the first Independent mayor of  the State's biggest city of Burlington. Those people, of course, were  wrong. It was 1986, milk prices were low, and both Dexter and I  understood that farmers were suffering. To raise spirits and money,  Rural Vermont held a fundraiser near Dexter and Alice's farm. For my  part, I drove the 2 hours to the Northeast Kingdom because not only did  I understand the importance of the issue, I was impressed by the  grassroots advocacy of Dexter, Alice, and the organizers. From that day  on, Dexter and I enjoyed a long friendship that included a pig roast on  his farm each year. At the heart, these events were very much about  good food, comradery, bringing people together, and appreciating the  pastoral landscape of Vermont. These events were also where good, old- fashioned democracy took place. People could talk about the issues that  were important to them and feel like politicians were actually  listening. I learned a great deal at these events about the struggles  of working people, especially in rural Vermont, and for that, I am  eternally grateful to Dexter.   I was sad not to be able to join Dexter on the farm this year, and I  will miss traveling there and seeing Dexter each year, but I am  thankful for our many years of friendship. To my mind, Dexter  represented the best of Vermont; he was not only deeply engaged in the  issues, but he also genuinely cared about the wellbeing of his friends,  family, neighbors, fellow farmers, and his rural constituents. He  believed everyone deserves a fair shot, and he tirelessly advocated for  Vermonters at every opportunity he could, whether by supporting  universal healthcare or milk prices that enabled farmers to keep the  lights on and live in dignity.   Ultimately, Dexter brought his ethos about farming--that ``if you  take care of the land it will take care of you, so you can leave it a  little bit better than you found it''--to his community and his State.  Vermont is indeed a better place, and Vermonters are better off, thanks  to Dexter Randall.                            ____________________
