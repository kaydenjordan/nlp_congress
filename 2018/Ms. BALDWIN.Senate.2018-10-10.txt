 Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 627,  S.J. Res. 63.    Mr. President, just over a year ago in this Chamber,  three brave Republican colleagues--Senator John McCain, Senator Susan  Collins, and Senator Lisa Murkowski--joined all Democrats in voting  against healthcare repeal legislation. They listened to the families of  their States.   I, too, voted against that repeal legislation because the people of  Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take away their healthcare.  When congressional Republicans tried to pass repeal plans that would  allow insurance companies to charge more for preexisting conditions,  families across our country fought back.   When the Republican majority tried to charge older Americans an age  tax and make people pay more for less care, people let their voices be  heard and sent a loud message to Washington: Protect our care. They  sent us all a clear message that they want us to work across party  lines to protect the healthcare guarantees they depend on and to stand  up for those with preexisting health conditions. Yet defeating the  legislative efforts that would have made things worse for families  didn't end the threat to the American people.   The Trump administration has been trying to do what congressional  Republicans couldn't. They have been sabotaging our healthcare system  and rewriting the rules on guaranteed health protections and access to  affordable care that millions of Americans have today. This sabotage  has created instability in the healthcare market, contributing to  widespread premium spikes in 2018.   This administration ended the critical cost-sharing reduction  payments that made healthcare more affordable for almost 90,000  Wisconsinites. The Trump administration again slashed funding for  outreach efforts to help people sign up for healthcare.   Trusted navigator programs like those in Wisconsin have had their  funding cut by nearly 90 percent in the past 2 years. This will mean  fewer people in rural Wisconsin will receive the support they need to  obtain affordable coverage this year.   It doesn't stop there. The Trump administration has even joined  Wisconsin's Governor and Wisconsin's attorney general and other States  in going to court to support a lawsuit that would take away guaranteed  protections for people with preexisting conditions. If they succeed,  insurance companies will again be able to deny coverage or charge  higher premiums for the more than 130 million Americans with a  preexisting health condition. In fact, if the Affordable Care Act's  protections for people with preexisting conditions are struck down in  court, Wisconsin is among the States that has the most to lose.   According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, one out of every four  Wisconsinites has some sort of preexisting health condition, and they  simply cannot afford to have the healthcare they depend on threatened  with higher costs or coverage denials.   The Trump administration has expanded junk insurance plans. These  plans are cheap for a reason; they do not have to provide essential  health benefits like hospitalization, prescription drugs, and maternity  care.   According to the fine print of one of the plans sold in several  States, including my home State of Wisconsin--marketed by the Golden  Rule Company--the plan doesn't even have to cover hospital care on a  Friday or Saturday. It will be just your bad luck if you happen to get  sick and need healthcare on the weekend. The very first exclusion  states that it provides no benefits for a preexisting health condition.  The fine print also notes if you are pregnant, that will be considered  a preexisting health condition.   These junk insurance plans can deny healthcare coverage to people  with preexisting conditions when they need it the most, and that is why  I am leading this effort in the U.S. Senate to take action and stop  this sabotage.   This is personal to me. When I was 9 years old, I got sick. I was  really sick. I was in the hospital for 3 months. I eventually  recovered. When it came to health insurance, it was as if I had some  sort of scarlet letter. My grandparents, who raised me, couldn't find a  policy at any price that would cover me--not from any insurer--all  because I was a childhood branded with those words: ``preexisting  condition.''   This is also personal for Chelsey from Seymour, WI, whose daughter  was born with a congenital heart defect. Right now, Zoe is guaranteed  access to coverage without being denied or charged more because of her  preexisting condition.   Chelsey wrote me during that debate last year: ``I'm pleading to you  as a mother to fight for the kids in Wisconsin with pre-existing  conditions that are counting on you to protect that right.''   No parent or grandparent should have to lie awake at night wondering  if the healthcare they have today for themselves and their families  will be there tomorrow. With the expansion of these junk plans, that  fear could become a new reality for far too many families as healthy  people leave the market, increasing premiums for everyone.   Children like Zoe may not be able to find any plan that her parents  can afford or that will cover the care she needs. No family should be  forced to choose between helping a loved one get better or going  bankrupt.   Before the Affordable Care Act, too many families had to make that  choice. Before the healthcare law, I heard from Sue from Beloit, WI.  Sue's husband was diagnosed with lung cancer. They quickly found out  their insurance plan had a $13,000 limit on radiation and chemotherapy.  That covered about one round of chemotherapy. When they needed to  continue treatment, Sue and her family used all of their savings, and  then they maxed out all of their credit cards. When they were facing  insurmountable credit card debt, she told me: ``I had no choice but to  file bankruptcy.'' Sue's husband later died.   We can't go back to the days when insurance companies wrote the  rules, just as we cannot allow the Trump administration to rewrite the  rules on guaranteed healthcare protections that millions of Americans  depend on.   More than 20 of the leading healthcare organizations in America,  representing our Nation's physicians, patients, medical students, and  other health experts, are supporting this resolution to overturn the  Trump administration's expansion of junk insurance plans. They are  doing so because these junk plans will reduce access to quality  coverage for millions and increase costs.   These junk plans will charge people more for coverage based on their  preexisting conditions or deny them coverage outright. These junk plans  will leave cancer patients and survivors with higher premiums and fewer  insurance options. These junk plans will force premium increases on  older Americans.   I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that  they are committed to protecting people with preexisting conditions.  Now is your chance to prove it. Anyone who says they support coverage  for people with  [[Page S6739]]  preexisting conditions should support this resolution to overturn the  Trump administration's expansion of these junk insurance plans.   This is an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to come together  to protect people's access to quality, affordable healthcare when they  need it the most. Let us join in seizing the opportunity to do what is  right by the American people.   I yield.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following documents concerning the rule submitted by the Secretary of  the Treasury, Secretary of Labor, and Secretary of Health and Human  Services relating to short-term, limited duration insurance be entered  into the Record: a letter to Congress from 113 health organizations  expressing concerns with the rule, a letter from the National  Association of Insurance Commissioners requesting a delay in  implementation of the rule, a short-term medical plan brochure from the  Golden Rule Insurance Company outlining the policy's coverage  exclusions, and a news article from 2014 illustrating the lack of  consumer protections in short-term limited duration plans.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     April 17, 2018.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader McConnell, Leader McCarthy,       Leader Schumer and Leader Pelosi: Our 113 organizations       represent millions of people with serious, acute, and chronic       diseases and disabilities, as well as their caregivers. These       individuals, and all Americans, need access to comprehensive,       affordable health coverage in order to meet their medical       needs.        We write to express our concerns about the impact the       proposed rule regarding short-term limited duration plans       (STLDs) (CMS-9924-P) will have both on the health insurance       marketplaces and the individuals we represent. While short       term plans can offer less expensive coverage, they are not       required to adhere to important standards, including the ten       essential health benefit categories, guaranteed issue, out-      of-pocket maximums, age-rating protections, and many other       critical consumer protections These policies are also allowed       to charge much higher premiums, deny coverage altogether for       consumers who cannot meet medical underwriting standards, and       impose lifetime and annual limits on services. If the       proposed rule put forward by the Administration is finalized       in its current form, it will limit access to quality and       affordable health insurance coverage for all Americans, and       disproportionately harm individuals with pre-existing       conditions and people with disabilities.        Expanding access to these policies will likely cause       premiums in the individual insurance marketplace to increase       dramatically, as younger and healthier individuals choose to       enroll in cheap short-term plans. Allowing STLDs to       proliferate would force individuals, including those with       serious or chronic diseases and disabilities, into a smaller,       sicker market to obtain the coverage they need to manage       their health. Premiums for comprehensive plans that meet       federal standards would likely skyrocket, and plans would       likely exit the market. This will make insurance either       unavailable or unaffordable for those who rely on the       marketplace to get coverage        Our organizations are dedicated to identifying and       promoting improvements to our health insurance markets that       control costs, stabilize the market, and positively impact       coverage and care for millions of Americans. Expanding access       to STLDs will move us away from--not towards--achieving these       goals. As advocates for our communities, we implore you to       protect patients and consumers, including individuals with       pre-existing conditions and persons with disabilities, by       asking the Administration to withdraw this proposed rule       until it adequately protects patients and consumers, as well       as any rules that do not increase stability, improve       affordability, and secure access to quality coverage in our       insurance markets.

Re Short-Term, Limited-Duration Insurance CMS-9924-P.       Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Department of         Health and Human Services,      Attention: CMS-9924-P,      Baltimore, MD.        To Whom It May Concern: Thank you for the opportunity to       comment on the proposed regulations on Short-Term, Limited       Duration Insurance published in the Federal Register on       February 21, 2018. These comments are submitted on behalf of       the members of the National Association of Insurance       Commissioners (NAIC), which represents the chief insurance       regulators in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and       the 5 United States territories.        As state insurance regulators we have the primary       responsibility of regulating our insurance markets and       ensuring consumers are protected and the markets are       competitive. As we stated in our comments on the current       short-term, limited duration regulation, ``Federal       interference can, and often does, have unintended       consequences and may not be effective in addressing the       underlying issues.'' We argued that the arbitrary 3-month       limitation set by the Federal government could harm some       consumers and limit choices. Returning the Federal definition       to ``less than 12 months,'' as proposed, is consistent not       only with longstanding federal law but also with how this       term has been long defined by most states.        In the analysis of Economic Impact and Paperwork Burden       related to federalism, the proposed rule states:        Federal officials have discussed the issue of the term       length of short-term, limited duration insurance with State       regulatory officials. This proposed rule has no federalism       implications to the extent that current State law       requirements for short-term, limited duration insurance are       the same as or more restrictive than the Federal standard       proposed in this proposed rule. States may continue to apply       such State law requirements.        Consistent with this statement, any further requirements,       including but not limited to restrictions related to the       sale, design, rating or duration of these plans, must be left       to the States, which have the primary authority under our       federal system to regulate the business of insurance, so that       they can address the unique conditions and needs of their       respective insurance markets. It is critical that state       regulators maintain the flexibility to determine whether, and       under what conditions, these plans are appropriate for their       state. We urge continued state flexibility on this issue.        We also agree that educating consumers and ensuring that       they are aware of the limitations of these plans is       paramount. Some of these plans may provide significantly less       coverage and consumer protections than comprehensive plans.       We supported the disclosure requirements in the current       regulations and support the expansions in this proposed rule.        States have received several consumer complaints about       confusion and misinformation regarding their short-term or       excepted benefit plans. Because of the real risk that       consumers may confuse short-term policies with comprehensive       health insurance that complies with the Affordable Care Act       (ACA), it is important that they be made aware of any       limitations to these policies during the sales process. We       are pleased that the proposed rule retains these important       disclosure requirements and adds valuable additional       disclosures.        As drafted, this rulemaking does not address the impact of       Section 1557 of the ACA on the issuance of short-term,       limited duration plans. Specifically, it is unclear whether       or not these plans will be considered to be a ``health       program or activity'' under 45 C.F.R. Sec. 92.4 This       distinction is critical.        If these plans are not exempt from the definition of       ``health plan or activity,'' the implication would be that       carriers could not offer these plans and also participate on       the Marketplace, Medicare, or Medicaid. In many states       throughout the country, carriers are deciding whether or not       to participate in the ACA-compliant marketplace, and if       clarifying language is not included carriers will be forced       to choose either to offer short-term, limited duration plans       or participate in the Exchange. We would ask for       clarification on this issue, and specifically advise that CMS       include language in the proposed definition of ``short-term,       limited duration insurance'' providing that such insurance is       ``not a health program or activity as defined in 45 C.F.R.       Sec. 92.4.''        As to the issue of renewability, the members of the NAIC       concur that any decision over whether and when these plans       should be renewable should be left up to the States, not       dictated by the Federal government.        Finally, states are concerned about the timing of this       rule, and some states may want to modify existing laws and       regulations to protect consumers and state markets.       Therefore, we recommend that the final regulation allow       states, if they so choose, to begin enforcing the new rules       in 2020, thus giving them time to review their rules and seek       statutory or regulatory changes to facilitate a smooth       transition.        Thank you for this opportunity to comment. We are available       to discuss these or other issues as the Short-Term, Limited       Duration Proposed Rule is finalized.            Sincerely,      Julie Mix McPeak,        NAIC President, Commissioner, Tennessee Department of       Commerce & Insurance.      Raymond G. Farmer,        NAIC Vice President, Director, South Carolina Department of       Insurance.      Eric A. Cioppa,        NAIC President-Elect, Superintendent, Maine Bureau of       Insurance.

Ito,        NAIC Secretary-Treasurer, Commissioner, Insurance Division,       Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs.                                   ____               UnitedHealthcare, Golden Rule Insurance Company                          Short Term Medical Plans          STATES: AZ, FL, IA, IL, IN, MI, MS, NE, PA, TN, TX, WI, WV         This coverage is not required to comply with certain       federal market requirements for health insurance, principally       those contained in the Affordable Care Act. Be sure to check       your certificate carefully to make sure you are aware of any       exclusions or limitations regarding coverage of preexisting       conditions or health benefits (such as hospitalization,       emergency services, maternity care, preventive care,       prescription drugs, and mental health and substance use       disorder services). Your certificate might also have lifetime       and/or annual dollar limits on health benefits. If this       coverage expires or you lose eligibility for this coverage,       you might have to wait until an open enrollment period to get       other health insurance coverage. Also, this coverage is not       ``minimum essential coverage.'' If you don't have minimum       essential coverage for any month in 2018, you may have to       make a payment when you file your tax return unless you       qualify for an exemption from the requirement that you have       health coverage for that month.                       What's Not Covered (all plans)         This is only a general outline of the coverage provisions       and exclusions. It is not an insurance contract, nor part of       the insurance policy/certificate. You will find complete       coverage details in the policy/certificate Also see state       variations on pages 10-13.                              general exclusions         Benefits will not be paid for services or supplies that are       not administered or ordered by a doctor and medically       necessary to the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or       injury, as defined in the policy.      No benefits are payable for expenses:        For non-emergency services or supplies received from a       provider who is not a network provider, except as       specifically provided for by the policy.        For a preexisting condition--A condition:        (1) for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment       was recommended or received within the 24 months immediately       preceding the date the covered person became insured under       the policy/certificate; or (2) that had manifested itself in       such a manner that would have caused an ordinarily prudent       person to seek medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment       within the 12 months immediately preceding the date the       covered person became insured under the policy/certificate.        A pregnancy existing on the effective date of coverage will       also be considered a preexisting condition.        Note: Even if you have had prior Golden Rule coverage and       your preexisting conditions were covered under that plan,       they will not be covered under this plan.        That would not have been charged if you did not have       insurance.        Incurred while your coverage is not in force.

These       policies have been around forever and are aimed at recent       college grads, people between jobs, and new employees waiting       for group benefits to kick in. They're marketed by major       insurers including UnitedHealthcare Services, Humana, some       Blue Cross and Blue Shield carriers, and many smaller       companies.        Short-term plans have become more visible as some insurers       and brokers take advantage of the hoopla surrounding the       Affordable Care Act to market them as alternatives to the       policies available on the state and federal exchanges.       Although the plans look a little like those approved under       Obamacare, they provide less coverage and don't have to       adhere to the same rules. The companies are allowed to turn       away patients who are sick and refuse to cover preexisting       conditions. They don't have to pay for preventative care and       aren't required to renew a policy if a patient needs a lot of       medical care. ``If you get sick, it's not going to take care       of you,'' says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser       Family Foundation, a health researcher.        The short-term plans also don't satisfy the Obamacare       requirement that people have adequate coverage, so people who       buy them face the same tax penalties as the uninsured. Twenty       percent of short-term policyholders believed, wrongly, that       their coverage would be adequate under the ACA, according to       a survey published in September by EHealth, an online       brokerage that sells conventional and short-term policies. An       additional 64 percent said they weren't sure.        There's plenty of cause for the confusion. Assurant, one of       the larger sellers of the temporary medical plans, says on       its website that ``these plans do not meet minimum essential       coverage requirements'' and customers may face tax penalties.       But insurance agency Liberty Medicare in Wynnewood, Pa.,       called short-term plans ``a viable alternative to Obamacare       plans'' in a recent blog post, although the company also       noted that ``their benefits are not as broad as Obamacare       benefits.'' Even if the policies exclude preexisting       conditions, says president Gregory Lazarev, for ``healthy       people who are not entitled to subsidies, it makes perfect       sense to go and buy a short-term plan.''        20 Percent of short-term policy holders wrongly believe       their plan meets Obamacare standards.        ``There definitely are some companies out there that are       aggressively marketing these and [similar] policies,''       Pollitz says. One making expansive claims is Health Insurance       Innovations, which connects consumers with short-term       policies from third-party insurers. The Tampa company, which       raised $65 million in an initial offering about a year ago,       is expecting a boost from the ACA, even though its plans       don't meet the law's requirements for adequate coverage. ``We       want to be ready to take full advantage of this unprecedented       degree of market expansion,'' Chief Executive Officer Michael       Kosloske said in a November earnings call. In an interview,       Kosloske says: ``Our benefits are the same or better than       what you're going to find, for example, on the exchanges.''        A sample policy sold by Kosloske's company suggests       otherwise. Unlike ACA plans, it doesn't cover immunizations       and routine physicals, outpatient prescription drugs,       preexisting conditions, pregnancy or childbirth, sports       injuries, substance abuse treatment, allergies, or kidney       disease. It also comes with a $2 million lifetime limit on       benefits, a provision banned under Obamacare rules.        Buying the stripped-down, short-term policy could save a       30-year-old Florida man $1,123 in premiums over a year,       compared with a typical bronze-level HMO plan from Humana. If       he earns $46,000 a year, he'd have to pay about 41 percent of       the savings in tax penalties for not having coverage       authorized by the ACA. The penalty rate will double in 2015.       If the hypothetical consumer earns $23,000 or less, federal       subsidies would make up the difference between the price of       the bronze plan and the short-term policy.        Kosloske points out that the bronze plan has exclusions,       too, and a limited network--it doesn't pay anything if you       see a doctor outside the plan. In the plan his company sells,       ``covered benefits are paid the same way whether in or       outside the broad and highly accessible provider network,''       he says. Pollitz advises consumers to stay away from short-      term plans. ``It may cover your claims until your term of       coverage runs out,'' she says. But for anyone who gets sick       and hopes to renew, ``it's junk.''        The bottom line: Consumers buying cheaper, short-term       health plans get limited benefits and still have to pay       Obamacare penalties.
