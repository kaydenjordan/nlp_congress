 Mr. President, EB-5 investments are a major economic  driver in Texas. EB-5 projects use merit-based immigration to create  thousands of American jobs and bring billions of dollars in investment  to major urban areas, like Dallas and Houston, as well as our rural  communities across the State. These projects include investments in  infrastructure for a wide variety of sectors, including energy,  hospitality, residential, and commercial.   I am a supporter of the EB-5 Program and its resources for the  community, but there is no question, as Senator Grassley has said, that  it could stand some reforms. As with any debate in Congress, there are  a lot of different opinions on what those reforms should look like, but  we can all agree that we need to strengthen this program and  reauthorize it.   I am glad to join Senator Grassley today in offering this legislation  to improve the integrity and security of the EB-5 Program, while  ensuring law-abiding Texas job creators aren't negatively impacted.   This bill would have reauthorized the EB-5 Program until 2023, with  significant oversight and integrity measures. It will require regional  centers to have policies and procedures in place to protect against  fraud. It will give the Department of Homeland Security greater  authority to terminate applications based on fraud, criminal misuse, or  threats to public safety or national security. It would subject EB-5  projects to greater oversight. All of these changes come without  skewing the framework of the program to benefit certain areas to the  detriment of others.   This happens to be very similar to legislation that I introduced in  2015 with Senator Schumer and Senator Flake, which included  recommendations from both the Department of Homeland Security and the  Government Accountability Office.   I appreciate Chairman Grassley's leadership on this legislation, and  I hope at some point we can reauthorize the EB-5 Program and safeguard  critical investments in communities across the country.    Madam President, dating back to his time as a Member of  the Senate, President Biden--then-Senator Biden--frequently shared a  piece of advice from his dad:         Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll       tell you what you value.    He is not wrong. We have heard countless iterations of the same  message from President Biden. Actions speak louder than words. Talk is  cheap. Or, as we say in Texas, sometimes someone is all hat and no  cattle.   So I want to take President Biden up on his advice. We have spent  plenty of time hearing what his values are. He has talked about the  importance of rebuilding our economy following the pandemic. We all  agree with that--restoring public trust in government, check;  protecting low- and middle-income families from tax hikes, check; and  standing up to Russia and China, the two greatest threats to the world  order. These are priorities shared by Americans with diverse political  views, and they are critical goals that any President--Republican or  Democrat--should have.    But we don't have to take the President at his word when he talks  about the importance of each of these things because we have his  budget. We have a written plan from the President of the United States,  outlining how his administration wants to turn his spoken intentions  into concrete action.   So based upon President Biden's budget, what does he value? It just  takes a quick glance to see that responsible spending is not one of the  things that he values. The overall pricetag of the President's budget  is a whopping $6.4 trillion. Even with the President's massive tax  hikes, the United States would still be running more than a trillion  dollar deficit each year.   It would only take 2 years for our debt burden to reach the highest  level in American history, surpassing even World War II-era debt.   As a reminder, the government has spent a massive amount of money  over the last 15 months, as we know. Much of it was a necessary  investment in our fight against COVID-19.   On top of that funding, though, our Democratic colleagues  circumvented the bipartisan legislative process and added an additional  $2 trillion on a host of partisan pet projects, only about 10 percent  of which related to COVID-19, even though that was the caption on the  bill--a COVID-19 relief bill that was only 10 percent COVID-19.   Now, perhaps nobody expected the President to dramatically cut  spending and solve our national debt problems in one go, but this is  not a time, after trillions of dollars of necessary COVID-19 spending,  to go on another unrelated spending spree, especially once you see  where all the money is going. Once again, this is his budget; these are  his values.   One of the most critical lines in any President's budget is  discretionary spending. For a decade, my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle have pined for parity between defense and nondefense  spending. But as soon as they get unified government--majority in the  House, majority in Senate, and the White House--what do they do? Well,  they abandon that parity argument and provide a measly 2-percent  increase to defense spending while providing a 16-percent increase in  the President's budget to domestic spending--hardly parity.   The Federal Government simply cannot provide for the common defense  without the resources to do so. In the face of growing threats, which  we all have acknowledged--China, Russia, Iran, North Korea--you would  think that the President would propose a substantial increase in  defense spending, but he proposed a whopping 2 percent.   Now, compare that to the Department of Education, where the  President's budget calls for a 41-percent increase, a 28-percent  increase for the Department of Commerce, and a 22-percent increase for  the Environmental Protection Agency. Well, when you adjust for  inflation, the small increase for defense spending actually represents  a decrease.   The Department of Defense isn't the only national security Agency  that the Biden budget expects to do with less. Even with a humanitarian  crisis on our border, the budget for the Department of Homeland  Security remains flat. Once again, after inflation, that will represent  a decrease in spending over the current year.   Customs and Border Protection personnel are working overtime to take  care of unaccompanied children, to stop dangerous drugs from crossing  our border, and to enforce the laws that we in Congress have passed.  They need more support to handle the situation in a fair and humane  way. Cutting already thin resources for the entire Department will only  make the circumstances at the border more dangerous--for law  enforcement, for local communities that are being overrun by the huge  numbers of people coming across the border--and a danger to the  migrants themselves.   If this $6.4 trillion budget doesn't support our most urgent  priorities, what does it support? What priorities are so critical that  they supersede the need to support our national security and protect  our borders?   Well, for one, the administration would double the size of the  Internal Revenue Service. I am sure that is good news to every  taxpaying American. The President has called for increasing the number  of IRS agents by 15 percent a year for the next decade.  [[Page S4752]]    We have previously seen the damage that a politically motivated IRS  can do. We saw the apparent leaking of taxpayer information recently,  which is supposed to be confidential by law. And we can remember the  IRS targeting controversy under the Obama administration.   Bureaucrats at the IRS subjected conservative groups that they  disagreed with politically or ideologically to a different level of  scrutiny than left-leaning groups. And, unfortunately, with this sort  of huge investment in the IRS, it looks like the Biden administration  simply wants to weaponize the IRS once again.   But that is just the start of it. A massive portion of the  President's budget stems from two of the programs he has already told  us about--one being the $2.6 trillion American Jobs Plan, which relies  on a very generous interpretation of the word ``infrastructure,'' and  it reads like the Green New Deal 2.0: more than $200 billion to build  or retrofit more than 2 million affordable and sustainable places to  live; a civilian climate corps; and an unrealistic 100-percent  renewable-generated electricity by 2035.   His budget includes a range of other spending to address climate  change, including over $1 billion to help other countries--not  Americans, not the United States, but other countries--to lower their  emissions.   I am sure China will be glad to take our money while continuing to  build coal-fired powerplants to meet the demands of their growing  economy.   Then there is a broad range of spending from President Biden's $1.8  trillion so-called American Families Plan--you have got to love the  names of these pieces of legislation--which includes everything from  universal preschool and free community college to mandatory paid leave  policies and using the Tax Code to disguise more Washington spending.   If you read through the President's budget, which, as he said,  reflects his values, you see the incredible way that President Biden is  simply caving in to the radical left. Mothers are no longer called  mothers. They are now called ``birthing people''--unbelievably.   Well, it is one thing for far-left activists to use these kinds of  terms on Twitter, but it is entirely different to diminish the role of  women in an official government document. Women are more than  ``birthing people,'' and I think it is insulting to women to  characterize them or define them by that.   The President doubled down on the woke ideology by proposing taxpayer  funding for abortion. We know abortion is enormously controversial in  our society, but this is a jarring break from a decades-long  bipartisan, consensual ban provided by the Hyde amendment. It is also  stands in stark contrast in the views of most Americans. The majority  of Americans say they oppose using taxpayer dollars to support  abortions because they are morally or religiously opposed to the  practice.    Adding to the list of absurdities is a massive expansion of welfare.  We already know that under the COVID-19 relief bills, the  administration has argued in favor of paying people more not to work  than they would earn if they did work.   A number of Governors--more than 20 of them now--have refused the  $300 weekly supplement because of their concern that this was actually  discouraging people from returning to work.   We are hearing from employers all across the country that it is hard,  if not impossible, for them to find the workforce they need to get the  economy growing again. Business owners in my State--and I would bet  across the Country--are already struggling to find a reliable workforce  following the overly generous pandemic-related unemployment benefits  that our Democratic colleagues insisted upon.   We can't continue to discourage Americans from going back to work,  because our economy will never recover if we stay on that path.   Overall, the President's budget would dramatically increase the size  of government and the role it plays in our everyday lives, especially  with education--as my friend Senator Tim Scott has said, putting  Washington even more in the middle of Americans' lives, from the cradle  to college. Is that really what the American dream is all about--more  and bigger government intervening in our lives, denying us the freedom  to make our own choices and to seek our own way?   It is no wonder that the White House rolled out the President's  budget so quietly. Frequently, a lot of this happens on Friday  afternoons after the press has left and nobody is paying much  attention.   While President Biden has told us what he values over and over again,  his budget actually speaks to much more. This is not the plan of  someone who is fighting for a strong national defense and a swift  economic recovery. This budget prioritizes climate justice over  American military servicemembers. It further hampers our economic  recovery at the expense of hard-working taxpayers, and it prioritizes  the restriction of wealth over the prospect of economic growth, which  would lift all boats. It digs the United States deeper and deeper into  debt, creating a massive financial pit that our children and  grandchildren will have to dig their way out of. We are writing the  checks, but they will pay the bills, and that, I believe, is immoral.   It is all well and good to tell the American people that you value  the same things they value--freedom, security, prosperity--but this,  which in President Biden's own words reflects his values, this is not a  blueprint to rebuild America. This is, indeed, strong evidence that  President Biden has bowed down to the woke political left in his own  base and is ready to bury the United States and future generations with  unprecedented debt.   When he released his budget, President Biden said, ``Where we choose  to invest speaks to what we value as a Nation.'' The President of the  United States has made clear what he values. The Nation? Its future?  Its prosperity? Its security? Not much.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
