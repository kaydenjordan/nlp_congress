 Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, the  Congressional Budget Office released its estimate of H.R. 2430, the FDA  Reauthorization Act of 2017, in July 2017. Information related to this  House-passed bill can be found at the Congressional Budget Office's  website with the following link: https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/ 115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/hr2430.pdf  ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate Budget Committee wishes to honor  and recognize Marion Curry on her retirement from the Congressional  Budget Office. Marion has worked in the budget analysis division of the  Congressional Budget Office in various capacities for more than 38  years and has been a full-time employee at CBO since 1987. During that  time, she served as the administrative assistant for the projections  unit, and over the past several years, she expanded her  responsibilities to also encompass the health systems and Medicare  unit, as well as the low-income health programs and prescription drugs  unit.   During her long tenure at CBO, Marion has skillfully carried out a  variety of tasks--carefully checking cost estimates as she produced  drafts, ensuring that timesheets were done correctly, directing callers  to the appropriate person, and in general assuring that administrative  matters were taken care of without a hitch. Such duties have undergone  many changes over the years--from using telephones as the primary  method of contact, typing tables by hand, and sending paper copies of  documents, to the current approach of using email as the primary method  of contact, transferring spreadsheets to the editorial staff for  producing tables, and sending PDFs of documents with supplemental data  posted on the web. Through all of those changes, Marion readily adapted  to new technology and procedures and carried out her responsibilities  with good humor, professionalism, a giving spirit, and a dedication to  serving the Congress and the public.   Marion contributed to CBO's work in ways that went well beyond her  administrative responsibilities. She routinely took the lead to make  sure that key life events of staff--such as birthdays, weddings, and  births--were celebrated, and she was often the first person others in  the organization consulted when they needed assistance with planning  and organizing events. In addition, her contributions to the charitable  works of the agency were well-known and appreciated. Marion is  extremely warm, generous, and giving--she was always there to provide  support, encouragement, and someone to talk to. Her contribution to the  working environment at CBO was beyond measure, and she will be greatly  missed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate Budget Committee wishes to honor  and recognize Jeffrey Holland on his retirement after 26 years of  distinguished service to the Congress with the Congressional Budget  Office. Jeff is highly regarded by Republicans and Democrats on both  sides of the Capitol for his deep knowledge of the budget process and  his commitment to the nonpartisan role that CBO plays in the budget  process.   Jeff arrived at CBO in 1991 soon after graduation from Carnegie  Mellon University's Heinz School of Public Policy with a master's  degree in public policy and management. He joined the projections unit  in the budget analysis division, which is responsible for preparing  projections of Federal spending, deficit, debt, and other data related  to the Federal budget, as well as providing ongoing support to  Congress.   In 1999, Jeff became chief of the projections unit, and for the past  18 years, he has successfully overseen the production of multiple  reports on the Budget and Economic Outlook, annual analyses of the  President's budget request, and also several reports on sequestration,  the debt ceiling, national income, and product accounts, and the  Troubled Asset Relief Program. Through all of these tasks, he has been  the steady hand of the projections unit, generous with his time and  knowledge, and highly responsive to questions and requests for data or  information from the staff of the Budget Committee. His persistence,  attention to detail, and reliably clear thinking have been vital to the  smooth functioning of the budget analysis division. Senate staff and  CBO colleagues have come to depend on him for his sage advice and deep  understanding of the budget laws.   In addition, Jeff has often lent his expertise to legislative  branches of other countries as they seek to develop their own capacity  for nonpartisan budget analysis. He is a sought-after explainer of the  Federal budget process to students visiting our Nation's Capital. In  short, Jeff's expertise, knowledge, and generosity of time and spirit  will be sorely missed. We wish him well as he  [[Page S4761]]  moves on after years of outstanding service to the Congress. We are  grateful for that service, and we wish him the best in the years to  come.                            ____________________
