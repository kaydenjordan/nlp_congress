 Madam Speaker, America's confidence in our electoral  system has suffered an egregious blow this cycle. Of the many credible  concerns surrounding this year's process, Dominion voting machines have  neared the top of the list. From crashing during a recount in Georgia  to several errors in Antrim County, Michigan, it is clear that  Dominion's authority on vote counting is in question. There needs to be  a fully independent audit of Dominion's voting machines.   No, this is not an attempt to overturn an election; this is about  making sure, moving forward, all Americans have faith in our elections,  whether it is the constitutional actions setting election process in  place or transparency in the tabulation of the vote.   Madam Speaker, my Republican colleagues and I have stressed that  every legal vote must be counted, but we must also ensure those who  count our votes, whether a person or a machine, are also fully  complying with the law.                            ____________________
