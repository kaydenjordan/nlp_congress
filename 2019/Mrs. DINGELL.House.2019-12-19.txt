 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his hard  work on getting us here today.   We have to be honest: This trade deal won't undo the deep damage  NAFTA 1.0 has done to our American workers, American manufacturing, and  our environment. Today, factories sit empty in Michigan and across my  district, while workers are unable to compete with subpar nonunion  workers in other countries.   A new trade agreement is not just going to uproot those factories  from overseas and bring them back home, but we fought hard to improve  the original deal because what the Trump administration first proposed  wasn't enough. Democrats fought for stronger labor and environmental  standards and tougher enforcement mechanisms.   This agreement has earned my vote because of the significant  improvements made over the last year in NAFTA 1.0, but our work is  still there to strengthen American manufacturing, protect our  environment, invest in our workers, and make sure we keep America at  the forefront of innovation and technology.
