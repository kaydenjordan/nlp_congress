 Madam Speaker, last week, Congress passed the  comprehensive bipartisan government funding bill that, for the first  time in over a decade, delivered direct relief to community funding  projects.   In my district, I worked with local and State elected officials, city  and town managers, nonprofit organizations, and community and business  leaders to identify top infrastructure, social services, and healthcare  projects in need of Federal investment.   I thank the Appropriations Committee for fully funding all of these  requests, which included a new workforce development institute for  offshore wind, the expansion of a domestic violence shelter and a  community health center, multiple projects to provide clean water for  my constituents, dam and dredging improvements to protect against  flooding disasters, and a project to support economic development.   This funding bill represents a shift in Congress toward partnerships,  good policy, and action. We must work to further advance bipartisan  progress in the years ahead.                            ____________________
