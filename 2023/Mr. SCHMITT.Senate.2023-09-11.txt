 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Jefferson  College in Hillsboro, MO, for 60 years of academic excellence and  accomplishment.   Founded in 1963, Jefferson College is the ``Jewel of Jefferson  County.'' The college has contributed to the development and progress  of Jefferson County and the surrounding region, equipping thousands of  students each year with the tools to be successful in a variety of  academic disciplines. The college's programs are instrumental in  raising up the next generation of teachers, police officers, nurses,  and citizens. The college remains devoted to providing high-quality  academics at an affordable price, making it a great option for students  in any stage of life. Communities are built upon the collaboration of  men and women who have been properly trained in their designated  fields, and Jefferson College continues to assemble communities of  qualified workers and strengthen Missouri as a whole.   I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing Jefferson  College's diamond anniversary, 60 years of scholarship. I hope all my  colleagues will join me in celebrating the important work being done at  Jefferson College and all the work it will accomplish in the  future.                            ____________________
