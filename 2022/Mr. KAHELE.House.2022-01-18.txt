 Madam Speaker, I rise to express the serious concern that  our aviation community has regarding the rollout of 5G service. The  Federal Aviation Administration has warned that potential 5G  interference could affect sensitive airplane instruments, such as radar  altimeters, which would significantly hamper low-visibility operations,  and so we must delay the rollout of 5G at select airports until we can  address all aviation safety concerns.   Pilots across America are flying in low-visibility conditions, from  snow to sea fog to other zero-visibility conditions, and they need all  the instruments and procedures at their disposal so that they can  safely protect the lives of their passengers and crew.   We cannot and must not compromise on safety. It will be safe to fly  when pilots say it is safe to fly. The United States has the safest air  transportation system in the world, and we must continue to safeguard  this system.   I am thankful that wireless carriers have decided to delay the  implementation at key airports, but that does not go far enough. The  FAA needs to ensure that 5G services will not be implemented at any of  the 50 airport locations that have been identified as vulnerable until  safety can be ensured.                            ____________________
