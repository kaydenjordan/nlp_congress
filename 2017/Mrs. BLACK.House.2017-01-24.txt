 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule  to provide consideration of H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act. This bill is,  quite literally, the least we can do for American taxpayers and our  voiceless unborn.   Frankly, the fact that we are even here discussing this, and that  there is opposition to this bill at all, really does break my heart,  and it speaks to the depths of the entanglement with the big abortion  industry that exist in some corners of this Chamber. Because, at the  end of the day, you know what this bill really is about? The right to  choose.   We hear our friends across the aisle use the phrase a lot. But what  about the other right to choose, the right of the taxpayer to choose  not to pay for the practice that violates everything that they believe?  That is what we are here to protect.   The American people support this policy, with 6 in 10 surveyed saying  that taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund abortions. And these  are both pro-life and pro-choice.   So today, Madam Speaker, I am asking my colleagues across the aisle  to honor the will of their constituents. I am asking them to remember  the good old Democratic rallying cry of safe, legal, and rare abortion.  Obviously, abortion is not rare today when over 330,000 abortions are  performed in 1 year.   If my colleagues still believe these words, they will join us in  supporting this modest solution to keep unsuspecting taxpayers off of  the hook for this practice. And if they can't vote for this bill then  there is truly not a single limit on abortion that they will accept,  and that is a sad commentary on the state of politics.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule.   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just clarify for the Record that there is no Federal funding  for abortion. All you have to do is read the Hyde amendment, which has  been in effect for 40 years. I don't support it, but that is the law of  the land.   The majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal. So if you  want to talk about polls, the overwhelming number of Americans believe  that abortions should be safe and legal.   I also would like to say that while my colleagues are working  overtime to try to defund organizations like Planned Parenthood, it is  because of Planned Parenthood, the counseling that is provided, and the  reproductive services that are provided at their clinics, and  contraception, that the number of abortions have decreased in this  country.   Madam Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to defeat the previous  question. And if we do, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to  bring up legislation, which I am happy to be a cosponsor of, along with  Ms. Eshoo, that would require sitting Presidents and Presidential  nominees to disclose their last 3 years of tax returns.                                time  1300                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind all persons in the  gallery that they are here as guests of the House and that any  manifestation of approval or disapproval of proceedings is in violation  of the rules of the House.   The gentleman may continue.   Mr. McGOVERN. Despite the long tradition of Presidents and  Presidential nominees of disclosing their tax returns, Donald Trump has  refused to release his, and his spokesperson recently said that he has  no intention of doing so. The American people expect and deserve  transparency, which this legislation would ensure.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, between his refusal to release his tax  returns and all these business conflicts of interest, this Presidency  is on a collision course with corruption.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support our effort here.   To discuss our proposal, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 55, I call up  the bill (H.R. 7) to prohibit taxpayer funded abortions, and ask for  its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   H.R. 7         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H634]]            SECTION 1.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 55, the  gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black) and the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Ms. DeGette) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on H.R. 7, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on H.R. 7, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in strong support of the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, and I thank the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for his unflinching leadership on  this issue.   It was just a week ago that groups of women marched in the streets of  D.C. and other cities across the country apparently ready to write off  this Presidency as it just began.   There were millions of pro-life women who were explicitly told that  they were unwelcome at this event. So today, the people's House is  giving them and the more than 60 percent of Americans from all  political persuasions who oppose taxpayer funding of abortions a voice.   The legislation before us will protect Americans' conscience rights  by ensuring that their hard-earned tax dollars are not used to fund the  destruction of innocent life. That is a principle that Members of both  parties have supported in this Chamber before.   Every year, Democrats and Republicans alike have come together to  support funding bills that maintain the law called the Hyde amendment,  which prohibits the direct Federal funding of abortion, with limited  exceptions. This 40-year-old law has saved an estimated 2 million  lives, but it is not permanent, meaning that this time-honored  protection could be taken away on a whim. What is more, the law, in its  current form, has clear loopholes.   A 2014 GAO study found that taxpayer-funded insurance subsidies could  be used to pay for abortions on over 1,000 ObamaCare plans nationwide.  That is why today we have the opportunity to make this life-affirming  law permanent and governmentwide.   As a mother, a grandmother, and a nurse for more than 40 years, this  measure is especially meaningful to me. During my years in the  healthcare industry, I saw the joy in young parents' eyes when they met  their newborn for the very first time. I held the hands of grieving  spouses and children as they said good-bye to their loved ones. And,  sadly, I witnessed a young woman lose her life due to the effects of a  botched abortion.   These experiences informed my view that all life is a precious gift  from God. I pray that in time this truth will be reflected in our  Nation's laws. Until then, can't we at least do this much.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and  Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, our constituents are looking to this Congress to  address the economy, jobs, our crumbling infrastructure, and so many  other issues. But despite these pressing needs, the only substantive  bill this House is considering this week is a bill restricting a  woman's ability to get a full range of healthcare services and a bill,  which passed before in this House and that we know is going nowhere in  the other body.   Its title alone must be part of the majority's new plan to redefine  facts. As we heard the other day, we now apparently have in our  discourse ``alternative facts.''   This bill takes that to a whole new level, and let me tell you why.  The bill is called the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion  Insurance Full Disclosure Act. But under current law, under the Hyde  amendment--which I hate, which I will do everything to repeal--we have  no taxpayer funding for abortion. Taxpayer funds are currently  prohibited from use for abortions. Instead, what this bill does is it  takes that concept and it uses it to far expand a restriction on a  woman's ability to get the full health care that she needs.   Let me talk about what this bill does exactly. First of all, it  codifies the Hyde amendment into statute, which has never been done in  this Nation's history.   Secondly, it codifies a ban on abortions in D.C., even when they are  done with D.C.'s taxpayer money and not with Federal money.   Number three, it codifies the Helms amendment, which denies women  abroad access to safe abortion care by severely restricting the use of  U.S. funds to pay for healthcare services in developing countries.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   It severely restricts abortion coverage in the ACA's exchanges by  forbidding people who have plans where they get subsidies from paying  for plans with their own money. This is a far expansion of a  restriction on a woman's right to get her own health insurance with her  own money.   It denies insurance-related tax credits to small businesses that  choose plans that offer abortion services. It permanently bans abortion  services for Federal employees and it codifies a ban on abortion  coverage for women in military services overseas.   The fact that we are debating this today, just 1 day after President  Trump issued an executive order reinstating the global gag rule, is a  slap in the face to the over 3 million women who marched last weekend.   Let's vote ``no'' on this bill and let's go to the business that the  American public really cares about.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), who is the chair of the Judiciary Committee  and a longstanding supporter of pro-life.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Dakota (Mrs. Noem), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Dakota (Mrs. Noem), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I referenced in my opening remarks that  there has been bipartisan support for this measure, the Hyde amendment,  on a yearly basis. I just want to make mention that the former  gentlewoman from California who just spoke did vote for this measure in  the fiscal year 2016 omnibus bill.   Madam Speaker, it is my honor to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is the sponsor of the bill and is a  champion for the unborn. It is really an honor for me to have served  with him on this particular issue.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I want to first thank the  distinguished gentlewoman, my good friend Diane Black, for her  extraordinary leadership. I also want to say to my colleagues--and I  hope this really is accepted for the profound change that it  underscores--the Hyde amendment has saved 2 million lives; 2 million  survivors who would have died had Medicaid funding for abortion not  been available.   This is over the course of 40 years, but 2 million lives, some of  whom are 39, 38. It is about 60,000 children every year. And if you  look at where this comes from, much of the mega-analysis comes from a  peer review done by the Guttmacher Institute in 2009. They have found  that there is a 25 percent  [[Page H637]]  reduction in Medicaid abortions when Medicaid money is not available to  effectuate the dismemberment and the chemical poisoning of an unborn  child.   Defense of the unborn child is a human rights issue of our time,  Madam Speaker. We talk about the unborn child, we degrade them, we  treat them as if they are tumors or warts to be excised rather than  children growing, developing, and maturing.   Ultrasound imaging, as we all know, has shattered the myth that  somehow an unborn child is anything but human and alive. And I hope  that the science, which is very readily available, catches up with the  policy.   This makes Hyde and all of the other amendments permanent. We know  that every year we have an annual battle over several of those  amendments. It also, finally, title II, takes out of ObamaCare the  facilitation and the funding of abortion.   When President Obama did his executive order in December of 2010, he  said that the Hyde amendment would be applied to the ObamaCare  exchanges. For months and years after that in-House debate, people have  said that has happened. It did not. We know beyond any reasonable  doubt--and we enlisted GAO to look at that--well over 1,000 plans pay  for abortion on demand in the ObamaCare exchanges.   So that got the votes the pro-life Democrats needed to effectuate the  passage of the Affordable Care Act. But, frankly, it hasn't happened.  Title II of this bill says the Hyde amendment will be applied to the  ObamaCare exchanges. Had that been done faithfully by the President,  there would be no need for title II of this bill.   I remember when the President stood right there in September of 2009  and said: Under our plan, no taxpayer funding will be used to pay for  abortion. Absolutely untrue. This language in H.R. 7 makes that true.  We don't want to be complicit in the killing and the maiming of unborn  children. As we know now, beyond any reasonable doubt, post-abortive  women increasingly are coming forward and speaking out, those  especially who found peace and reconciliation to say abortion also  hurts women.   There are two victims in every abortion: mother and baby. Two million  lives saved. That is what we should be all about, life affirming and  the saving of human rights.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), one of our new Members.    Madam Chair, it is my honor to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), one of my Ways and Means  colleagues and a long-time supporter of pro-life.    Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks), who has been a longstanding  supporter of life.    Madam Speaker, I want to once again mention that there  has been longstanding bipartisan support for the support of the Hyde  amendment.   As a matter of fact, the gentlewoman from California who just spoke  voted for this on three different occasions;  [[Page H638]]  most recently in the MACRA that was passed in 2015; the omnibus, which  was passed in December of 2015 and also in December of 2016; and in the  fiscal year 2017 CR.   It is now my honor to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama  (Mrs. Roby), a member of the Appropriations Committee and a strong  supporter of pro-life.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith).   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my friend for yielding.   Madam Speaker, my distinguished colleague said ``prove it'' about the  2 million. Well, there is a very extensive study done by Michael J.  New. The Review of Literature done in June of 2009 by the Guttmacher  Institute found: ``Approximately one-fourth of women who would have had  Medicaid-funded abortions instead gave birth when this funding was  unavailable.''    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Brady), who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, once again, I want to talk about the  longstanding bipartisan support for the Hyde amendment. The gentlewoman  from Florida has supported this measure in the omnibus bill and also  the CR of 2017.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Wagner), who is a member of the Financial Services Committee. She  and her family have been fighting for pro-life issues for many, many,  many years.    Madam Speaker, once again, I want to say that there has  been longstanding bipartisan support for the Hyde amendment, and the  gentlewoman from Florida supported this measure back in 2015 on the  H.R. 2 MACRA bill and the 2015 omnibus bill, H.R. 2029.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs.  Love).    Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Madam Speaker, I want to remind everyone of the  longstanding bipartisan support for the Hyde amendment. The gentlewoman  from New York voted for this measure in the omnibus bill, H.R. 2029, in  2015, and then on the MACRA bill, also in 2015.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Russell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) one of our newest Members.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) one of our newest Members.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. LaHood).   Mr. LaHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7, the No  Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure  Act.   Unfortunately, in our Nation, the most vulnerable and the most  helpless lives amongst us have had their lives ended unceremoniously  and tragically through abortion. Since 1973, 57 million lives have been  lost to abortion. Even more disheartening, taxpayer dollars have been  funding these abortions, despite the fact that polls show that 60  percent of Americans believe that abortions should not be directly paid  for with tax dollars.   Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has saved 2 million lives by  prohibiting tax dollars from funding abortions. It is time to make this  lifesaving amendment permanent and governmentwide. If signed by our new  President, this   [[Page H641]]  measure would do just that. Supporting comprehensive, life-affirming  care is a better and more effective way to invest in women's health.    I am thankful to all those who will come to Washington, D.C., this  week to March for Life on behalf of the unborn. As a practicing  Catholic and the father of three, I am proud to be the voice for the  unborn here in Congress.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7 and stand up for life.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene).   Ms. DelBENE. Madam Speaker, this weekend, millions of women marched  across the country to send a clear signal to Congress and President  Trump: Hear our voices and protect our rights.   Yet here we are, just 2 days later, voting on the same extremist  policies that House leaders have been pushing for years.   Women will not be fooled. We know H.R. 7 is another direct attack on  our health and our families. It creates sweeping new restrictions on  abortion care for women who purchase coverage under the Affordable Care  Act, with no meaningful exceptions to protect a woman's health.   That means women like Stephanie, from my district, who faced  heartbreaking complications during her wanted pregnancy, would be left  without coverage for the doctor-recommended care she needed.   We should not be injecting ideology into a woman's personal medical  decisions. This bill is an insult to the millions of women who marched  this weekend, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), a gentleman who has been a champion of  life.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Tennessee is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Madam Speaker, today I am simply asking my colleagues  across the aisle not to flip-flop on this issue. This legislation isn't  just the right thing to do; it also has broad support.   Polling shows that 6 in 10 Americans agree that taxpayer dollars  should not fund abortions. Despite this fact, a nonpartisan government  study found that abortions could be funded with taxpayer dollars  through ObamaCare, and this demands a response.   Today we have an opportunity to invest in women's health over  abortion by passing H.R. 7 and making the Hyde amendment permanent and  governmentwide.   I urge my colleagues to reject this motion to recommit and to vote  ``yes'' on H.R. 7.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
