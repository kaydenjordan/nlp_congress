 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when  the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at noon on Monday next for  morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Mr. Fred Alexander of Glynn County, Georgia.   Born in 1940 in Vidalia, Georgia, Fred was a standout athlete in  football, basketball, baseball, and track. After graduating from Lyons  High School, he went on to attend Georgia Teachers College, then Austin  Peay State University in Tennessee on a football scholarship.   Along with his brother Bill, Fred owned the Island Grove Motel before  joining the local banking industry, an industry he worked in for 35  years.   Outside of his professional life, Fred was a longtime member of St.  Simons United Methodist Church, a past president of the Brunswick  Exchange Club, and a member of Boys and Girls Club Board of Directors.   Being an avid golfer, he also served on the Board of Directors of the  Brunswick Country Club. He enjoyed spending his time off the golf  course playing gin rummy and dancing with his beloved wife, Janie.   One of his newest hobbies was waving good morning to the Glynn Middle  School students as they passed by his Lanier Boulevard home.   Fred is survived by his wife, five children, and a whole host of  grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   My sincerest condolences go out to the Alexander family during this  difficult time.                            ____________________
