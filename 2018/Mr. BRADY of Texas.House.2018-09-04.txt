Section 13031(j)(3)(A) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget       Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c(j)(3)(A)) is       amended by striking ``July 21, 2027'' and inserting ``October       13, 2027''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4318, currently  under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Senate amendments to  H.R. 4318, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018, which the House  passed in January by a unanimous vote of 402-0, and passed the other  body, the Senate, by unanimous consent in July.   Through the MTB bill, we would temporarily suspend or reduce  uncompetitive tariffs for certain products that aren't made in the  United States. Requiring U.S. manufacturers to pay tariffs for products  that are simply not made here runs up their manufacturing costs and  puts them at a competitive disadvantage compared to manufacturers in  other countries.   This bill is bipartisan, and it will deliver much-needed temporary  tariff relief to American manufacturers of all sizes, helping them  reduce costs, create jobs, and compete globally. And the bill helps  American consumers too by reducing prices and not forcing them to pay  unnecessary taxes on products that aren't made here.   The Senate amendments we are considering today made very few changes  to the House-passed bill. Still, these changes are important to ensure  that the bill, which has overwhelming support in both Chambers, remains  noncontroversial.   The changes we are considering today also reflect the spirit of the  new and transparent process established by Congress, which was designed  to ensure that no U.S. business is harmed and that any controversial  provision is removed.   Specifically, the amendments remove six provisions to address  concerns about domestic production, as well as one provision that was  simply a duplicate of another.   In addition, the descriptions of three products were expanded and  clarified to help distinguish between similar products not covered by  the tariff reduction.   Finally, the amendments made minor adjustments to the expiration date  of the offset.   I would like to, again, thank the U.S. International Trade Commission  for its tremendous effort in successfully bringing this new MTB process  to life.   I would also like to thank the Commerce Department and Customs and  Border Protection for their invaluable work. I want to thank the  committee members on both sides of the aisle, and those off the  committee who worked to put this new, transparent process in place that  honors the House ban on earmarks: Ranking Member Richie Neal; Trade  Subcommittee Chairman Dave Reichert of Washington; Trade Subcommittee  Ranking Member, my friend, Bill Pascrell of New Jersey; Representative   Tom Reed of New York; Representative Renacci of Ohio; and  Representative Paulsen of Minnesota. Then, off the committee, I am  grateful for the leadership of Representative Mark Walker,  Representative  Tom McClintock, Representative Todd Rokita, and  Representative Rod Blum.   Today, Congress can deliver meaningful tariff relief to American  manufacturers and take action that will help boost American  productivity, American competitiveness, and American job creation.   I urge my colleagues to join us in concurring with the Senate  amendments to H.R. 4318.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4318 will deliver much-needed temporary tariff  relief to American manufacturers of all sizes, helping them to grow and  create jobs. The bill will also help American consumers by reducing  prices and not forcing families to pay unnecessary taxes on products  that aren't made here.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join here in a bipartisan way  concurring with the Senate amendments to H.R. 4318.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
