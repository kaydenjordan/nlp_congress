 Madam Speaker, this June, we celebrate  National Dairy Month and recognize the farmers and the producers across  Pennsylvania who provide healthy dairy products for our children who  need that as they grow and mature.   Pennsylvania's 13th District is home to the greatest number of dairy  cows in the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. For generations,  family-owned-and-operated dairy farms have been at the heart of our  rural communities.   This year, Congress will work to pass a farm bill. To prepare for  this legislation, I have been traveling across our district to hear  from the farmers who will be affected most by this legislation.   Over the past years, we have seen inflationary policies lead to  rising prices on the grain, the fertilizer, and supplies that our  farmers rely on, and they are faced with imitation products that  continue to put a strain on the dairy markets right here in America.   Last year, dairy substitutes made over $2.8 billion in sales,  directly harming these locally owned dairy farmers in Pennsylvania.   The attacks on our dairy farmers have been going on for far too long.  We have seen liberal policies dating back to the Obama administration  that have yanked whole milk from school cafeterias and have pulled away  the nutritious product that growing young men and women need.   This decision is directly harmful. We know the nutritional benefits  to bone, to muscle, and brain development that only whole milk can  provide. Now, our students are missing out on these benefits.   National Dairy Month allows us to recommit to returning whole milk  back into the schools, back to the kids who need it.   Let's pledge to end the false labeling of fake dairy products, and  let's commit to standing with our dairy farmers.                            ____________________
