 Madam Speaker, from the moment I arrived in Congress,  the aura of John Lewis loomed large. He will rightfully be remembered  as a giant of the civil rights movement and the conscience of the  Congress.   To me, though, he will always be remembered as a man who I felt  privileged and honored and humbled to call colleague and friend. He  will always be remembered as the kind, humble, approachable gentleman  from Georgia, a tireless fighter who rallied our Caucus at pivotal  moments to make positive change, to stand for what is right, to give a  voice to the powerless, to protect the rights of the disenfranchised.  Of course, he was well-known for making noise and getting into good  trouble, necessary trouble.   It was one of the great privileges of my life to join John Lewis in  making some good and necessary trouble when he organized a peaceful  sit-in on the House floor to demand action on gun violence.   John Lewis made a difference in the lives of millions, and his  presence was always felt in Congress, but his absence will be felt even  more.   Rest in peace, my friend.
