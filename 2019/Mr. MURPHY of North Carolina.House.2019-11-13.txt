 Mr. Speaker, yesterday I proudly  announced my first piece of legislation as a Member of Congress, H.R.  5037.   Of course, every bill that goes through this great legislative body  is important, but I think it is fair to say that every Member's first  bill carries with it an importance in its own right. It marks the  beginning of a new path forward, and I wanted mine to begin in  remembrance of my predecessor, friend, and mentor, the late Congressman  Walter B. Jones, Jr.   Congressman Jones served the great people of eastern North Carolina  for over 20 years. He supported our military, he supported our farmers,  and he supported our coasts. As his successor, I pledge to do the same.   This bill, which would name a post office in the town Congressman  Jones was born and raised, in the great town of Farmville, North  Carolina, is the least that we can do to honor the remarkable statesman  and steward that he was.   In this time of great divisiveness, it is wonderful to have an issue  that we all can rally around and support. I look forward to this bill  becoming a reality for the people of eastern North Carolina.                            ____________________
