 Madam Speaker, I am pleased to commend  the House Appropriations Committee for passing 11 of the 12  appropriations bills out of committee. All the bills except Homeland  Security have passed committee.   Here on the House floor we have passed four of those appropriations  bills. The Senate has passed three. This is what we call regular order,  and it is very important to the political process that every Member of  Congress in this Chamber and the Senate have a chance to offer  amendments, be heard, and speak. Both parties have agreed to this.   We need to get all the bills through the House and appoint the  conference committees. Those conference committees are where you  reconcile the differences. We have fallen away from this here in this  Chamber in the past few years. It is about time we got back to the  regular appropriations process.   I want to keep the positive momentum going and commend us for passing  those bills. Let's get that Defense bill passed and fund our troops the  way that the American people deserve.                            ____________________
