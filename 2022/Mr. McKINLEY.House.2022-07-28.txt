 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman-in-waiting for the  opportunity to address this.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the STREAM Act. Over the last  century, American companies have mined coal in at least 26 States  across the country. Over that same period of time, thousands of these  mines have ceased operation.   Abandoned mines produce acid drainage that, unfortunately, flows into  our streams and is toxic. As a result, tens of thousands of miles of  streams and waterways across America are being poisoned.   West Virginia alone, according to the West Virginia Department of  Environmental Protection, has indicated that we have 1,500 miles of  streams that are toxic in West Virginia.   The STREAM Act ensures States have the flexibility to use these  federally allocated funds for acid mine drainage cleanup and provides  long-term maintenance of these cleanup projects. The bill preserves the  use of important guidelines already in place, as you have heard, and  simply extends them to recently approved new funding measures.   Making our streams safe is not a partisan issue. Mr. Speaker, as  chairman of the Congressional Coal Caucus, I am proud to be leading the  Republican effort, in conjunction with Representative Cartwright, to  pass this bipartisan legislation.   For anyone who has never seen these orange, poisoned streams, they  will never understand the gravity of the situation. But for those of us  that have seen and lived with this devastation that will last for  years, decades, into the future, the time to vote ``yes'' is now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the STREAM Act, and I encourage a  ``yes'' vote.  [[Page H7399]]                                     time  1630
