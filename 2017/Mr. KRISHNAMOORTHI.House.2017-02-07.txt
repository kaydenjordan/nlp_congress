 Mr. Speaker, as debates over the meaning of last  fall's elections continue, one fact is not in question: The American  people want us to work together on commonsense, bipartisan solutions to  grow our economy and create good-paying, middle class jobs. Neither  party can meet this challenge alone.   I am proud to say that Republican Congressman Mike Gallagher and I  have joined together in founding the Middle Class Jobs Caucus to bring  greater attention to these issues and to advance proposals to address  them. The caucus will meet regularly to address a wide array of key  issues facing working families, such as job training and infrastructure  and transportation modernization.   Every era of prosperity in our history has been built on a thriving  middle class. In the plainest terms, middle class jobs mean a strong  America. I encourage all of our colleagues to join us in helping  families reach the middle class and stay there.                            ____________________
