 Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to join  my colleague from the Pacific Northwest speaking in opposition to the  nomination of our colleague to the position of U.S. Attorney General.   I thank the Senator from Oregon. I know he has been here for several  hours. I listened to much of his remarks, and many of the issues he  brought up in his statement reflect the issues that we in the Pacific  Northwest are dealing with--the population of the Pacific Northwest  concerns--and how many people in our part of the country have moved  forward on so many important issues of equal protection for all  Americans under the law. So I thank my colleague for being here. I  thank him for the many things he had to say this evening on this  subject.   I hearken back in my own life, as I reflect on this decision, to the  time I grew up. This is something that has been instilled in me as a  young person growing up in the 1960s and 1970s.   I saw the most incredible events happen in our Nation's government,  and I saw a position--both the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney  General, someone who is now a Pacific Northwest resident--use that  office, the power of the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General,  to say they disagreed with the President of the United States. Not only  did they disagree with the President of the United States, they would  rather resign from office than carry out the acts he was asking them to  carry out.   As a young person, that Saturday night massacre was an incredible  indelible image of how people should act responsibly in carrying out  their duties.   So when I think about this position of Attorney General, I think of  that very issue; that I want an Attorney General who will stand up for  the citizens of the United States, no matter what, even if he has to go  against the President of the United States. That, to me, is the  ultimate in serving the people of this country.   In many ways, in the last several weeks, I feel like we have been  relitigating the 1960s and 1970s. When we  [[Page S891]]  talk about the civil liberties of American citizens, whether they are  the LGBT community; or whether we are talking about government maybe  using backdoor devices to spy on American citizens; or whether we are  talking about immigrant rights, we are talking about the same things  people fought for in the 1960s and 1970s. So it is no surprise that my  colleague--also from Massachusetts--reflected on this in some of the  comments she made last night that raised such a ruckus and concern on  the floor. I certainly supported her and supported her in her rights to  make those comments, but these larger issues about how one wields power  at the enormous office of responsibility of Attorney General is what is  at question in the Senate. I could go on this morning about many other  issues I am concerned about in relation to the nexus of the Attorney  General to the other positions that we are also considering, but this  morning I am going to keep my remarks specifically to the Attorney  General.   In this new information era--and I have been out here on other  nights, in fact with my colleague from Kentucky Mr. Paul, to discuss  these very important issues of encryption and making sure the U.S.  government does not unduly spy on U.S. citizens.   I am concerned that the President's nominee has supported President  Bush's warrantless wiretapping and domestic surveillance programs. He  also has supported law enforcement's backdoor key to encryption.   I will say, there are many things we need to do to fight this war on  terrorism and to be strong in working together with law enforcement all  across the United States and on an international basis. I will be the  first to say there are great things we can do as it relates to  biometrics and using biometrics effectively, but when it comes down to  it, it is all about us working with the international community and  getting cooperation from them to work that way, as opposed to running  over the civil liberties of U.S. citizens. So I do have concerns that  the President's nominee on this issue may not stand up to the President  of the United States in making sure civil liberties of Americans are  protected.   I am also concerned this nominee will not fully protect the rights of  lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans. The reason I say  that is because of his record, and the doubts it raises because of his  opposition to various pieces of legislation which have moved through  these Halls--opposition to gay rights, same-sex marriage, hate crime  laws, voting rights for historically disfranchised communities, and  workplace protection for women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender  communities. All of these are things I wish we would have in an  Attorney General who had been a greater advocate for the transition  that America has made in protecting civil liberties in these issues.   These are very big issues in my State. They are very big issues that  have been long discussed--probably discussed before they reached this  body--and decided decisively in favor of the civil liberties of these  Americans. So I find it troubling that in his position, the nominee  used his power to target the LGBT student housing and education  conference at the University of Alabama, and that he consistently voted  against LGBT Americans' right to live where they choose, and voted for  the constitutional amendment my colleague mentioned, the Matthew  Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crime Prevention Act--not being  supportive on those issues.   These are important issues that mark our country's ability to stand  up for civil liberties. It is important in this era and time, because  of the hate crimes and the horrific things that have happened to these  individuals, that we have someone who not only recognizes those, but  embodies the fact that these individuals are facing discrimination and  must continually--continually--have someone to fight for their civil  liberties.   The nominee sponsored legislation to roll back, as I said, LGBT  rights in housing, employment, and health care, and there are an  estimated 10 million LGBT Americans who are protected by our Nation's  hate crime and anti-discrimination laws. What we want is leadership. We  want leadership to continue on these issues. We want leadership that  when we see problems, they are going to be addressed, even if it means  fighting what the President of the United States has to say.   My colleague also had opposed the reinstatement of the Voting Rights  Act and strongly supported voter ID laws that put barriers up for the  elderly, indigent communities, and communities of color to get access  to their ballots. I can tell you as a Washingtonian that nothing is  more important to us than this issue of voting rights, and I would  match our system with any other State in the Nation. We vote by mail.  We have seen as high as 84-percent voter turnout in a Presidential  year, and incredibly high turnout even in a midterm election.   We know that giving our citizens the right to vote, and making  progress on everyone having the right to vote, including the use of  provisional ballots, making sure the law is clear in embracing and  making sure people have the opportunity to vote, and have their votes  counted, are going to continue to be issues in the United States of  America. We want people to have total confidence in our voting system,  and we want them to have confidence that every citizen has a right to  cast a vote, and will not be turned away at the ballot box because of  an artificial barrier.   Believe me, there are lots of ways to catch fraud and corruption in  the voting system in the State of Washington because it is based on  your signature. Have we had people make mistakes in the system? Yes.  They have been caught or corrected.   The notion that our system needs all of these other artificial  barriers is not true. It is a system that has worked well for us and,  as I said, has empowered more people to participate in our electoral  system.   I want someone who is going to help us move forward in this country.  The notion that we are putting up lines of obstacles for voting in this  country should not be the way we are going. We need to go in the other  direction.   I am concerned that the next Attorney General will fail to protect  the civil liberties of all Americans, irrespective of their race, and  protect opportunities to participate in our democracy and to make sure  we are continuing to move forward. He has called the work of the  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the  American Civil Liberties Union ``un-American.'' Let us remember that in  our time, we need people who are going to recognize the rights of  individuals and stand up for them. If in the past his judgment and  temperament on these issues has expressed a lack of concern for these  individuals, my question for all of us is, what kind of leadership will  that drive for the next Attorney General?   He has called the decision in Roe v. Wade ``a colossal mistake'' and  has cast 86 anti-choice votes, including a vote against protecting  abortion providers and their patients from anti-choice violence.  Washington State has one of the strongest statutes in the country for  protecting a woman's right to choose. It was something we did before  the national law. It is something many people in my State feel strongly  about, and, yes, in the past, we have experienced violence at clinics.   In fact, in September 2015, there was a devastating bombing of a  Planned Parenthood clinic in Pullman, WA--a tragedy that was  unbelievable. The fact that those clinicians showed up in the parking  lot the next day and continued to deliver services, and that law  enforcement was there to help them and respect them is what I expect  out of our system and the U.S. Attorney General--that someone will be  there to help enforce the law and deter these kinds of crimes and make  sure that we are moving forward as a country.   I said earlier that I feel as though we are relitigating the sixties  and seventies. I wish that those issues had all gone away, but I feel  as if they are still with us. These examples of disrespect toward the  civil liberties of individuals, and using violence as a way to  demonstrate that disrespect, require a swift hand of justice to oppose  them.   My colleague voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which  amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 so that gender-based pay disparity  claims could be heard in court. This is also something of great concern  to many Americans, not just women. It is a concern to men as well,  because men want  [[Page S892]]  their wives to make the salary they deserve, to make certain their  family has the income it deserves.   These are battles that we are going to continue to fight in the  United States of America until we have fair pay. I do view it as a  civil rights issue. As I said, Lilly Ledbetter amended the Civil Rights  Act.   He also voted against the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence  Against Women Act, which ensures that law enforcement has the every  resource necessary to investigate cases of rape, and provides colleges  with the tools to educate students about dating violence, sexual  assault, and to maintain the National Domestic Violence Hotline, which  fields 22,000 calls a month from Americans facing threats of domestic  violence.   That issue in and of itself, along with the amount of domestic  violence that women face in the United States of America, is something  that needs constant vigilance and constant attendance in order to fight  against. I don't know all the reasons he did not support that  legislation, but I know one aspect. He opposed language in the Violence  Against Women Act allowing tribes to prosecute nontribal members who  commit domestic violence against tribal members on reservation land.  That is right. People were coming onto Indian reservations across our  country. In Washington State, we have 29 recognized tribes. On those  sites, people were committing crimes of domestic violence but, because  of a loophole, weren't being prosecuted. There were unbelievable  amounts of violence.   The last administration came up with a way to work together to make  sure that those crimes were prosecuted. It is as if the Federal system  couldn't affect all the activity that was happening, but it could work  in concert with local law enforcement officials to come up with a way  to make sure that women, who were being abused just because they were  Native American on a tribal reservation, would get their fair justice.   I do have concerns about these issues as they relate to tribal  sovereignty, to the issues of domestic violence and, particularly,  domestic violence that is happening in Indian Country.   I also want to bring up an issue I think my colleague from Oregon  brought up, which is something I don't know that all of our colleagues  agree on, but I am here to advocate for my State; that is, the nominee  in his testimony said that he would leave to the States the question of  legalizing and regulating marijuana in this administration.   In the past, he has refused to respect the rights of States that have  democratically chosen to legalize marijuana for medical or recreational  use. This is an important subject for us in the Pacific Northwest  because we had a previous Attorney General who, after we had passed  medical marijuana laws, tried to shut down our medical clinics. This  was years before we passed legislation allowing for the legalization of  marijuana by the broader public, not just medical marijuana.   We have seen an Attorney General who has aggressively pursued this  medical use, and now we have concerns, as our State and several other  States have legalized marijuana, about how this Attorney General is  going to treat those actions.   We hope that this past record is not a reflection of the future and  how he plans to treat individuals, but I know my colleague from Hawaii  was here earlier and mentioned several cases of individuals in his  State who needed that medical attention, who needed that product, who  were given great comfort in their medical treatments by having access  to that.   Is that now all in question? Is that something that Americans who  have resided in States that have taken this action now have something  to fear from the next Attorney General?   I know that there were many discussions in the confirmation hearing,  and that there are concerns today relating to the issue of a ban on  Muslims entering the United States. I will not go into great detail  here, but will say that it is clear that the State of Washington has an  opinion about this and that our State Attorney General and our Governor  are trying to represent that viewpoint in the judicial process.   It is important to me that we get these issues right because I want  to protect the civil liberties of individuals, and I see a path forward  for us to be tough on these cases; that is, the true cases of terrorist  activity. I say that because Washington had a case in 1999 of an  individual who entered the United States at Port Angeles, WA. He had  come from Algiers, and then when he got to France, he cooked up a new  identity. When he left France and went to Canada, he cooked up another  identity, and then he arrived at the U.S. border from Canada on a boat  with explosives and a plan to either blow up the Space Needle or travel  to LAX and blow up the LAX Airport.   There was very good work by customs and border agents who found  something unusual about this individual. It didn't add up. His passport  looked as though it was valid, but something that was said gave the  border agent reason to conduct a more thorough check.   In fact, they did. They opened the trunk of his car, and as they did,  he ran, and with good reason because they saw a car full of explosive  materials in the trunk. That so-called Millennial Bomber was caught.  Since then, I have been an advocate for using biometrics as a standard  for us pushing visa waiver countries for letting people into their  country, as Mr. Ressam did travel, as I said, from Algiers to France,  cooking up a new identity, and then France to Canada, and Canada to the  United States, each time cooking up an identity.   But if we had cooperation with these countries on biometric  standards; if we had implemented those biometric standards, and pushed  those countries that give access to our country through the Visa Waiver  Program, we would be a lot further down the road in finding those  individuals who mean to do us harm.   We need cooperation by these other countries and the best techniques  and standards to help us. That is far different than denying access to  individuals, for example, from the Somali community that is a very big  refugee community in our State. As I said, I will leave it to our  Washington attorney general and our Governor to continue to pursue that  effort.   I have heard from many Washingtonians who are concerned about this  nomination. I heard from a young woman from Yakima, WA, who said she  was flabbergasted by this nomination, that ``if he was deemed  inadequate during the days that Strom Thurmond was in office, why now  is he adequate?''   I heard from a constituent in central Washington who said: ``I am a  transgender and gay, and much of the time I worry about my rights as a  U.S. citizen, whether they'll be revoked despite the fact that my  family has fought in every war in the U.S. since the Civil War. I am  worried that legislation would be implemented that would dehumanize me  and other LGBT community individuals, and that doesn't align with the  nominee's religious beliefs.''   So these are concerns my constituents have, and I have to agree with  them, that our nominee's record leaves question about his ability to  fervently advocate on behalf of these individuals, given his record and  history in the past. And I know that my colleague, the ranking member  from the Judiciary Committee, has been out here on the floor, going in  detail about the questioning that happened during the committee process  on all sorts of issues, as it relates to women's rights and  reproductive choice, and how we are going to continue to move forward  to make sure these individuals are protected.   So, to me, my constituents are loud and clear. They want these civil  liberties protected. They want an Attorney General who is going to make  sure that those civil liberties are fought for and respected every day  and are going to get equal protection under the law.   Here are some additional excerpts from the letters of our concerned  constituents.   KS from Yakima, WA, a concerned constituent, writes: ``I am simply  flabbergasted that Jeff Sessions was chosen to be our Attorney General.  If he was deemed inadequate in the days when Strom Thurmond was in  office, then he's certainly inadequate in 21st century America. As you  are politicians, I shouldn't have to remind you of this, but I'm going  to anyway. One, America was built by immigrants from  [[Page S893]]  all over the world, on top of an already diverse nation of the First  Peoples. Two, there are over 300 languages spoken in the U.S., nearly  half of which are indigenous. Three, people have had to fight tooth and  nail against discrimination based on their race and ethnicity, and the  fact that so many are still doing to that today is extremely worrisome.  Four, it's been our legally protected right since 1967 to marry and  have a family with someone of a different race. Five, it's only been  our legally protected right to marry and have a family with someone of  the same gender since 2015. Six, my generation, the Millennials, is the  most diverse of any in American history. Since 2000, 40 percent of all  children have been born to multiracial families. And those children  will be eligible to vote before you know it. The ones born in 2000 will  likely have a lot to say come the midterm election. This America  cannot, should not, MUST NOT have an attorney general who thought the  Klan was too liberal. He has no place at a school crosswalk, let alone  leading the most powerful nation in the free world. PLEASE do not let  this happen!''   SL from Wenatchee, WA, writes: ``He has repeatedly shown within his  career that he clearly sees the LGBTQ+ community as something that is  acceptable to discriminate against. Most notably is his support of the  Defense of Marriage Act. This worries me very deeply since I am  Transgender and gay. Much of the time I worry that my rights as a US  citizen will be revoked, despite the fact that my family has fought in  every war in the US since the Civil War. I am worried that he would  allow legislation to be law that would dehumanize me and other LGBTQ+  individuals because it doesn't align with his apparent religious  beliefs. He also seems to not hold much issue with civil rights as long  as they don't go `too far.' Additionally, his continual stance against  immigrants could have a distinct impact on my city and community. We  have a large Hispanic and Mexican population, many of them around the  neighborhoods where I live. The many years I've lived here I've found  our multicultural community to be hard working and not the `evil' that  Trump is adamant to make them out to be. I do not feel reassured if he  becomes the Attorney General that he would stand up to Trump and fairly  support these marginalized individuals in the Department of Justice.''   JH from Seattle, WA, writes: ``I trust that you will protect and  stand for the ideals of our country and vote no to the appointment of  Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. The job of the Justice Department is  to protect all people, and to enforce the laws of the land to do so.  Sessions has not in word or deed demonstrated he is capable of doing  so. Even while awaiting confirmation, he is supporting discrimination  against LGBTQ people by his support of the FADA. I expect any person  confirmed in our government to clearly support all people--black,  brown, white, male, female, transgender, gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer,  Jew, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Native, atheists, and people of all  ethnicity. The Attorney General is responsible for upholding The  Constitution--including Congress shall make no law respecting an  establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or  abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the  people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a  redress of grievances. This means upholding the Constitution, including  Press's right to cover Mr. Trump and report as they see fit--not  censored news. This also means supporting The right of the people to be  secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against  unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no  Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or  affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and  the persons or things to be seized. This means insisting that the  Justice Department hold themselves and local police forces accountable  for detaining and searching people--and do promulgate brutality from  behind the badge. Instead of Jeff Sessions, please garner support for  and vote for a legal mind who has a demonstrated record of upholding  all people's rights. There are many fine minds and hearts in our  country who are up to the task. It is your responsibility as a Senator  of our fine Democracy to vote only for one of them.''    Gary from Spokane, WA: ``Jeff Sessions does not believe that our laws  should protect everyone. He believes certain groups should have less  rights and/or less protection under the law. He will allow  discrimination, based on his record. There is enough volatility in this  time of ours to understand the importance of a fair minded, tempered  and balanced person to head the department of justice. There is no  denying we are entering a tumultuous time. There is enough concern over  Jeff Sessions to give pause, consider the times we are in, and come up  with a better choice. Concerns over our country turning to  totalitarianism are real. The president elect is extremely polarizing  and may very well be breaking the US Constitution as soon as he's sworn  in, due to conflicts of interest. The attorney general certainly needs  to understand these concerns and be able to enforce the laws of the  American people. There are many other talented legal professionals with  a wide variety of skill sets related to law enforcement. This is the  time to slow down a bit; delay . . . at least this appointment. There  is an appointment process for a reason. Make Mr. Trump come up with a  better choice. No matter your party, there is no win in becoming a  rubber stamp for Mr. Trump. I vote nay for Jeff Session as Attorney  General. Consider the importance of this time, consider the future of  our country, consider the rights guaranteed in the bill of rights. The  choice then is easy, nay for Sessions, yay for thoughtful, accountable  and tempered governance.''   Betsy from Waldron, WA, writes: ``Please oppose the appointment of  Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. He is opposed to basic civil rights  for all people and he cannot be put in charge of protecting those same  rights. Please do not compromise with Trump or try to compromise as if  he were a normal president. Please oppose, blockade, filibuster, and  refuse to go along with Trump's plans to tear our country apart. I am  relying on you to be our first wall of defense against this terrifying  man.''   RaGena from Spokane, WA, writes: ``As a constituent I urge you to  oppose the confirmation of Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General of  the United States His voting record as senator and the content of his  speeches to the Senate do not inspire confidence in his ability to  discharge the responsibilities of the Attorney General's office in  keeping with role of the Department of Justice in contemporary American  society. His responses to the Judiciary Committee raised further,  serious concerns. All this, coupled with the reasons for his failure to  be confirmed as a federal judge decades ago, suggest that he is not the  person for this job.''   DH from Tacoma, WA, writes: ``I am writing to express my strong  opposition to the nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General.  Everything I know about this man makes him uniquely unqualified for the  post. He has not supported equal rights of minorities and has supported  vote suppression as a means to reduce the effect of minority votes. In  the attorney general seat, Sessions will be able to make decisions that  will negatively affect the daily lives of some of our most vulnerable  citizens. Please reinforce my belief in you as a leader and vote no on  Jeff Sessions for attorney general.''   JG from Seattle, WA, writes: ``You must vote against confirming Jeff  Sessions as Attorney General. His record makes clear that he will not  support voting rights for all Americans and will not act to protect the  rights of minorities or work to improve the criminal justice system. In  fact, his record makes clear he will move to suppress voting rights and  will promote DOJ actions that will hurt minorities in particular. He is  not fit to serve as this country's Attorney General.''   AM from Seattle, WA, writes: ``I am a criminal defense attorney in  Seattle. I write to ask you to vote against confirming Jeff Sessions as  United States Attorney General. Under the Obama administration, many  inroads have been made into remedying the harms of mandatory minimum  drug sentencing and other forms of drug sentencing reform.  Additionally, states like Washington have been allowed to sell  marijuana, legal under state law, without  [[Page S894]]  fear of federal prosecution. Finally, the Obama administration made  good use of the civil rights division to assist in reforming police  departments engaged in improper policing practices, such as Seattle. I  have no confidence that Jeff Sessions will continue to support any of  these policies. Please do not vote to confirm him.''   LB from Seattle, WA, writes: ``Please block Jeff Sessions from  becoming Attorney General. The idea of having a racist attorney general  is appalling. We need to improve race relations in this country and in  our law enforcement officers, especially. I am 41 and feel like the  race relations in this country had been improving steadily throughout  my life, at least on the west coast. It's very scary to me that this  new administration has to brought to light all the issues that still  remain but to be a great country we cannot be a divided one and with  half our population being minorities this appointment seems like a huge  huge step in the wrong direction.''   LR from Seattle, WA, writes: ``I am writing to ask you to do  everything you can to stop the nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney  General. His record shows his hostility toward civil rights, the ACLU,  the NAACP, the LGBT community and more. I am especially concerned about  his ability to send us backwards on gay marriage and other civil rights  laws. His appointment to head the Justice Department would be a  disaster for civil rights law in this country. Please help stop this  travesty.''   MY from Edmonds, WA, writes: ``I am writing to urge you to continue  due diligence on the appointment of Jeff Sessions as attorney general.  I do not believe the political commercial I just saw trying to paint  him in a wonderful light and asking people to contact senators to urge  confirmation. I continue to have concerns about what he will do to  lessen voter rights and other issues under his authority. The  advertisement did not change my opinion and I feel it's just full of  alternative facts. Please continue to ask tough questions on all of  these appointments.''   RR from Bellingham, WA, writes: ``Please do not consider Jeff  Sessions for Attorney General. His views, clearly displayed over the  course of his career, are the antithesis of what our country stands for  around the world. The United States has been a bastion of freedom,  truth and inclusiveness. Sadly, those qualities are rapidly  disappearing, faster than o thought possible, under the Trump  administration. ALL of our citizens are entitled to equality under the  law. All of our citizens are entitled to live freely regardless of  their race, religion, lack of religion, gender or sexuality. Jeff  Sessions is dangerous. He will dismantle civil rights laws, allow  racial profiling, support laws that prevent access to voting and  encourage the abuse of the LGBT community. Please vote no.''   I also know there are letters from many organizations that also have  opposed this nomination, and my colleague has talked about many of  those, but the NAACP, civil and human rights organizations, the HRC,  and the American Federation of State and County Municipal Employees  have said they question the objectivity and sense of justice needed on  these important issues.   I mentioned the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and other issues of the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, things that people are  concerned that they get the fair attention and enforcement of law. I  ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                        National Association for the                                   Advancement of Colored People,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2017.      Re The NAACP Strongly Urges the U.S. Senate To Vote No on           Sen. Jeff Sessions Nomination as Attorney General.       U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's oldest,       largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based civil       rights organization, I strongly urge you to vote against       Jefferson ``Jeff'' Beauregard Sessions III for Attorney       General. Throughout this contentious debate, and through his       past actions, his recorded words, and his voting record as a       United States Senator, Sen. Sessions has demonstrated a clear       disregard, disrespect, and disdain for the rights and needs       of all American people. Senator Sessions possesses neither       the political nor the moral temperament to serve as Attorney       General.        The NAACP staunchly opposes the confirmation of Senator       Jeff Sessions based on several factors, including the fact       that he does not agree with us on a majority of issues as is       reflected in our federal legislative report card. Since 1914,       our report card has been reflective of our bread-and-butter       civil rights issues, and the fact that Senator Sessions has       averaged, since coming into Congress, just over 10%,       demonstrates his clear disregard for issues that are       important to us and to those we represent and serve. It would       be a disservice to these people who support our priorities       for us to not speak out against this nomination. Supporters       of the NAACP would argue, in fact, that the Department of       Justice is a crucial enforcer of civil rights laws and       advisor to the President and Congress on what can and should       be done if those laws are threatened. Given his disregard for       issues which protect the rights, and in some cases the lives,       of our constituents, there is no way that the NAACP can or       should be expected to sit by and support Senator Sessions'       nomination to head the U.S. Department of Justice.        The disdain Senator Sessions has shown for civil rights       organizations, including the NAACP, is as palatable as it is       disturbing. During his confirmation hearing in 1986 for a       federal judgeship in Alabama, Senator Sessions replied to one       question by saying, ``I'm often loose with my tongue. I may       have said something about the NAACP being un-American or       Communist, but I meant no harm by it.'' Yet he denied saying       anything disparaging about the NAACP in his recent hearing       before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 9, 2017.        Lastly, in a floor statement made earlier today, Senator       Lindsey Graham suggested that the opposition of the national       NAACP is out of step with the sentiments of Alabamians.       Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the       President of the Alabama State Conference of NAACP Branches       has been a leader in opposing this nomination. He was up here       on January 9, 2017, to hear Senator Sessions' testimony, a       trip he took with busloads of NAACP Members who also opposed       the confirmation. This was a day after he was arrested for       sitting in on Senator Sessions' office in Mobile as a means       of protest in which he urged Senator Sessions to withdraw his       nomination from consideration by the Senate.        In summation, I would like to reiterate that it is the       experiences of the NAACP that lead us to oppose Senator       Sessions' nomination. We further call on President Trump to       nominate an individual who have a demonstrated commitment to       the constitutional promises of civil rights, voting rights       and civil liberties protection and enforcement for all, and       an articulated respect and promise to promote the civil and       human rights of all people, regardless of their race,       ethnicity, gender, age, religion, place of national origin,       sexual preference or station in life. Thank you in advance       for your attention to the position of the NAACP. Should you       have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to       contact me at my office.            Sincerely,      Hilary O. Shelton,        Director, NAACP Washington Bureau & Senior Vice President       for Policy and Advocacy.                                   ____                                        The Leadership Conference on                                          Civil and Human Rights,                                   Washington, DC, December 1, 2016.                 An Open Letter to the United States Senate      Civil and Human Rights Organizations Oppose Confirmation of Jeff                                  Sessions         Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Democratic Leader Reid,       Chairman Grassley, and Ranking Member Leahy: On behalf of The       Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition       of more than 200 national organizations committed to promote       and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the       United States, and the 144 undersigned organizations, we are       writing to express our strong opposition to the confirmation       of Senator Jefferson B. Sessions (R-AL) to be the 84th       Attorney General of the United States.        Senator Sessions has a 30-year record of racial       insensitivity, bias against immigrants, disregard for the       rule of law, and hostility to the protection of civil rights       that makes him unfit to serve as the Attorney General of the       United States. In our democracy, the Attorney General is       charged with enforcing our nation's laws without prejudice       and with an eye toward justice. And, just as important, the       Attorney General has to be seen by the public--every member       of the public, from every community--as a fair arbiter of       justice. Unfortunately, there is little in Senator Sessions'       record that demonstrates that he would meet such a standard.        In 1986, when then-U.S. Attorney Sessions was nominated by       former President Ronald Reagan to serve as a judge on the       U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, the       Republican-controlled Senate upheld its constitutional duty,       undertaking a careful and comprehensive review of his record       at that time. The Judiciary Committee was presented with       compelling evidence that then-U.S. Attorney Sessions had a       deeply troubling record as an opponent of civil rights       enforcement, a champion of voter suppression tactics       targeting African  [[Page S895]]       Americans, and a history of making racially-insensitive       statements. This record included warning an African-American       colleague to be careful about what he said ``to white       folks,'' and speaking favorably about the Ku Klux Klan, as       well as his prosecution of three African-American voting       rights activists on dozens of charges that were promptly       rejected by a jury.        As you know, the Attorney General is our nation's highest       law enforcement official, with a particular responsibility to       protect the civil and human rights of all Americans. The       Leadership Conference opposes Senator Sessions' nomination to       become Attorney General, in part, because of the previous       record we have cited. However, it would be a grave mistake to       assume that our opposition is based only on incidents prior       to his judicial nomination.        Indeed, the following are examples of his actions as a       Senator over the past 20 years that raise very disturbing       questions about his fitness to serve as Attorney General:        Voting Rights: In addition to his failed 1985 prosecution       of three voting rights activists who were working to increase       African-American registration and turnout, Senator Sessions       has voiced strong support for restrictive voter ID laws that       have had the effect of disenfranchising many otherwise       eligible voters, called the Voting Rights Act ``intrusive''       as it seeks to protect eligible minority voters, and praised       the Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County v. Holder (2013)       that gutted a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This       is hardly the record of someone to be entrusted with the       protection of voting rights for all Americans.        Association with White Nationalist and Hate Groups       regarding Immigration Policy: Senator Sessions has been a       fierce opponent of comprehensive immigration reform,       referring to a bipartisan 2007 bill as ``terrorist       assistance.'' He has closely associated himself with       NumbersUSA, the Federation for American Immigration Reform,       and the Center for Immigration Studies, all three of which       were founded by John Tanton, who held white nationalist       beliefs and called for the preservation of a ``European-      American majority.'' Senator Sessions has also received       awards from the David Horowitz Freedom Center and Frank       Gaffney's Center for Security Policy, two organizations       designated as anti-Muslim hate groups by the Southern Poverty       Law Center.        Hate Crimes and LGBT Rights: Senator Sessions opposed the       Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention       Act, even though a unanimous Supreme Court had long ago       upheld a similar state law in Wisconsin v. Mitchell (1993).       This is particularly disturbing at a time when there have       reportedly been more than 700 hate incidents committed in the       weeks since the election. The next Attorney General must       recognize that hate crimes exist, and vigorously investigate       them.        In addition, on LGBT rights, Senator Sessions supported a       constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He also       opposed the repeal of ``Don't Ask Don't Tell.''        Women's Rights: Senator Sessions has consistently opposed       legislation to advance women's rights, notably opposing       multiple efforts to address the pay gap, to protect women's       access to reproductive health services, which       disproportionately affect low-income women and women of       color, and to address the scourge of violence against all       women. Specifically, Senator Sessions opposed the Lilly       Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, enabling women to file       ongoing pay discrimination claims, and has voted multiple       times against consideration of the Paycheck Fairness Act.       Senator Sessions also opposed Title X funding legislation,       which supports contraception, breast cancer screening and       other health services for low-income women. In addition,       Senator Sessions repeatedly voted to defund Planned       Parenthood, and in 2014, he voted against S. 2578 to fix the       Hobby Lobby decision by prohibiting employers from denying       coverage of any health care service, such as contraception,       required under federal law. Senator Sessions also opposed the       reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2013,       and when then-candidate Donald Trump was revealed in a 2005       video to have made comments bragging about physically forcing       himself on women, Senator Sessions declined to condemn the       remarks, even questioning whether the comments described       sexual assault.        Criminal Justice Reform: Though Senator Sessions was a       longtime supporter of eliminating sentencing disparities       between crack and powder cocaine offenses, he has since been       an ardent supporter of maintaining draconian mandatory       minimum sentences. Recently, Senator Sessions helped to block       broad-based, bipartisan efforts to reduce sentences for       certain nonviolent drug offenses. He also opposed the       President's initiative to address disparities and restore       fairness to the justice system through the use of his       constitutionally granted executive clemency power. He       criticized the Department of Justice's Smart on Crime       Initiative, which has focused on prosecuting fewer but ``more       serious'' drug cases and over the last three years, has       contributed to a 20 percent reduction in overcrowding in the       federal Bureau of Prisons. Finally, Senator Sessions       condemned the Department of Justice's use of its powers to       investigate law enforcement agencies accused of misconduct       and a ``pattern or practice'' of violating civil rights,       calling consent decrees that mandate reform following these       investigations ``an end run around the democratic process.''        Failing to Protect our Communities from Pollution and       Climate Change: Climate change and environmental degradation       disproportionately affect low-income families and communities       of color. Senator Sessions has a long record of voting       against protections for our clean air, water, and climate.       Among his many anti-environmental votes, in 2015 he voted for       the resolution to kill the clean power plan and for the       Barrasso bill to deny protections for streams that provide       drinking water for 113 million Americans. In 2012, he       supported a resolution that would roll back protections from       toxic mercury. America needs and deserves an Attorney General       who will take into account the health and safety of all       communities. Senator Sessions is not qualified in this regard       and cannot be counted on to protect our air, water, and       climate.        Rights of People with Disabilities: Senator Sessions       opposed efforts to implement Alabama's obligation to provide       community-based services to individuals with disabilities who       were needlessly institutionalized. In addition, he called the       Individuals with Disabilities Education Act's requirements to       include children with disabilities in mainstream education       ``the single most irritating problem for teachers throughout       America today'' and ``a big factor in accelerating the       decline in civility and discipline in classrooms all over       America.'' This opposition to integration and inclusion is       extremely concerning given the active role that the Justice       Department plays in enforcing the Americans with Disabilities       Act to enable people with disabilities to live independent       lives, be full participants in their communities, and to be       educated in neighborhood schools and regular classrooms.       Senator Sessions also opposed ratification of the Convention       on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.        These aspects of Senator Sessions' record are among those       that led The Leadership Conference to believe that he should       not be confirmed as our next Attorney General. At the very       least, these issues must be fully aired and deliberated       before each Senator makes a final decision with respect to       his nomination--otherwise, the Senate's constitutional duty       to provide ``advice and consent'' would be reduced to a mere       farce.        Given Senator Sessions' record and public statements, the       burden should be on him to prove to the Judiciary Committee,       the Senate, and the American people--especially to       communities of color and immigrant communities--that he can       be trusted with the tremendous power of the U.S. Justice       Department to enforce our nation's civil rights and       immigration laws with integrity, fairness, and a sense of       justice.        The burden on Senator Sessions is not to prove that he is       not a ``racist.'' For the record, The Leadership Conference       has never made such an allegation, as we do not claim to know       what has been in his heart when he has taken the actions and       made the statements we have described above. Nevertheless, we       believe those actions and statements are themselves       disqualifying.        This is notwithstanding our recognition that Senator       Sessions' record does include some positive actions. For       example, the Southern Poverty Law Center, while expressing       opposition to his confirmation, acknowledged that he was       helpful in the Center's successful effort to sue and bankrupt       the Ku Klux Klan following its role in the 1981 lynching       death of Michael Donald. The Leadership Conference also       worked with Senator Sessions in an effort that culminated in       the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced       racial disparities in federal cocaine sentencing provisions.       While these actions are noteworthy, they do not change our       conclusion that Senator Sessions' overall record is too       troubling for him to be confirmed as Attorney General.        The collegiality that ordinarily governs Senate decorum is       no substitute for, and must not supersede, the Senate's       profoundly important duty to vigorously and fairly review       each nominee who comes before it. We believe that based on       this review, there can be only one conclusion: Senator       Sessions is the wrong person to serve as the U.S. Attorney       General.        Thank you for your consideration of our views.

U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.6 million members of the       American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees       (AFSCME), I am writing to express our strong opposition to       the confirmation of Sen. Jeff Sessions as Attorney General of       the United States. Sen. Sessions has a lengthy record of       public service, but his record does not demonstrate that he       possesses the objectivity and sense of justice needed to       serve as the nation's chief law enforcement officer.        Sen. Sessions has a troubling pattern of antipathy toward       legal protections on which working families depend. He       opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act enabling women to       challenge pay discrimination. He denounced the Individuals       with Disabilities Education Act provisions that ensure that       children with disabilities are included in mainstream       education. He also opposed the  [[Page S896]]       reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and the       Shepard-Byrd Hate Crimes Act.        Sen. Sessions has expressed strong support for voter ID       laws which restrict the rights of many, otherwise, eligible       voters. He has called the Voting Rights Act ``intrusive'' as       it seeks to protect minority voters and praised the U.S.       Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County v. Holder which gutted       a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.        Recently, Sen. Sessions helped to block bipartisan efforts       to reduce sentences for certain nonviolent drug offenses. He       has also criticized the Department of Justice's use of       consent decrees to address misconduct and violations of civil       rights by law enforcement agencies.        Testimony provided by Sen. Sessions during his hearing has       not alleviated our grave concerns about his suitability to       lead the Department of Justice. We urge you to reject his       nomination.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                                           National Nurses United,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2017.      Hon. Maria Cantwell,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cantwell: We write on behalf of the more than       150,000 registered nurse members of National Nurses United to       urge you to vote against the confirmation of Senator Jeff       Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Attorney       General. Much has been said by many others against       confirmation of this nominee, so we will be brief        Our members work as bedside healthcare professionals in       almost every state in the nation. We work in every hospital       setting, from small rural facilities to large urban public       health systems, in prominent research hospitals affiliated       with prestigious public and private universities, as well as       Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics. We care for Americans       on every point of the demographic spectrum, at their most       vulnerable. We provide the best care we possibly can, without       regard to race, gender, national origin, religion, socio       economic circumstances, or other identifying characteristic.       That is what caring professionals do. Unfortunately, that is       not what Jeff Sessions has done in his role as a public       servant. And to vote in favor of confirming him as the chief       law enforcement officer of the United States would abdicate       your responsibility to provide the oversight necessary to       ensure that basic legal rights are enforced evenhandedly and       for the protection of all people.        As Senate colleagues, you no doubt know Senator Sessions'       record as a lawmaker, as well as his record as the U.S.       Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and as the       Alabama Attorney General. It was, of course, his record in       the U.S. Attorney's office and his many publically verified       racially insensitive comments that resulted in a majority of       the Senate Judiciary Committee voting against confirmation       for his nomination to be a U.S. District Court judge in 1986.       This `no' vote happened while the Judiciary Committee was       majority Republican. Even Senator Howell Heflin, a fellow       Alabamian, voted against him, citing ``reasonable doubts''       over whether he could be ``fair and impartial.''        Senator Sessions has oft asserted that his comments over       the years were taken out of context, or intended as humor.       But his record tells the truth. Early in his career he       charged civil right leaders (``the Marion Three'') with       voting fraud related to their efforts to assist African       American voters. The fact that the defendants in that case       were acquitted didn't deter Mr. Sessions. Later, as Attorney       General of Alabama, he initiated another voter fraud       investigation involving absentee ballots cast by black voters       that, again, resulted in findings of no wrong doing. During       that same timeframe, he was criticized for declining to       investigate church burnings, and he ``joked'' that he thought       Ku Klux Klan members were ``OK, until [he] learned that they       smoked marijuana.''        Against that background, Senator Sessions aggressively       interrogated Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Court's first       nominee of Latino heritage. Further betraying a deep belief       in natural division between racial groups, he grilled Justice       Sotomayor about whether she could be fair to white Americans,       despite her 17-year record as a jurist and having received       the American Bar Association's highest rating. And he       expressed grave concerns that she would engage in judicial       ``empathy'' on the high court, favoring persons of certain       races or ethnicities over others. He then voted against her       confirmation.        Senator Sessions' prejudices are not only against people of       color. As an organization representing a predominately female       profession we are compelled to express our outrage that       Senator Sessions defended Donald Trump's statements about       grabbing women by the genitals, by saying that such conduct       would not constitute sexual assault. The fact that he took a       different position during his Committee hearing is of no       comfort. It only shows that he will say whatever he believes       will help land him in the seat of power to determine whether,       and against whom, to enforce our laws. His comments last fall       dismissing President-elect Trump's despicable treatment of       women is consistent with his vote in 2013 against the       Violence Against Women Act. As nurses, we see close up the       devastating effects of domestic violence against our       patients, and we are disturbed by Senator Sessions' alleged       concern that the protection of that statute should not extend       to victims of violence on tribal lands.        Moreover, confirming Senator Sessions to the job of the top       prosecutor would exacerbate our national crisis over race       issues in policing and our criminal justice system. He       personally blocked the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act,       a bipartisan effort spearheaded by Sens. Charles Grassley (R-      Iowa), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and John Cornyn (R-Texas), and       Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). The fact that law       enforcement leadership throughout the nation supported the       reform effort made no difference to Senator Sessions. And       unfortunately, his actions as U.S. Attorney for the Southern       District of Alabama only further illustrate his indifference       to this crisis. For example, drug convictions made up 40       percent of his cases when he served in that position--twice       the rate of other federal prosecutors in Alabama.        Despite the current trend of focusing resources on violent       crime, and away from out-dated drug war policies, Senator       Sessions continues to oppose any attempts to legalize       marijuana and any reduction in drug sentences. As Attorney       General, he could direct federal prosecutors throughout the       country to pursue the harshest penalties possible for even       low-level drug offenses, a step that would further exacerbate       our national record of incarcerating non-violent offenders--      the vast majority of whom could be successfully treated, at       far lower cost to society, with appropriate healthcare       treatment.        Nor should Senator Sessions be trusted to ensure equal       access to voting rights. He has publically called the Voting       Rights Act ``intrusive,'' and has insisted that its proactive       protections of racial minorities were no longer necessary.       This is especially disturbing as Senator Sessions voiced       public support for voter-ID laws, while his home state       recently tried to close over thirty DMV offices, many in       majority-black areas, shortly after instituting strict voter-      ID requirements. We are reminded of the words of Coretta       Scott King in her letter opposing Jeff Sessions' nomination       to the federal district court in 1986: ``The irony of Mr.       Sessions' nomination is that, if confirmed, he will be given       a life tenure for doing with a federal prosecution what the       local sheriffs accomplished twenty years ago with clubs and       cattle prods.''        We will not attempt to address all the positions Senator       Sessions has taken that are out of step with the reality of       the difficult times we are in, but as nurses we must include       our grave concern that as Attorney General he would not be       vigilant in enforcing environmental protections. In a July       2012 Senate hearing on climate science, Senator Sessions       dismissed the concerns about global warming expressed by 98%       of climate scientists, and asserted that this is ``[a] danger       that is not as great as it seems.'' These positions are       frightening. Climate change is a public health issue that       cannot be overstated. As nurses we have been seeing for some       time increases in the frequency and severity of respiratory       diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema, as well       as an increase in cancers and aggravation of cardiovascular       illness. The effects of air pollution are particularly acute       in pediatric patients. They have higher respiratory rates       than adults, and consequently higher exposure. Our elderly       patients are also especially vulnerable. Respiratory symptoms       as common as coughing can cause arrhythmias, heart attacks,       and other serious health impacts in geriatric patients. As       global warming progresses, we are seeing sharp increases in       heat stroke and dehydration, both of which are sometimes       fatal.        In our disaster relief work through our Registered Nurse       Response Network, we have been called upon to assist the       victims of Hurricane Katrina and Super Storm Sandy--events       that many scientists believe would not have been of the       magnitude they were if not for rising temperature.        Current and future generations cannot afford to have a fox       minding the hen house on the important issues of civil and       criminal protections under the control of the Attorney       General. We urge you to set aside your personal loyalty to       Senator Sessions and evaluate honestly his record and fitness       for this critically important job. We urge you to vote       against his confirmation.            Sincerely,      Deborah Burger, RN,        Co-President, National Nurses United.      Jean Ross, RN,        Co-President, National Nurses United.     I also note that the National Nurses United, on behalf  of 150,000 registered nurses, also urge the opposition to this nominee.  And the record of this individual has made these individuals concerned  about the resources and focus on crimes and actions that they see in  their day-to-day lives.   They want to make sure they are going to work effectively in  addressing these issues that they see through the health care system.  All of these issues add up to a great deal of concern about this next  vote that we are going to be taking.  [[Page S897]]    We are not under the illusion that somehow, magically, the vote is  going to turn out any differently than it did on the last nominee. Why  are we here at 4:30 in the morning to talk about this? Why are we going  to continue to pursue efforts, as the minority, to get time to discuss  these nominees? We are going to do that because we have great concerns  about their record. And, frankly, in the case of the next two nominees  who are coming before us, we had specific questions asked about their  actual actions and statements and the testaments before the Finance  Committee. Instead of the majority answering those questions for us,  they decided not to answer them and push the vote to the floor of the  United States Senate.   I am very concerned about the Price nomination, and the discussion  that I hope we are going to have time to have here on that nomination  and to bring light to the issues that we didn't get to bring to light  in the Finance Committee.   The Treasury nominee that we will give time to in the next several  days, the discussion of that record, the things I am interested in,  obviously, are the protection of Medicare and Medicaid, and making sure  we expose what is the concept and idea to either cap or cut the  benefits that Americans are getting under those programs today and to  have a great discussion about a very important issue that was talked  about during the campaign and was put into party platforms on both  sides of the aisle, but now all of a sudden seem to be forgotten. That  mysterious, but all-important issue, something called Glass-Steagall,  the separation of commercial and investment banking. That is what the  Trump campaign, now President Trump, working with Republicans, put into  a platform. Let us have Glass-Steagall.   Let us have separation of commercial and investment banking. Why?  Because it is the disaster that brought us the implosion of our economy  and cost our economy $14 trillion, according to the Dallas fed. Yet,  many Americans have not fully recovered from that event. I get that a  lot of banks have recovered because we gave them the keys to the  Treasury, and they got bailed out, but a lot of everyday Americans have  not recovered. And certainly there are pension issues in the  questioning of nominee Mnuchin. There was some discussion, ``Well, that  is not what we meant. That is in the party platform, but that is not  what we meant, and that is not what we are going to pursue.'' And  certainly the rollback of Dodd-Frank provisions, that were just done in  a Congressional Review Act, without very much discussion or fanfare or  understanding by the American public, these kinds of actions are the  things we seek debate on.   As these nominees come right after this, my constituents in the State  of Washington are feeling as if these nominees need to be questioned on  how they are going to uphold existing law and how they are going to  implement and enforce existing law as it relates to these many issues.  We are doing our best here. We would rather not do it at 4:30 in the  morning. We would rather not do it at 4:30 in the morning, but we will  do it at 4:30 in the morning if that is what it takes to get the airing  on these issues and this amount of attention.   So I do find that the other side of the aisle, trying to gavel down  my colleague from Massachusetts, was an attempt to try to say that you  can control this debate. You can control the questions we have or the  discussions we want to have or the concerns that our constituents have,  which are real. I don't think it takes a genius to see that many people  marching in Seattle on women's issues or an attorney general or a  Governor who files a case or all the discussion that is happening, as I  said, in response to a bombing at a health clinic just within the last  few years or a bombing that happened in Spokane, an attempt on a Martin  Luther King Day parade just several years ago, where somebody left a  backpack trying to do harm--these are issues today.   They may be the same struggles that our Nation has had, but we have  made it through, and we want a law enforcement officer in the land to  uphold the law, enforce it, and to fight for the civil liberties of  these individuals.   So I go back to my opening comments about this. And that is that I  truly believe that mark that was set in the Saturday night massacre is  the mark we should always strive for. I happened to ask at the time,  when I first got on the Senate, I sat on the Judiciary Commission for 2  years, and I asked Attorney General Ashcroft about these issues. I  asked him specifically, if you become the Attorney General for the  Nation--at this time we had a law that had been implemented, the  roadless area rule. Even though it had become the force of law, would  he enforce that, even though the new President wanted to overturn it?  Because I wanted to get across this very issue: Are you working for the  American people? Will you uphold the law if, in fact, that is the law  of the country? At this point in time, Mr. Ashcroft hesitated about  whether it did have the force of law but said that if it did have the  force of law, he would certainly uphold it. Obviously, we saw a lot of  Executive orders in the early days of the Bush administration trying to  overturn many of these things, and we saw an Attorney General's office  that stood by. Instead of defending these laws in court, basically they  were effective at not implementing fighting them because basically they  did a very poor job in the court process--or decided not to argue or to  file on behalf of the existing law, as opposed to answering to the  Senate of the United States.   So we have seen examples of this. We have seen examples of Attorneys  General who are responding more to the President of the United States  than upholding the laws of the land.   I think Americans--at least the Washingtonians who are writing me in  record numbers, who are speaking out in record numbers, who are  concerned in record numbers--want the laws on the book to be enforced,  and they want the steps they are taking and making progress on as a  State to also work in coordination with the next Attorney General.   I will be honest with people. I did not vote for the law to legalize  marijuana in my State. I did not vote for it. I did not think that  given some challenges and issues we had, it was the right thing to do.  That is how I cast my vote. But more than 20 counties in our State, out  of 39, voted for this law. It is not something that just Seattle did  and it dominated the State, and there were just a bunch of people in  Seattle who wanted to legalize marijuana; it was counties throughout  our State. Some of our most rural counties voted for the legalization  of that product.   In the ensuing years, we have had a good relationship with the  Attorney General and the Department of Justice on how that law was  going to continue to play out. So, as you can imagine, it is a much  more integrated system now several years later. Several questions still  remain about how this country is going to address that issue as a  nation as a whole.   But right now, right now, we want to know we are going to have an  Attorney General, and my obligation to a citizenry who has passed by  initiative this decision is to make sure that I am looking for people  here who are going to work with the State of Washington on that right  that our State has to continue to move forward.   So it is of concern. As I said, the notion that a previous Attorney  General did not agree--not this past Obama administration, but the  previous Bush administration literally came to our State when we had a  medical marijuana law and forced the investigation and shutdown of some  facilities, caused great concern to medical patients throughout our  State. So this is raising a question for people here. It is my  obligation to make sure these issues are raised and brought up as we  seek this discussion on the Sessions nomination to be Attorney General  for our country.   I again thank my colleagues for being out here and for all of the  discussions we have had on these issues. We should not be afraid to  have these discussions. We should not be afraid to think about how we  are going to work not only across the aisle, as I have done with my  colleague Susan Collins on those homeland security Court issues--we  worked successfully with Jeh Johnson, the last Homeland Security  director, to make sure that we were moving some of our airport border  control issues to overseas airports. We were able to get that done in  December  [[Page S898]]  after the San Bernardino event and make sure that we are now working.   Why do we want them over there? Why do we want the border control and  efficiency over there? Because then you can work more in coordination  with law enforcement about who bad actors are before they reach the  shores of the United States. By working with local law enforcement in  those countries, we have better ways to find information about  individuals we have concerns about. That is the best nexus for us, and  so she and I have worked on that issue.   As I mentioned earlier, Senator Collins and I are big advocates for  the use of biometrics because you can identify people. As I mentioned,  in the Ressam case, if we had identified Ressam the first time he  entered France, we would have known who he was when he got to Canada.  It would not have taken him going to the U.S. border. We would have  found out when he arrived in Canada. But this is the United States  using our clout and using our efforts to say to our European  counterparts: We have implemented these biometric standards, and we  want you to implement them, and we want to work together to make sure  people we have great suspicion and concern about are being addressed.   So, yes, we can work across the aisle on these issues. We can find  ways to make sure that we are protecting civil liberties and also  addressing the most heinous of these crimes and working to find  individuals in a cooperative fashion, knowing that we are going to have  to do this on an international basis.   So I urge our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to think  about what America now needs in moving forward on the protection of  civil liberties. I hope that--I am sure it is tempting to want to reach  and to do some of these issues in Executive orders.   I mentioned the other issues of government surveillance in the  Pacific Northwest that the State of Washington for sure has concerns  about. These are our issues.   Infringing on the civil liberties of American citizens is not a  pursuit we should be following. We should be working in coordination  with law enforcement on verifying that people are who they say they are  and pursuing an agenda, working with our international counterparts, to  stop people in those countries before they even plot a case like the  Ressam case in the State of Washington.   I know my other colleagues will be showing up here shortly, but I  just wanted to put an additional note in. If any of our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle are up early and just happen to turn on the  television, if that is one of the things they do in the morning--we  asked our colleagues to give us ample time to debate on the Price and  Mnuchin nominations. We can continue to do the all-night thing. We can.  I feel for the floor staff and the people who are here all night and  the extra strain that it puts on the stenographers who are here and  have been working around the clock. But what we want is to have a  hearing on the issues we are concerned about. We want to be able to  have these issues discussed not necessarily in the middle of the night  but during the broad daylight so that we can engage the American people  on what these choices are so that our colleagues on both sides of the  aisle will hear from their constituents and will hear why these issues  are so important.   In the two cases we are going to see following this nomination for  Attorney General, we are going to individuals who did not fully respond  and answer the questions we wanted answered as it related to  information they supplied to the Finance Committee.   So when you talk about--some people say: Why are you guys doing this?  We say: Well, it is the Treasury nominee and the head of our health  care system. So basically it represents all our revenue and a big chunk  of our spending. That is what those two individuals represent. They  represent the revenue that our country raises and a big chunk of the  money. In fact, I think health care is 7 percent of our economy. It  represents a big aspect of our economy--those two individuals. So we  want to make sure we have ample time to discuss those nominees, to  raise the questions we have about those nominees. Maybe in that  discussion here on the Senate floor in the bright light of day, we will  get some answers. We will get some answers about some of the things  that were discussed in the hearing about opposition to certain issues  or incorrect information. We will engage our colleagues in a debate,  and maybe they can help us understand the support for ideas like  basically, you know, changing Medicare into a program that caps the  benefits on individuals or taking Medicaid and doing the same thing.   I am a big proponent of changes in delivery system reform that have  driven great efficiencies into the health care system. I think many of  our colleagues don't know, for example, about a program that got people  out of nursing homes and into community-based care; that a lot of  States in the country that use this part of the Affordable Care Act now  are driving more efficient health care services into those States--a  lot of States that did not support President Obama, did not support the  Affordable Care Act, but took the money from the Affordable Care Act  and are now implementing a much better delivery system for those who  are living longer and need assistance on health care.   Why is that so important? Because back to my point about Glass- Steagall and the implosion of our economy, what we are going to see is  a very great tragedy on retirement issues. We are going to see a lot of  people who don't have enough money to retire and certainly not enough  to take care of their health care. So what happens then? Those  individuals end up on Medicaid. If they end up on a Medicaid system  that is based on nursing home care, the U.S. Government is going to be  paying a lot more money for those services.   Those are all issues that we want to discuss with our colleagues, and  we want to have an opportunity to do so during the next several days.  We hope you will give us the ability to do that instead of holding all- night sessions--do that during the day--and give us ample time on those  nominees and push those to next week so that we can have that  discussion now.   Again, I want to thank the floor staff and everybody who has been  here these two nights. It is a long haul. It is a long haul to do  there. But behind every Member who has spoken on my side of the aisle,  I can tell you, there is a passion of our constituents. There are true  concerns, both by individuals and I would say businesses, as you can  probably see from those who joined the case Washington State brought.  You can see that there are issues here of how our economy works and how  businesses work as well.   The passion and fervor that drive people to come here and speak on  these issues is really one that represents the whole society we in the  Northwest represent, the economic issues and the challenges that we  face and how we have lived together in the diversity that has emerged  and how much that diversity in the Pacific Northwest has grown our  economy. That is what people are telling us. People want to know: What  is the economic engine of the Pacific Northwest? And one of the things  that scientists and researchers come up and say is that it is  diversity.   The diversity adds to the creativity, the creativity adds to the  inventiveness and the ingenuity, and the ingenuity is what is  propelling these various businesses all across the various sectors. I  am not just talking about high-tech sectors; I am talking about in  agriculture, in aerospace, certainly in tech, but in many other aspects  of manufacturing as well. So we want a nominee for Attorney General who  is going to recognize that diversity, fight for that diversity, who is  going to stand up to the President of the United States when they need  to stand up and continue to make the effort that previous Attorney  Generals have made in doing the job that it takes to be the top law  enforcement officer in the land of the United States.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
