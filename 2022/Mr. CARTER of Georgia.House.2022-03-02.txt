 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  the life of Dr. Ray Farley, the former president of Young Harris  College.   Dr. Farley was a long-time supporter of Young Harris College, with 35  years of dedicated service to Young Harris under his belt.   Beginning as a professor of history in 1955, Dr. Farley worked with  the college until his retirement in 1991, after serving as the college  president for 20 years. For some of those years I was a student at  Young Harris College while Dr. Farley was the president. I got to know  him well. He was a fine gentleman and did an excellent job.   During his tenure as president, Dr. Farley made it his mission to  modernize and expand the services and facilities at Young Harris. He  was responsible for taking important steps to strengthen the college  endowment, faculty, curriculum, and facilities.   Dr. Farley implemented his plan for helping to beautify the campus as  well by renovating dining facilities, resident halls, and  administrative buildings. The years with Dr. Farley at the helm were  integral to the growth and development of the college itself.   In April of 2021, Dr. Farley was awarded the Outstanding Friend Award  by the Young Harris College Alumni Association for his incredible  dedication and service to the college. His legacy and impact will be  felt for many years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I send my condolences to his family and friends as well  as the whole Young Harris community.                            ____________________
