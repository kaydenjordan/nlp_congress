 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday the administration informed  congressional leaders that Secretary Mnuchin, White House Chief of  Staff Mulvaney, and Acting OMB Director Vought reached a deal with  Speaker Pelosi to prevent a government-funding crisis and deliver on  President Trump's top priorities.   The agreement secures the most important priority of the Republican  conference. In fact, in my view, it is the most important obligation of  the entire Congress; that is, securing the resources we need to provide  for the common defense. This deal does it.   Over the past 2\1/2\ years, Republicans in Congress have worked with  the President to stop and reverse the decline in the strength and  readiness of our Armed Forces. After years of insufficient funding that  hurt readiness and tied commanders' hands, Congress and President Trump  have secured badly needed funding increases to rebuild and modernize  the U.S. military.   There is still more work ahead. The progress we have made remains  tenuous. America's adversaries are not taking their foot off the gas  anytime soon, so we can't either. We have to keep up the momentum. This  agreement provides the stability of funding our military deserves and  requires. Thanks to tough negotiating by the Trump administration, this  deal delivers for the security of our Nation. It delivers for our men  and women in uniform. It protects the progress of the last 2 years and  provides the fuel for further progress. That is the bottom line.   The nature of divided government means this certainly isn't the  agreement Republicans would have written all by ourselves; for example,  I will never understand why our Democratic colleagues treat funding the  U.S. Armed Forces like a Republican priority that somehow needs to be  matched up with additional spending that Democrats like in order to  make it palatable for them. It seems to me every one of us, both sides,  should jump at the chance to fund defense adequately.    Alas, that is not a mystery that is going to be solved for me in the  immediate future. The fact is, the Federal  [[Page S4984]]  Government is coming up with urgent deadlines with respect to the debt  limit and beginning the appropriations process.   The full faith and credit of the United States cannot be in question.  The last thing Americans need is for Washington to throw a big wrench  in this red-hot economy that is creating historic levels of job  opportunities and growing their take-home pay, and so faced with our  Democratic colleagues' reluctance, the Trump administration took the  high road. They did what needed to be done for our Armed Forces and  veterans and negotiated a successful deal. In fact, compared to current  law, the administration has secured a larger increase for defense  spending than for nondefense. Let me say that again: a larger increase  for defense than for nondefense compared to current law.   What is more, the administration successfully kept leftwing poison  pills and policy riders far away from this agreement. We know some of  the far left have been hankering to claw back the Hyde amendment  protections or cut away at reprogramming authorities and flexibility  that Presidents rightly possess. I applaud the fact that no leftwing  riders like that were allowed into the deal.   This is the deal that was necessary to continue rebuilding our  national defense after years of neglect, and it is the deal that was  possible in divided government. I am proud to join President Trump in  support of it, and I will be proud to support it when the Senate votes  on the agreement before we adjourn at the end of this month.                            ____________________     Madam President, in the meantime, this body has other  significant business to complete for the American people. Most  immediately, in just a few hours, we will be confirming a new Secretary  of Defense. The vote to advance Dr. Mark Esper's nomination yesterday  afternoon came in at 85 to 6. That is precisely the kind of  overwhelming bipartisan vote that is called for in this circumstance.   The nominee is beyond qualified. His record of public service is  beyond impressive. His commitment to serving our servicemembers is  beyond obvious. The need for a Senate-confirmed Secretary of Defense is  beyond urgent. I urge every one of my colleagues to vote to confirm our  next Secretary of Defense later today.                            ____________________     Madam President, that isn't the only important task we  will tackle on a bipartisan basis today. In just a few hours, the  Senate will attend to an important subject we have never failed to  address; that is, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund.   I know my colleagues don't need any extended lecture from me about  the solemn commitments this program represents: commitments to the  firefighters, police officers, and all the first responders who rushed  selflessly toward the World Trade Center just moments after the attacks  began, to the first responders and workers who reported for duty days  or even weeks later, putting their health at serious risk to help  others, commitments to those who responded to the Pentagon and in  Shanksville, PA, as well, and in the cases where injury or illness has  already claimed the lives of those heroes, commitments to the surviving  families.   Congress can never repay these men, women, and families for their  sacrifices, but we can do a small part to make our heroes whole. That  is why the Senate has never failed to attend to the fund before. We are  not about to do so now.   I had the honor of meeting with a group of first responders and  advocates several weeks back. They gave me the badge of Luis Alvarez, a  New York Police Department bomb squad detective who was terminally ill  and has since tragically passed away.   It was my honor to receive it. It was my honor to reiterate that the  Senate's ironclad commitment to getting this done was never in doubt. I  told the first responders I wanted the Senate to address this prior to  the August recess, and today we will do so. It will be my honor later  today to vote for the funding and ensure this fund is secure. I urge my  colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, in recent weeks,  I have spoken about our Nation's renewed competition with other great  powers, like Russia and China. Despite decades of efforts to welcome  these nations into a peaceful, prosperous, and fair international  system, we are constantly reminded that these nations have their own  design on the future. In their visions, foundational principles of  sovereignty, freedom, human rights, and a rules-based international  order tend to take a backseat to power politics and the pursuit of  hegemony.   The Chinese Communist Party, for example, is working to extend its  control and influence everywhere from Taiwan to Cambodia, to Laos, to  Burma, to Hong Kong, as we have seen recently. The tools and tactics  may differ but the goal is the same: Beijing wants to bend its  neighbors to its will.   Earlier this month, after historic protests, Hong Kong's Government  hit pause on legislation that would have further eroded its autonomy  and invited more meddling from the mainland, but victory for freedom  and autonomy is not yet assured. The bill in question has been  suspended, but it hasn't been totally withdrawn.   Hong Kong's people, emboldened by this rare victory over Beijing's  creeping influence, have continued to exercise their freedom of  assembly to reclaim the rights, privileges, and autonomy slowly sliced  away in recent years by the PRC.   Protests continue and with them countervailing pressures from  authorities beholden to Beijing. Increasingly brutal police tactics and  pro-mainland vigilantes are drawing blood in an effort to intimidate  Hongkongers back into submission.   Hong Kong's autonomous governance, political freedoms, and stable  rule of law has been a crucial precondition of its tremendous growth  and prosperity. U.S. firms have invested tens of billions in Hong  Kong's economy because they trust the autonomous region's political  climate, independent judicial system, and degree of independence from  Beijing.   By contrast, international firms are currently pulling back from  China due to concerns about corruption, autocracy, intellectual  property rights violations, and state-sponsored corporate espionage.   At a time when China faces slowing growth, Beijing should seek to  emulate Hong Kong, not engulf Hong Kong and remake it in the image of  the Chinese Communist Party.   The PRC has long been working hard under the surface to increase its  influence and power. In Hong Kong, like in so many other areas, China  has used this approach that experts have called ``hide and bide''-- hiding their intentions and biding their time, slowly slicing away  resistance, building leverage, and encroaching, one step at a time.   In the case of Hong Kong, Beijing and its agents have overreached,  but they are recalculating--postponing action on this legislation while  biding time to resume the encroachment.   This is not just a matter of the people of Hong Kong. The PRC's  treatment of Hong Kong--just like its treatment of the Uighurs or  Tibetans that Beijing claims as citizens--is an indicator of how  Chinese rulers will behave abroad. All nations who trade with the PRC  should be watching the drama unfolding on the streets of Hong Kong.   The world is watching and wondering: If a government cannot respect  the basic rights of people it claims as its own citizens, why on Earth  would it be trusted to respect the rights and interests of its  neighbors, its trading partners, or the companies that invest in its  economy?   As we all know, the people of Hong Kong have been carrying the banner  for decades. I am proud to say that here in the United States, we have  been marching alongside them the entire way. Back in 1992, I was proud  to author the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act and helped codify America's  stance on the special status of Hong Kong.   So on the 70th anniversary of the PRC and the 30th anniversary of the  Tiananmen Square massacre, I am grateful the administration and  Congress, on a bipartisan basis, are reexamining America's relationship  with  [[Page S4985]]  the PRC. I am grateful for the bipartisan work my colleagues have done  on this important issue, and I am confident Congress will continue to  hold hearings and stay vigilant on the subject of autonomy and  democracy in Hong Kong, as well as China's overall strategy and its  implications for the United States, our allies, and the entire world.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
