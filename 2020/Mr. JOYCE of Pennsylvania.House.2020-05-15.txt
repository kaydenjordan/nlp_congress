 Mr. Speaker, in every neighborhood across  our country, Americans are struggling with the health and economic  ramifications of the coronavirus.   As schools are closed and small businesses stay shuttered, American  families are just trying to make it one day at a time. Here in  Congress, House Democrats are just trying to fund Planned Parenthood.   American families are focused on putting food on their tables. Here  in Congress, Democrats are focused on keeping Americans out of work  instead of saving family-sustaining jobs.   American families are working together to weather this storm. Here in  Congress, Democrats would rather blame our President than hold the  Chinese Communist Party accountable for their role in this pandemic.   Here in Congress, Democrats are wasting time that we could be using  to deliver real solutions for the American people. This bill is not the  answer, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no.''
