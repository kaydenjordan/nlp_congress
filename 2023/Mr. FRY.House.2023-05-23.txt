 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish the Palmetto State, South  Carolina, a happy 235th birthday.   On May 23, 1788, South Carolina became the eighth State to officially  join the United States of America.   From the stunning coast of the Grand Strand to the rich farmlands in  the Pee Dee, to the rolling hills of the Midlands, to the historic  charm of the Lowcountry, and to the foothills of the Blue Ridge  Mountains in the upstate, I cannot think of a better place to call  home.   Our $29 billion tourism industry drives our State's economy. People  flock from all over to witness our rich heritage and our incredible  atmosphere. We welcome over 40 million visitors each and every year. I  have lived in South Carolina my entire life, and I wouldn't have it any  other way. Happy birthday to my favorite State, the Palmetto State,  South Carolina.                            ____________________
