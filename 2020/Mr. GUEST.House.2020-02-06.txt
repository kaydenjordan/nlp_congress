 Mr. Speaker, this morning, my father, my son, my father- in-law, and I attended the National Prayer Breakfast, and joined  thousands of other men and women to pray for our country and our  President.   This was one of the most humbling experiences of my life and will  remain one of the greatest honors that has come with the position of my  office.   Prayer is an important part of my Christian faith. It is an act that  people of faith value immensely, and every person should be able to  pray, free from persecution, in any institution of the United States.   Additionally, our children should never feel ostracized for  displaying their faith and expressing their religious beliefs in our  schools across our Nation. It is more important than ever to defend our  First Amendment rights and to support efforts made by our President and  his administration, and Members of Congress should uphold these values  and protect prayer.                            ____________________
