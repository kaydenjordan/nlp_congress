 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of recognizing  Jesse Edinger of Fort Harrison, MT, for his impact on the Lewis and  Clark County and surrounding areas.   Jesse Edinger joined the U.S. Army directly after graduating high  school in 1999. He attended basic and advanced individual training at  Fort Leonard Wood, MO. His first duty station was in Fort Drum, NY,  where he served as a military police Patrolman, MP. Shortly after, he  received orders to go to Korea. There he was immediately assigned to  the United Nations Command Honor Guard, providing a variety of  missions. In Korea, he met the love of his life Sunwoo. They married  and transferred to Fort Riley, KS, in 2003. Immediately after arriving  Fort Riley, Jesse received orders to deploy to Iraq. In Iraq, he  completed a wide range of military police battlefield functions and was  able to return safely to the U.S. In 2004, Jesse left Active Duty and  decided to serve his home State in the Montana Army National Guard.   After 3 years in the Guard, he was once again called back to Iraq as  an MP. He spent a year there and again returned safely to his family.  In 2006, he volunteered for the Montana Army National Guard honor guard  team and 1 year later was hired as the non-commissioned officer in  charge of the military funeral honors team. He worked hand in hand with  the State coordinator to ensure fallen veterans received the most  professional honors possible. He was one of Montana's first nationally  certified honor guard instructors. In 2014, Jesse Edinger once again  volunteered to deploy to Afghanistan as a military police investigator.  After serving another yearlong deployment, he returned to his military  funeral honors position at Fort Harrison, MT, where he became a  certified instructor as a casualty notification officer. These officers  notify next of kin and assist family members of a soldier killed in  action or that has died in the line of duty. Jesse was recently  promoted to the rank of master sergeant and has conducted around 1100  funeral honors missions for Montana veterans and soldiers killed in  action.   For 20 years, MSG Jesse Edinger has served his country proudly and  has honored the lives of more than 1,000 Montana veterans. His wife Sun  also serves in the Montana Army National Guard. Together they have  three children. MSG Edinger is the epitome of a military leader, and I  am proud to recognize him during Military Appreciation Week.                            ____________________
