 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to today's rule.   Madam Speaker, before I came here, I was listening to the debate. I  listened to Congressman Gallagher, a veteran, come to the floor and  talk about an idea that he has, an idea that here we are, Afghanistan  is collapsing, and thousands of Americans in Afghanistan are trying to  get out.   Here we are, called back for a special session. All his previous  question would say is that we would have to have a report every day on  those Americans, that we wouldn't pick a timeline until the mission is  finished, and that people would be able to be brought back.   As I listened to his impassioned speech, I waited for the response. I  listened to my friend on the other side. He respects Mr. Gallagher, but  he could not turn the floor over because if the floor were turned over  to Republicans, instead of changing the election law and spending $5  trillion, they would put the American public first. God forbid we would  do that.    Madam Speaker, I heard the Democrat on the other side say we could  not turn the floor over to the Republicans to let the American public  know how many Americans were there. It would be devastating-- devastating--to allow that to happen.   This week, the House is in session for the first time since Kabul  fell to the Taliban. What is happening in Afghanistan is a disaster for  America's security and credibility, not for just today and not for next  week, but for decades to come. Other countries are questioning whether  we have the resolve to honor our word because of the bungled  withdrawal.   President Biden magnified this damage over the past week by hiding at  Camp David, delivering incoherent speeches, and is reported as failing  to contact a single foreign leader for 36 hours. Today, he signaled an  unconditional surrender to the Taliban, promising to leave in just 7  days.   We just had a classified briefing for all the Members. I don't  believe any Member walking out of there believes that in 7 days we  could get the thousands of Americans out. That is why we can't  relinquish the floor to the Republicans to actually get a report on it.   Madam Speaker, the President's actions gave the impression of  incompetency and a declining power. This week, we learned that the  Taliban seized millions in U.S. weapons, making them stronger than they  were 20 years ago.   Madam Speaker, it is reported the Taliban now has more Black Hawk  helicopters than Australia. Military missions should be dictated by our  Nation's interests, not by our enemies or by arbitrary timelines.   Right now, there is no greater national priority than getting our  people home. But I just heard from the Democrat on the other side that  we could not relinquish the floor to allow Mr. Gallagher's, a  veteran's, previous question to come up because that would be dealing  with the Nation's interests right now. No. We need to deal with the  Democrats' priorities right now.   As I look around, I see our allies responding to this crisis with the  seriousness it deserves. Madam Speaker, the Speaker called us back  here. We are not the only body of power that has been called back.   In Britain, Parliament returned from its summer recess. Do you know  what they are doing, though, Madam Speaker? They are working in an  emergency session on this current situation to get their citizens home.   In France, President Macron is trying to rally the U.N. Security  Council.   This House should be correcting this disastrous record left by this  Commander in Chief and proving that America never abandons her people  or shrinks from defending our interests.   Madam Speaker, that is not what I heard on this floor. I heard a  direction, Madam Speaker, by the Democrat leading and in charge of this  right now that we could not relinquish the floor simply to Mr.  Gallagher's request of letting America know how many Americans are  there and to not put a timeline until every American comes home.   We should be doing nothing else on the floor until every single  American is home. Democrats called us back for an emergency session,  the first session since Kabul fell to the Taliban. But faced with a  national security and credibility crisis in Afghanistan, they have done  nothing to plan to address it.   We were allotted 90 minutes, and, oh my God, we went over 15 minutes.  But we made sure that then the Democrats had to shut that meeting down,  that Members of Congress could ask no more longer questions because we  needed to get back to the floor right now.  [[Page H4365]]    When history writes about this day, they will talk about the entire  week. They will talk about last night, how Congress worked late into  the night, actually ordered food to come in, was in the Speaker's  Office for late hours, spent their day calling other Members and  twisting votes. We had reports that the President called people, that  former Presidents called people, and that people were threatened and  that their spouses were threatened about jobs. We heard that they were  threatened even in their own campaign.   But what were they threatened about? Was it anything to deal with  Americans coming home? No. It was about this rule. It was about what we  are bringing up right now. The reason we had to stop our briefing was  because we had to come to the floor to deal with this.   So, what are we talking about? $5 trillion of hard-earned taxpayer  money being spent on more Big Government, changing election law to  benefit one party over another, outlawing IDs even though the majority  of America wants it, and nothing about how that $5 trillion will spend  $1 bringing Americans home or making us safer.   What is the definition of a public servant? I would say doing  something for the good of the others.   Madam Speaker, the party today of the majority, the Democrats here,  their interest is themselves, to stay up late into the night while  other nations are working to bring their citizens home.   Madam Speaker, as people walk onto this floor and vote on this bill  that they worked late into the night on, I want them to think about one  thing. I want them to think about those American families in  Afghanistan who late into the night were not knowing if they could even  make it to the airport, not knowing if they will even get out, and  wondering if the public servants were thinking of them. The sad answer  is the majority was not. They were thinking of themselves, that it is  too important to deal with anything else.   Madam Speaker, there are allies who are sitting in Afghanistan. Why  did they go? They went to defend America because America was attacked  and out of the respect and character of who we are.   This body, elected and respected around the world, in a time of  crisis doesn't speak of it and doesn't act on it but only acts for  themselves and, in a moment of time of using the rules to allow the  opportunity to change its course and to correct them when they were  wrong, the voice of the other side says: No, we could not turn the  floor over to allow America to know how many Americans are there or to  get a report on it.                                time  1415    Just as they bang the gavel down, the 90 minutes have come. You have  asked enough questions. You can ask no more because we must get to the  floor to pass $5 trillion and change election law so the Democrats  believe they can buy and change an election.   Madam Speaker, if there is any moment in time to put an election  aside, if there is any moment in time to put politics aside, I would  have thought today was the day. I would have thought we were being  called back so that we could focus on what the rest of the world is  focused on.   So when the Speaker came to the floor to speak, I turned my volume  up. Surely, she was going to speak of this day. Surely, she was going  to talk about the Gold Star families. Surely, she was going to thank  those veterans and those who have served here knowing what they are  going through and what they are watching.   And you know what she said? Speaker Pelosi actually said: Today is a  great day of pride for our country and Democrats. Today is a great day  of pride for our country and our Democrats.   Let me be very clear. It is not. It is an embarrassing day for our  Nation. We are 3 weeks away from the twentieth anniversary of 9/11, and  this is what history will write. This is what you did with your  majority. This is what you controlled. This is how you made sure you  would not release the floor for the idea that Americans can find out  how many are stuck in Afghanistan or how they are going to get home.   I hope you are proud of that because this is what your leadership has  done. This is what your leadership worked on. This is what the power of  the twisting of the arm has delivered. The United States of America is  not going to let terrorists dictate when and how we get Americans out.   I firmly believe what has been said many times and especially by  Abraham Lincoln, `` . . . government of the people, by the people, for  the people, shall not perish from the Earth.'' If you believe that too  and you are watching, I ask that you pick up your phones and you call,  especially if you are a Democrat because I do not think the leadership  here represents you with what they are asking for. I know your love of  this country.   I know the thousands upon thousands of Democrats who served their  Nation, who served in Afghanistan, and I know those Americans who are  in Afghanistan are not just of one party. I would like to see both  parties work on the issue, what is really before us.   Can you not put politics aside? Can you not care for one moment that  you could rig an election to get elected? Can you not care about making  government so large that you are going to bring more inflation and  trillions of dollars?   That is what you spent last night on. That is what you spent the  whole time on. That is what you brought us in for. That is what you  closed the briefing on, but we couldn't ask any more questions. Time is  up. That is what you are fighting so hard for that a veteran who has  served his country asked for a previous question to simply say: Can we  get a report of how many Americans are still there? And asked that we  do not pick a date when we get out until every American is out.   But I heard the leadership on the other side say that we could not do  that. We have to change the election law. We have to spend $5 trillion.  This is what we came back for in a special session. This is what our  mission is.   Everyone who votes for this rule today, that is what you are voting  for. That is what you are championing. That is what history will write.  And, no, it is not a good day. Maybe in your caucus you think it is a  great day for you and the Democrats. It is an embarrassing day for  America. It is an embarrassing day for this floor, and it is  embarrassing that you would even move forward with it.
