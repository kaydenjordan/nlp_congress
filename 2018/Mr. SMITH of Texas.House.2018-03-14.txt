 Mr. Speaker, activist judges have joined liberal  Democrats to stop President Trump's policies. Federal trial judges have  abused their authority by issuing almost two dozen nationwide  injunctions to block the Trump administration's actions. According to  Attorney General Jeff Sessions, these injunctions have far exceeded  their historic use. In fact, the number of injunctions surpasses all  those approved in the past 200 years.   Nationwide injunctions encourage forum shopping by opponents of the  President's policies who file claims in courts with liberal judges.  These judges place their personal views and politics above the rule of  law. They do a real disservice to the justice system.   It is time to rein in these activist judges. The people's respect for  the law is at stake.                            ____________________
