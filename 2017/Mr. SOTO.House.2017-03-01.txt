 Mr. Speaker, this is a simple issue: Do we want to make  workplaces safer? Do we want to keep workers from getting hurt on the  job? Of course, we do.   In order to protect workers, we need good data on where injuries are  happening so we can work with employers to stop them.   Sometimes the other side says commonsense protections like this are  too expensive or they kill jobs or they stifle innovation. None of  those is even remotely true here.   The protections this resolution would take away cost nothing.  Responsible employers are already keeping these records. That is why  the coalition opposing this resolution includes workers rights  advocates and a whole lot of other folks like public health  practitioners. These are not political people. These are just people  who work every day to help Americans lead safe, healthy lives.   This is not about President Obama or power grabs. It is about  protecting the American worker.   The 6-month period is a setup which will lead to less enforcement.  Rather than eliminating the rule, let's codify it and use the  information we collect to continue to evolve our laws to protect  workers.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
