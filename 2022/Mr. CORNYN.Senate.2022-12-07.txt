 Madam President, yesterday, President Biden traveled to  Phoenix, AZ, to visit the site of a new semiconductor manufacturing  plant.   I am a proud proponent of domestic semiconductor manufacturing  because it has become a matter of economic and national security, and  it enjoys broad bipartisan support here in the Senate through the CHIPS  and Science Act.   It is exciting to see the sort of announcements that we were seeing  in Arizona and these new chipmaking investments on American soil. But  it is hardly the most pressing or most urgent matter on the minds of  Arizonans or Texans or any other border State communities as well as  folks across the country.   It is only about 150 miles from Phoenix to the United States-Mexico  border, which has been willfully neglected by the Biden administration.   Under President Biden's administration, we have broken one record  after another when it comes to illegal immigration at the southern  border, and the system is now near its breaking point with the  expiration of title 42, which is the public health title which has  given the Border Patrol the authority to repel people coming across the  border--some of them, at least--using that tool. But when that goes  away, Border Patrol, absent any change in administration policy, will  not be able to return those individuals--mainly adult males--back  across the border for illegally entering the United States.   So despite the President getting on Air Force One at Andrews Air  Force Base, flying to Phoenix, AZ, a border State, the President's trip  did not include a short trip and visit to the border. After all, the  President has pretty good transportation. He has got Air Force One. Can  you imagine? It would just take a quick hop to the border to give the  President the opportunity to learn because he has not visited the  border once since he took office.   He could have done what I have done and what other Members of the  Senate have done when we visited the border. He could have asked the  Border Patrol agents to share their challenges, ask what he could do to  help.   He could have asked what can the Federal Government do to make your  job easier in order to address this crisis.   He could have talked to Customs and Border Protection Office of Field  Operation officers about their efforts to interdict the drugs that took  the life of 108,000 Americans last year alone, virtually all of which  comes across the southern border.   He could have just simply said thank you, thank you for your service  to the countless men and women who are on the frontlines of this crisis  each and every day.   Unfortunately, President Biden couldn't be bothered to make that  trip.   As he was leaving Washington yesterday, a reporter asked the  President why he would visit Arizona, a border State, and not go to the  border.   The President responded:         Because there are more important things going on.    Talk about a slap in the face to every single person who is troubled  by what is happening at the southern border.   Every day, migrants are being exploited by people who care nothing  about their welfare but view them simply as a commodity to make money.  The stories of the abuse of migrants who take the long and dangerous  trip from their home across the southern border are legion. The  President could have learned more about that and expressed concern and  say: You know, what can we do to discourage people from making that  long and dangerous trip into the United States and being subjected to  sexual assault and other forms of abuse?   He could have asked about the fentanyl, the synthetic opioids, and  other dangerous drugs that are coming into our country and killing  innocent people in our communities. We have had a number of teenage  children, schoolchildren, killed when they consumed a pill that they  thought was maybe a prescription drug like Xanax or Percocet, which was  contaminated with fentanyl. It just takes a pencil lead portion of  fentanyl to kill you. Unfortunately, that has been happening because of  the border crisis and the drugs flowing across the southern border.   The cartels and criminal organizations are getting rich off the trail  of death and destruction that they have created. But let it be known:  President Joe Biden thinks there are more important things to do.   That is more outrageous than disappointing, but it is really both. It  is outrageous and disappointing to hear the President of the United  States admit this outright. But as dangerous, outrageous, and  disappointing as it is to hear him say it, we really shouldn't be  surprised by his inaction when it comes to addressing this crisis.   For nearly 2 years, President Biden and his administration have  ignored the crisis at the border so he refuses to visit. You know, he  might just learn something. He might find out that this is not about  root causes, which is what Secretary Blinken and others, Vice President  Harris, have said. They think illegal immigration is a result of root  causes.   Well, there is a component of that--people experiencing violence or  poverty in their home country who want to come to the United States-- but it is also about drug smugglers. It is also about criminals who  have been deported for endangering Americans, and yet they come back  across the border to do it again and again.   So the President might have actually learned something if he had just  taken a few minutes to talk to the people who work and live on the  border.   So he refuses to visit; he avoids talking about it; he acts like  there is nothing wrong when, in fact, we are experiencing an  unprecedented humanitarian and security crisis.   Since President Biden took office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection  has encountered more than 4 million--4 million--migrants at the  southern border. During the full 8 years of the Obama administration,  Customs and Border Protection didn't see that many migrants. In 2  years, we have seen more than they saw in 8 years during the Obama  administration.   President Biden's policies have not only tolerated this situation, it  has actually made it worse and encouraged more migrants to make the  trip to our  [[Page S7021]]  border and successfully get into the interior of the United States.   Whether or not President Biden wants to admit it or not, there is a  crisis at the southern border. Everybody who takes 30 seconds to learn  about it understands it. And the truth is, this crisis, as bad as it  is, is getting worse because of the President's open border policies.   From day 1, the Biden administration decided they needed to dismantle  all of the policies of the previous administration that deterred  illegal immigration. It is not just about catching people who come into  the country illegally; it is also about discouraging people from making  that trip in the first place. And the Biden administration's policies  create the impression that anybody who can make it to the border can  make it into the interior.   The administration has rolled out a steady parade of rhetoric,  policies, and guidance that sent a clear message: Cross the southern  border and you will be able to successfully make your way into the  United States.   So it is no surprise that this message that has been sent by open  border policies and a lack of enforcement, it is no surprise we have  seen these unprecedented numbers.   For the first time on record, Customs and Border Protection logged  more than 2 million border crossings in a single year. They encountered  nearly 2.4 million migrants in fiscal year 2022.   In October, we logged the highest number of migrant encounters on  record. This is 230,000 in a single month.   If this happened in any one of the States represented by my  colleagues that are not border States, I wonder what their reaction  would be. When Governor Abbott or Governor Ducey or Governor DeSantis  had put some of these migrants on a bus and sent them to Washington or  Chicago or New York, Mayor Adams said: This is a crisis. Mayor Bowser  in Washington, DC, said: We need the National Guard to come out when  just a few thousand migrants make their way into the interior. But when  230,000 show up on the border of Texas in a single month, they could  care less.   As shocking as these statistics are, they don't tell the full story.  Whether we are talking about migrant encounters, drug seizures,  terrorist arrests, you have to remember, these are just the ones we  know about.   When Border Patrol agents are asked to process and care for thousands  of migrants a day, that means they are not on the frontlines securing  our border. They can't stop the drug smugglers if they are filling out  paperwork or providing formula to an unaccompanied child.   New reporting from FOX News shed light on how many individuals evaded  Border Patrol just last month. Law enforcement refers to these as the  ``got-aways.'' But they don't pull that number out of thin air.   The United States-Mexico border includes an extensive network of  physical and technological barriers. Some sections have 30-foot steel  walls, others have vehicle barriers, others include sensors, cameras,  and other surveillance equipment.   Known got-aways are those who are spotted by some form of  surveillance but not apprehended by the Border Patrol, and last month,  Border Patrol logged more than 73,000 got-aways.   Let's see, in October, we logged the highest number of migrant  encounters on record, more than 230,000 in a single month. And during  that same month, 73,000 more migrants were got-aways. These are 73,000  people who did not want to encounter Border Patrol. They weren't  seeking asylum; they were trying to evade law enforcement and probably  for a very good reason.   Of course, even that data doesn't tell the full story. These are just  the known got-aways for a single month. There is no way of knowing how  many actually evaded detection entirely, especially over the course of  the last 2 years.   It is not just the people we are concerned about. It is dangerous  drugs like fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, as well as illicit  weapons and drug money.   The criminal organizations and cartels that take advantage of and  exploit the administration's open border policies are, in two words,  commodity agnostic. In other words, they will deal in drugs, weapons,  or people as long as it makes them money--commodity agnostic.   President Biden and his policies are the best thing that ever  happened to their dirty business.   It is making them rich while trading on human misery and death. I  disagreed with President Biden's assessment that there are more  important things than what is going on at the border. That is easy for  him to say, sitting in the White House in Washington, DC.   The people I represent, who live and work along the border, are  overwhelmed. And this is a Federal responsibility. This shouldn't be up  to the States because this is an international border. By definition,  it is a Federal responsibility.   This state of chaos is also hurting the migrants who are sold lies by  the cartels and traffickers and are duped into paying thousands of  dollars a head to come to the United States. And, you know what, you go  to Houston, TX, and some of those same migrants are held hostage,  working in prostitution or forced labor by the people who say they will  turn them in to the authorities and reveal the fact that they are  illegally in the United States unless they continue in that forced  labor or that prostitution.   As I said, this is hurting our border communities, which are now  apparently expected to carry the weight of feeding, caring for, and  transporting thousands upon thousands of migrants. And it is weighing  on the men and women in our law enforcement community who put their  lives on the line to secure the border and to protect the American  people.   I wonder if President Biden knows that last month three Border Patrol  agents took their own lives--two from Texas and one from New Mexico. It  is absolutely heartbreaking to see the toll this crisis is taking on  these brave men and women who have been begging the administration for  support for nearly 2 years. This isn't asking them to do something over  and above what is required because all they are asking is for the  administration to enforce the law, to let them enforce the law, and to  relieve them of the burden of this abdication of responsibility.   So if President Biden had taken a few minutes to hop down to the  border in Air Force One when he was in Phoenix yesterday, he might have  learned some of this. Over the years, I have had the pleasure of  learning from and working with the men and women who live and work  along Texas's 1,200-mile border with Mexico. We are talking about law  enforcement officials, local officials like the county judges, the  mayors, the private property owners, the small business owners, and  folks who run nonprofits. They have provided an unvarnished view of how  decisions in Washington impact their communities, the economy, and our  national security.   And President Biden could have learned this--Vice President Harris,  too. I have taken the opportunity, along with my colleague Senator  Cruz, to introduce dozens of our Senate colleagues to these people on  the border that I am talking about so they could gain a better  understanding of the challenges that they are up against and the things  that we could do that would make their life and the conditions on the  border better.   And I will just issue an open invitation, Madam President. I am happy  to invite President Biden to come to Texas, to the border, and I would  be delighted to introduce him to these people that I have talked  about--law enforcement, small businesses, local elected officials,  private property owners--that are being absolutely overwhelmed by this  border crisis created by President Biden's open-border policies. If he  would take the time to actually listen to their experiences, there is  no way he would continue to believe that there are more important  things going on.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
