 Mr. President, I will just take a few minutes here. This  is very important, that we get this supplemental passed.   I want to first thank my colleague and the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee, Senator Leahy, for the work he has done here,  working together to get where we are today. This has been a lot of  work, working together, but it also shows that we can work together in  a bipartisan way and put the country first, and this is evidence here.   What does this bill do? It sticks to immediate security needs, the  urgently needed funding to safeguard the Capitol, ensure National Guard  readiness, and protect our allies in Afghanistan. That is among other  things. It is just over $2 billion total, more than half of which is  for the Department of Defense. Out of the defense funding, $521 million  is to fill National Guard shortfall and about $500 million to evacuate  Afghan allies; $600 million for the State Department to fund Afghan  special immigration visas; $100 million for our own Capitol Police  here, to fund that; and $300 million for security enhancements around  the Capitol.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote yes for this.   Again, I want to thank Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell, our  leaders on both sides of the aisle, for helping bring this to where we  are today.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2124 and ask that  it be reported by number.
