 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 62nd  anniversary of Tibetan Uprising Day.   Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of representing an incredibly diverse  community of individuals at home in New York 14, many of whom are  Tibetan. In fact, one of the largest constituencies of Tibetans in the  world makes its home in New York 14.   For decades, the Tibetan people have bravely fought for their  freedom, including to seek and fight for the freedom to simply be  Tibetan: to speak their language; to practice their Buddhist religion;  to sustain their culture, their traditional medicine, and their land;  and to live freely in their own country.   It is the responsibility of all those who value freedom of speech and  expression to stand with them against gross human rights abuses.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with the Tibetan residents of New  York 14 and all those across the country in their righteous fight  against persecution.                            ____________________
