The proposed sale will improve Argentina's capability to       meet current and future threats by increasing operational       capabilities and force availability. Argentina will use the       Stryker vehicles to conduct stability operations in support       of disaster relief and international peace keeping       obligations. Argentina will have no difficulty absorbing       these vehicles into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the       basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be General Dynamics Land Systems,       Anniston, AL. There are no known offset agreements in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       temporary assignment of two (2) U.S. contractor       representatives to Argentina to support the program.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.

The M1126 Stryker is an infantry carrier vehicle       transporting nine soldiers, their mission equipment, and a       crew of two, consisting of a driver and vehicle commander. It       is equipped with armor protection, M2 machine guns, and M6       smoke grenade launchers for self-protection. The Stryker is       an eight-wheeled vehicle powered by a 350hp diesel engine. It       incorporates a central tire inflation system, run-flat tires,       and a vehicle height management system. The Stryker is       capable of supporting a communications suite, a Global       Positioning System (GPS), and a high frequency and near-term       digital radio systems. The Stryker is deployable by C-130       aircraft and combat capable upon arrival. The Stryker is       capable of self-deployment by highway and self-recovery. It       has a low noise level that reduces crew fatigue and enhances       survivability. It moves about the battlefield quickly and is       optimized for close, complex, or urban terrain. The Stryker       program leverages non-developmental items with common       subsystems and components to quickly acquire and filed these       systems.        2. The AN/VAS-5 Driver's Vision Enhancer is a compact       thermal camera providing armored vehicle drivers with day or       night time visual awareness in clear or reduced vision (fog,       smoke, dust) situations. The system provides the driver a 180       degree viewing angle using a high resolution infrared sensor       and image stabilization to reduce the effect of shock and       vibration. The viewer and monitor are ruggedized for       operation in tactical environments.        3. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        4.

A determination has been made that Argentina can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        6. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Argentina.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Transmittal No. 20-41       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MK 54 Torpedo is a conventional torpedo that can be       launched from surface ships, helicopters, and fixed wing       aircraft. The MK 54 is an upgrade to the MK 46 Torpedo, which       is currently in-service in Belgium. The MK 54 replaces MK       46's sonar and guidance and control systems with modern       technology. The new guidance and control system uses a       mixture of commercial-off-the-shelf and custom-built       electronics. The warhead, fuel tank and propulsion system       from the MK 46 torpedo are re-used in the MK 54 configuration       with minor modifications. There is no sensitive technology in       the MK 54 or its support and test equipment. Belgium has not       requested nor will it be provided with the source code for       the MK 54 operational software.

Transmittal No. 20-27       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MV-22 Osprey is a U.S.-military, multi-mission,       Tilt-Rotor aircraft with both a Vertical Takeoff and Landing       (VTOL) and Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) capability. It is       designed to combine the functionality of a conventional       helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance       of a turboprop aircraft.        2. The AN/AAQ-27A Forward Looking InfraRed (FLIR) is a       third-generation, mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) imaging       system that allows aircrews to see through darkness, smoke,       haze, and adverse weather. The system incorporates a state-      of-the-art MWIR indium-antimonide (InSb) staring focal plane       array with 480 x 640 detector elements. It has demonstrated       superb image quality and range performance using non-      developmental, in-production components to provide higher       resolution imagery than current long wavelength infrared       systems.        3. The AN/APR-39 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) System       monitors the environment for pulsed radar signals,       characterizes and identifies them, and alerts the crew to the       existence of emitters. The AN/APR-39 contributes to full-      dimensional protection by improving individual aircraft       probability of survival through improved aircrew situational       awareness of the electromagnetic threat environment. These       systems have specific aircraft applications providing varying       levels and types of warning to allow aircrews to initiate       evasive maneuvers or deploy active countermeasures.        4. The AN/ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispenser System (CMDS) is       an Electronic Warfare (EW) System providing combat aircrews       with enhanced survivability in all threat environments. This       on-board, self-protection capability stems from the       integration of RWR hardware with a system for the dispensing       of expendable countermeasures. The AN/ALE-47 CMDS provides       the aircrew with a ``smart'' countermeasure dispensing       system, allowing the aircrew to optimize the countermeasures       employed against anti-aircraft threats. The systems consists       of five major components and several sub-components.        5. The AN/AAR-47 is an Electronic Warfare (EW) system       designed to protect aircraft against Infrared-Guided (IR)       missile threats, laser-guided/laser-aided threats, and       unguided munitions. Upon detection of the threat, the system       will provide an audio and visual sector warning to the pilot.       For IR missile threats, the system automatically initiates       countermeasures by sending a command signal to the CMDS. The       AN/AAR-47 includes sensor pre-processing for improved       performance in high-clutter environments.        6. AN/APX-117 is a commercially available Identification       Friend or Foe (IFF) transponder that incorporates all of the       advanced features required in today's global military and       civil air traffic control environments. The transponder's       open-system architecture design and high-density field-      programmable gate array technology ensures ongoing       versatility and future utility through software growth,       without the risk and cost associated with hardware       modifications. The AN/APX-117 supports IFF modes 1, 2, 3/A,       C. It is Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B)       complaint and is compatible with Multifunctional Information       Distribution System (MIDS) and Joint Tactical Information       Distribution System (JTIDS).        7. The AN/ARN-153 is a full-featured Tactical Air       Navigation (TACAN) system capable of supporting the       operational requirements of high performance aircraft in a       lightweight compact design. The AN/ARN-153 supports four       modes of operation: receive mode; transmit-receive mode; air-      to-air receive mode; and air-to-air transmit-receive mode.        8. The AN/ARN-147 systems combines all Very High Frequency       (VHF) Omni Ranging/Instrument Landing System (VOR/ILS)       functions into once compact, lightweight, low-cost set. It is       the first militarized VHF navigation receiver to provide       optional internal MIL-STD-15538 capability. The solid-state       system is MIL-E-5400 class II qualified and meets       international operability requirements by providing 50-kHz       channel spacing for 160-VOR and 40-localizer/glideslope       channels. Digital and analog outputs of the AN/ARN-147 ensure       compatibility with high-performance flight control systems       and both digital and analog instruments. Modular construction       techniques give quick access to all cards and modules to       reduce repair time.        9. The AN/ARC-210 629F-23 (non-COMSEC) multimode integrated       communication system is designed to provide multimode voice       and data communications in either normal or jam-resistant       modes in line-of-sight mode. The system is capable of       establishing 2-way communication links over the 30 to 512MHz       frequency range in tactical aircraft environments.        10. The AN/APN-194 Radar Altimeter Receiver-Transmitter is       a high-resolution device which measures altitude from 0 to       5,000 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The radar altimeter       measures the time (analogous to distance) required for a       pulse of electromagnetic energy to travel from the aircraft       to the ground and back to the aircraft. The AN/APN-194       employs a narrow-pulse transmission in the C-band range with       leading edge tracking of the echo pulse. Altitude range       information is obtained by comparing the received echo pulse       with a timed ramp voltage generated simultaneously with the       transmitted pulse. The output of the AN/APN-194 is fed into       the autopilot of the target to control the altitude of low-      flying targets.        11. The AN/ASN-163 is a 5-channel Miniature Airborne GPS       Receiver (MAGR) that provides Over-The-Horizon and secure       navigation capabilities using satellite information.        12. The M240 Machine Gun (7.62mm) is a defensive weapon       system used to support troop insertion and medical evacuation       missions.        13. The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) is a PC-based       common approach for aircraft mission planning. It is a system       of common and host-platform-unique mission planning       applications for Navy and Marine Corps aircraft. Using a       ``building block'' approach, developers integrate and       assemble a JMPS Mission Planning Environment (MPE) from a set       of software sub-components to meet the needs of a particular       aircraft type. An MPE consists of a framework, one or more       common components/federated applications, and a Unique       Planning Component (UPC). The foundation of an MPE is the       framework, which allows the host operating system to       interface and interact with the MPE. The second level of an       MPE consists of the common components and/or federated       applications; these applications provide functionality that       is common to multiple aircraft platforms (i.e. weather or GPS       munitions). The final level of software is the UPC, which       provides platform-specific functionality and integrates the       common components functions and the framework interface to       produce the overall mission planning software environment for       the platform. When bundled, the three levels of software       become an MPE that is specific to a single aircraft type.       Depending on the aircraft model, a JMPS MPE might operate on       a stand-alone, locally networked, or domain controlled, or a       mixture of all three operating environments.        14. The highest level of classification of defense       articles, components, and services included in this potential       sale is SECRET.        15. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        16. A determination has been made that the Government of       Indonesia can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        17. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Indonesia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms  [[Page S5371]]  sales as defined by that statute.

The       total estimated cost is $620 million.        This proposed sale is consistent with U.S. law and policy       as expressed in Public Law 96-8.        This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and       security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing       efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a       credible defensive capability. The proposed sale will help       improve the security of the recipient and assist in       maintaining political stability, military balance, and       economic progress in the region.        This proposed sale will help sustain the recipient's       missile density and ensure readiness for air operations. The       recipient will use this capability as a deterrent to regional       threats and to strengthen homeland defense. The recipient       will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Camden, AZ.       There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection       with this potential sale.

There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 20-24       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Patriot Air Defense System contains classified       SECRET components and critical/sensitive technology. The       Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Four Pack is       classified CONFIDENTIAL. With the incorporation of the PAC-3       missile, the Patriot system will continue to hold a       significant technological lead over other surface-to-air       missile systems in the world.        2. The PAC-3 Missile sensitive/critical technology is in       the area of design and production know-how and primarily       inherent in the design, development, and/or manufacturing       data related to certain components. Information on system       performance capabilities and effectiveness, select software       documentation, and test data are classified up to SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of hardware and software elements, the information       could be used to develop countermeasures or equivalent       systems, which might reduce system effectiveness or be used       in the development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the recipient can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the recipient.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.
