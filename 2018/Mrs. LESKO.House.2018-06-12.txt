 Madam Speaker, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has ignited a  fire that the American economy hasn't seen in decades. The tax cuts and  reforms passed by Congress have made a real impact on the lives of  Americans across the country and to the people in Arizona's Eighth  Congressional District.   The tax cuts have allowed small business owners like Mike and Colleen  Sutter to reinvest in their employees. They have owned a small business  for the last 27 years in El Mirage in my district. Due to the tax cuts  package, Mike and Colleen were able to give across-the-board pay  increases and bonuses to their employees, including a $3 an hour  increase for hourly workers.   This historic tax reform legislation has also had a huge impact on  those living on fixed incomes. Arizona Public Service Electric Company  cut its power rates by $119 million because of the tax cuts. These  lower costs help seniors all over America and in my district.   With a simpler and fairer Tax Code, businesses are finally able to  hire again, more than 1 million new jobs have been created, and there  are more jobs available than there are unemployed Americans. Our Nation  is in business again.   Americans are seeing more money in their paychecks, a reduced tax  burden, and a roaring economy. The tax cuts have meant real dollars  going back into the pockets of small businesses and families.   I thank my colleague from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert) for his commitment  to commonsense tax reform.
