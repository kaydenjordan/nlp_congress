 Mr. Speaker, the Heroes Act is what America needs. It  is what my State of New York needs.   Nearly $7 billion for public transportation, that is a compromise.   Aid to struggling small businesses, including restaurants, that is a  compromise.   Billions of dollars to help schools operate safely and to help  parents afford childcare and get back to work, that is a compromise.   Another round of stimulus checks for the American people, that is a  compromise, Mr. Speaker.   Billions of dollars for emergency rental assistance as people face  evictions and people don't know where they are going to get the money  to pay their rent, they are backed up, that is a compromise.   And, finally, Mr. Speaker, help for States and local government--not  red States and blue States, all States. Last time I checked, it was all  the United States of America. Let's help all the States. They are not  getting the revenue that they need. That is a compromise.   I said the last time we passed the Heroes Act back in May that it was  a good thing. I say today that this is a real good thing, and it is a  compromise.
