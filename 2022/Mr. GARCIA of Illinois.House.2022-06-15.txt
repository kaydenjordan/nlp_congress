 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor  Jeffrey Sherwin of the city of Northlake, Illinois for 25 years of  service to that city.   Mayor Sherwin, a lifelong resident of Northlake and Leyden Eagle, has  dedicated his life to public service.   Prior to becoming mayor in 1997, he served as trustee for Northlake  Public Library and Northlake Fire Protection District.   As mayor, he has worked tirelessly to transform the community by  putting education, housing, infrastructure, and protecting the  environment at the forefront of his effort.   Mayor Sherwin built senior housing, established many new green and  recreational spaces, and restored wetlands.   In celebration of 25 years of service, today, we thank Mayor Jeffrey  Sherwin for his career of service.                            ____________________
