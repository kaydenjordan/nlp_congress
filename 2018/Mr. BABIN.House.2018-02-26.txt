 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Paul Mitchell for this  opportunity to talk about our historic tax cut legislation and the  great benefits that are flowing to small businesses and the tens of  millions of Americans who work for them.   This is especially true in the great State of Texas and the nine  counties that I represent from Houston to the Louisiana State line,  which has more petrochemical refining facilities than any district in  the entire United States, and their employees benefitting from lower  taxes. But the gains and the headlines that we have seen say so much  more than that. The gains extend far beyond just employees benefitting  from lower taxes. I am also hearing from hundreds of individuals and  families about how their tax bills are being cut and what they plan to  do with their larger paychecks.   ExxonMobil has announced a $50 billion investment in its U.S.  operations and employees over the next 5 years. Walmart has already  boosted hourly wages and provided employees with a bonus. Boeing,  Incorporated, has announced $300 million in employee-related  investments and charitable giving.   Let's break this down even further to the stories that aren't making  the headlines of major papers but which are improving lives and growing  businesses all across southeast Texas.    Juan and Leigh both owned small businesses in Houston and were able  to hire additional employees with the money that they are saving from  their tax cuts. That is putting Americans to work immediately.   Amy in Polk County shared with me that she was able to purchase new  equipment to run her business much more efficiently. Helen in Tyler  County took her tax savings and plowed it back into her business to  help it grow. Julie in Orange shared that she will save enough from the  tax cuts to purchase a larger inventory for her business.   Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and I am hearing  story after story just like this about small businesses growing and  hiring our friends and our neighbors. The individual tax rate cuts are  making a huge difference for east Texans as over 90 percent of  Americans are getting a tax cut.   Robert from Highlands wrote to tell me that he is using his tax  savings to help his daughter get a college degree. Alan in Houston has  decided to put his tax cut into savings for his retirement. Ms. Drake  is now able to buy a new stove, while Justin from Harris County is  paying down credit card debt.   Scott is using his savings to help him buy a brand new home. Mr.  Woods told me that with his tax savings, he is spending it on his wife.  He may be the smartest of us all.   The tax cuts are even helping in Hurricane Harvey recovery. Judy from  Orange County shared with me how the tax cuts have enabled her to  replace household items destroyed by Hurricane Harvey, and Jason from  Baytown is able to now repair his home.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is making a real difference in the lives of  our friends and our neighbors in southeast Texas and all across this  Nation.                                time  2115    These decisions add up to tens of billions of dollars of investments  in our economy, in small businesses, in education, and in the  improvement of our lives.   Tens of millions of Americans are seeing lower payroll deductions  resulting in bigger paychecks, more retirement savings, bigger family  budgets,  [[Page H1261]]  and relief at every level. This tax cut bill is benefiting families,  job creators, and our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Michigan, Mr. Paul  Mitchell, for giving us this opportunity to speak about this wonderful  historic tax package.
