 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. I want to thank Mr.  Grothman from Wisconsin for authoring this resolution. I also thank my  good friend and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed  Royce, for his leadership as always.   Mr. Speaker, freedom of worship is a basic human right, yet we see  religious minorities all over the world subjected to persecution and  violence.   In Iraq and Syria, ISIS has forced Christians in Mosul to convert to  Islam, to pay a protection tax, and to flee or face execution. ISIS has  carried out genocide against the Yazidis, the Christians, and the  Shias. In Europe, we see synagogues fire-bombed and a surge of anti- Semitism across the continent. In Burma, we see government security  forces engaged in ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.                                time  1530    Freedom of religion has been a bedrock principle of open and  democratic societies for centuries. It is enshrined in our founding  documents, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in  charters of democracies all over the world.   The freedom to worship as a person chooses or not to worship at all  is a broad right that should not be restrained by a government or a  fanatical group. Religious persecution holds societies back, undercuts  progress, and is usually associated with a much broader assault on  basic human rights.   Here in the United States, we must make it clear that it is not  enough to just guarantee religious liberty to our own people. We must  speak out and act when we see this freedom, this liberty, and any other  freedom under attack anywhere and hold accountable those responsible  for human rights abuses.   In places like China, we see freedom of speech under attack. In  Chechnya, we see LGBT individuals targeted, tortured, and executed by  Putin's cronies just for whom they love. We see women's reproductive  rights under attack.   We must also speak out against attacks on our press, on our right to  organize, on equality for LGBT persons, and on women's right to control  their own bodies. This legislation helps us send a clear message that  protecting all human rights is a priority for the United States.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we all know that America's first immigrants  came here because they were fleeing religious persecution in their home  countries. It would be hypocritical of us to condemn current-day  religious persecution around the world and then to slam our doors shut  in the face of those trying to flee such persecution. America must  remain a place where those facing persecution or death can find refuge.   Mr. Speaker, I support this measure and urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend  and colleague for yielding and for his incredible leadership as the  ranking member on this important committee. I also thank Chairman Royce  for his work on this issue, bringing the bill to the floor, and truly  being a visionary legislator in shining a spotlight on the systematic  persecution of Christians around the world. It is frightening, it is  wrong, and we need to do everything we can to stop it.    Freedom of religion is a core American principle and a key component  for peace and stability around the world. There are too many examples  of Christian persecution. Congress must clearly condemn those  atrocities.   As cofounder and co-chair of the Hellenic Caucus, I have long  advocated for reforms in Turkey to respect the rights of the Ecumenical  Patriarchate and reopen the Halki seminary.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Boko Haram has wreaked havoc in  Nigeria, killing innocent Christians and Muslims alike.   Coptic Christians in Egypt and elsewhere face the constant threat of  violence, and we have seen some tragedies for this community just in  the past year. The number of Coptic Christians that have been killed is  truly astounding. They have laws now that, if a wall falls or any  church needs repair, you cannot even repair the church.   These are just a few examples of spots around the world where  Christian persecution is rampant.   Persecution against Christians and other religious minorities around  the world is a security crisis, and the United States Government must  remain vigilant in monitoring and response. It should be a unanimous  vote in support of this important resolution.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for bringing this to  the attention of Congress and, hopefully, the world.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, protecting human rights has been and must remain a  cornerstone of our foreign policy. Around the world, we see religious  liberties under siege in places like Iraq, Syria, Burma, and certainly  in Iran. But we also see threats to free press, rights to organize,  persecution for sexual orientation, and even reproductive rights in  places like China, Chechnya, and other places as well. So we must send  a clear message to the world that the United States does not and will  not stand idly by, and helping pass this measure helps us to say just  that.   I want to thank Chairman Royce, as always, for his cooperation. This  is strong, important, bipartisan legislation, and we should pass it  unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me supporting H. Res. 407,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our chairman, Ed Royce, for working with me to  bring this measure to the floor, and I thank Congressman McCaul, the  lead Republican sponsor of this resolution, as well. I am pleased to be  the lead sponsor on this resolution.   After more than a decade of good progress in the U.S.-Mexico  partnership, this year we have seen some things change course in a  troubling way. It is a problem, and it needs to be stopped. That is why  I offer this measure reaffirming our strong commitment to our  relationship with Mexico. We don't want anyone there to have any kinds  of questions. We believe in a strong U.S.-Mexico relationship.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank our ranking member on the Western  Hemisphere Subcommittee, Mr. Sires, and Mr. Castro for their efforts on  this resolution and their support day in and day out for a robust U.S.- Mexico partnership.   Mr. Speaker, it is hard to overstate how important the U.S.-Mexico  relationship is and the tremendous impact it has on Americans every  single day. Mexico is a friend and ally. Mexico is our third largest  trading partner. It is a country with which we share deep person-to- person, family, and cultural ties, and it is a country where we have  painstakingly cultivated a vibrant, critical relationship between our  two countries.   Over the past century, there have been many highs and lows in the  U.S.-Mexico relationship. Unfortunately, sometimes, recently, we have  had a lot of lows with talk about building walls and other derogatory  talk about Mexicans. We don't want that to continue. We want to  establish and reaffirm the strong U.S.-Mexico relationship.   In 2007, I became chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of  the House Foreign Affairs Committee. That was the same day that the  Merida Initiative was announced by Presidents Bush and Calderon, which  led to a new level of security cooperation between the United States  and Mexico.   That effort wasn't perfect then and it isn't today. The civilian toll  of Mexico's drug war is still far too high, and human rights violations  at the federal, state, and local level in Mexico remain a serious  problem. But what we gained from the Merida Initiative was an entirely  new way of collaborating with the Mexican Government on a wide range of  security issues.   Presidents Obama and Pena Nieto built on Merida's foundation, and one  of the results was a remarkable achievement in the last hours of the  Obama administration, which was the extradition of drug kingpin ``El  Chapo'' Guzman to my hometown of New York City to stand trial. Without  a strong U.S.-Mexico partnership, that would not have been possible. A  decade ago, it probably would not have happened at all.   And while we absolutely don't need to waste billions of taxpayer  dollars on a 2,000-mile-long wall against our southern border, what we  do need is to maintain our partnership on security matters with the  Mexican Government.   We want the Mexican Government to continue to reach out to us with  information regarding suspected terrorists. We want to say that the  Mexican Government will cooperate with us and extradite the next drug  kingpin to the United States, and it goes on and on. So we cannot  overemphasize just how important the U.S.-Mexico partnership is and how  it keeps Americans safe on a day-to-day basis.   H. Res. 336 underscores the importance of a U.S.-Mexico relationship  built on mutual respect. Mutual respect means building bridges, not  walls, between our two countries; it means recognizing the vast  contributions of Mexican Americans to our country and not classifying  an entire population as drug dealers and rapists; it means not singling  out an esteemed judge based solely on his race.   Congress has an important opportunity today to be the adult in the  room and let the Mexican Government and the Mexican people know that  our relationship with them is very, very important and will continue to  be important. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  measure. I am pleased that we have support for this on both sides of  the aisle.   I thank Chairman Royce, as always, for his cooperation and his  partnership, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Torres), my good friend and colleague on the Foreign  Affairs Committee, and a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me close on a positive note. I believe that it is  not too  [[Page H9826]]  late to reverse course on this latest direction of U.S.-Mexico ties. At  a difficult moment in our bilateral relationship, I am heartened to  stand here on the House floor and listen to my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle offer such robust support for the U.S.-Mexico  relationship.   I again thank Chairman Royce and Mr. McCaul for their help and  support of this resolution. What we need is to maintain and even  strengthen our cooperation on security and economic matters with the  Mexican Government. Passage of H. Res. 336 today is an excellent step.  Congress really needs to lead the way.   So I thank, again, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  supporting this resolution, and I pledge to do everything I can to  continue to enhance the very important U.S.-Mexico relationship.   I think it is important to state that this relationship is not only  important to Mexico, but it is important to the United States for so  many different reasons. That is why I think it is important for  Congress to reaffirm its support, strong support, for the U.S.-Mexico  relationship.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  supporting this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I want to, first of all, thank the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Duncan), who, until recently, was the chairman of the  Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. We will have him back on the committee  any time he wants to come. I thank him for authorizing this resolution  reaffirming the importance of the strategic partnership between the  United States and Canada.   I also appreciate the efforts of my good friend Mr. Meeks as the lead  Democratic sponsor, and again, I thank Chairman Royce for working to  bring this measure to the House floor.                                time  1600    It is only appropriate, after spending time on the House floor  discussing the importance of the U.S. relationship of our neighbor to  the South, that we also focus on the strategic partnership between the  United States and our neighbor to the North, which, of course, is  Canada.   Canada is our second largest trading partner. Interesting, Canada is  our second largest trading partner--and Mexico is our third largest  trading partner--with about $1.7 billion in goods and services and  400,000 citizens in both countries crossing the border on a daily  basis. Think about that, 400,000 citizens from both countries cross the  U.S.-Canadian border on a daily basis.   The preclearance process makes it easy for Americans traveling to  Canada to clear U.S. customs while at a number of airports in Canada  and arrive back home almost as if they were on a domestic flight. Of  course, our relationship goes far beyond commerce and tourism, and I am  particularly pleased that H. Res. 357 takes note of the extensive  cooperation between the United States and Canada at NATO.   Canada has been and remains a key U.S. ally in several international  conflicts around the world, including in Afghanistan, where Canada  employed 2,800 troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance  Force from 2006 to 2011.   I also want to note the crucial role that Canada has played in  holding Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his lackeys accountable  through both multilateral action at the OAS--Organization of American  States--and targeted sanctions. Most recently, I was very pleased that  Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland hosted the Lima Group in Toronto in  October.   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the U.S.-Canada relationship needs to be  rejuvenated, needs to not be taken for granted. We have to work at that  over time, and I think it is important that we all work at that.   As a global entity, the U.S.-Canada relationship should be a  relatively even one to manage. We don't want to have jobs at risk by  creating a trade war with Canada. Trade disputes between two big  neighbors are normal. We should not be escalating manageable  disagreements in a way that could hurt workers in both of our  countries.   So I believe that we should let all the leaders know that the House  is leading the way, and we hope that everyone follows Congress' lead  today in affirming the importance of the U.S.-Canada relationship.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H9828]]    Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say that this year marks the 150th  anniversary of the Canadian Confederation. So it is appropriate that we  are considering this important resolution on the House floor before  2017 comes to a close.   As was said by all the other Members, the U.S. and Canada share so  much more than just our extensive borders and daily commerce. We share  people-to-people ties that run generations deep and continue on a daily  basis.   Today, by passing H. Res. 357, Congress has an opportunity to show  our commitment to and gratitude for the U.S.-Canada relationship. We  also have an opportunity to show the world how two nations can get  along with miles and miles of continuous borders.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  resolution. I again thank Chairman Royce and the former chairman of the  Western Hemisphere Subcommittee for their work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
