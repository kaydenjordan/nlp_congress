 Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3373, as amended, the Sergeant  First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address  Comprehensive Toxics Act.   When we were debating the House version of the PACT Act 4 months ago,  I couldn't have said that. I am glad that I can today.   The bill is not perfect, but expanding healthcare and benefits for  veterans who were exposed to burn pits or other dangerous toxins while  serving our country is the right thing to do.   I come from a long line of veterans. My grandfather, Marines; my  father, Army; my uncle, Marines; I was in the Marines; my son, Marines;  my grandson, Marines; and my granddaughter enlisted this year in the  United States Navy.                                time  1400    I know exactly how high the stakes are when this country sends young  men and young women to serve. I know exactly how high the stakes are  when they come home. I know exactly how often we have failed to meet  them and give them what they need. That is why I helped lead the charge  to provide disability benefits to blue water Navy Vietnam veterans a  few years ago.   We were decades late in giving those veterans the help they need. My  vow then and now was to make sure that other generations of veterans  don't have to wait for benefits they earned while they were serving or  the healthcare they require.   DOD estimates that 3.5 million veterans have been exposed to  dangerous toxins in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 20 years. Some  of them are already sick and suffering from the health effects of that  exposure. They need help, and this bill will give it to them.   This bill will also make sure that the VA can actually give that help  to them, unlike the earlier PACT Act that could not.   I am grateful for the hard work of the Senate Committee on Veterans'  Affairs Chairman Jon Tester and Ranking Member Jerry Moran. They took a  flawed House bill and made it better.   There are several aspects of their work that make today's vote on the  PACT Act very different than the prior one. This is a better bill than  the one the House passed in March.   It reflects bipartisan negotiations and input from VA, which is  ultimately responsible for putting this into practice.   It incorporates the good work the VA is already doing to address  toxic exposure--namely, the scientific framework that the VA has been  using since last year to expand benefits to toxic-exposed veterans.   It removes certain provisions from the House bill that VA told us  could not and would not get done. It adds other provisions that would  make VA work more transparently to veterans and taxpayers, more  flexible, and more scientifically sound.   All of those things were missing from the prior House version. Most  importantly, the earlier version of the bill ignored the massive  operational impacts this effort will have on VA's  [[Page H6019]]  healthcare and benefit systems. In contrast, this bill addresses this  head-on.   To ensure that the VA has the staff capacity it needs to better serve  toxic-exposed veterans, this bill would: authorize 31 VA medical  facility leases; make it easier for Congress to authorize additional VA  medical facility leases going forward, something the committee has been  trying to do for decades; make it easier for VA to recruit and retain  the staff it needs to implement the bill; and give VA resources to  process claims faster using modern technology.   These changes and additions are critical to the bill's success, and  they give me confidence to vote for this bill without fearing that it  would be impossible to implement or risk breaking the VA for veterans  everywhere, those who are already receiving benefits.   Many of us are concerned about the CBO score for this bill and the  funding mechanism it contains. The total score went from $325 billion  over 10 years in the prior version to $681 billion in this version. I  don't criticize my colleagues for being concerned about that. That is  an increase of $356 billion.   That number gives me a lot of pause when I consider the strain that  rising inflation is already putting on American families. Anyone who is  trying to serve these veterans, it should give them pause, too, because  not only is it the veterans that will be paying, but it is their  children and grandchildren, as well.   However, only about $285 billion of the score is truly new spending.  The costs of expanding care and benefits for toxic exposure actually  decreased by about $40 billion from the prior version of this bill to  this one. The rest of the score is a result of the cost of war toxic  exposure fund.   The fund pays for expanding healthcare for veterans who experience  toxic exposure. That is reasonable. However, the fund is also a  budgetary ploy by the Democrats to take existing healthcare costs that  have nothing to do with toxic exposure and transfer them from  discretionary to mandatory spending. That is causing CBO's score to be  artificially high because almost $400 billion in costs that are already  funded by current law are being scored against the bill.   Even worse, this ploy would put even more government spending on  autopilot and limit our ability to control and oversee it, which is our  right under the Constitution. That is wrong.   Now, some of my colleagues will vote against the bill because of  that, and like I said before, I don't blame them. I am not. I am voting  for it because, as the Republican leader of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee and as a veteran, I know that, on balance, this is a good  bill that will help millions of veterans, servicemembers, survivors,  and military families. That is why I will be supporting this bill  today.   I have already thanked our Senate colleagues for their work on this  bill, but I also thank many Members on both sides of the aisle who have  introduced the various standalone bills that make up the PACT Act,  including Chairman Takano for his hard work and commitment to this  issue. I thank our staff because they also have worked to make sure  that this bill would come about, not only that it would come about, but  it would be able to be implemented.   I recognize the many veterans service organizations who have held our  feet to the fire every step of the way to get it done. I know they will  stay by our side every day ahead to make sure VA does it right. I look  forward to doing the work with them.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman), the highest ranking officer that serves in  Congress today. He has served with many of the men and women who will  benefit from this bill today.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy), who has served from the time of being in Congress on  the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks), who has actually served in health situations  in our military, a veteran herself, and is very aware of the things  that we are dealing with here.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Rosendale), the ranking member of the Technology  Modernization Subcommittee of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Ellzey), a Navy veteran and F-18 pilot.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  State of Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a gentleman who has served on this committee  and has understood these issues for all of his time in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), a gentleman who is very much in support of our  veterans.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   While I wholeheartedly support the intent of the PACT Act and intend  to vote for it, I am opposed to the precedent that the funding  mechanism in this bill sets.   Later, I will be offering a motion to commit that would prohibit  creation of the cost of war toxic exposure fund. Democrats are using  the fund to move almost $400 billion of existing VA healthcare spending  from the discretionary to the mandatory side of the ledger for purposes  completely unrelated to veterans.   We should not use this bill to create more entitlement spending. That  is dangerous, and it is a very dangerous budget ploy. It will put more  spending on autopilot. It will limit our ability to do our job,  constitutionally, of oversight of the second-largest bureaucracy in the  world that serves millions of veterans and survivors. It will hurt  taxpayers who are already suffering everywhere, from the gas pump to  the grocery store.   My motion to commit is simple, and I hope my colleagues will support  it.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of the  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  commit.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Nineteen months ago, when I took over as the lead Republican on the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, I told my colleagues that helping toxic- exposed veterans was my top priority. Today, I am proud to say that we  are delivering on that promise.   It was not an easy road to get here, but the PACT Act will make a  difference for veterans, their families, and their survivors.   Today, I am thinking of veterans like Lauren Price, Heath Robinson,  Kate Hendricks Thomas, veterans who raised their right hands like I  did. They did their duty, and they did it well. But unlike me, their  lives were cut short.   They were young, seemingly healthy adults who had endured a different  battle on the stateside. Their lives were changed in an instant when  they developed rare cancers in the blink of an eye, possibly due to  their repeated exposure to burning chemicals while they served  overseas.   Lauren left behind her husband, Jim, and five children. Heath left  behind his wife and a young daughter. Kate left behind her husband and  a young son.   The bill we will vote on today is in honor of them and the hundreds  of thousands of veterans just like them. Lauren, Heath, and Kate left  us too soon and would want us to do everything in our power to try to  prevent what happened to them from happening to their fellow brothers  and sisters in arms.   The PACT Act will grant their wish for generations. It will help over  3 million veterans get the care and benefits they are due before it is  too late.   We have made this mistake in the past. We don't need to make it  again. We need to move forward with this bill, and we will work in a  bipartisan way to make sure that is exactly what happens once it is  signed into law and implemented by the VA.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to commit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
