 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute and honor to an  individual who made a difference, Damon Nelson. When I think of Damon I  think of the quintessential staff person, and I think of three words:  duty, honor, and country.   Like a lot of us who grew up in the San Joaquin Valley, he was always  in touch with his roots. Damon was a person who obviously loved our  country and dedicated his entire career to serving, first in the  American military in the Air Force, and then later coming to our  Nation's Capitol to try to make a difference.   He was a problem solver. He understood that oftentimes cooler heads  prevail in bringing people together and that the efforts to bring the  art of the political compromise ultimately served the people not only  of our valley, but the people of our Nation.   He will sorely be missed in terms of his contributions, and we wish  him and his family Godspeed during this time of mourning. We thank him  for his service to our country.                 40th Anniversary of Marjaree Mason's Passing     Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this month marks the  40th anniversary of the tragic death of Marjaree Mason, a woman whose  life was filled with so much promise and purpose.   In 1978, Marjaree was soon approaching graduation from Fresno State.  She had a job she enjoyed, working for the National Economic  Development Association. She was committed to serving others and  surrounded herself with the support of family and friends.   That was until her life was cut short by a brutal death. At the age  of 36, Marjaree was heinously kidnapped, abused, and murdered by her  ex-boyfriend at his Fresno home.   To celebrate her life and continued legacy, the folks in Fresno  dedicated the Marjaree Mason Center, which was founded in 1979, to  provide victims and survivors of domestic violence a safe and  supportive environment. The center offers long-term safe housing, legal  assistance, educational opportunities, crisis support, and counseling  to victims and their families. It is in constant need. The center  offers long-term safe housing.   For decades, I have been working hard to end these horrific crimes  plaguing our community and the Nation. Over 10 years ago, Congressman  Ted Poe and I founded the bipartisan Congressional Victims' Rights  Caucus in the House of Representatives to give a  [[Page H9531]]  voice to victims of domestic abuse and other crimes that sadly occur on  a national scale.   The Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, a piece of legislation working  to improve responses to domestic violence, is one of the major  initiatives the caucus works on to protect, reauthorize, and expand the  needs for this sad occurrence around our country.   In my district, we have several organizations, including the Central  California Legal Services, Choice Women Empowerment, Centro La Familia,  and Valley Crisis Center, in addition to the Marjaree Mason Center  working nonstop to provide safety and support of domestic violence  survivors.   I would like to thank Marjaree Mason's family for the continuous  support and commitment to expanding the mission of its center over the  past 40 years. Former Sheriff Steve Magarian and so many others  continue to contribute to this important work that this center does,  for domestic violence is still sadly prevalent in every community,  affecting more than 10 million people each year in the United States.   We must continue to fight to ensure that no one in our valley and in  our Nation suffers the same fate that Marjaree Mason faced. We must  continue to work together to end domestic violence once and for all.                            ____________________
