 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:          Page 1184, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $474,054,999)''.        Page 1190, line 19, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $1)''.        Page 1190, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $400,000,000)''.        Page 1190, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $400,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Budd) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose a $900 million earmark to the  Gateway Project, an upgrade of an Amtrak rail bridge and tunnel between  Newark and New York City. This earmark is a downpayment. The project is  supposed to be $29.5 billion.   My amendment would do two things: It would cut spending by $474  million, and it would take $400 million and add it to national transit  funding.   Mr. Chairman, New Jersey canceled a project doing the same thing in  2010. That was when it cost $8.7 billion. Now the Federal version costs  $13 billion. This is what the Governor's office said, defending the  decision, in reference to comments made by Senator Frank Lautenberg:   `` . . . perhaps he can explain why he is insisting New Jersey tax  and toll payers fund 70 percent of a project, while billions in Federal  funding pour out of Washington for high-speed rail lines in other  States like Florida, which will pay only 20 percent of project costs.''   Here we are, Mr. Chairman. Billions are about to pour out of  Washington. If this earmark stands, then we send a clear message to the  States: Shortchange your infrastructure, and Washington will bail you  out.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, let's first get one thing straight:  This is a cut in infrastructure investment, authorized by the FAST Act,  which was passed by this body by a vote of 359-65. It is an authorized  program in the FAST Act. This is not, by any stretch of the  imagination, an earmark.   This amendment proposes a cut of $474 million from the Federal  Railroad Administration State of Good Repair program. This program was  created to address the state of good repair backlog in our intercity  rail transportation system. That backlog, by itself, is estimated to be  at a whopping $38 billion.   This program replaces or, frankly, rehabilitates any publicly owned  or Amtrak-owned infrastructure and will ensure intercity rail service  is safe, reliable, and ready to support economic and population growth.  It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, an earmark. It is an  authorized program.   Now, let me address the funding shift. Again, I respect the  gentleman, but I respectfully oppose what the gentleman is proposing.   We have already allocated significant resources to the new search  program, which I support, consistent, again, with the President's  request. We have chosen to allocate funding for other projects,  consistent with the wills of Congress of this House with the FAST Act  that benefit both commuter and passenger rail and make significant  returns on investment for our country, particularly, by the way, for  our economy.   So we are funding transit infrastructure to get our economy moving,  literally. And, as a nation, we have to address our critical  infrastructure assets, which is why this was authorized by Congress in  the FAST Act--I repeat.   This amendment would undermine that effort, so I would respectfully  urge a ``no'' vote on the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for  yielding. I join him in opposing this amendment. It would reduce the  total amount of spending on new infrastructure projects by $474  million.   The main criticism of this bill, as the chairman has said, is that we  ought to be doing more investment in infrastructure, not less. This  amendment would make the bill's shortcomings even worse.   The Federal-State partnership for State of Good Repair program can be  used for grants along the Northeast Corridor, the Chicago to Detroit  Corridor, and publicly owned rail infrastructure throughout the Nation.  These corridors include many of the Nation's passenger rail  bottlenecks.   This amendment would take away dedicated funds to improve passenger  rail service throughout our country. It is a distraction from the  infrastructure challenges we face. We should be finding ways to invest  in infrastructure: worthy new projects, expand mobility and  opportunity. This amendment moves in the opposite direction.  [[Page H7048]]    Mr. Chairman, I urge its defeat.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, a couple of things. I look at this, and this  still allows funding of existing projects and infrastructure, but it  also reduces the deficit, too.   And I want to quote the Eno Center for Transportation here: ``It is  obvious from the beginning of the timeline that the new Hudson River  tunnel project was conceived as a way around Governor Christie's  cancellation of the ARC tunnel project. Instead of having Jersey  Transit as the sponsor like ARC, the new tunnel would be under the  aegis of Amtrak.''   Mr. Chairman, this isn't about Amtrak funding. This is about funding  for a single project in New Jersey that the State, itself, wouldn't  fund in 2010. Amtrak funding for the Northeast Corridor account remains  untouched under my amendment.   We are talking about Amtrak funding for a single project. As the  chairman, himself, has said, a significant proportion of the $328  million in the Northeast Corridor account will go to Amtrak.   This is 300 times the size of an average earmark, when we had  earmarks. We have an earmark ban in place right now. There is debate  over this, but it is not fair with the ban in place that chairmen get  huge earmarks and the rest of us, essentially, are banned. There should  be one rule that applies to everyone, and right now the earmark ban is  what applies.   One-sixth of the non-aviation DOT money in this bill is going to  Gateway. In what universe is that reasonable?   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida has 2 minutes remaining.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Chairman, this is a lot of money, as I mentioned  earlier. The State of Good Repair account is funding at 18 times last  year's appropriated level. Let me say that again: 18 times last year's  level and the budget request.   I will close with one more quote from Governor Christie regarding the  decision to cancel the original version of this project. He said: ``I  don't want to hear about the jobs it will create. If I don't have money  for the payroll, it will not create the jobs. This is not a difficult  decision for me.''   The Federal Government doesn't have the money for the payroll either,  Mr. Chairman. We are $20 trillion in debt. Heritage Action for America,  Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, National Taxpayers Union, and Citizens  Against Government Waste are scoring ``yes'' on my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I yield back.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, again, I think we know this issue. I  strongly oppose the amendment, and I would urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North  Carolina will be postponed.              Amendment No. 33 Offered by Mr. Brooks of Alabama    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 33  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
