 Mr. Speaker, for over 70 years, the United  States and Japan have been bound together by a steadfast and loyal  alliance. Our nations have come together in decades of peace and  cooperation.   Today, however, our Japanese allies are facing mounting threats.  China is ramping up its expansionist efforts, and the tyrannical regime  of North Korea continues to develop its arsenal of nuclear weapons and  intermediate-range ballistic missiles, which pose a direct threat to  the civilian population of Japan.   In this increasingly unstable and bellicose environment, it has never  been more important for the United States to stand strong in support of  Japan.   North Korea, in particular, is guilty of grave human rights abuses  against Japanese citizens. Since the 1970s, North Korea has covertly  abducted 17 Japanese citizens from the homeland islands, some while  they slept in their beds. In addition to these 17 officially recognized  abductees, there are numerous other cases of missing Japanese citizens  for whom the possibility of having been abducted and taken to North  Korea simply can't be ruled out. The agony of not knowing haunts these  families, and the fear of abductions in the night from the sea has  haunted coastal communities in Japan for decades.    Every single one of these abductions is a horrific tragedy that has  caused untold suffering. Perhaps even more disturbing is North Korea's  heartless and transparent deception concerning the status of these  victims. For example, while North Korea claims eight of these abductees  have died from causes like suicide, heart attacks, and traffic  accidents inside North Korea, the regime has never produced any  objectively verifiable evidence of their deaths to the families who  just want to know.   The North Koreans have conveniently claimed that the remains of some  of the abductees were washed away in floods. They have even handed over  alleged abductee remains to Japan only for the DNA testing to later  show that these alleged remains do not match the identities of the  abducted victims. It is unimaginably cruel.   North Korea's treatment of Japan and its citizens is nothing short of  evil and an inhuman crime. America doesn't allow its allies to be  bullied. That is why I introduced H. Res. 620, a resolution that seeks  to carry out justice for the Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.  This resolution accomplishes three major goals.   First, it provides official congressional recognition of the horrific  abductions of Japanese citizens by the North Koreans. This includes an  acknowledgment that North Korea has violated the basic human rights of  these Japanese citizens and that only 5 of the 17 officially recognized  abductees have been returned to Japan.   Second, this resolution urges North Korea to take action on  rectifying these abuses. It calls upon North Korea to release all  foreign abducted nationals, including those from Japan. It also urges  North Korea to return the remains of all deceased abductees, provide  information about their demise, and make reparations for these crimes.   Lastly, the resolution reaffirms Congress' commitment to our alliance  with Japan and to American strength abroad. When America is weak, our  enemies are empowered; our allies are endangered; and our national  security is put at risk. When America is strong, we hold our enemies  accountable for their actions; we defend our allies; and we keep our  country safe.   The alliance with Japan is the bedrock of America's influence in Asia  and our security. Strong and unapologetic support for Japan is an  essential component of American foreign policy. We in Congress must all  speak as one and stand with Japan. We will not let such a faithful and  crucial ally be pushed around by a tyrannical and rogue regime.   I am incredibly proud to introduce this resolution. I thank  Congresswoman Tokuda for co-leading this bipartisan effort.   Stop for a moment and remember the suffering of these families who  have had their family members taken from them without any knowledge of  their well-being.                            ____________________
