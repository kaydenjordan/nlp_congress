 Madam Speaker, tonight, I will vote for impeachment. The  President threatened to withhold Congressionally approved military aid  to an ally under Russian attack unless the ally, a foreign government,  agreed to help the President with his campaign. That is an abuse of  power. The President refused to cooperate with Congress's  constitutional duty to provide oversight. That is obstruction.   As drastic and unwelcome as this is, inaction would not only give  this president a license to further abuse power and obstruct, but set a  dangerous precedent for all future presidents, that their misdeeds are  immune from consequences. Inaction would also seriously undermine our  system of government by relegating the Congress to a less than co-equal  branch of government.   As difficult as this is for our country, I believe this is the right  thing to do for our country.
