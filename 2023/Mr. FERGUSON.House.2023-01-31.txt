 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the passing of my  dear friend and former colleague, Mayor Bill Stankiewicz. Mayor Bill  was a staple of Troup County, and he was loved by everyone.   Bill served his community as the city manager, a two-term mayor, and  through his involvement on a number of boards, including the LaGrange- Troup County Chamber of Commerce, the Racial Trustbuilding Initiative,  and the Joint Development Authority Board.   He was an extremely dedicated public servant, and he took great pride  in doing the tough work to improve his community. As mayor, he worked  to reestablish the city's finances during a period of instability, and  he proudly worked to relocate and renovate city hall in Hogansville.   When I was the mayor of West Point, I had the privilege of working  with Bill on many projects for the greater good of our county and our  cities. He was a pleasure to be around.   My heart goes out to his wife, Mary, and the entire Troup County  family. Bill will forever be remembered and honored for his invaluable  service to his community and to this Nation. He will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
