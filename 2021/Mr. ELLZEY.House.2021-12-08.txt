 Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor today to  congratulate Mike Fletcher, the store director of the H-E-B in  Corsicana, Texas. After 27 years, Mike did something we all hope to do  one day, and that is retire.   Though not a Corsicana native, Mike has come to call Corsicana home.  He grew up in Waco, and lived there until he was about 20, and then  attended Texas A&M University and while attending school, started his  career in the grocery industry.   What H-E-B and Mike have done for Corsicana and the surrounding  community over the last 19 years cannot be captured in a 1-minute  speech. But what I can say is that Mike has served his community. He  kept the doors open, the shelves stocked, and the community fed during  the COVID-19 pandemic and the winter storm that hit the great State of  Texas.   He and his wife, Deedy, have been an integral part of Navarro County  since they moved there in 2002. Mike has served on the Salvation Army  board, the United Way board of Navarro County, been a member of the  Rotary Club, volunteered on disaster relief teams in West, Texas, when  the fertilizer plants exploded in 2013, and much more.   He might be retired from working at H-E-B, but he is not finished  serving his community.   So, Mike, congratulations on your retirement and thank you for your  continued dedication to Corsicana and Navarro County.                            ____________________
