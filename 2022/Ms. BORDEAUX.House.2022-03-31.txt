 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Affordable  Insulin Now Act.   Before his death, my father paid $300 for a 10 milliliter vial of  insulin that cost about $25 in Canada. Far too many Americans, like my  father, are forced to choose between paying for their medication or  buying food for their families. No one should have to make that choice.   Georgia has one of the highest diabetes rates in the country, and  this measure would provide my constituents with meaningful relief. I  urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6833 and lower the  cost of insulin.
