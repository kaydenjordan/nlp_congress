 Mr. Chairman, I am here to support the Financial  CHOICE Act, and for good reasons.   Under Dodd-Frank, North Carolina has lost 50 percent of our banks  since 2010, while three community banks have consolidated just in the  last month. Monthly banking fees have increased 111 percent.   As well, Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  which even the liberal D.C. Court of Appeals calls unconstitutional and  a threat to individual liberty.   Dodd-Frank has made the Wall Street banks even bigger and more  powerful; and Dodd-Frank has contributed to the slowest, weakest  economic recovery in 70 years, impeding access to capital and credit in  the market for small business.   Maintaining the status quo is not acceptable.   The Financial CHOICE Act will impose the toughest penalties in  history for fraud on Wall Street. It will end taxpayer bailouts for  Wall Street and allow your community banks and credit unions to focus  on serving you and your local business, which will help create jobs and  grow the economy. The Financial CHOICE Act means opportunity for all  Americans and bailouts for none.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, continuing to answer  Mr. Duffy about who opposes this bill, the Fleet Reserve Association,  which includes the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard.   With that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Lynch), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee.
