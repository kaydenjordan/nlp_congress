 Let me start by joining my colleague, the Democratic  leader, in his words about Lamar Alexander--a great Senator and a  personal friend, someone I am sorry is going to bring his Senate career  to an end in 2 years because he has done so many good things. I could  spell out many of those things, but one comes to mind immediately. A  few years ago when I was deciding whether to run for reelection myself,  I thought one of my goals would be to increase the Federal investment  in medical research. That is right in the wheelhouse of the committee  jurisdiction of Lamar Alexander. I went to him and his counterpart on  the Democratic side, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, and Roy Blunt  of Missouri, and we put together an informal team pushing for increases  in medical research. We have had amazing success. It has been  bipartisan, and it has been an enthusiastic effort all around. We  couldn't have done it without Lamar's wholehearted participation. He  was committed to medical research, and as a result, we have had more  than a 5-percent increase each year for the last 4 years in the budget  and appropriations for the National Institutes of Health. That is going  to end up creating more opportunities to spare people suffering and to  cure disease and to save lives than we can possibly imagine. That is  the kind of thing people expect of us, don't they, in the Senate?   The Democrats and Republicans will find a common goal and work  together to achieve it. Lamar Alexander was part of that successful  effort. I am going to hold him to it for the next 2 years, as I am sure  he will hold me to the same goal. I look forward to working with him  but certainly with some pain in my heart, as the Democratic leader  said, with the knowledge his career is coming to an end. He has been an  extraordinary public servant as a Governor, as a Presidential  candidate, as a Cabinet member, and as a Member of the U.S. Senate. I  am sorry for his decision, but I certainly understand why he would make  that on a personal and family basis.                                First Step Act    Madam President, I wish to say a few words about the legislation  currently pending before the U.S. Senate. Every once in a while--it  doesn't happen very often--the stars line up and the Democrats and  Republicans and the conservatives and the progressives and the  President and the Congress agree on something. I am not talking about  Flag Day or apple pie or whether Lassie was a collie dog. It really  comes down, occasionally, to something that is meaningful. We are in  the midst now of a debate on the floor of the Senate, which will  culminate probably tomorrow in some historic votes on the whole  question of criminal justice reform.   How important is this issue? It is so important that we rarely take  it up more than once a decade; that we sit down and look at criminal  justice standards and laws in America and decide whether we can make  them better and more effective.   Just a few minutes ago, my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, a  conservative Republican, came to the floor and explained how the State  of Texas engaged in prison reform and found out they could not only  reduce the prison population but reduce the incidence of crime at the  same time. That is what we are setting out to do at the Federal level  as well.   Senator Cornyn's prison reform measure, which he introduced with  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, has been a central part of  our conversation on criminal justice reform.   I had another part of criminal justice reform that I have been  working on for a long time. Three decades ago, Congress responded to  our Nation's drug epidemic by creating the harshest mandatory minimum  sentences in our history. Consider what happened next as we made the  penalties for drug use and sales higher than ever in our history. What  happened next was the use of illegal drugs in the United States of  America actually increased, just the opposite of what we were trying to  achieve. The availability of heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine  increased, despite harsh criminal penalties. Crime rates for Federal  drug offenders did not go down. In other words, longer prison terms did  not deter drug use or drug crime, but they did lead to an explosion in  our Federal prisons.   Since 1980, the Federal prison population has grown by over 700  percent. Federal prison spending has increased by nearly 600 percent in  that period of time. Today, the United States of America holds more  prisoners, by far, in prison than any country in the world. America has  5 percent of the world's population, 25 percent of the world's  prisoners--more than Russia or China. Our overcrowded Federal prisons  consume one-quarter of the Justice Department's discretionary budget.  This undermines other important priorities, like preventing crime in  our neighborhoods and treating drug addiction.    The largest increase in the Federal prison population is for  nonviolent drug offenders. This is largely because of the inflexible  mandatory minimum sentences. These mandatory penalties don't allow  judges to distinguish between drug kingpins, who should be our focus  when it comes to criminal penalties, and lower level offenders. That  isn't fair. It isn't smart. It isn't an effective way to keep us safe.   We also have to consider the racially disparate impact of these laws.  Listen, the majority of illegal drug users and dealers in America are  White, but three-quarters of the people serving time in prison for drug  offenses are African American or Latino. The majority of the users and  dealers are White, and three-fourths of those who go to prison for drug  crimes are African American and Latino, and the large majority of those  subject to Federal mandatory minimum penalties fall into that same  group of African Americans and Latinos.   As a result of mandatory minimums, the families of nonviolent  offenders are separated for years on end. Most of  [[Page S7645]]  these families are people of color. This has a destructive impact on  their communities and erodes faith among them in our criminal justice  system.   Most Senators don't come to the floor and say what I am about to say,  but let me tell you the worst vote I ever cast. I was a Member of the  House of Representatives, and it was about 25 or 26 years ago when I  voted for a law that established what became known as the crack powder  sentencing disparity. That jumble of words means that under this law,  it took 100 times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine to trigger the  same minimum sentence--100 times. This came to be known as the 100-to-1  crack-to-powder disparity. Under this law 80 percent of the people  sentenced for crack cocaine offenses were African American.   In 2010 I worked with an unlikely ally, then-Senator Jeff Sessions  from Alabama. He was a Republican Senator and a member of the Judiciary  Committee, and he felt strongly about this issue.   I said to him: Senator Sessions, 100 to 1 isn't fair--that for a tiny  handful of crack and a handful of powder cocaine, the handful of crack  would get 100 times the sentence as the cocaine doesn't make any sense.   We debated back and forth. I thought it should be one to one in the  sentencing. He didn't agree, but the day finally came when we had to  make a decision. We actually bargained in the Senate gym. I know the  Democratic leader referred to that gym earlier. We get a lot of  business done there. We were bargaining in the gym on the day of the  committee markup--back and forth and back and forth. Finally, the two  of us agreed that it would go from 100 to 1 to 18 to 1. I can't tell  you why 18, but it was a compromise. It dramatically reduced the  disparity in sentencing between crack cocaine and powder cocaine.   That Fair Sentencing Act passed the Senate Judiciary Committee, the  Senate, the House Judiciary Committee, and the House, and it was signed  into law in a very private ceremony by President Obama, which Senator  Sessions and I attended.   For the last 5 years, I have been working on the next step--a  bipartisan coalition of Republican and Democratic Senators to take the  next step on reforming our Federal drug sentencing laws. Five years ago  I joined up with another unlikely ally--Mike Lee, a very, very  conservative Republican from Utah--to introduce a bill called the  Smarter Sentencing Act. We had a problem. There was a Republican  Senator who didn't like the bill at all. His name? Chuck Grassley, from  Iowa, a conservative Republican. Coincidentally, he is chairman of the  Senate Judiciary Committee.   After a while, I said to Senator Lee: We are going nowhere without  Grassley. We have to get him on board if we are going to change the  law.   It took a year, which is just a few minutes in Senate time. It took a  year of negotiating for us to finally reach an agreement that Chuck  Grassley and Mike Lee and I all signed on to for sentencing reform.   We were joined by Senator Cory Booker in the last year or two, a  Democrat from New Jersey. After more than a year of negotiations, we  introduced the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, legislation  approved by the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 16 to 5 earlier this  year.   Around the same time, the House of Representatives passed bipartisan  legislation to reform the Federal prison system. This bill was  supported--listen to this--by President Donald Trump, cosponsored by  Republican Congressman Doug Collins, Democratic Congressman Hakeem  Jeffries of New York, and Republican House Judiciary Committee chairman   Bob Goodlatte of Virginia.   I didn't like the original version of this bill because I thought we  could do better and we should add criminal sentencing to prison reform.   Then we did something that is rare. We sat down, Democrats and  Republicans, and worked it out. We believed that we could come up with  a common bipartisan bill by combining the two.   The result is the most extraordinary political coalition I have ever  witnessed in the time I have been in Washington. The so-called FIRST  STEP Act--the revised FIRST STEP Act--is a bipartisan sentencing and  prison reform bill that is sponsored by 34 Senators--17 Republicans and  17 Democrats. It is supported by President Trump and a broad spectrum  of stakeholders.   Listen to who is supporting this bill on criminal sentencing reform  and prison reform: the Fraternal Order of Police. That is a good  starting point. It is the largest police group in America. There is the  National District Attorneys Association, the largest group of  prosecutors in America. So we have the police and the prosecutors, and  we also have the American Civil Liberties Union. Go figure that a bill  we put together could bring these folks together in common purpose to  pass it.   Our bill would reduce Federal mandatory minimum sentences in a  targeted way. We don't repeal any mandatory minimum sentences, and we  don't lower any maximum sentences. We would simply allow Federal judges  to determine in certain low-level cases, on a case-by-case basis, when  the harshest penalties should apply.   The bill also puts in place a recidivism reduction program and prison  reform that will facilitate the successful rehabilitation and reentry  of prisoners, which Senator Cornyn addressed just a few minutes  earlier.   Let me tell you a story about this man here. His name is Alton Mills.  In the year 1994, at the age of 24, Alton Mills was given a mandatory  life sentence without parole for a low-level nonviolent drug offense.   When Alton Mills stepped into that Federal prison cell with a life  sentence, he was stepping into a jail cell for the first time in his  life, and he was bound to stay there for the rest of his life.    I ended up being contacted by his public defender. She has this  wonderful name. She is from Chicago. Her name is MiAngel Cody. MiAngel  Cody contacted me and told me Alton Mills' story--how this kid growing  up in Chicago, a decent kid in high school, made a bad turn, got mixed  up with a drug gang, was a sales runner on the street, which is just  the lowest possible level, and on a third offense got a life sentence  to spend the rest of his life in prison.   I asked President Obama to take a look at this and consider  commutation. In December of 2015, after serving 22 years in prison,  Alton Mills came home to Chicago.   What has he done since then? He has become a mechanic at the Chicago  Transit Authority. He got married. He is contributing to society. He  has a granddaughter. He is working as a community college student  pursuing an associate's degree. If he hadn't received a pardon, Alton  Mills was destined to die in prison because of the Federal sentencing  laws that we are setting out to change.   The FIRST STEP Act would eliminate this mandatory life sentence for  nonviolent drug offenders like Alton Mills, and the bill would also  give a chance to thousands of people still serving sentences for  nonviolent offenses involving crack cocaine under the 100-to-1 standard  I mentioned earlier.   I am going to have more to say about the pending amendments, which  will be brought up tomorrow. The Senator from Arkansas is going to  offer three amendments that I consider to be poison pills.   After 6 years of hard work putting these bills together--Democrats  and Republicans, police, prosecutors, the ACLU, and President Trump and  Senator Durbin together on a bill--now comes the Senator from Arkansas,  who has introduced three amendments which I think are very destructive  to this bill. I am going to oppose all three of them, and I hope he  will think twice about them.   We have an opportunity to do something significant, historic, and  bipartisan here for the good of this Nation. We could end up reducing  the crime rate in our country and do it in a smarter way with  sentencing and prison reform. The amendments that he will propose  tomorrow--the Senator from Arkansas--have been opposed by groups across  the board--left and right, conservative, progressive, Republican, and  Democrat. They all oppose his amendments.   I am not going to get into a specific discussion about them until  later, but I wanted to let the Senator from Arkansas know that we are  hopeful that he will take a more constructive approach. If he goes with  the amendments that we have seen, we are going to have to do our best  to oppose him.  [[Page S7646]]    Some are going to suggest that the underlying bill doesn't go far  enough to unwind the harsh mandatory sentencing that I mentioned  earlier. I agree. But that is the nature of legislation. It is the  nature of compromise. It is what the Senate is all about. A Republican- controlled Senate is considering a bill supported by Senators from both  sides of the aisle, and we have a chance to do something. Congress  should make this bipartisan legislation a fitting ending to this year.  For all of the cynicism and skepticism about what Congress can achieve,  we can prove as soon as tomorrow, with one of the most historic changes  in criminal justice legislation in our history, that we can work  together for the good of this Nation. Our people who send us to this  job expect no less.   I yield the floor.
