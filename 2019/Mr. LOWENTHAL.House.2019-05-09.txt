 ``The President launched public attacks on the  investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence  adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a  series of targeted efforts to control the investigation. For instance,  the President attempted to remove the special counsel; he sought to  have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit the  investigation; he sought to prevent public disclosure of information  about the June 9, 2016, meeting between Russians and campaign  officials; and he used public forums to attack potential witnesses who  might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who declined to  cooperate with the government.''
