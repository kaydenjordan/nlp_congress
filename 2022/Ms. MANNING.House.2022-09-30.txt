 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share my appreciation for  local law enforcement officers in my community and across the country.   I recognize the sacrifices these brave men and women make every day  to keep our communities safe, but words of praise and gratitude are  never enough. I am proud to say I have backed up my words with action.   Last week, I voted to pass a package of bills that support our police  officers and increase public safety. Investing in our officers is  critical to protecting our communities.   We can increase public safety by ensuring that law enforcement  agencies are well trained to de-escalate dangerous situations, respond  to mental health and domestic violence emergencies properly, and make  sure that the right channels are in place to uphold justice for all.   That is why I voted to pass the Invest to Protect Act. This  legislation will provide Federal grants to smaller law enforcement  agencies like those in my district to recruit, retain, and train good,  accountable officers.    To the police officers and first responders in my community: Thank  you for the work you do to protect North Carolina's Sixth District.                            ____________________
