 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the House of Representatives continues to  investigate the circumstances of the President's interaction with  Ukrainian President Zelensky and whether he used the power of his  office to pressure  [[Page S5809]]  a foreign leader to intervene in an American election on his behalf.  The facts that are already in the public domain are so deeply troubling  and must be taken very seriously. I know that our colleagues in the  House of Representatives did not run for office to begin an impeachment  inquiry, but this task was thrust upon them by the President's alleged  conduct and the demands of the Constitution of our Republic.   Here in the Senate, our job is even more austere. We are assigned the  power not only to examine the evidence but to render judgment. We all  have a solemn duty to follow the facts impartially and let ourselves be  governed by reason, rather than by passion or by politics. That role  means that we have a responsibility to behave impartially, in a  nonpartisan manner from the outset. As my friend Leader McConnell said  during the 1998 impeachment debate, ``it's been my view that I don't,  as a potential juror, if it's serious enough to warrant a potential  impeachment proceeding, I don't think I ought to pre-judge the case.''   Yet already a few of my Senate Republican colleagues seem determined  to turn this serious inquiry into another partisan exercise. My friend  the Republican leader, here on the floor yesterday, made the sadly  predictable attack of calling the work of the majority in the House  partisan. Another of my colleagues, Senator Graham, said he was trying  to organize a letter of Senate Republicans promising they would not  vote to convict the President before the House even completes its  inquiry--before any articles of impeachment are even drafted, let alone  voted on, before a scrap of evidence was considered in the Senate  trial, if it comes to that. Senator Graham seems to be advocating  ``Alice in Wonderland'' justice--first the verdict, then the trial. I  hope he will rethink that.   Over the State work period, the Republican leader ran an  advertisement in which he declared: ``The way that impeachment stops is  a Senate majority with me as majority leader.'' That is a far cry from  what he said in 1998: ``not prejudging the case.''   We are several steps away from a potential trial in the Senate. The  House continues to do its work diligently, even handedly, with only the  facts in mind. So I remind my Republican colleagues in this Chamber  that committing today to vote not guilty is contrary to their oath to  do impartial justice. That is their oath. Instead of prejudging, I  remind my Republican colleagues in this body that you have a  responsibility to put country over party. Our national security, the  rule of law, and our democracy are at stake.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2605         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
