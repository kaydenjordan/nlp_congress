 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  582, the Raise the Wage Act. We must advocate for an increase in the  minimum wage, as stagnant wages impede economic mobility and are a  detriment to our nation's working class.   According to the Economic Policy Institute, the current minimum wage  places nearly 78,000 Texans at this unlivable income, while 118,000  Texans earn even less. The Raise the Wage Act will result in a  significant increase in the average annual earnings for Texans. In my  home district, this figure is estimated to increase by 18.2 percent,  which will make an immeasurable different in our communities.   Many people in my district are forced to work multiple jobs for long  hours to ensure food is on the table for their families. This  legislation will eliminate this burden on our working-class families.  The economy may be growing, and wages may be rising, but the benefits  of economic and wage growth are not felt equally. Individuals working  40 hours a week should be able to afford the basic necessities for  themselves and their family.   I proudly stand in this chamber as a cosponsor of H.R. 582, the Raise  the Wage Act. I urge my colleagues on both sides to join me in voting  for this legislation to promote economic freedom and equity for all  Americans.
