 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Boulder County  on their inaugural Juneteenth celebration this year.   In 1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation,  freeing millions of enslaved people. Two years later, on June 19, 1865,  the impact of this proclamation reached Texas, where the last enslaved  people were liberated when Union soldiers marched into Galveston to  deliver the news.   Over 150 years have since passed, and while there is still much work  to be done in the fight for racial justice and equality, we celebrate  the resilience of Black Americans and the long struggle for freedom and  justice that they have led.   I am incredibly proud that Boulder County is holding an inaugural  Juneteenth event. By exposing more people to the importance of this day  and educating our community, we have the power to make a difference in  Boulder County.   Thank you to everyone for putting the work in to organize this event,  and I look forward to celebrating the event with you.                            ____________________
