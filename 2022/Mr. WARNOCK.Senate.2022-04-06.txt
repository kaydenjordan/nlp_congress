         Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up       with America's destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at       Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched       the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence across       the pages of history, we were here. For more than two       centuries our forebears labored in this country without       wages; they made cotton king; they built the homes of their       masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful       humiliation--and yet out of a bottomless vitality they       continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible       cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now       face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the       sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are       embodied in our echoing demands. Before closing I feel       impelled to mention one other point in your statement that       has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the       Birmingham police force for keeping ``order'' and       ``preventing violence.'' I doubt that you would have so       warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs       sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt       that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you       were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of       Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to watch them       push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if       you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young       boys; if you were to observe them, as they did on two       occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to       sing our grace together. I cannot join you in your praise       of the Birmingham police department.        It is true that the police have exercised a degree of       discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they       have conducted themselves rather ``nonviolently'' in public.       But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of       segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently       preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must       be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make it clear       that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends.       But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps       even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends.       Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather       nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany,       Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to       maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T.S. Eliot       has said: ``The last temptation is the greatest treason: To       do the right deed for the wrong reason.''        I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and       demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their       willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the       midst of great provocation. One day the South will recognize       its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, with the       noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and       hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that       characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old,       oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a seventy two       year old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a       sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride       segregated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical       profundity to one who inquired about her weariness: ``My       feets is tired, but my soul is at rest.'' They will be the       young high school and college students, the young ministers       of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously and       nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going       to jail for conscience's sake. One day the South will know       that when these disinherited children of God sat down at       lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is       best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in       our Judeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation       back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by       the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution       and the Declaration of Independence.        Never before have I written so long a letter. I'm afraid it       is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you       that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing       from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is       alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters,       think long thoughts and pray long prayers?        If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the       truth and indicates an unreasonably impatience, I beg you to       forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the       truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to       settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to       forgive me.        I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also       hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to       meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights       leader but as a fellow clergymen and a Christian brother. Let       us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will       soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be       lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not       too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and       brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their       scintillating beauty.        Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood,        MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.    I yield the floor.
