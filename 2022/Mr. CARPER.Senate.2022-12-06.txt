 Before the Senator leaves, the Bible study that he has  referenced is one that Jim and I and a handful of other Democrats and  Republicans join in every Thursday when we are in session, with Barry  Black, the Chaplain of the Senate, and it has been hosted literally in  the hideaway of Jim Inhofe. So it is a home game for him, but it is a  home game for Democrats and Republicans just to share some time  together in prayer and faith and some of the challenges we face.   Some people across the country watch the news all the time--you would  think we hate each other here and we never want to work together, never  want to get anything done. Thanks in no small part to Jim Inhofe's  hospitality and participation and example, that is not the case.   So I just want to add my comments as well.   He is the two-time chairman of the Environment and Public Works  Committee and a great partner with me in reducing emissions from buses  and diesel engines and stuff like that. He is the lead Republican on  the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act. So I just want to say there are  some good environmentalists in Oklahoma, and on all the issues we have  dealt with, Jim Inhofe has been one of those.    Sure.    People ask me: What do you like most about being in the  Senate? What do you like most about public service? I like helping  people. When they ask me more specifically what gives me joy in the  Senate, it is that Thursday, it is that half an hour we spend together  just about every Thursday. I am always pleased to be there with our  colleagues--sometimes even work out in the gym together.
