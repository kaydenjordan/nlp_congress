 Mr. Speaker, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has transformed  the economy, delivering economic growth in the form of more jobs,  bigger paychecks, increased investment, and historically high small  business optimism.   Today, I rise in support as an original cosponsor of H.R. 6760, the  Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018.   I thank Chairman Brady for his tireless work over the last year and a  half to make this legislation possible, continuing to build on the  success of the  [[Page H9167]]  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by locking in those tax cuts for individuals,  families, and small businesses.   Today's bill makes permanent the transformational tax reforms  included in the legislation we enacted last December.   Mr. Speaker, locking in those important reforms provides certainty  and enhances growth. In fact, according to the Tax Foundation's  analysis, making these reforms permanent will create 1.5 million new  jobs, increase wages by nearly a full percentage point, and increase  the overall GDP by 2.2 percent. Those are facts.    Locking in these important reforms reduces burdensome complexity.  Because of this legislation, the vast majority of individuals and  families will choose the enhanced standard deduction and will no longer  need to do the recordkeeping required for itemizing deductions.   The alternative minimum tax, which requires individuals and families  to calculate their tax twice each year and pay the higher amount, will  be eliminated for close to 96 percent of those who have had to pay in  2017. A recent Tax Foundation study shows that a reduction in time  spent on tax compliance that is expected to come from the  simplification in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will, indeed, translate  into savings of $3.1 billion to $5.4 billion for individuals and  families.   Locking in these important reforms will fuel the small businesses  that fuel the American economy.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivered lower tax rates in a new 20  percent deduction for pass-through business income. Today's bill locks  in those benefits.   Mr. Speaker, now is the time to keep our economy booming and protect  the family and small business tax reforms delivered last December. I  urge my colleagues to support this and help lock in these benefits for  all Americans by passing H.R. 6760.                                time  0930
