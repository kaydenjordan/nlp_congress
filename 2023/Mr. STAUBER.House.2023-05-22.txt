 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in  the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 346) to establish a task force  on improvements for notices to air missions, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.         Not later than September 30, 2024, the Administrator of the       Federal Aviation Administration shall make the following       improvements:        (1) Complete implementation of a Federal NOTAM System (in       this section referred to as a ``FNS'').        (2) Implement a back-up system to the FNS.        (3) Brief the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the       Senate on a plan to enhance the capability to deliver       information through the FNS that is machine-readable,       filterable, and in the format used by the International Civil       Aviation Organization (ICAO) to promote further global       harmonization among neighboring Air Navigation Service       Providers (ANSPs) and provide users of the National Airspace       System with one consistent format for domestic and       international operations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material in the Record on the Senate amendment  to H.R. 346.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of my bipartisan  legislation that improves the safety of air travel.   NOTAMs provide current, up-to-the-minute data to pilots on any aspect  of their flight. Unfortunately, NOTAMs are often buried in lengthy  reports, conflating important safety information with more common  alerts. These inefficiencies have created some life-threatening  situations over the years.   On January 11, 2023, all U.S. domestic flights were grounded for the  first time since 9/11. The NOTAM system crashed. Old and antiquated, it  comes as no real surprise that the system easily went down.   Unfortunately, leadership at the Department of Transportation has  left me uninspired. Instead of focusing resources on safety  improvements and upgrades, Secretary Buttigieg has spent his time  retitling programs and systems.   I will tell you that no pilot cares what the system is called, just  that it works and provides her with the information she needs to get  her crew and her passengers to safety.   Mr. Speaker, I have been advocating for NOTAM upgrades for 4 years.  My  [[Page H2482]]  legislation, which creates a task force at the FAA with important input  from safety experts, industry professionals, and unions to address both  the efficiency and resiliency of the NOTAM system, has passed out of  the House in both the 116th and the 117th Congresses.   However, it is only after a disastrous event that this legislation  finally got the traction it deserves. We must stop reacting in  Congress. We must be thoughtful, considerate, and proactive in how we  legislate.   I thank my good friend and colleague, Mr. DeSaulnier, for his support  and his leadership on this legislation and Senators Klobuchar and  Capito for pushing the legislation in the Senate.   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation before another  failure of the NOTAM system occurs. Our pilots, our crews, and our  passengers are counting on us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 346 is a key step toward safeguarding  the integrity and safety of America's national airspace.   This legislation proves that Congress can rise to the challenges of  the day, and I urge all Members to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's leadership not  only in the Western Caucus but his leadership on very important issues  such as the Endangered Species Act. I appreciate his giving me the  opportunity this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the gray wolf being fully  recovered.   Gray wolves have never been extinct in Minnesota. We currently  estimate our population at over 2,700 gray wolves, while the ESA  recovery plan goal for our State is 1,400. In fact, Minnesota has more  wolves than the rest of the lower 48 States combined.   The Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations, along  with our very own Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, have all  agreed: It is a scientific fact that the gray wolf has recovered.   On my chart here, Mr. Speaker, you can see clearly the gray wolf has  recovered. The blue dotted line is the Federal recovery plan, and the  green dotted line is the minimum in Minnesota to reinstitute a wolf  hunt. The wolf population is way up at the top, well above each  threshold, as you can see.    Unfortunately, radical activist groups have weaponized the Endangered  Species Act to keep the gray wolf listed. This misguided effort is a  clear danger to our deer herds, livestock, and beloved family pets  across Minnesota.   We have the scientists, the know-how, and the experience to  responsibly manage the gray wolf, including implementing a hunting and  trapping season.   When wolves are above their ESA targets, which they clearly are,  Federal bureaucrats--unelected Federal bureaucrats in Washington,  D.C.--or judges in California should not be able to take away our  management powers just because of their ideological views or because  they want to give favors to radical activist groups. They should follow  the science.   That is why I helped introduce the Trust the Science Act with my  friend and colleague Representative Boebert to delist the wolf and  exempt its delisting from judicial review.   It is well past time to, once and for all, delist the gray wolf and  reinstitute a hunt in Minnesota as part of our local management. Let's  get the Federal Government out of the way and properly allow our State  managers to manage the gray wolf population.   Our way of life in northern Minnesota depends on it.   It is simply ``sumbumcheous'' to keep the gray wolf on the endangered  species list. It has recovered. Let's trust the science.                                time  2100
