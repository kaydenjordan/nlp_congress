 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for  yielding the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, before I speak on today's legislation, I want to take a  moment to express my continued deep concern and uneasiness about the  Russian hacking in order to influence the outcome of the 2016  Presidential election and the deeply troublesome response from our  President-elect.   American democracy was attacked, in 2016, by Russian hackers who  sought to tip our Presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. That  is not I who is speaking--that is the CIA, the FBI, and 14 other United  States intelligence agencies that have reached a clear consensus on  this matter. Yet, even in the face of the overwhelming evidence,  President-elect Trump has continued to sow seeds of confusion by  publicly attacking and trying to discredit our country's intelligence  agencies and the brave men and women who risk their lives every day to  keep us safe.   Today, intelligence officials are testifying before the Senate on  this matter. In one of his most alarming actions yet, President-elect  Trump has said that he would rather trust the words of WikiLeaks  founder Julian Assange--an accused sex offender, who is holed up in the  Ecuadorian Embassy in the U.K.--than the consensus of the Directors of  the U.S. intelligence agencies. When Speaker Ryan was asked about  Julian Assange, he called him a sycophant for Russia who leaks, steals  data, and compromises national security. Yet, America's next President  puts more faith in him than in the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies that  he will soon oversee.   This is not normal behavior by a President-elect, let alone by a  President, and we cannot allow it to become normal. I appeal to my  fellow Members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats--and  especially the Republican leadership--to reach out to the President- elect and ensure that there is a clear understanding about how damaging  these statements and actions are to America's credibility, to our  national security, and to the morale and responsibilities of our  intelligence agencies. I appeal to my colleagues to get him help now.   America faces serious threats across the globe, and we cannot afford  to have a Commander in Chief at war with the very intelligence agencies  that are responsible for keeping our country safe. Whatever his  motivation, President-elect Trump must clearly and unequivocally join  Republicans and Democrats who seek answers. We need a bipartisan,  independent commission to uncover the truth about Russian hacking, and  we need all of our leaders to support it.    It is time Mr. Trump's Twitter sideshow comes to an end. It only  confirms what many of us feared during the campaign--that he is  temperamentally unfit to be President. We must be united in protecting  the integrity of our elections against Russians and all foreign  influence.   Now, Mr. Speaker, let me get to the underlying bills.   I rise in strong opposition to this rule, which provides for the  consideration of H.R. 26, the REINS Act, under a structured process,  and for H. Res. 11, a resolution objecting to a recent United Nations  Security Council resolution on Israel, under a completely closed  process.   Before I get into discussing the merits of the bill, Mr. Speaker, I  would like to first express some serious concern with the process used  to rush this legislation to the floor. The deadline for amendments to  be submitted to the Rules Committee was 10 a.m. on Tuesday. That is 2  hours before Members were sworn in and before the 115th Congress  officially began. Now, it is true that some of the amendments that were  received after the deadline were made in order for consideration on the  floor. But, really, is this the way we want to begin the consideration  of legislation in this session of Congress? All Members should have had  the opportunity to review the legislation and offer thoughtful  amendments to the REINS Act. Wouldn't it have been something to have  considered this bill under an open process? If you hadn't wanted to  have done that, maybe you could have waited a couple of days before you  brought it to the floor so that everybody, especially the freshmen,  [[Page H115]]  would have had an opportunity to evaluate it, and maybe they would have  had some good ideas that they would have wanted to offer. But, here we  are, right out of the gate, limiting the process and prohibiting  Members from offering their ideas on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, we have a process for reviewing rules promulgated by the  executive branch. Congress should--and, indeed, can--examine  regulations. Not all regulations are perfect. There are such things as  bad regulations, and we should get rid of the ones that don't work.  There is no debate on that. We have the ability to override regulations  with new laws, and we have reauthorizations, appropriations, spending  limitations, oversight hearings, investigations, GAO audits and  studies, and the Congressional Review Act, just to name a few. We have  a process that can and should work, but, because my Republican friends  don't always get what they want, they want to undermine that process.   I don't think my Republican colleagues are really interested in a  thoughtful review of these regulations. In fact, I find it hard to  believe that this Republican Congress even has the capacity to utilize  the process that is outlined in this bill so as to consider the 100 or  so regulations--some of which are highly technical and would require  experts in specialized fields to analyze--that could come up in any  given year; but I guess that is the point. This bill would make it  nearly impossible to implement much-needed regulations that ensure  consumer health and product safety, environmental protections,  workplace safety, and financial protections, just to name a few.   It would be a dream come true for industry and the wealthy, well- connected Republican donor class who, for example, are interested in  blocking all attempts to rein in Wall Street, to combat climate change,  or to protect workers and their public health. One simply needs to look  at the intensive lobbying that has gone into fighting these regulations  and supporting antiregulation legislation like the REINS Act--groups  like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Koch brothers, the American  Petroleum Institute, just to name a few.   Industry groups already use their seemingly unlimited resources to  delay and prevent commonsense regulations from taking effect by tying  rules up in court. This bill is just one additional tool for the  wealthy and powerful to delay and destroy commonsense consumer  protections.   In short, this bill is not about creating jobs, so nobody should be  fooled. It is about rewarding special interests, plain and simple. It  is about making it more difficult to rein in Wall Street, to control  polluters, or to protect workers. But this is in keeping with the  philosophy of the Republican majority, so no one should be surprised. I  urge my colleagues to strongly oppose this effort.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me just say a few words about the closed  rule on H. Res. 11, the resolution condemning U.S. abstention on Israel  at the U.N. Security Council.   The peace and security of the State of Israel are priorities for  every Member of Congress. Let us not try to obscure or confuse that  truth. I can't think of any Member of this House who doesn't support  peace in the Middle East and a safe and secure Israel. We may disagree  about how to achieve those goals. Most of us believe that a two-state  solution that provides peace, security, and prosperity to all of the  peoples of the region--Israeli, Palestinian, and their Arab neighbors-- is the best option to securing a just, lasting, and durable peace.   I have always voted in support of economic and military aid for  Israel, but this does not mean that I always agree with the policies of  a particular government in Tel Aviv. Sometimes I have been critical of  the Israeli Government just as I am often critical of my own government  and of other governments in the region.   For the past four decades or more, the United States, under  Republican and Democratic Presidents alike, has strongly opposed the  expansion of settlements and the demolition of Palestinian homes. This  has been a bipartisan consensus. We oppose the settlements as a  violation of basic human rights; we oppose them as creating obstacles  to a lasting two-state solution; and we oppose their rapid expansion as  potentially creating a reality on the ground that, therefore, closes  any possibility of a two-state solution.    Since 1967, under Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan,  George H. W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama, the United  States has voted in favor or has abstained on more than 50 U.N.  Security Council resolutions that are critical of Israel, including  resolutions on settlements or the demolition of Palestinian homes. Of  the more than 30 abstentions that have been cast by the U.S. over  nearly five decades, only one was cast by the Obama administration-- just one.   H. Res. 11 does not precisely express that fact accurately. It  implies that the U.S. always opposes or vetoes such regulations when  that is hardly the case, nor does U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334  impose a solution on Israel outside of direct bilateral negotiations to  end the conflict. Some of us who are strong supporters of Israel have  difficulties with some of the wording in H. Res. 11 on a  straightforward factual basis.   Yesterday, in the Rules Committee, I offered an amendment to allow  this House to debate a substitute offered by our colleagues,  Congressman David Price, Congressman Eliot Engel, who is a cosponsor of  H. Res. 11, and Congressman Gerry Connolly. The Price-Engel-Connolly  amendment expresses the House's strong support for Israel, a two-state  solution, and direct negotiations between the parties to the conflict.  It is reasonable and balanced and is very much deserving of debate and  this House's attention.   Regrettably, the Republican majority on the House Rules Committee  rejected allowing that amendment to be brought before the House and  debated. Instead, it decided to begin this new year and this new  Congress with yet another closed rule--in fact, the second closed rule  this week with no debate, with no thoughtful alternatives, and with no  ability of the Members of this body to deliberate such serious issues  and choose between alternative proposals--just politics, politics,  politics, politics as usual.   I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and to please send a clear  message to House leaders that we would like to be able to debate  reasonable alternatives and amendments to bills, like the Price-Engel- Connolly amendment. If we don't start out the year demanding fairness  and openness in our debates of important issues then I don't want to  even speculate as to what the rest of the year will look like.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I hope that my colleague from Alabama uses some of that passion to  convince the President-elect to stop cozying up to Vladimir Putin, who  is no friend of democracy, no friend of Israel, and no friend of human  rights.   All we are trying to do here, Mr. Speaker, is to have a little  democracy on the House floor. People can vote whichever way they want  to vote. But the Rules Committee last night, staying true to form,  actually denied us the ability to bring to the floor and debate an  alternative, which we think is, quite frankly, more appropriate.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge that we defeat the previous question.  If we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule that will make in order  H. Res. 23, the David Price-Eliot Engel-Gerry Connolly resolution, to  provide an alternative viewpoint.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution again was blocked by the Rules  Committee, right along party line. Republicans said ``no'' to an open  debate, even though it complies with all the rules of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, to discuss the proposal, I yield 3\1/2\  minutes to the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee said that the  American people don't want business as usual. Yet, here we are on this  opening week and what we see is business as usual, more Putin-like,  closed rules coming to the floor. The 113th and the 114th Congresses  were the two most closed Congresses in the history of the United  States. Here we are beginning the new session with, again, this closed  process.   The Speaker, on opening day, made a promise to uphold the rights of  the minority.   Well, you know what?   That means that the minority ought to be able to be heard on the  House floor, that we ought to be able to bring amendments and  substitutes to the floor. Yet, we get rejected time and time again.   This is not the way the most deliberative body in the world should be  run. This is not the way Congress should be run. By closing down this  process the way the majority does, it does a great disservice to the  American people   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule. It is  not fair. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question  so that Mr. Price, Mr. Engel, and Mr. Connolly can bring up their  alternative to H. Res. 11.   Mr. Speaker, let me say, finally, that I am deeply concerned that the  institution of Congress has been undermined time and time again by this  tendency to be overly restrictive and outright closed. We are supposed  to be the greatest deliberative body in the world, but the problem is  we don't deliberate very much. Everything that is brought to this floor  tends to be a press release substituting for legislation.                                time  1345    There is no bipartisanship. There is none. There is no working  together. There is none. And that is unfortunate. I think one of the  messages of this last election for the American people was they want to  see things happen here. Not just whatever the Republicans want or  whatever the Democrats want, they want us to see us working together.   I served here as a staffer during a time when there was collegiality,  when Republicans and Democrats came together and passed appropriations  bills and authorization bills and passed major reform bills. That  doesn't happen anymore.   On the issue of regulatory reform, I think you can actually get a  consensus on regulatory reform. There is nobody in this House that  thinks the regulatory process is perfect. The problem is, when you  bring a bill to the floor that is so one-sided, that is poorly written,  that is impractical, we can't support it.  [[Page H121]]    On the issue of Israel, we could have come to a consensus, I think,  and spoken with one voice to show our unwavering support for the State  of Israel. But instead, we have a bill that comes to the floor that is  politically charged--I think that is very clear, based on the tone of  some of the speeches here today--but also has factual errors in it.   The frustration level has grown to the point where some of us in the  minority have taken to protesting. We had a sit-in in response to the  fact that we couldn't get legislation to the floor that said if you are  on a terrorist list, you can't fly, then you can't buy a gun, and a  bill that called for universal background checks.   We thought we had a promise to be able to bring some of this to the  floor. My friends could have voted against it. But we were told, no,  you don't even have the right to debate these bills.   I am going to say to my colleagues sincerely that, unless things  change, you are going to see the discord, the anger, and the  frustration build on this side of the aisle, and you are going to see  it build throughout the country.   There is a reason why people hold Congress in such disdain. It is  because they see this place not as an institution where we can solve  problems but as a place where it is all about obstruction or ``my way  or the highway.''   This is a lousy way to start the new year. Please vote ``no'' on the  previous question and vote ``no'' on this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
