 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6020, and I  thank the committee, both sides on this, for advancing this piece of  legislation to us.   My colleague and I from Massachusetts, Lori Trahan, have been leading  this fight around the country to preserve Minor League Baseball in 42  communities.   Baseball in these communities is threatened by this proposal by Major  League Baseball to virtually eliminate minor league teams in small  towns, from Massachusetts to Montana, in communities like Charleston,  Bluefield, and Princeton, West Virginia.   But why is Congress involved? You have to understand: For the most  part, Major League Baseball controls the destiny of minor leagues, and  they should not be allowed to bully these  [[Page H1566]]  small communities into submission. Our goal is to level the playing  field for these small towns and ensure that they have a voice in this  matter.   Minor League Baseball is a point of pride in these cities and towns  and brings jobs and economic development. It provides affordable,  family-friendly entertainment, and brings people together for an  afternoon at the ballpark and, hopefully, creating the next generation  of baseball fans.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is intended to show Congress' commitment to  preserving America's pastime in small parts of rural America, far  removed from the bright lights of major leagues. By passing this piece  of legislation, we will be sending a message that eliminating  grassroots baseball in these 42 communities is an unnecessary burden on  these small towns, jerking the rug out from under baseball towns in  rural America.   Look, there are many things in our American culture that should  matter. This particular legislation demonstrates that there are some  things in our American society, in our culture, that should mean more  than dollars and cents. Major League Baseball needs to think about  this.
