Madam President, the President's inauguration over 2  years ago was a historic moment. Though my candidate didn't win, I  attended it in my capacity here in the U.S. Senate and saw a lot of  people, but the one person I saw who was nothing short of remarkable  was Jimmy Carter.   The reason why it was remarkable to see the former President, who  left office in 1980--39 years ago--was the fact that most everyone had  counted him for dead. If you will remember, he was diagnosed with a  form of cancer that was supposedly fatal. People were talking about  making their last trip to Plains to attend his church on Sunday and  hear his last sermon. I thought it was over, and most everyone did,  too, but then something amazing happened. There was a new drug that  came along, and it turned out to be just the right drug to save his  life.   When I saw Jimmy Carter a little over 2 years ago, I thought to  myself: I never thought I would see him again, and I never thought I  would see him looking this good.   Those things don't just happen. Those drugs aren't just discovered.  They are the product of a great deal of work and research and  application.   I remember asking Dr. Collins at the National Institutes of Health  what Jimmy Carter's story was. He explained that early research at NIH,  which is the premier medical research facility in the world, had led to  some new possibilities in treating cancers. It just so happened that  Jimmy Carter's cancer was responsive to that drug. Others have been,  too, and I hope that even more are discovered.   The good news is that the U.S. Senate and Congress understand this.  Do you know what has happened over the last 4 years? What has happened  over the last 4 years is a dramatic show of bipartisanship when it  comes to medical research. Roy Blunt, from Missouri, is in my  neighboring State. I, of course, represent Illinois. He is the head of  the Appropriations subcommittee that funds the National Institutes of  Health. Lamar Alexander, from the State of Tennessee, is the chairman  of the authorizing committee for the National Institutes of Health.  Patty Murray, my Democratic colleague from the State of Washington,  serves in both the appropriations and authorization committees and  couldn't be a stronger advocate when it comes to medical research. We  have a little team together, the four of us, and we said we were going  to do something or try to do something each year.   Here is what we set out to do. We set out to take the appropriations  for the National Institutes of Health and give it 5 percent real growth  every single year--because Dr. Collins told me: If you do that,  Senator, then the people who do the research believe that next year  could be a good year, too, to continue their research, and they will  stick with it, and when they stick with it, amazing things happen.   So we did. I want to give credit to Senator Blunt, Senator Alexander,  and Senator Murray. I was happy to be a part of the effort. For 4  straight years, we added 5 percent real growth to the National  Institutes of Health. In total, when you look at all of the increase of  that period, there is a 30-percent increase in medical research in a  period of 4 years and more to follow--more to follow, if we get a  chance.   That is why, when we received President Trump's budget yesterday, it  was such a heartbreaking disappointment. He has given up in terms of  our continued increases in medical research. In fact, he wants to cut  $5 billion out of the appropriations for the National Institutes of  Health.   Each of us decides why we want to be here and what is worth fighting  for. I think medical research is worth fighting for. The team that has  been fighting for it has been a bipartisan team in the Senate, and I  hope they felt the same way I did--a feeling of real disappointment in  President Trump's budget.   I have to tell you that he believes his wall is the most important  thing on Earth. I believe medical research and saving lives are among  the most important things on Earth. As for cutting money out of medical  research--for whatever reason you are going to use it--I just have to  say to the President and others that you are in for a fight. There are  a lot of us who are standing up and representing patients that are  counting on that research to find a breakthrough and families who are  dealing with Alzheimer's.   How many friends of mine and how many families could I tell you about  who have some form of Parkinson's or dementia or Alzheimer's that has  changed the family dramatically? Can we and should we be looking for  more medical research to delay the onset of Alzheimer's and, God  willing, to find a cure some day?   We are reaching a point where this is going to absolutely take over  the medical budget of America if we are not careful. Shortsighted cuts  in medical research jeopardize those new cures for cancer, heart  disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and dementia.   The President is just wrong in his priorities--just wrong. Some of  the other things he has done in the budget are equally troubling.  According to his budget request, the President wants to cut $1.5  trillion from Medicaid--$1.5 million from Medicaid.   What is the Medicaid Program? It is health insurance for poor people.  Who are those poor people? In my State of Illinois, out of all the  babies born in my State each year, half of them are paid for by  Medicaid. There are low-income moms delivering babies--we hope healthy  babies--because Medicaid as health insurance is there to help them.   But that isn't the biggest charge on the Medicaid Program. The  biggest charge on the Medicaid Program--that health insurance program-- is for your mom, your grandmother, or your father. When they reach that  stage in life where nothing is left, when there is no savings and maybe  a little Social Security check, and they have medical needs, it is  the Medicaid Program that comes through for them.    If we cut what the President is suggesting, $1.5 trillion in  Medicaid, which of those groups do you want to reduce care for--the  mothers with their new babies or the parents and grandparents at a  stage in life where they have no  [[Page S1786]]  place to turn and no savings to turn to? That is not a good outcome.   Then there was the suggested cut of $845 billion in the Medicare  Program. Medicare is health insurance for the elderly. When you reach  age 65, you have paid into it through your working life and you have  that Medicare insurance plan. The President cuts $845 billion out of  Medicare.   Does Medicare work? There is one way to test it. What is the life  expectancy of senior citizens today, after Medicare, compared to their  life expectancy before Medicare? It is dramatically different. People  are living longer and more independent lives because Medicare gives  them quality care when they reach age 65, and President Trump believes  we should cut that program by $845 billion. That, to me, is  shortsighted.   When it comes to our health, is there anything more important? When  it comes to the health of our families, of seniors, of the disabled,  and of women who are about to have a baby, is there anything more  important than to make sure that turns out right? It is hard for me to  think of what it might be.   The cut to the Centers for Disease Control of $1.3 billion in the  President's budget is another one you just shake your head at. The  Centers for Disease Control shows up when no one else will enter the  room, when they are facing diseases that are life-threatening. For the  Ebola crisis in western Africa and the fear that it would spread  throughout that continent and maybe to the United States, it was the  Centers for Disease Control that stepped in and said: We are going to  tackle it. We will take it on.   They did, and they did it successfully.   We are only one plane ticket away from some of those diseases making  it into the United States. I want the Centers for Disease Control to  stop them in their tracks before they come to the United States, and  the President cuts $1.3 billion.   The SNAP food stamp program is another one--a cut of $220 billion.  This is a program that provides supplements for food for families. Many  of them are working families who just don't make enough money to get  by. I can't tell you how many food pantries I visited in Illinois where  the people who run it--many of them volunteers with churches and  charities--say: The people who are coming in to see us now are folks  who are working and not making enough money.   Some of them qualify for food stamps, and some of them don't, but  feeding America should be fundamental in this country; shouldn't it?  Shouldn't that be one of the basic things we pride ourselves on as  Americans?   Remember when President Trump spoke about the aging infrastructure of  America during his campaign? Even though I wasn't supporting his  candidacy, I certainly cheered those remarks. Infrastructure is  bipartisan. The roads and bridges in Arizona and Illinois and in every  other State all need help, and they count on us in Congress to come  through with it. Well, the budget that the President released this week  slashes infrastructure funding by 22 percent. When we should be putting  more into making a more modern and more efficient infrastructure to  build our economy, the President cuts it. He cuts 31 percent from the  Army Corps of Engineers.   Today, I had a visit from the Illinois corn growers. We are proud.  There is a lot of corn in Illinois, and we are proud of being No. 2 to  Iowa, I might add, when it comes to corn production. But do you know  what they talked about in addition to ag programs? They talked about  the locks and dams on the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers. Those are  the avenues of commerce for agriculture in the Midwest, and they are  old and getting older and falling apart.   The Army Corps of Engineers are counted on to modernize them, and the  President cuts 31 percent of their budget--one-third of their budget-- and 16 percent of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.   The President's budget completely ignores the threat of climate  change, cutting the Environmental Protection Agency by 30 percent.   Here is one that hits home. The President cut the Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative by an outrageous 90 percent. They did a survey a  few years ago and asked the people of Chicago, the city I am proud to  represent: What do you think is the defining characteristic of the  city?   The overwhelming response was Lake Michigan. That beautiful lake, a  part of the Great Lakes, is not just a source of pride, but it is a  source of good, clean drinking water and of recreation and commerce. We  know it is threatened in every direction, from chemical runoffs to  invasive species, and we fight to make sure those lakes will survive  for another generation. The President cuts the funds for that effort by  90 percent.   These are just a few examples of decisions made in the President's  budget.   Needless to say, I have saved the best for last. Though he has cut  everything I just talked about--from medical research to protecting our  Great Lakes, to transportation and infrastructure, to taking care of  senior citizens, to making sure that health insurance is there for  expectant mothers--the President needs $8.5 billion for his almighty  wall, this wall on our southern border.   We have given the President 120 miles of fencing--new and replacement  fencing--over the first 2 years he was in office. That is 120 miles to  add to the 640 already on our border. Do you know how many miles have  been built, as I stand here today, for the last 2 years that we have  given the President? None. It takes a long time to build these fences,  and the President is learning it the hard way. Yet he wants to take  money out of programs across the board on the possibility that they may  be built in the future--needed or not. Congress needs to step up--and I  hope on a bipartisan basis--to assert our constitutional authority and  to find a bipartisan way to put together a budget that is much more  balanced and that realizes the real values of America.                             Judicial Nominations     Mr. President, this week, Senate Republicans are looking  to confirm two more circuit court nominations, which would make a total  of six circuit court confirmations this year.   None of these six circuit court nominees have had any prior judicial  experience. Some have had very little courtroom experience at all.   Four of them have been put forward over the opposition of Senators in  their home State: Eric Miller, who was opposed by both Washington  Senators; Chad Readler and Eric Murphy, who were opposed by Senator  Brown; and now Paul Matey, who was nominated over the objections of  both Senators Booker and Menendez.   I believe the Republican majority is making a serious mistake by  abandoning blue slips for circuit court seats. They have set a  precedent that could affect each and every one of our States.   Already, the Trump administration has nominated a person for a Ninth  Circuit California seat, Daniel Bress, who has only lived in California  for 1 year since high school and who practices in Washington, DC.   It is absurd to see a nominee to a California-based seat with such  minimal ties to California. That is what the Republicans have brought  about by abandoning circuit court blue slips. It is a big mistake.   This week, Majority Leader McConnell plowed right through with a vote  on Paul Matey, President Trump's nominee for a Third Circuit seat based  in New Jersey. Mr. Matey had recently served for 4 years as the general  counsel for University Hospital in Newark, NJ. While Mr. Matey was  there, a patient safety organization gave this hospital annual grades  of ``C,'' ``D,'' ``D,'' and ``F'' for patient safety. The grades got  worse while Mr. Matey was there.   Previously, Mr. Matey had been a longtime staff member to New Jersey  Governor Chris Christie. He served as Governor Christie's chief ethics  officer and deputy chief counsel. Mr. Matey said he provided a rigorous  system of ethics training, monitoring, and oversight for staff members  in the Governor's office; yet it is unclear what steps, if any, he took  to ensure that ethics rules were followed. It certainly appears that  Mr. Matey's ethics guidance fell way short during the so-called  Bridgegate scandal in 2013. That is when Christie administration  officials arranged to close lanes on the George Washington Bridge as  retaliation  [[Page S1787]]  against a mayor who had not endorsed the Governor's reelection. The  deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, was sentenced to 18 months in  prison for her role in this scandal.   In addition to being a former staffer to a Republican-elected  official, Mr. Matey is a longtime member of the Federalist Society. But  just because a nominee meets the ideological litmus tests of the  Republican Party and the Federalist Society doesn't mean he has the  experience and judgment to be a good circuit court judge. More likely,  it is a sign the nominee will be an ideological judge.   New Jersey's two Senators opposed Mr. Matey's nomination, but the  White House and Senate Republicans plowed right through with this  controversial nominee.   Also this week, Senator McConnell has scheduled a vote on D.C.  Circuit nominee Neomi Rao. The DC Circuit is often considered the  second most important court in the land, and typically the nominees to  this court bring with them a wealth of legal and judicial experience.   Ms. Neomi Rao has virtually no practical experience in law. She has  never tried a case in court. She has never argued an appeal in court.  She has never made an appearance in an American court, and she has  filed one court brief in her entire career.   How in the world could someone suggest that this woman get a lifetime  appointment to the second highest court in the land, never having tried  a case, never having argued an appeal, never having made an appearance  in the court, and having filed only one court brief in her entire  career?   She was a political appointee of the President, working at the Agency  known as the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. When she was  there, she set out to rescind a lot of Federal regulations-- regulations, however, that might have been better left on the books-- that protected workers, the environment, and Americans facing  discrimination. She was out to put an end to those regulatory  protections.   She has been an academic. She has written a lot. In the year 2009,  she wrote: ``The President may also decide not to follow Supreme Court  precedent, and in the rare instance, may decide against the enforcement  of a particular judgment.''   That would be considered a radical statement by most standards. It is  a radical view of Executive power that Ms. Rao put forward. It flies in  the face of Supreme Court rules and decisions, where the final word on  constitutional interpretation was decided and established two centuries  ago in Marbury v. Madison.   Ms. Rao has also published a number of articles in college, in which  I can't even describe to you what she was thinking. They were shocking  and inflammatory writings on issues involving race, sexual orientation,  sexual assault, and date rape.   In April of 1993, this woman--destined for the circuit court and a  lifetime appointment, where she will use her judgment on a daily basis  to decide the outcomes of cases and the legal framework of America-- wrote: ``Date rape exemplifies the attempts of the nurture feminists to  develop an artificial, alternative world in which women are free from  sexual danger and `no always means no.' ''   In October of 1994, she wrote of date rape survivors: ``If she drinks  to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that  point was part of her choice.''   In September of 1994, she wrote that a group at Yale called the  Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Co-Op was ``spreading myths about AIDS.''   In November of 1993, she wrote:         Myths of sexual and racial oppression propagate themselves,       create hysteria, and finally lead to the formation of some       whining new group. One can only hope to scream,       ``Perspective, just a little perspective, darling!''    These are a few examples of writings, which are difficult to describe  in the fairest terms and inflammatory at the least.   While she wrote a letter to the Judiciary Committee apologizing for  some of these writings, what does it say about her values, her  thinking, and whether she should be in this legal position for the rest  of her life?   The bottom line is this. Ms. Rao has minimal practical experience in  the law. Her legal views are beyond extreme, and her personal views, as  reflected in her own personal writings, are deeply troubling.   I would like to say to the President and those who are in charge of  picking his nominees: Please, isn't there a good Republican  conservative somewhere in this area who has actually been in a  courtroom, who has actually made an appearance in a case, who has maybe  even tried a case, who has maybe even filed a motion, or who would know  a courthouse if they saw it and not on television? Is that too much to  ask for a lifetime appointment to the second highest court in the land?   This nominee may be ideologically perfect for somebody who decided  she was destined for this court, but this nomination is not a  perfection when it comes to the legal system in America. It is an  imperfection, which, if approved by the Senate, is going to be with us  for a lifetime.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 763         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
