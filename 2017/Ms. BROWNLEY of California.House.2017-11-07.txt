 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  2123, the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act, or VETS Act.   As we approach Veterans Day, a time when we honor the service and  sacrifice of those who fought bravely on behalf of our nation, we must  rededicate ourselves to ensuring that the VA has the tools it needs to  be the 21st century, world-class healthcare system that our veterans  deserve. One way the VA can modernize is by embracing telehealth and  using new technologies to provide more timely and convenient care for  our veterans.   The VA has seen tremendous growth and interest in telehealth over the  past few years, and we should continue to find innovative ways to  connect veterans with the providers that they need, no matter their  physical location. This will particularly help rural veterans, and will  help us expand access to specialty care from the medical centers to the  community clinics, and even into veterans' homes. I have seen this  firsthand at the Oxnard community clinic in my district, which is able  to connect veterans to retinal specialists and audiology specialists  using telehealth technology, making it easier for veterans to get  better care closer to home.   The House Veterans' Affairs Committee has also heard from many  veterans who have used telemedicine services. For instance, at a field  hearing in my district, Zachary Walker, a Navy veteran, testified about  the fast and efficient service that telemedicine can deliver to our  veterans, getting him in the door to his local clinic faster than a  traditional appointment.   Our bill is a commonsense solution that will allow us to further  expand on these telehealth services by permitting VA providers to  conduct telehealth treatment across state lines no matter their  location, connecting more health professionals with the veterans who  need their care.   It has been my pleasure to work with Congressman Glenn `GT' Thompson,  and Senators Joni Ernst and Mazie Hirono, to advance this bipartisan,  bicameral bill, which has received widespread support from the Veterans  Service Organizations and the VA. I urge my colleagues to support this  commonsense legislation.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        November 7, 2017, on page H8558, the following passage appeared  in Ionic typeface:
