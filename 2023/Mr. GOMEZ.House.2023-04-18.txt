 Mr. Speaker, here we go again. Republicans are attacking  one of the most marginalized, most discriminated groups in our  country--trans Americans--just to score cheap political points. Yes,  cheap political points because this is something from the top down,  from the head of the Republican Party here in Congress to each of the  States that have introduced anti-trans legislation.   It is especially sick when you look at the statistics. Over 50  percent of trans youth considered suicide just last year. Let that sink  in: 50 percent--not a fraction, 50 percent.   Yet, rather than address pressing issues like gun violence, the  leading cause of death for our children, Republicans are attacking  trans and other LGBTQ kids. It shows exactly who they are--bigots and  bullies. I said that once and I will say it again: bigots and bullies.   This isn't their first attack on the trans community, as I mentioned.  At the start of this Congress, my Republican colleagues threatened to  revoke funding for an organization in my district that helps trans  Americans find jobs and mental health resources. Oh, big conspiracy,  trying to help people with mental health issues and help them find  jobs.   If they think their attacks will stop me from supporting the trans  community, they are simply wrong.   Transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth want to participate in  team sports for the same reason as their cisgender peers: to be part of  a team, learn sportsmanship, and challenge themselves.   As the brother of an LGBTQ American, I find their attacks offensive.  I will vote ``no'' on this piece of legislation.
