 Mr. Speaker, this past December, America lost another  hero from our Greatest Generation, Herb Heilbrun.   Born and raised in Cincinnati, Herb enlisted in the Army Air Corps  after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He flew 35 missions during World War  II, where he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for saving the lives  of his crew after his plane was hit.   Following the war, Herb returned to Cincinnati, where he worked in  sales and real estate before being named president of the Cincinnati  Board of Realtors in 1970.   Herb's service did not stop after the war. Herb Heilbrun devoted the  later years of his life to traveling our great United States of America  with his best friend, a fellow Cincinnatian and Tuskegee airman named  Johnny Leahr. They reached out to teach students the importance of  respect, racial tolerance, and friendship.   Herb was truly a beloved member of our community. Always appearing at  veterans' events, proudly in his uniform, he passed away at the age of  100.    It was a privilege for me to call Herb Heilbrun my friend. May we all  honor him for his life of service and dedication to our country, to his  community, and to his family. May he rest in peace.   Earlier this year, I introduced a bill to rename a post office in  Avondale after Herb and John, and I urge the House to pass it without  delay.                            ____________________
