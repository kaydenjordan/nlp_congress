 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  legislation, H.R. 959, the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Reauthorization  Act of 2018.   First, I want to thank Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone for  moving this legislation through the Energy and Commerce Committee. It  is easy to see why nursing consistently ranks as the most trusted  profession in America. As the husband of a nurse, and co-chair of the  Congressional Nursing Caucus, I know the amount of dedication and  support nurses put into their daily task of caring for every patient.   An estimated 10,000 baby boomers are turning 65 years old every day.  In order to meet this increased demand for care, we need to grow the  largest group of healthcare providers: nurses.   Despite the importance of nurses to the wellbeing of patients, we  face a projected nursing shortage that will leave too many patients  without the care that they need. The shortage will affect the entire  healthcare system, so we need to do all we can to make sure that those  individuals are interested in this valued career path and have access  to high-quality education opportunities.   My bill authorizes funds for loan payback programs and grants for  advanced education, workforce diversity, and nursing recruitment  programs. This bill will expand our Nation's trained nursing workforce  so they can provide the highest quality care American patients need.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the incredible bipartisan support this  bill has received on behalf of the Nation's nurses, and I urge my  colleagues to support this important legislation.
