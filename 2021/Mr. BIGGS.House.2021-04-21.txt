 Madam Speaker, if this bill passes, the President may only  act if the Secretary of State allows him to act, and that is backward.  The Secretary of State should not be authorized in statute to tell the  President, the Secretary of State's boss, that the President may act.  It is antithetical to the executive powers as set forth in the United  States Constitution.   Let me say that again. H.R. 1333 gives the authority to initiate a  suspension of entry not to the President but to the Secretary of State  in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security.   But it is the President, in whom all executive power vests, who  should determine whether to suspend entry and not just in consultation  with or the permission of the State and Homeland Security Departments.   While we are discussing this, we have a crisis on our border, a  crisis created by this President. For months, he refused to acknowledge  the crisis. When he accidentally slipped and said it was a crisis, we  were later told he didn't really mean it was a crisis.   Well, here is the deal. You are housing illegal aliens in hotels.  That is the kind of crisis this has become. The situation is so bad  that the Biden administration has reopened and expanded facilities to  house illegal aliens who have surged across the border.   President Biden inherited a secure border and policies that were  working and, instead, has created an inhumane border crisis.   If he wants to solve the crisis, he needs to finish construction of  the wall; reinstate the migrant protection protocols; reinstate the  asylum cooperative agreements with Honduras, Guatemala, and El  Salvador; and remove the other incentives to come, like $1,400 from the  COVID package that was just recently passed.   He can bring it under control, but the best way to bring it under  control is to move immigration judges to the southern border to deal  with asylum cases that are occurring today, not the backlog. Those  people are already in here. Deal with those cases today.   Getting back to this bill, it is representative of an executive  branch that is willing to give over and cede Presidential authority to  Cabinet members instead of the President himself. This bill should not  be passed. It should not even be considered.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   When I hear that, oh, this bill simply is just trying to give a phone  call, well, then why didn't it say that? Why didn't it say that in the  bill? It didn't say that. It talks about access to an attorney. I am an  attorney. I did court-appointed attorney work. I did it all the time.   Madam Speaker, this may not give someone a court-appointed attorney,  but what it does is, you open it up. If Democrats don't think that  consumes resources, then I just wonder if Democrats have ever been to a  port of entry and watched people coming through and seen the secondary  inspection process.   This is going to bog down your ports of entry, and it is going to  lead to litigation. This is a trial lawyer's blessing, a trial lawyer's  dream, I can tell you that, because that is what is going to happen.  There are going to be mistakes made, and even if there aren't mistakes  made, there are going to be lawsuits.   This is not designed to facilitate border ingress and egress. This is  not designed to help commercial traffic. This is going to bog down our  system.   While that is going on, Democrats say this is not going to be a  problem. It will redirect and redeploy Border Patrol agents and Customs  agents to deal with this. That means it is going to really slow things  down, and everyone knows what that means. That means that all the  people who are coming are going to have an even wider open field.   In February, over 101,000 aliens were encountered. In March, over  172,000 aliens were encountered at the border. The number is going up.  It is not going down. It is going up. Do you know why? Because the  policies of this administration draw people in. They have done  absolutely nothing to slow this down.   Madam Speaker, do you know what the number one most important thing  would be? How about the President of the United States of America stand  up and say: No. We will send you back. Our border is closed. If you  want to come in, come in legally through the ports of entry.    How about doing that? Well, he has not done that. That is why you see  people showing up with Biden campaign T-shirts on the border. That is  why the Mexican President said this is Biden's border crisis. That is  why the El Salvador President has expressed the same. And that is what  Border Patrol agents also understand.   Ranchers and people in my district and those who live on the border,  that is why they will say: This is Biden's problem. He created it. He  inherited a solution and created a crisis.   The person who he has tapped to lead the efforts to address this  surge at the border has been all over the place, just hasn't been at  the border.    Madam Speaker, this individual has not been to the border  once, but the solutions are not a mystery.   President Biden has to stand up and make a statement: You have to  continue construction of the wall; reinstate the MPP program; reinstate  the 12 international agreements that were in place that were slowing  this down. That would have stopped it. The last thing is, move your  asylum courts down to the border to deal with current asylum cases.
