 Mr. Speaker, this morning, for the fourth time in the  history of the House of Representatives, we will read aloud on the  floor of the House the full text of the U.S. Constitution.   It is our hope that this reading will help demonstrate to the  American people that the House of Representatives is dedicated to the  Constitution and the system it establishes for limited government and  the protection of individual liberty. We also hope that it will inspire  many more Americans to read the Constitution themselves.   The text we will read today reflects the changes to the document made  by the 27 amendments to it. Those portions superseded by amendment will  not be read.   In order to ensure fairness to all those interested in participating,  we have asked Members to line up to be recognized on a first-come,  first-served basis. I will recognize Members based on this guidance.  Each Member will approach the podium and read the passage laid out for  him or her.    In order to ensure relative parity and fairness, I may recognize  Members out of order in order to ensure bipartisanship and balance.  Additionally, because of his long-term leadership on civil rights  issues, I will recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Representative  John Lewis, to read the Thirteenth Amendment.   I want to thank the Members of both parties for their participation  in this historic event. I will begin by reading the preamble to the  Constitution:   ``We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect  Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the  common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings  of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this  Constitution for the United States of America.''

The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, regulatory reform plays a critical role in ensuring  that our Nation finally achieves a full economic recovery and retains  its competitive edge in the global marketplace. Congress must advance  pro-growth policies that create jobs and restore economic prosperity  for families and businesses across the Nation and make sure that any  administration and its regulatory apparatus is held accountable to the  American people.   America's small-business owners are suffocating under mountains of  endlessly growing, bureaucratic red tape; and the uncertainty about the  cost of upcoming regulations discourages employers from hiring new  employees and expanding their businesses. Excessive regulation means  higher prices, lower wages, fewer jobs, less economic growth, and a  less competitive America.   Today, Americans face a burden of over $3 trillion per year from  Federal taxation and regulation. In fact, our Federal regulatory burden  is larger than the 2014 gross domestic product of all but the top eight  countries in the world. That burden adds up to about $15,000 per  American household--nearly 30 percent of average household income in  2015.   Everyone knows it has been this way for far too long; but the Obama  administration, instead of fixing the problem, has known only one  response: increase taxes, increase spending, and increase regulation.  The results have painfully demonstrated a simple truth: America cannot  tax, spend, and regulate its way to economic recovery, economic growth,  and durable prosperity for the American people.   Consider just a few facts that reveal the economic weakness the Obama  administration has produced. In the December 2016 jobs report, the  number of unemployed workers, workers who can only find part-time jobs,  and workers who are now only marginally attached to the labor force  stood at 9.3 percent. They number 15 million Americans. America's labor  force participation rate remains at lows not seen since the Carter  administration, and median household income is still below the level  achieved before the financial crisis, which is after the entirety of  the Obama administration.   The contrast between America's current condition and the recovery  Ronald Reagan achieved as President is particularly stark in that, 4\1/ 2\ years after a recession began in 1981, the Reagan administration,  through policies opposite to those of the Obama administration's, had  achieved a recovery that created 7.8 million more jobs than when the  recession began. Real per capita gross domestic product rose by $3,091,  and real median household income rose by 7.7 percent.   To truly fix America's problems, the REINS Act is one of the  simplest, clearest, and most powerful measures we can adopt. The level  of new major regulation from the Obama administration is without modern  precedent. Testimony before the Judiciary Committee during recent  Congresses has  [[Page H125]]  plainly shown the connection between skyrocketing levels of regulation  and declining levels of jobs and growth.   The REINS Act responds by requiring an up-or-down vote by the  people's representatives in Congress before any new major regulation,  which is defined in the bill generally as a rule that has an effect on  the economy of at least $100 million, can be imposed on our economy. It  does not prohibit new major regulation. It simply establishes the  principle: ``no major regulation without representation.''   The REINS Act provides Congress and, ultimately, the people with a  much-needed tool to check the one-way cost ratchet that Washington's  regulatory bureaucrats too often turn. During the 114th, 113th, and  112th Congresses, the REINS Act was passed multiple times by the full  House of Representatives, each time with bipartisan support.   I thank Mr. Collins of Georgia for reintroducing this legislation,  and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the REINS Act.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   During this debate, my friends on the other side of the aisle have  raised quite a few false alarms:  [[Page H131]]    If this bill passes, all important regulation will stop, they say.  But that is not true. All regulation that is worthy of Congress'  approval will continue;   If this bill passes, expert decisionmaking will stop because Congress  will have the final say on new, major regulations, not Washington  bureaucrats. That is not true.   Congress will have the benefit of the best evidence and arguments  expert agencies can offer in support of their new regulations. Congress  is capable of determining whether that evidence and those arguments are  good or not and deciding what finally will become law. That is the job  our Founding Fathers entrusted to us in the Constitution. We should not  shirk from it.   I will tell you, though, what will stop if this bill becomes law: the  endless avalanche of new, major regulations that impose massive,  unjustified costs that crush jobs, crush wages, and crush the spirit of  America's families and small-business owners. Think about what that  will mean to real Americans who have suffered the real burdens of  overreaching regulations.   Support the American people and listen to the major organizations  across the country, which I include in the Record, who support H.R. 26,  the REINS Act.   Support the American people.

Hon. Doug Collins,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Collins: Serious regulatory reform is       needed to revitalize entrepreneurship, small business growth,       our economy, and quality job creation. Therefore, the Small       Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) strongly       supports the Regulations from the Executive In Need of       Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017.        U.S. entrepreneurship and startup activity are in a frail       state. While economic uncertainty and difficulties accessing       capital present barriers to new business formation, excessive       government regulation drives uncertainty and creates new       obstacles. When the policy ecosystem becomes noxious for       startups and small businesses, our entire economy suffers.       For existing businesses, overregulation is driving costs       higher and undermining confidence, investment and growth. The       system is out-of-control, and common sense tools and       solutions are needed to rein in the explosive growth of       federal red tape.        The REINS Act requires that Congress take an up-or-down       vote on every new major rule--defined as having an economic       impact of $100 million or more--before such a rule could be       enforced. This substantive regulatory reform measure would       serve as an important check on the regulatory system, and       have a positive effect in terms of how regulation affects       small businesses, and therefore, consumers, America's       workforce and the economy.        The REINS Act will bring needed accountability to our       nation's regulatory system, and SBE Council thanks you for       your leadership in spearheading this important legislative       effort.            Sincerely,                                                    Karen Kerrigan,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                                    National Roofing                                         Contractors Association,                                    Washington, DC, January 3, 2017.      To All Members of the House of Representatives.        Dear Representative, The National Roofing Contractors       Association (NRCA) strongly supports the Regulations from the       Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act and urges you to       support this legislation when it comes to the House floor for       a vote.        Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the nation's oldest       trade associations and the voice of professional roofing       contractors worldwide. NRCA has about 3,500 contractors in       all 50 states who are typically small, privately held       companies with the average member employing 45 people and       attaining sales of about $4.5 million per year.        The roofing industry has faced an avalanche of new       regulations from numerous government agencies in recent       years. The cumulative burden of often counterproductive       regulations is highly disruptive to entrepreneurs who seek to       start or grow businesses that provide high-quality jobs. Most       important, federal agencies have failed to work with industry       representatives to provide greater flexibility for employers       in achieving regulatory goals and minimizing adverse impacts       on economic growth and job creation.        NRCA strongly supports regulatory reform to provide small       and midsized businesses with much-needed relief from       burdensome regulations, and the REINS Act is a key component       of regulatory relief. It would require Congress to approve,       with an up-or-down vote, any new major regulation issued by a       federal agency before the regulation would become effective.       Under the REINS Act, a major regulation is defined as any       rule that is estimated to have an economic impact of at least       $100 million on the private sector; would result in a major       increase in costs or prices; and would have significant       adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,       productivity or U.S. competitiveness.        NRCA believes the REINS Act, by requiring major regulations       undergo a vote in Congress to become effective, would       substantially increase accountability among federal agencies       seeking to issue new regulations. This legislation would help       provide employers in the roofing industry with the certainty       they need to invest in their businesses and create more jobs.        NRCA supports the REINS Act and urges you to vote for this       legislation in the House. If you have any questions or need       more information, please contact NRCA's Washington, D.C.,       office.                                                  Dennis Conway,                                 Commercial Roofers Inc., Las Vegas,      NRCA Chairman of the Board.                                   ____                                                 Associated Builders                                           and Contractors, Inc.,                                    Washington, DC, January 4, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of Associated Builders and       Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry trade       association with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000       chapter members, I am writing in regard to the Regulations       from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017       (H.R. 26) introduced by Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) as well as       the Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017 (H.R. 21) introduced by       Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA).        From 2009 to present, the federal government imposed nearly       $900 billion in regulatory costs on the American people which       requires billions of hours of paperwork. Many of these       regulations have been or will be imposed on the construction       industry. ABC is committed to reforming the broken federal       regulatory process and ensuring industry stakeholders' voices       are heard and rights are protected. ABC supports increased       transparency and opportunities for regulatory oversight by       Congress and ultimately, the American people.        The Obama administration issued numerous rulemakings that       detrimentally impact the construction industry. In some       cases, these regulations are based on conjecture and       speculation, lacking foundation in sound scientific analysis.       For the construction industry, unjustified and unnecessary       regulations translate to higher costs, which are then passed       along to the consumer or lead to construction projects being       priced out of the market. This chain reaction ultimately       results in fewer projects, and hinders businesses' ability to       hire and expand.        ABC members understand the value of standards and       regulations when they are based on solid evidence, with       appropriate consideration paid to implementation costs and       input from the business community. Federal agencies must be       held accountable for full compliance with existing rulemaking       statutes and requirements when promulgating regulations to       ensure they are necessary, current and cost-effective for       businesses to implement.        ABC opposes unnecessary, burdensome and costly regulations       resulting from the efforts of Washington bureaucrats who have       little accountability for their actions. H.R. 26 will help to       bring greater accountability to the rulemaking process as it       would require any executive branch rule or regulation with an       annual economic impact of $100 million or more to come before       Congress for an up-or-down vote before being enacted.       Moreover, H.R. 21 will further enhance congressional       oversight of the overreaching regulations often issued during       the final months of a president's term and help to revive the       division of powers.        Thank you for your attention on this important matter and       we urge the House to pass the Regulations from the Executive       in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017 and Midnight Rules       Relief Act of 2017 when they come to the floor for a vote.            Sincerely,                                             Kristen Swearingen,                                       Vice President of Legislative                                               & Political Affairs.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Subparagraph (A) of section 804(2) of title 5, United       States Code, as proposed to be amended to read by section 3       of the bill, is amended to read as follows:        ``(A) an annual cost on the economy of $100,000,000 or       more, adjusted annually for inflation;''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I offer this manager's amendment to assure that, just as the REINS  Act strengthens Congress' check on rules that impose major new costs on  the economy, it does not unduly delay the effectiveness of major new  deregulatory actions, those that alleviate regulatory burdens of $100  million or more.   When first introduced in the 112th Congress, the REINS Act  incorporated the definition of major rule in the underlying  Congressional Review Act--generally, a rule that has ``an annual effect  on the economy of $100,000,000 or more.''   This was done in the interest of consistency with prior terminology,  and it  [[Page H135]]  swept in both actions that imposed costs and actions that lifted costs.  But, especially after the regulatory onslaught we have witnessed during  the Obama administration, it is time to revise that definition.   We should assure that the REINS Act focuses Congress' highest  attention on the rules that hurt the economy the most: those that  impose $100 million or more in costs per year. We should likewise make  sure that the REINS Act does not impose additional hurdles in the way  of the most important and desperately needed deregulatory actions:  those that free the economy of $100 million or more in annual  regulatory burdens. A deregulatory action with that level of economic  effect is one that Congress should be encouraging, not slowing down.   This refinement of the REINS Act's major rule definition is also  needed to assure consistency with the major Administrative Procedure  Act reform legislation the House is due to consider next week, the  Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. That measure already modernizes  the major rule standard for APA purposes to $100 million or more in  annual costs imposed on the economy. The REINS Act should mirror it.   I urge my colleagues to support this manager's amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time  only to urge my colleagues to support this important amendment and not  lose the opportunity to benefit from deregulatory reforms that will  grow our economy and save America's economy hundreds of millions of  dollars. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Messer    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in  House Report 115-1.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for  offering this amendment, and I rise in support of it.   The cumulative burden of Federal regulation will surely be reduced by  the REINS Act, but that burden has two elements: the burden being added  by new regulations and the burden already there.   This amendment adds a useful provision to the REINS Act to address  the elimination of unnecessary burdens already in the Code of Federal  Regulations. It does so, moreover, in a manner that parallels  President-elect Trump's promise to pursue a policy of one-in/two-out  when it comes to new regulatory actions by his administration.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   On the floor of this House in 2011, the President of the United  States promised the American people ``to reduce barriers to growth and  investment . . . when we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on  businesses, we will fix them.''   But, Mr. Speaker, those were just President Obama's words. His  actions were starkly different. Throughout the entire 8 years of the  Obama administration, a flood of new, major regulations has been  burying America's job creators and households at record levels; and to  make matters worse, when Congress declined to legislate the President's  misguided policies for him, he increasingly resorted to unilateral  regulatory actions to legislate by executive fiat.   It is time to say, ``Never again.'' The REINS Act, in one fell swoop,  puts a stop to abuses like President Obama's and assures that  Congress--the body to which the Constitution assigns the power to  legislate--has the necessary tools to block the most overreaching  [[Page H173]]  regulations and mandates on the American people.   This motion to recommit seeks only to distract from the urgent need  to reform our regulatory system and reduce unnecessary burdens on the  public. When health care reform regulations are adopted, they should be  adopted with the approval of this body.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, reject this motion  to recommit, and show America that Congress can act for the good of job  creators and all Americans who desperately want and need jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at noon tomorrow, and further  when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on Monday,  January 9, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate  and 2 p.m. for legislative business.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
