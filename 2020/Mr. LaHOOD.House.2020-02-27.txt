 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor the life  of my Jacksonville office director, Barb Baker, who suddenly passed  away earlier this month.   Hired in 2002 by then-Congressman Ray LaHood, Barb epitomized what it  means to be a public servant working for the constituents of Illinois'  18th Congressional District for the last 18 years. She was an  incredible asset to our constituents and a constant presence in the  Jacksonville community. She helped and assisted so many people in  Jacksonville and throughout central Illinois.   Barb was also the past president of the Sunrise Rotary Club,  receiving the Paul Harris Fellowship Award. She was past president of  the Pilot Club, the Morgan County Republican Women's Club, the Illinois  Association of Court Clerks, and had served as treasurer for the City  of Jacksonville Park System Board.   Barb blessed the Jacksonville community and our office with a spirit  of warmth and decency few could rival. She leaves behind an indelible  mark on Jacksonville and central Illinois as a selfless person deeply  committed to her family, her faith, and her community.   Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, Barb was an incredible daughter, wife,  mother, and grandmother.   We will miss Barb dearly, and I ask you to continue to keep her and  her family in your prayers.                            ____________________
