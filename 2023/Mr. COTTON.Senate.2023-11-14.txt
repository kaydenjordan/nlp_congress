 Mr. President, since Joe Biden took office, Iran and its  proxies have attacked American troops in the Middle East at least 135  times. Let me say that again: 135 attacks on American troops since  January 2021. What is worse is that 52 of those attacks have happened  in the last month since Hamas conducted its murderous rampage in its  ongoing war against Israel. These rocket and drone attacks against  American bases in Iraq and Syria have caused at least 56 servicemember  injuries, 25 traumatic brain injuries, and 2 Americans have died  because of these attacks.   Just like they have been for years, these attacks are financed by  Iran, Israel's greatest enemy. These attacks--let's be clear--are meant  to kill Americans and to increase the conflict and the violence in the  Middle East.   So what has President Biden done in response to these attacks? Has he  punished Iran and its proxies for killing Americans? Has he made it  clear that the United States will not tolerate these attacks in the  future? No, not even close.   Consider the Biden administration has also failed to enforce oil  sanctions on Iran, giving them over $90 billion, and now President  Biden is, reportedly, once again, considering the release of the  remaining $10 billion Iran is owed as part of its hostage exchange.  What kind of message does it send to the people attacking our troops to  give them another $10 billion more to fund their activities against the  United States and Israel?   In fact, since the terrible atrocity of October 7, Joe Biden has not  changed his Iran policy in a single way. Of the 135 attacks on  Americans, the Biden administration has hit back fewer than 10 times.  Think about that; 135 times they hit us, fewer than 10 times did we hit  them back. When the attacks against Americans increased in October,  President Biden didn't even authorize a response for 9 days. It took at  least 13 attacks on Americans for President Biden to finally react. And  what did he do? The bare minimum, striking empty weapons storage  facilities in eastern Syria.   After these strikes, Secretary Blinken said:         My warning to the Ayatollah was that if they continue to       move against those troops, we will respond, and he should be       prepared.    Well, it is not surprising that shooting a bunch of empty warehouses  doesn't scare Iran. In fact, it emboldened them in the form of 22 more  attacks. That is right. Proxies attacked American troops' positions 22  more times after that initial pathetic response.   When Secretary Austin announced those strikes, he said:         The United States does not seek conflict and has no       intention nor desire to engage in further hostilities.    Well, Lloyd Austin and Joe Biden may not seek conflict, but Iran  does. And it will continue to try to kill our troops until they face  real consequences, until they are scared straight.   On Sunday, we finally did hit back again, but, again, we didn't even  try to hold the real bad guys accountable; instead, the administration,  once again, shot only at expendable proxies. Iran obviously was not  deterred by this latest pathetic response. How do we know that? Once  again, these proxies have committed four more attacks against Americans  since Sunday.   Iran has had a proxy strategy for decades. It uses groups like Hamas  and Hezbollah and militias in Iraq and Syria to deny responsibility for  its campaign of terror against Israel and the United States. When we  kill their proxies, all we do is validate their proxy strategy.   Iran will fight to the last Arab, but Iran will not fight if we hold  the things at risk that they hold most dear: their shock troops in the  Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, their Quds Force or, if necessary,  sites and facilities in Iran itself.   The United States needs Iran to know that we will not tolerate these  attacks. We need to make sure Iran knows that we will not tolerate  these attacks and that any attacks by Iran's proxies will be treated as  an attack by Iran on the United States and be met with devastating  consequences.   That is one reason I will be introducing legislation later this week  that would strengthen sanctions against the Iranian transfer of  missiles and drone technologies to terrorists and even other nations  like Russia, which uses them in its war against Ukraine.   It will also stop Iran from developing the kind of long-range  missiles that can threaten the U.S. homeland because, again, if we let  Iran continue to shoot at American troops in the Middle East without  shooting back at the Iranians who are directing those attacks, what  will they do if they get their hands on missiles that can target  America? What will they do if they get their hands on a nuclear weapon?   It is time, today, to make Iran, once again, fear the United States  before more Americans die.   I yield the floor.   (Mr. REED assumed the Chair.)   (Ms. SMITH assumed the Chair.)    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.
