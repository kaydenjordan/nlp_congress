 Mr. Speaker, today I honor the anniversary of the Food  Stamp Act of 1977.   Tomorrow, the program we know as SNAP--the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program--turns 40. We also know that before the  implementation of SNAP, families couldn't afford healthy meals and kids  were going to school on empty stomachs.   Today, thanks to this program, over 18,000 families in my district on  the central coast of California count on SNAP benefits to put food on  their tables at home and help their children feed their minds at their  schools.   In my district, the number one industry is agriculture. We ship our  many fresh fruits and vegetables all over the country and to even other  parts of the world. As a representative of this area, it is my goal and  it is my responsibility to make sure that the families in my district  have access to the same nutritious produce that is grown in our  backyard.   As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, under the leadership  of Chairman Conaway, I look forward to working on the 2018 farm bill  with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle so that we can support  strong investments in SNAP. By doing that, we will support stronger  families and a stronger future.                            ____________________
