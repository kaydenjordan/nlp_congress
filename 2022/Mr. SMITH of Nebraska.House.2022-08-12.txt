 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas  for yielding me time.   As Mr. Burgess pointed out, if we defeat the previous question, I  will move to amend the rule to make in order my amendment to strike  funding for IRS enforcement activities.   The administration's own Treasury Department has said this funding  would be used to hire 87,000 new IRS agents. This has been verified.  These agents will be focused on targeting American families, small  businesses, farmers, and ranchers with audits.   Families and small businesses are struggling. That is no secret.  Inflation is at 8.5 percent. Food and gas prices are at record highs.  Despite this bill's name, reasonable economists agree it will do nearly  nothing to actually reduce inflation, especially in the near term.   Small business pessimism about costs and access to workers is at all- time highs, and audits would only compound this misery. Estimates put  the starting cost to a small business being audited in the range of  $10,000 to $75,000. Ridiculous. That is the last thing our small  businesses need, the vast majority of whom follow the law. They are  law-abiding individuals and law-abiding businesses.   My amendment makes the following changes to the bill.   It strikes the $45 billion for enforcement activities, which include  legal and litigation support, digital asset monitoring, and enforcing  criminal statutes. Those are audit activities.   It strikes $25 billion for operation support, which includes rent  payments, printing, postage, and other administrative activities to  support the new auditors. It also strikes $104 million for the Office  of Tax Policy at IRS, the office which creates new tax regulations.   It strikes $153 million for the U.S. Tax Court, where cases related  to these new audits would be heard, and it strikes $50 million for  Treasury to implement these changes.   Now, let me tell you what this amendment would not do. This amendment  leaves in place $3.2 billion for taxpayer services to help address the  backlog of nearly 20 million unprocessed returns. We agree this backlog  is a serious problem, and taxpayers need better customer service. It  leaves in place $4.8 billion for badly needed IRS systems  modernization.   According to the CBO, the bill would still reduce the deficit if we  adopt this amendment while leaving every other provision of the package  intact.   Unless there are Senate Democrats who believe auditing families and  small businesses is the single most important part of this bill, they  should have no problem expeditiously passing it again.   Because we would only make in order this one single amendment, if we  defeat the previous question, it will only delay final passage of the  bill by about 20 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I have many serious concerns about this bill that the  rule makes in order, which I will discuss later. I find it particularly  troubling the Democrats think auditing thousands of more American  families and small businesses is the solution to inflation.   Let's defeat the previous question and help assure law-abiding  Americans that the IRS isn't going to show up at their doors.    Mr. Speaker, it is interesting, in this  exchange here, the claims being made that this bill will just do so  many wonderful things for our country and that they are holding  harmless folks making less than $400,000.   The CBO just reported that at least $20 billion in savings from this  bill will come from families making less than $400,000 a year, hardly  what has been stated by the folks advocating for this bill.   We know that the facts point out that it is 87,000 new employees,  including agents, over at the IRS, and these full-time equivalents  would take place by 2031. I am not sure where those folks come from,  necessarily. I know it has been stated that this would fill vacancies  or answer retirements for the next few years. But why do we need new  money for that? That should already be budgeted.   Certainly, these agents at the IRS have law enforcement authority.  They have badges that let them walk around the magnetometers at the  airports. Certainly, I would assume they are armed, as well.    The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates 78  to 90 percent of new revenue from unreported income will come from  folks earning less than $200,000 per year.   I think we need to be very cautious as we move forward and grow an  agency that even President Clinton pushed back on when he was  President, realizing that the agency was harassing the American people.    Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear that if  Secretary Yellen were accurate when she said that inflation was  transitory, we would have no reason to be here right now. Obviously,  she has backed off those comments based on realities, and that is what  we need to focus on. Now, the realities and the facts are not what some  hopes might be for some legislation on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record documents from the CBO, the JCT,  the GAO, and the Department of the Treasury.        CBO has received a number of questions regarding our       estimate of an amendment offered by Senator Crapo during the       floor debate on H.R. 5376 last weekend. That amendment,       #5404, would limit the use of additional funds for the       Internal Revenue Service. If the amendment had been adopted       none of the additional funds could have been used to audit       taxpayers with taxable incomes below $400,000.        CBO did not complete a formal cost estimate in advance of       consideration of the amendment but the agency did provide the       following information to the Senate Budget Committee:        CBO estimates that the amendment 5404 would have the       following effects:        No effect on outlays in the one or ten year budget windows;       would reduce outlays in the five year budget window.  [[Page H7572]]         No effect on revenues in the one year budget window; would       reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the       provisions of section 10301 in the five and ten year budget       windows.        No effect on outlays after 2031 but would decrease the       ``non-scorable'' revenue resulting from the provisions of       section 10301 after 2031.        CBO has not completed a point estimate of this amendment       but the preliminary assessment indicates that amendment 5404       would reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the       provisions of section 10301 by at least $20 billion over the       FY2022-FY2031 period.            Thanks,                                                   Leigh Angres,                                    Director of Legislative Affairs,      Congressional Budget Office.                                   ____                                       Congress of the United States,                                     Joint Committee on Taxation,                                     Washngton, DC, August 17, 2021.                                 Memorandum       To: Redacted.      From: Thomas A. Barthold.      Subject: Distributional Information.         This memorandum responds to your request for distributional       information on a proposal in Treasury's ``General       Explanations of the Administration's Fiscal Year 2022 Revenue       Proposals'' (the ``Greenbook''). The proposal, ``Introduce       Comprehensive Financial Account Reporting to Improve Tax       Compliance,'' requires financial institutions to report       inflows and outflows for every account with at least $600 of       inflows or outflows in a year, for tax years beginning after       December 31, 2022. Although these inflows and outflows do not       directly correspond to any line items on tax returns, the       proposal is estimated to reduce underreporting of income,       particularly on income subject to little or no information       reporting, such as individual business income, self-      employment income, and small C corporation income. We       estimate that the proposal would raise $206 billion over the       2022-31 budget window.        We are unable to provide distributional effects for this       proposal because we do not impute unreported income to our       individual tax model, in part because the distribution of       unreported income is not well identified. Instead, we provide       some distributional information on the tax gap attributable       to the types of taxpayers that might be most affected by this       proposal. In particular, underreporting of non farm       proprietor income, i.e., Schedule C income, was estimated to       contribute $68 billion to the annual $245 billion individual       income tax underreporting tax gap for tax years 2011 to       2013.\1\ Underreporting of Schedule C income also contributes       heavily to the $45 billion self-employment (SECA) tax       underreporting tax gap for those same years.\2\        The table below presents a distribution of estimated tax       assessments from representative random audits related to       underreporting of Schedule C income. To estimate these tax       assessments, income adjustments from these audits were       multiplied by estimated average marginal tax rates.\3\ As the       table shows, more than half of the assessed amounts are       estimated to come from taxpayers with reported income between       zero and $50,000.\4\ To the extent that taxpayers with sole       proprietor income tend to have lower income than taxpayers       with partnership or S corporation income, the distribution of       the tax assessments related to underreporting of Schedule C       income might not represent the distributional effects of the       Green Book proposal. To provide a fuller picture, the table       also presents a distribution of estimated tax assessments       related to underreporting of Schedule E income.\5\ Many       random audits of Schedule E income did not include entity-      level audits. Entity-level audits were likely more common       among smaller, single-owner businesses.\6\ Thus, the Schedule       E distribution below is incomplete and could skew toward       lower incomes relative to a hypothetical distribution       resulting from random entity-level audits.        The distributions below are grouped by reported adjusted       gross income and therefore skew toward lower-income taxpayers       relative to distributions done by true income (reported       income plus unreported income). However, when audit       adjustments are added to reported income, affected taxpayers       tend to remain in the reported income group or move up only       one income group.\7\   PERCENTAGE OF ESTIMATED TAX ASSESSMENTS RELATING TO UNDERREPORTING OF .                                    . . ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Reported Adjusted Gross Income     . . .

Table 2, DeBacker et al. (2020).               Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology         As discussed below, we analyzed data for the most recent       years available to determine (1) audit rates by selected       income categories and the reasons for differences across       these categories, and (2) audit outcomes and resources used       for auditing individual tax returns across the income       categories and the likely reasons for any trends. Our scope       of work focused on taxpayer income and did not include       analyzing audits by other characteristics, such as type of       audit, type of auditor, or audit location.        Income levels. The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) 2020       Data Book Table 17 provides data on audit rates and results       by various groupings of total positive income. However, for       our analysis and to simplify reporting, we developed fewer,       broader income categories by combining IRS's income       groupings, as shown in table 2. We analyzed IRS data using       our broader income categories and compared the results with       IRS's groupings. When the finer-level analysis provided       additional insight, we discuss those insights in the report.       In general, we used our broad income categories throughout       the report to discuss general audit trends.        Similar to IRS, our income categories include returns with       the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). We also analyzed EITC       returns as a separate category because of their high volume       and improper payment reporting.                          a. restoring irs resources         The first step in the President's efforts to restore IRS       enforcement capability is a sustained, multi-year commitment       to rebuilding the IRS. This involves spending nearly $80       billion on IRS priorities over the course of the decade       including hiring new specialized enforcement staff,       modernizing antiquated information technology, and investing       in meaningful taxpayer service--including the implementation       of the newly expanded credits aimed at providing support to       American families. Importantly, the additional resources will       go toward enforcement against those with the highest incomes,       and audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for       those earning less than $400,000 in actual income.        The President's proposal includes two components: a       dedicated stream of mandatory funds ($72.5 billion over a       decade) and a program integrity allocation ($6.7 billion over       a decade). These mechanisms provide for a sustained, multi-      year commitment to revitalizing the IRS that will give the       agency the certainty it needs to rebuild.        The IRS proposal includes year-by-year estimates of the       additional resources that will be directed toward the agency       as well as the specific activities that these resources would       support. The design ensures that the IRS is able to absorb       and usefully deploy additional resources over the entire 10-      year horizon and keeps budget growth manageable at around 10       percent per year.                                   ____                                          Secretary of the Treasury,                                      Department of the Treasury,                                    Washington, DC, August 10, 2022.      Charles P. Rettig,      Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service,      Washington, DC.        Dear Commissioner: The Inflation Reduction Act includes       much-needed funding for the IRS to improve taxpayer service,       modernize outdated technological infrastructure, and increase       equity in the tax system by enforcing the tax laws against       those high-earners, large corporations, and complex       partnerships who today do not pay what they owe.        These crucial investments have been a focus of the Biden       Administration since the President's first day in office, and       I was heartened to see the legislation pass the Senate this       weekend.        Notwithstanding the changes that arose because of       Republican challenges during the Byrd process, I write today       to confirm the commitment that has been a guiding precept of       the planning that you and your team are undertaking: that       audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for       households making under $400,000 annually .        Specifically, I direct that any additional resources--      including any new personnel or auditors that are hired--shall       not be used to increase the share of small business or       households below the $400,000 threshold that are audited       relative to historical levels. This means that, contrary to       the misinformation from opponents of this legislation, small       business or households earning $400,000 per year or less will       not see an increase in the chances that they are audited.        Instead, enforcement resources will focus on high-end       noncompliance. There, sustained, multi-year funding is so       critical to  [[Page H7573]]       the agency's ability to make the investments needed to pursue       a robust attack on the tax gap by targeting crucial       challenges, like large corporations, high-net-worth       individuals and complex pass-throughs, where today the IRS       has resources to initiate just 7,500 audits annually out of       more than 4 million returns received.        This is challenging work that requires a team of       sophisticated revenue agents in place to spend thousands of       hours poring over complicated returns, and it is also work       that has huge revenue potential: indeed, an additional hour       auditing someone making more than $5 million annually       generates an estimated $4,500 of additional taxes collected.       This is essential work that I know the IRS is eager to       undertake.        For regular taxpayers, as you emphasized last week, the       result of this resource infusion will be a lower likelihood       of audit by an agency that has the data and technological       infrastructure in place to target enforcement resources where       they belong--on the high end of the income distribution,       where the top 1 percent alone is estimated to not be paying       $160 billion in owed taxes each year. That's important as a       matter of revenue-raising, but it's also essential as a       matter of fairness.        Crucially, these resources will support a much-needed       upgrade of technology that is decades out-of-date, and an       investment in taxpayer service so that the IRS is finally       able to communicate with taxpayers in an efficient, timely       manner. I look forward to working with you on creating new       digital tools to allow taxpayers to get information from the       IRS instantaneously and on improving taxpayer service, so the       agency is well-equipped to answer calls when they come in.        This historic investment in our tax system will accomplish       two critical objectives. It will raise substantial revenue to       address the deficit; and it will create a fairer system,       where those at the top who do not today comply with their tax       obligations find it far less easy to do so, and where all       taxpayers receive the service from the IRS that they deserve,       and that your dedicated workforce is eager to deliver. The       importance of the work ahead cannot be overstated.            Sincerely,                                                   Janet L. Yellen.
