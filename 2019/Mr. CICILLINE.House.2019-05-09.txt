 Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, our Republican friends  voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They brought in cases of beer  to celebrate. They piled into luxury buses that ferried them to the  White House, where they had a second party with the President to  celebrate their attempt to kick millions of Americans off their health  insurance.   Fortunately, we stopped them. That bill never became law.   But 2 years later, they are up to the same old tricks. The President  is asking a Federal court to strike down not just protections for more  than 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions, but the entire  Affordable Care Act.   Talk about not getting the memo. The American people sent a message  to President Trump in November and to my Republican colleagues on the  other side of the aisle. They want government to stop working for  special interests and start working for the people again. That is why  House Democrats are about to pass legislation to strengthen protections  for folks with preexisting conditions, H.R. 986.   While President Trump continues his assault on the Affordable Care  Act, Democrats are going to continue our work for the people by passing  legislation to make sure every American has access to the quality,  affordable healthcare they deserve.                            ____________________
