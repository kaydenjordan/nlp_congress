 Mr. Chair, I rise today because the Republicans' so- called energy legislation is a farce. This bill does nothing to lower  energy costs. It instead increases our deficit by $2.4 billion in  handouts to Big Oil.   In Ways and Means, the Oversight Committee clearly presented a report  last year that clearly showed the oil companies themselves lied. Not  Biden but the oil companies raised the price beyond belief.   I tried to offer a simple amendment to this bill that expressed  support for offshore wind development, a clean energy source. That is  it. It was blocked. At the same time, an amendment on their side was  added, which gives hot air to fictions about offshore wind. So much for  regular order.   Let me be clear, the experts agree. NOAA agrees, the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration, the experts agree that offshore wind is  not harmful to marine life. They would support it.   The author of one of these amendments was once a big supporter of  wind energy. Now, he is leading the misinformation campaign against  offshore wind.   How do you like that?   Republicans don't listen to experts or science. We know that. Their  attacks on clean energy are rooted in pure bad faith.   Wind power is clean energy. It supports good-paying, union  manufacturing and construction jobs.
