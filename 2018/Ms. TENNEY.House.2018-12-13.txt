 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my dear friend Melvin  Phillips, a full-blooded Oneida Indian, who is facing eviction from his  ancestral land by the illegitimate CEO of the Oneida Indian Nation, Ray  Halbritter.   Mr. Phillips currently resides on ancestral land in Vernon, New York,  which his family has possessed for centuries, long prior to the last  treaty signed by the State of New York in 1842, of which all of his  ancestors signed all of the treaties with the State and were codified  into State law thereafter.   Melvin Phillips is an 82-year-old leader of the Orchard Party Band of  Oneidas. Virtually all the elected officials in my region, including  the Governor of New York, my 2018 opponent, and all of my predecessors  who held this seat, overtly or tacitly, wrongly support the eviction of  this genuine Native American and his family from their ancestral lands,  in spite of all the laws in place to protect Mr. Phillips.   I have represented Mr. Phillips and his family pro bono because of  his amazing story. He is the epitome of the American hero, albeit the  Native American hero.   Mr. Phillips refuses to compromise his integrity. He is a fighter for  the truth. He will not cash in to this corrupt casino leader or anyone  else to protect his land or his culture.   Regardless of any official position I hold, I will not stop fighting  for Mr. Phillips and his family no matter how many millions are spent  to defeat me at the ballot box by Mr. Halbritter and his shills or how  difficult the odds may be for this great American.
