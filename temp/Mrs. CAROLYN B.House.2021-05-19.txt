 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  chairman and ranking member for their extraordinary leadership, for  doing the right thing, and for working to make this country safer and  stronger.   Like my friend on the other side of aisle from North Carolina, I  didn't intend to speak either.   As a New Yorker, I was closely involved in supporting the work of the  9/11 Commission. It, too, like January 6, was one of the darkest days  in the history of our country, and we needed answers on how such a  horrible thing could happen. Almost 3,000 people were murdered just  because they went to work that day. Many things needed to be answered.   This body came together. We were united; we were determined; we  passed the Commission. We had two outstanding leaders, Governor Kean  and Lee Hamilton. They did everything together. They issued a report  that sold more copies than Harry Potter. I nominated it for a National  Book Award. It laid out what happened so clearly from their joint  investigations. More importantly, it told us what to do about it. They  had a series of recommendations to make this country safer.   This body worked together and enacted most of them, and it did make  this country safer. In fact, I get periodic reports from the law  enforcement in my city on attempts to hurt us and how the reforms and  the programs we put in place are helping us, making us stronger and  protecting us better.   We need this January 6 commission, for the sake of America. Let's  stop fighting long enough to work together to help our country  understand what happened.   Why did it take 4 hours for the National Guard to respond? In New  York, they would have been there in 10 minutes. Why didn't they respond  to all of the news reports about what was happening? We need answers.  Let's come together and work together and get them.   A January 6 commission, I urge for the sake of the country, everyone  should vote for it.
