 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 762 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 762         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1119) to       establish the bases by which the Administrator of the       Environmental Protection Agency shall issue, implement, and       enforce certain emission limitations and allocations for       existing electric utility steam generating units that convert       coal refuse into energy. All points of  [[Page H1452]]       order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on Energy and Commerce now printed in the bill       shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       on any further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1917) to allow       for judicial review of any final rule addressing national       emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for brick and       structural clay products or for clay ceramics manufacturing       before requiring compliance with such rule. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. An       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-62 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 762, which  provides for the consideration of H.R. 1119, the Satisfying Energy  Needs and Saving the Environment--or SENSE--Act, and provides for  consideration of H.R. 1917, the Blocking Regulatory Interference from  Closing Kilns--or BRICK--Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, for many years our domestic energy industry has suffered  under unnecessary and politically motivated regulations and burdensome,  bureaucratic red tape, prohibiting growth and innovation. President  Trump and his administration have been working hard, along with this  Congress, to undo the policies which have so harmed our domestic energy  industry.   Today's rule allows for the consideration of two bills, which will  further those efforts and reform our regulatory framework so our energy  producers can do their jobs more efficiently and economically, along  with safeguards that will still be in place to protect health and  safety. These bills provide a commonsense solution to tailor EPA  emission standards, and they provide reasonable compliance timelines  for the specific regulated industries.   The first bill, H.R. 1119, the SENSE Act, is sponsored by my  colleague, Mr. Rothfus from Pennsylvania. This bill would provide for  targeted modifications to the EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards,  MATS, as it applies to coal refuse-to-energy facilities. The EPA has  included certain emissions limits in the new standards that are just  simply not achievable for these refuse plants.   These specialized power plants have been developed to recycle coal  refuse by using it as an energy source to generate affordable, reliable  electricity. These facilities have thus far removed 214 million tons of  coal refuse from the environment, at no expense to taxpayers.   In addition to helping address coal refuse, these facilities have  created an estimated 1,200 direct jobs and 4,000 indirect jobs in areas  that have been economically distressed for many years.                                time  1230    There are 19 of these coal refuse-to-energy facilities, many of which  are at direct risk of being shut down absent passage of the SENSE Act.   The SENSE Act would create a way for coal refuse-to-energy facilities  to continue their much-needed work by allowing these plants to  demonstrate compliance with EPA's hydrochloric acid standard by using  sulfur dioxide as a proxy and assuming that a 93 percent reduction in  sulfur dioxide demonstrates compliance with the hydrochloric acid  emissions reduction standard.   The bill would still require these coal refuse-to-energy facilities  to be subject to emissions limitations and to achieve substantial  declines in emissions; but it would do so in a way that these  facilities can achieve while also remaining operational, recognizing  the crucial role they play in providing energy, and helping to clean up  coal refuse sites.   Mr. Speaker, our rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1917,  the Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns, or BRICK, Act  of 2017 sponsored by my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Johnson). This bill  will help preserve America's brickmaking industry and its 7,000 jobs  and protects them from an EPA rule that created a far too rushed  compliance timetable for businesses across the Nation.   The emissions standards in this rule apply to kilns at brick and  structural clay products manufacturing facilities and at clay ceramic  manufacturing facilities. Industry has estimated the cost of this rule,  if allowed to go into effect, would potentially exceed $100 million  annually, which is four times higher than what the EPA initially  estimated. This is yet one more example of how poorly thought-out and  misguided regulations are harming industries and have been a severe  hindrance to the kind of job creation we know we can now see unleashed  across our Nation.   We have got to ensure businesses have time to comply and that  regulations make sense. We should not force them into arbitrary time  lines that will make them shut down. H.R. 1917 provides that needed  time and makes compliance possible.   The BRICK Act also includes the text of the Relief from New Source  Performance Standards. This legislation was authored by my Democratic  colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson). The provision in this bill  will help both manufacturers and users of wood heaters by providing  relief from overly burdensome and arbitrary time lines that have been  imposed by the EPA's New Source Performance Standards. Specifically,  this bill provides an additional 3 years for businesses to comply with  this rule.   Wood heaters are an affordable source of home heating, especially in  rural America, and it is critically important that we protect this low- cost source of heating. The New Source Performance Standards for wood  heaters, which took effect in 2015, include a provision that is proving  nearly impossible, once again, for manufacturers to comply with as they  are struggling to design compliant models in the short timeframe  allowed by the agency. As a result, we have seen workers laid off and  other companies fearing that they will not be able to stay in business  after 2020.   Wood heater users in many low-income households across the country  face the likelihood of having to pay more and having a reduced product  choice. This is one more example of Federal overreach in which the  agency failed to take into account the real impact of these regulations  on everyday Americans across our country.   It is crucial that we pass the BRICK Act, which would extend the  deadline for the second phase of the wood heater standards from 2020 to  2023, and provide time for meaningful judicial review of the Brick and  Structural Clay Products: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air  Pollutants before the owners and operations of these facilities are  required to make significant and potentially irreversible decisions  regarding capital investments, or driving them out of business  altogether.   Mr. Speaker, we must ensure emissions standards are reasonable and do  not unnecessarily cripple small businesses, which we know are the  drivers of our economy.   Mr. Speaker, therefore, I encourage support for the rule for these  important bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1453]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), my colleague and the sponsor of the SENSE  Act.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Johnson), the sponsor of the BRICK Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I enjoy very much serving on the Rules Committee with  all of my colleagues on the committee. One of the things that I am  often asked because I am a new Member of this body is: What has  surprised me most about being a Member of Congress?   My answer is: Often you see on the outside what looks like a lot of  vitriol between the parties, but, in actuality, I believe that every  Member of this body is here for the right reasons. They are here  because they want to serve the people of their districts, the people of  their States, and the people of this Nation.   I think it is crucially important, Mr. Speaker, particularly when we  are talking about something as sacred as the safety of our children,  that we not engage in the kind of partisan attacks, that we not exploit  tragedy, that we not engage in the kind of questioning of motives that  I just heard my colleague on the other side of the aisle do.   I know my colleague, Mr. Hastings, knows that we may have  disagreements, but the reason that I, as a mother, feel so strongly  about the Second Amendment is because I want to keep our kids safe. I  know he knows that my beliefs about the Second Amendment, though they  are different from his, are not based upon any campaign donations and  any campaign contributions. I know he knows that they are based very  firmly on a fundamental commitment to the importance of the Second  Amendment as part of what makes this Nation safe, as part of what makes  our individuals secure, and how important it is for us not to use this  tragedy to take steps--that may make people feel better--that  fundamentally violate our constitutional rights and that won't keep our  kids safe.   When you go down the path that we have heard so many on the other  side of the aisle suggest we go down, whether they are talking about  banning entire classes of weapons, whether they are talking about  expanding background checks so that they are somehow universal--our  background check system right now is broken. It doesn't work.   We have a situation in which States are not reporting in the way that  they ought to report. So when I hear my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle suggest that what we ought to do, frankly, is expand a system  that is failing and call that progress, I can't help but think that  that is pretty much their standard operating procedure: No matter what  the policy is, let's expand the broken system, let's ignore whether or  not it is really working, and let's call it progress.   Mr. Speaker, I will not be a party to that. I will not be a party in  a situation in which we have had tragedy after tragedy, a situation in  which in this most recent tragedy law enforcement fundamentally at all  levels failed our children. When you have individuals inside of a  school who were killed because armed officers outside the school failed  to enter, when you have children who are killed because call after call  after call to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the local law  enforcement officials went unheeded because specific tips about this  particular individual went unheeded, that is not a time, Mr. Speaker,  for us to say: What we ought to do then is prevent law-abiding  Americans from having access to the firearms that they need to defend  and protect themselves.   I think, Mr. Speaker, if you look at what those on the other side of  the aisle are attempting to do with respect to the debate about guns  and the debate about school safety, it is critically important for all  of us to stand up and say: No, we will not go down a path that is going  to violate constitutional rights, that will not keep our children safe,  and find some kind of false comfort in that.   When you are talking about the bills that are before us today, Mr.  Speaker, we are in a similar situation. We have had 8 years in the  Obama administration where they imposed regulation after regulation  after regulation in the name of somehow protecting the environment.   Mr. Speaker, President Obama's own EPA Administrator testified in  front of Congress that the Clean Power Plan would, in fact, not have  any sort of positive impact on the environment or on global  temperatures, yet they imposed it anyway, imposing massive costs on our  industry in the name, I suppose, of trying to feel better and trying to  feel like they are doing something. But what they are really doing is  actually putting ourselves in a situation where we are harming small  businesses, where we are strangling them, and where we are preventing  their ability to grow and to thrive. We know we can do that, Mr.  Speaker, in a way that also protects our environment.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Rothfus and Mr.  Johnson, for their work on these very important bills.   In Wyoming, Mr. Speaker, we know that our coal and our fossil fuels  are national treasures. They are absolutely crucial to providing the  power that runs this Nation. I am proud of all that we in this body and  President Trump together have done to roll back dangerous and ill- advised Obama-era regulations that have been aimed at killing our  fossil fuel industry.   We can no longer go down the path of allowing these regulations to  exist in a way that devastates industry, puts the fundamental  reliability of our electricity and of our energy grid at risk, and  achieves no measurable impact for the environment. It is long past time  for that indefensible approach to end. That is what we are doing here  today.   These are good bills. They are important bills. They will take this  next step in rolling back the kind of overwhelming regulation that we  have seen, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of both the rule and the underlying  bills.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 762 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill  [[Page H1457]]       and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
