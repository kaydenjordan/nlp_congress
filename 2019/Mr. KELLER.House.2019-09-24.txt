 Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no doubt that Americans  pay too much for healthcare. Seventy percent of Americans agree that  lowering prescription drug costs should be a major priority for the  legislature.   During August, I participated in a number of healthcare-related  roundtables with medical professionals across Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District. Those healthcare professionals identified a  number of ways to help lower prescription drug costs, including patent  reform that would help get generics to market quickly and the need to  incentivize innovation as a means to find more cures.   As such, I am disturbed that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle have introduced a pricing bill that is merely for political  talking points and, if enacted, would put this country on the road  toward socialized medicine. Rather than incentivizing innovation and  patent reform, Democrats have introduced a bill that would increase  taxes and stifle innovation while raising drug prices, leading to fewer  cures.   The American people have demanded action on lowering healthcare  costs. But, Mr. Speaker, socialized medicine is not the answer. It is  time to work together on real solutions in the free market to lower  prescription drug costs and find cures for all Americans.                            ____________________
