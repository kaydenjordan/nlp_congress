 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Build Back Better Act, which includes significant investments in the  fight for health equity.   As chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, I know  all too well that, for centuries, Black Americans and people of color  have been systematically denied affordable healthcare access and left  behind when it comes to our healthcare policies. No more.   Healthcare access is an essential right, and we must do more to  ensure  [[Page H5100]]  that all Americans, regardless of race, ethnicity, income, or ZIP Code,  have access to quality, affordable healthcare.   I am proud that our draft of the Build Back Better Act takes a step  toward that goal. We have included several key investments that are  going to make a real difference in healthcare available to folks. These  investments will prevent chronic illnesses like heart disease and  diabetes, ensure earlier detection and treatment of certain cancers,  and tackle the Black maternal health crisis.   There is so much good included in the Build Back Better Act, but  today I want to highlight just three of the most urgent health equity  issues this bill will address.   The first of those priorities is saving the lives of mothers. The  Build Back Better Act provides for a mandatory extension of postpartum  care for new mothers utilizing Medicaid. In the American Rescue Plan,  we included an option for States to extend postpartum care for 12  months after delivery. While some States have taken up that option, it  will expire in 5 years.   The Build Back Better Act goes a step further in making that expanded  postpartum coverage mandatory and permanent. Research shows that one- third of all pregnancy-related maternal deaths occur between 1 week and  1 year of delivery, and Black women are at an increased risk of  experiencing severe complications or death. No more.   New mothers should have access to postpartum care, regardless of  which State they live in. Extending postpartum care under Medicaid will  save lives and ensure that mothers are able to see their babies grow  up.   Additionally, the Build Back Better Act includes a solution to  permanently close the Medicaid coverage gap. There are still 12 States  that have refused to expand Medicaid, and as many as 4 million people  currently lack access to healthcare because of the coverage gap. No  more.                                time  1045    Ensuring that Medicaid is available to everyone who needs it will  reduce emergency room visits, allow for an increased focus on  preventive care and save us money in the long run. Closing the coverage  gap will also help address the Black maternal health crisis.   Because of the Medicaid coverage gap, many women are not eligible for  care until they become pregnant, and by the time they get approved,  they have missed out on weeks or even months of prenatal and early  pregnancy care during these critical early days of pregnancy.   Access to healthcare in the early days of pregnancy is crucial in  detecting and treating pregnancy-related complications with both mother  and baby. Closing the coverage gap will ensure that new mothers have  access to care when they need it most.   With Build Back Better, we are tackling health equity issues from  babies to older adults. Once we pass the Build Back Better Act, we will  begin including dental, vision, and hearing coverage for seniors  through Medicare Part B.   Dental coverage will include cleaning and x-rays, extractions, oral  disease management services, and dentures--all vital dental procedures  and care that seniors both need and deserve. Many people may not  realize it, but oral health has significant impacts on your overall  health, and poor oral health has been linked to heart disease, kidney  disease, and dementia.   Including dental coverage will help so many people, but it will be  especially important for people of color. According to a Kaiser Family  Foundation study, 71 percent of Black Medicare beneficiaries and 65  percent of Hispanic beneficiaries went without a dental visit in the  past year, compared to 43 percent of White beneficiaries. No more.   Ultimately, these policies are not just about saving lives, but  improving lives. We are investing in the health and safety of our  constituents and their ability to live long, happy, and healthy lives  with their families.   Our healthcare system has been pushed to its limits throughout the  past 18 months, and we have been shown, under a bright light, the  cracks in its foundation. But it is not beyond repair. Through  meaningful investment, we can rebuild our healthcare system in a way  that works for everyone and addresses centuries-long challenges to  achieving health equity.   The Build Back Better Act presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity  for us to advance health equity. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.                            ____________________
