 Madam Speaker, my adult son, Ian Schakowsky, I will  always credit for my decision last June to support the impeachment  inquiry. It had never been my goal to impeach a President, but Ian made  such a compelling case. He reminded me of the oath I have taken 11  times now to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.  He said: Mom, this is not about politics, and this is not about party.   Pushing back against my arguments, he said: This has nothing to do  with the final outcome. It is about doing the right thing, even if  others don't.   He made me see that it was about my legacy, my modest place in  history.   I want to thank my son for helping me do the right thing today to  vote to impeach the President of the United States, Donald Trump,  because no American is above the law.
