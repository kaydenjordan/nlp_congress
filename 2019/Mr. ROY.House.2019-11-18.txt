 Mr. Speaker, I am here tonight with a number of my  colleagues from Texas because Governor Rick Perry, as we Texans refer  to him, will be stepping down in a few weeks as the Secretary of Energy  of the United States of America.   I have had the honor of serving on his staff, working with him on a  number of projects, including a book, and working on his campaigns. He  has been a State Representative in Texas, the Agriculture Commissioner  in Texas, Lieutenant Governor, Governor of Texas, but I always think of  Rick Perry first and foremost as a proud Texan, an Aggie, an Eagle  Scout, a husband, an Air Force veteran, a father, and a grandfather.  But for me personally, I always remember the Governor as a friend, a  loyal friend who would help those who needed it, whether it was a  veteran, suffering after battle, who needed a home, which the Governor  and his lovely bride, Anita, would welcome them into their home, or  whether it was praying for me when I had cancer as a staffer for  him. Governor Perry literally called me from a Presidential debate to  check on me while I was going through chemotherapy. And he stood with  me and my family through it all. He is above all a good and decent man.    There are few people in this world who cause you to want to charge  the hill behind him, and you know it will be for fighting a just cause,  but Governor Perry is one of those people. And he learned this from his  family and his community.   Governor Perry grew up in Paint Creek, Texas, with no indoor plumbing  for the first 5 years of his life in 1950s west Texas. His dad, Ray,  was a World War II veteran, who along with Perry's wonderful mom,  Amelia, were ranchers in Texas. And his wife Anita, whom he met in  elementary school, was his high school sweetheart and has been the love  of his life and by his side ever since. He is a proud dad to Griffin  and Sydney and granddad to their wonderful children.   Governor Perry is fairly famous for being an Aggie. He received his  bachelor of science degree in animal science from A&M. He was  commissioned to second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force upon  graduation. He was a member of Squadron 6 and served as a junior and  senior Yell Leader and was immersed in all aspects of Aggie student  life. A strong supporter of the Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M, Governor  Perry has been a speaker at countless Aggie musters since 1990 and was  the principal speaker at the main campus ceremony in 2002. And he was  also the key note speaker at the 125th anniversary celebration of the  Corps of Cadets in 2001. He exemplifies the Aggie values, selfless  service, respect, loyalty, integrity, and excellence in leadership.   Before I yield to my colleague, I would be remiss if I did not note  that it was 20 years ago today that the historic tradition at Texas  A&M, the A&M bonfire that is always built in preparation for and lit  the night before the game against the University of Texas, one of the  greatest rivalries in sports, which is long overdue for renewal, 20  years ago today it collapsed at 2:42 a.m. where 11 students and one  former student died and 27 others were injured. Fifty-seven Aggies were  working on the bonfire at the time when they heard a crack, and it  collapsed. My wife was a senior at the time. And as we commemorate  Governor Perry tonight, we also commemorate the lives of those great  Aggies who were carrying on the spirit of that great institution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for those kind remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), my  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for those great  remarks about the Governor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Taylor), who  represents the town in which my lovely bride grew up, Plano, Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for joining us  here this evening and lauding the service and accomplishments of  Governor Perry, Secretary Perry.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson), my  former colleague in the United States Senate and my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas. I know that he  appreciates the Governor's military service because he, too, is a  veteran. I thank him for his service, and I thank him for the kind  remarks for the Governor. I know he will cherish and appreciate those.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from west Texas (Mr.  Arrington), who represents my father's alma mater, Texas Tech  University, and ask his indulgences after the NCAA basketball  championship.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for those  inspiring remarks about our mutual friend, the former Governor of  Texas, although he will always be the Governor of Texas in our hearts.  I know he will appreciate those sentiments.   As someone who--my father grew up down the road in Sweetwater, Texas,  and is a west Texan, just down the road from where he grew up, and you  can share those experiences. There is something special about that part  of the world, the people and what it means. I think the United States  could learn a lot from spending some time with the good people of west  Texas.   I would point out, following what was just said, in 2016, when  Governor Perry was thinking about running for President, at that time,  he was on the stage, and to his right, when he announced his  Presidential campaign, was Marcus Luttrell, a retired member of the  Navy SEALs, who was the only survivor of a 2005 attack by the Taliban  in Afghanistan. He wrote a book about his experience, called ``Lone  Survivor,'' as you know, which has become a movie.   To Mr. Perry, to the Governor, our friend, Mr. Luttrell is more than  a military veteran and best-selling author. He is practically a member  of the family. Now, why is that?                                time  2015    Well, as Perry said, ``He is not just the lone survivor. He is a  second son.''   Marcus was in physical therapy in San Diego in 2006 when he met the  Governor and his wife, Anita, who were there on vacation. And they  reconnected in Texas where Mr. Luttrell was from, and Mr. Perry took  Mr. Luttrell into his home.   He is living there. He is the Governor, and he took Marcus into his  home to live with him while he was dealing with post-traumatic stress  disorder. They are now friends, and Governor Perry is the godfather of  Mr. Luttrell's children. That is who he is. Mr. Speaker, you know that,  I know that, and those of us from Texas know that.   I would point out how great this world would be if the E.U. or the  U.N. would hire the Secretary to go be in charge of energy for the  world. Can you imagine if we were able to export LNG from Texas to  China and to India and the places that are polluting the world? Imagine  if we could export the kind of entrepreneurship and capability that  Texans are doing that are driving the world's economy.   Literally, the tip of the spear for the world's economy is the great  State of Texas. And it is largely due to the spirit of the people of  Texas which is exemplified by that great Governor.   I would make a few points here. The philosophy of the Governor when I  worked for him was, ``I have been guided by a simple philosophy: that  job creation, not higher taxation, is the best form of revenue  generation.'' And I think this body could learn a lot from that. Follow  the model of Texas.   That philosophy served the people of Texas well. In his tenure he  added more than 2.2 million jobs, or Texas did. According to the Bureau  of Labor Statistics, that is nearly four times the national average  during the same  [[Page H8948]]  timeline. Twenty-three percent in Texas, versus 6 percent in the United  States as a whole.   Twenty-nine percent of all new jobs in the United States came from  Texas. Employment grew three times faster in Texas than in California,  New York, Florida, Illinois, or Pennsylvania. Texas led wage growth  across all income levels. Ninety-five percent of all jobs in Texas paid  above the minimum in 2013 when he was at the height of being Governor.   He grew Texas' economy to become the world's twelfth largest economy.  Today it is the tenth under current Governor Greg Abbott.   It wasn't just about the growth, but as the Governor said in his 2005  address to the people of Texas: ``Our challenge is to make sound,  strategic investments that withstand the test of time.''   It was his fiscal conservatism, though, that I think a lot of people  looked to the Governor, is how he led that great State, unlike this  body, balancing our budgets, and doing so while growing our great  economy.   He understands what everyone in Washington can't seem to wrap their  head around, that you can't spend money you don't have. While this body  racks up $100 million of debt per hour, Texas balances its budget while  leading the world in job creation.   While Perry was Governor, Texas cut spending, balanced the budget,  and grew the Texas economy exponentially. The State of Texas, under  Perry's leadership, finished the `13-'14 legislative session with a  $2.6 billion surplus; things we can only dream of here in Washington  right now.   He fought tax hikes, passed the largest school property tax rate  decrease in Texas State history at the time; passed extensive property  tax breaks for disabled veterans and their spouses; and championed the  idea that the people, not the government, are the drivers of growth and  innovation.   Governor Perry oversaw perhaps the largest transformation of energy  technology and policy in Texas history, setting the foundation for  extraordinary achievements to come. Breakthroughs in hydraulic  fracturing, which some people use as the bogeyman, creates the engine  of the prosperity our Nation is now feeling and that is now being  exported around the world.   We are sitting in this great Chamber with lights fueled by natural  gas. That is what Texas is doing. That is how Texas is leading the  world. It led to an oil and natural gas surge in Texas growing by  roughly 260 percent and 50 percent respectively.   Texas is producing more oil than Iraq and Afghanistan, leading the  way for America to achieve energy independence, which we only could  dream of a mere decade or 15 years ago.   The State's wind power sector hardly existed when the Governor came  to office, but Texas became the Nation's leader in wind energy  generation during his tenure in his all-of-the-above approach.   Perry took the same progrowth mentality to Washington during his time  as Secretary of Energy. As Energy Secretary, Perry focused not only on  securing American energy independence, but on our stability and  capacity to export LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world.   Because of his leadership, the U.S. will be able to provide allies  and partners with affordable energy that will drive economic growth and  prosperity around the world. America has seen this historic growth  while leading the world in total CO2 emissions reduction  since 2005.   When the Governor stepped down from Texas, briefly thinking he was  done with public service before being pulled back as the Secretary of  Energy--that is why I am not sure he is done with his public service  yet, by the way--``Texas is a State,'' he said, ``where nothing is  impossible. Where the sons and daughters of migrant workers can aspire  to own the farm; where the children of factory workers can build new- age manufacturing facilities; and where the son of tenant farmers''--as  was the Governor--``can become Governor of the greatest State in the  Union.   ``In Texas, it's not where you come from that matters, it's where you  are going. Texas doesn't recognize the artificial barriers of race,  class, or creed.    ``The most vivid dreams take flight from the most humble beginnings,  and so it was for me,'' said the Governor.   ``As many of you know, I grew up in a place called Paint Creek. When  I was young, we didn't have electricity or running water. Mom bathed us  in a number two washtub. And we attended the Paint Creek Rural School,  where some of the teachers lived on campus. Their profession was  literally their life, and they inspired me,'' he said.   ``In fact, I'm proud to say I graduated in the top 10 of my class of  13 students,'' he added. ``I can assure you none of my teachers knew  they were instructing a future Governor.   ``But they also have a motto at the Paint Creek School that  summarizes the endless possibilities for its students: `No dream too  tall for a school so small.' ''   This is the story of Texas. This is the story of America. When will  we go back to that story again? When will we talk about those  aspirations that America represents, that that flag represents, that  this body represents, instead of the games that we play in this place  rightly known as the swamp?   He said: ``In this, the people's House,'' referring to the Texas  House, ``we're in the business of making dreams possible. Every dream  counts, every child matters. . . . And in Texas, every child has a  chance. That is the Texas we have built together, a Texas of unlimited  opportunity. There's a reason more people move to Texas than any other  State, because this is the best place to find a job, raise your family,  and pursue your dreams.   ``In some respects, this has been true for a long time,'' he said.  ``In the early 1800s, Americans headed west, leaving their troubles  behind to find a second chance.''   That is what my family did. Maybe what your family did, my friend  from Texas.   My family came from Georgia to Dripping Springs, Texas, in 1853. My  great-great-great grandparents are buried just a few miles down the  road from where my wife, Carrah, and I have 10 acres outside of Austin,  Texas. They came there seeking a better way of life. My great-great  grandmother was born in San Marcos, and she married my great-great  grandfather who was a Texas Ranger battling Comanches and Comanche  incursions at the time signing up in Hays, and Travis, and Blanco  Counties. It was a tough country.   There were no handouts. There was no government to go seek some  refuge from. You just had to grab yourself up by your bootstraps--yes,  we still like that phrase and we still use it in Texas--and figure out  how to survive.   ``They planted roots; tamed a harsh land; won a revolution; founded a  republic; survived droughts; wildfires and hurricanes; discovered  crude; started great universities; and took mankind to the Moon.''   In his tenure alone, the Governor said: ``We have been tested by the  disintegration of the space shuttle; Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Ike;  devastating wildfires; the spread of Ebola; and a humanitarian crisis  at the border.   ``Each time, Texans have responded to these tests with great  character. As long as there has been a Texas, there has existed a  people whose character has been refined by fire, whose souls are  resilient, who respond to tragedy with grace, and who look to the  future with hope.   ``What we have done together is preserve Texas as a land of  opportunity, making our economy more diverse and jobs more plentiful.''   I could go on. I will just close out here by saying, all of that is  applicable to this, the United States of America. All of that is who we  are. And we would do well to remember that again. It is the greatness  of this country that we must return to.   The Governor, when he served in the Air Force, flew C-130s. And one  time as the Governor, he was over in Iraq or Afghanistan--I don't  remember which--and he was flying in a C-130, rattling around as you do  you when you fly in those planes. He landed, and as he always did when  he was flying around, he went up and talked to those guys flying the  plane, because he would have rather been in that cockpit than whatever  he was doing as Governor. And he went up there and he talked to them,  and then he started looking; they went and looked at the manifest and  the history of the airplane, and he  [[Page H8949]]  had flown that C-130 in the 1970 when he was a pilot in the Air Force.  That is who he was. He wanted to go find out and he wanted to talk to  those guys.   When the Governor ran for President in 2011-2012, I worked on his  Presidential campaign. I had been working in his office, and that was  when I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, as I referenced earlier.  As I said earlier, he called me from a debate stage--literally going on  stage--to make sure and check on me and check on my health and see how  I was doing during chemotherapy. That is just who he was. That is who  he has always been.   When he was launching his campaign in Charleston, South Carolina, I  unfortunately had to miss that. I was going to be there, but I was at  MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston starting treatment. But when he  announced, he used a phrase: `` . . . making Washington, D.C., as  inconsequential in our lives as possible.''   It is what I aspire to do here as a Member in this body. Not because  there are not great things we can do in this body, but because the  greatness of this country lies outside of this body. It lies outside of  this city. It lies in every town, in every community, in every school,  in every business, in every hospital, all around this great country  where people wake up every day to make lives better.   Too much of our focus is on what happens here. Too many Sunday  mornings are about what is happening on ``Meet the Press'' instead of  what is happening in the church pew, instead of what is happening down  the street.   Too many people are looking to the VA to solve problems for the  veterans instead of wondering, who is the veteran 5 miles down the road  who needs help right now?    We solve problems like the Cajun Navy coming over to Houston, like  the people of Texas rising up in the wake of floods after hurricanes to  solve problems for real people in real time.   Instead of mortgaging our future with fake promises that we can't  afford while this body has show votes--no matter who is in charge, by  the way--on resolutions and bills, and never sits here and has the real  debates and the real work of what we need to do.   The real work is going on outside of this body. Governor Perry  represents the greatness of this Nation. Both his life story and who he  is, he embodies the greatness of this country.   I wholeheartedly endorse making Washington, D.C., as inconsequential  in the lives of Americans as possible, because our country will be ever  greater as the State of Texas has been ever greater under his  leadership and since our inception as a State in leading this country  and leading this world.   I thank the Governor. I thank his lovely wife. I thank his family. I  look forward to seeing what he is going to do next.   And with that, and on behalf of all Texans and my colleagues here in  the House, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
