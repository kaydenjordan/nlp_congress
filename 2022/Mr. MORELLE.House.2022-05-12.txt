 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the extraordinary  and impactful life of Gloria Langston, community advocate, and  cofounder of Rochester's first Black-owned radio station, who sadly  passed away last week.   Founded in 1974, WDKX was one of the first Black-owned stations in  New York State. Their call sign is a tribute to Frederick Douglass,  Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X, demonstrating their commitment  to uplifting the Black community.   Together with her husband, Andrew Langston, Gloria established WDKX  as a fixture in the Rochester radio space, bringing people together and  keeping our community engaged.   My heart goes out to her beloved son, Andre, and the entire Langston  family during this difficult time. May you find peace in knowing her  legacy will live on through the good works of those she has inspired.                            ____________________
