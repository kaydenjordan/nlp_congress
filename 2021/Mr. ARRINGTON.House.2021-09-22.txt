 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana, my  dear friend. I am honored to be here and to stand with you and so many  of my colleagues who believe, like we in west Texas believe  unquestionably and unequivocally, that life is sacred, and it is a gift  from God. We celebrate that, and we praise God for that.   We also believe that whether you are 2 weeks in the womb as an unborn  citizen of this great country or you are 2 years old or you are 22, you  deserve the constitutionally protected right to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.   If anybody questioned whether the Democratic Party has been hijacked  by the radical left, look no further than H.R. 3755, abortion on demand  for any reason at any time, right up until the child is born, when the  child is viable to live independently outside the womb, when the child  can feel pain in the termination of its life.   Mr. Speaker, this would put us on par with the likes of North Korea,  China, and only seven countries in the world that allow for late-term  abortions.   It usurps States' sovereign rights to determine their values and  their culture of life and to restrict reasonably this horrible  procedure where people would abort a child simply because they didn't  get a boy when they wanted a girl, or somehow they discovered that the  child has Down syndrome.   They can't put these reasonable protections in place because this is  yet another top-down from Washington, a one-size-fits-all to impose  Washington values on the American people.   I can just tell you, Mr. Speaker, I am proud of Texas' record of  passing pro-life legislation that reflects the pro-life values of the  people of Texas.   I stand against H.R. 3755. As for me and my house and the people of  west Texas, we stand for life, which is why we oppose this.
