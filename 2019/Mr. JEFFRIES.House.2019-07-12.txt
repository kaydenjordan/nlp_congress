 Madam Speaker, I thank the chair for yielding and for  his tremendous leadership.   Since the tragedy on September 11, approximately 10,000 people have  been diagnosed with cancer related to toxic smoke and dust.  Approximately 15,000 people are suffering with asthma or other  respiratory illnesses. Approximately 10,000 people struggle with PTSD.  Almost 5,000 individuals are struggling with anxiety and depression.  More than 2,000 people have died since September 11.   The overwhelming majority of these individuals who are sick and  afflicted are 9/11 first responders.   The Victim Compensation Fund is expected to run out of money. In  order to take care of these brave heroes and individuals, we vowed as a  nation to never forget. That means looking after those brave men and  women who sacrificed so much in the days, weeks, months, and years  after September 11.   Support this legislation.
