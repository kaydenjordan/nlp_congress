 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in our job, we get a lot of books, probably  two or three a week at least, and for the last year most of those have  been on  [[Page S4050]]  healthcare and healthcare reform. A book I received recently is one  called ``Demystifying ObamaCare,'' by David G. Brown, who is a doctor.  It was helpful enough to me that I thought I would share a part of it  with anybody listening. It always fascinates me when we are here  talking and maybe somebody is listening.   Page 7 starts out by talking about, ``How Does ObamaCare Look After  Seven Years?'' Incidentally, this one is all well documented and  footnoted, which is one of the unusual things about this book. It is  not just speculation on his part--it is a lot of research that he has  done and shared. He says:         ObamaCare actually reduces insurance market competition by       strict rules, regulations, and mandates.        ObamaCare significantly increases healthcare cost by the       way it attempts to assist those who cannot afford coverage.        ObamaCare does not tackle the underlying causes of       increased costs. Instead, it worsens the factors that drive       up the cost of healthcare with the addition of mandates,       regulations, and taxes. ObamaCare does nothing to decrease       the factors that increase costs.        ObamaCare has increased the total number of healthcare       spending. The cost is not $938 billion dollars, but now is       $2.6 trillion dollars over 10 years, or almost 3 times the       original figure.        ObamaCare increases cost for families, businesses, and       individuals for their healthcare. This includes not simply       ObamaCare exchanges but health insurance across the board.       Associated with this, there has been a marked increase in       healthcare premiums, costs for medications, deductibles, and       copays.        There has been reduction of access to care in ObamaCare       plans, i.e. ObamaCare exchanges (insurance does not equal       access).        ObamaCare, to some extent, has reduced the number of       uninsured but not handled the problem of the uninsured       population.        ObamaCare does not effectively address the problems of the       safety net system, i.e. putting new people into Medicaid has       exacerbated the problems for Medicaid, and removes its       original safety net function.        ObamaCare has reduced funding and thus care for programs       for the elderly, Medicare.        ObamaCare has taken the decision making process out of the       hands of patients and their families. It has done so by       removing their freedom to make those decisions.    This is from the book, ``Demystifying ObamaCare,'' by David Brown,  who is a doctor.   It goes on later to say:         The individual mandate was instituted as a way to force       patients into having health insurance or else pay a financial       penalty for not having it. The employer mandate, which was       just instituted in 2016 after several delays, was intended to       move those with employer-based insurance into the government       sector. Additionally, the HHS required all individual and       small group policies to meet the ``essential health benefit''       requirements. These benefits were determined by the secretary       of the HHS and required involvement of not simply government,       but also non-government plans. The individual and small group       policies then had to be sold at a more significant cost to       the consumer.        How is the Employer-Based System changed so employees could       be moved into a government system?        Businesses with 50 or more full-time employees had to       provide health insurance approved by HHS or be financially       penalized.        The cost for businesses for the penalties for not providing       insurance was less than the cost of the insurance.        ObamaCare exchanges were there to take in anyone who needed       to have insurance. Employer based mandates were a way of       moving employees out of the employee-based marketplace into a       government program. It is the back door way of having a       government based healthcare system. It was ingenious but       fortunately, for the American people it was flawed.        Yes, Americans in the individual market lost their       insurance (5 million Americans) but the employer-based       mandate was postponed through the efforts of Congress. Many       of the larger companies have self-insured their employees.       The ObamaCare exchange program has been very expensive for       the consumers. It has also significantly limited access to       care i.e. narrowed networks of providers, (doctors and       hospitals). ObamaCare has increased the numbers in Medicaid       but this program itself has severe flaws.    Again, in ``Demystifying ObamaCare'' by David Brown, a doctor, going  to page 18, ``What Are the Facts About Medicaid and Medicaid  Expansion?''         Costs of Medicaid (total federal and state spending) will       more than double i.e. more than $427 billion to $896 billion       between 2014 and 2024. The costs of this will be borne by the       taxpayers.        The cost of Medicaid to the states has a tremendous impact       on other services. It is often the second most expensive       budgetary item. With Medicaid expansion, there are increased       costs to the states, even in those states, which have       accepted Medicaid expansion and increased federal funding for       it. Other state services may have to be reduced even in       states who have not accepted Medicaid expansion.        Medicaid is actually a safety net for the poorest and most       vulnerable Americans but expansion changes this. It reduces       the access to care for others who are already in the system.       The single adult able-bodied American is competing for care       with those who need the care as a safety net.        It severely underpays doctors and hospitals, and the number       of Medicaid providers are declining. It compensates doctors       an average of 50% less than private insurance. By CBO       estimates, by the time of full implementation of ObamaCare,       one out of every six hospitals will be in the red because of       severe underpayment from Medicaid and Medicare.        Medicaid expansion does not reduce inappropriate       utilization of emergency rooms. A recent study showed       Medicaid patients utilize the emergency rooms for their       routine care 40% more than those who are uninsured.        Medicaid has the worst clinical outcomes compared with any       other medical program. There are worse outcomes including       conditions such as heart disease, cancer, complications from       major surgery, transplants, and AIDS. These outcomes are       independent of patient factors and reflect the program       itself. It may be no better than having no insurance at all.       A recent study comparing Medicaid patients with those who are       uninsured showed no difference in blood pressure, glucose,       and cholesterol levels after two years of observation.        In short Medicaid expansion reduces access to care,       increases cost of care and places people within the program       that has the worst possible outcomes to care.    Going on in ``Demystifying ObamaCare,'' by David Brown, page 25,  ``Medicaid Expansion Update: How Does It Stand Today?''         Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have adopted       Medicaid expansion. Three states have considered it but       rejected Medicaid expansion. The other sixteen states have       refused to participate in it.        Medicaid expansion has increased the Medicaid number from       58 million to approximately 70 million people, 20% of the       uninsured population. It has caused overall expansion of the       number of people in the program.        ObamaCare has increased the number of individuals insured       by allowing them to participate in the existing Medicaid       program. In order to do so, the inclusion criteria for their       enrollments have changed. Medicaid expansion is now based on       age and financial criteria. That includes both the able-      bodied individuals who are able to work and chose not to and       those who were previously involved in the Medicaid safety       net. For example, the lower income mother with children.        It was thought that the states that accepted Medicaid       expansion would have ``free money'' if they participated with       this Federal program. 100% of the costs of adding new       patients were picked up by the federal government with that       figure gradually being reduced to 90% of the cost starting in       2017.        This was for new patients added to Medicaid and not the       existing patient population. States however found that their       Medicaid programs were flooded with new enrollees, many of       which had met the criteria for Medicaid before the ``woodwork       effect.''        The overall expansion of Medicaid with increasing numbers       of enrollees has led to marked increase in spending on       Medicaid and marked increase in total costs for Medicaid.    It goes on with a lot of numbers which have a lot of significance to  accountants, but I will skip over those and continue on with his last  two points.         Medicaid is associated with the worst possible clinical       success rate across the board for all medical and surgical       illnesses. It is worse than any other program, including any       government programs such as Medicare or any private program.       In certain studies, it has shown to have worse clinical       outcomes than having no insurance at all. No data has       developed during the course of Medicaid expansion to change       these findings.        Medicaid expansion is associated with a huge financial       burden on the states and the cost to the states with Medicaid       expansion has increased dramatically.    Again, at the end of the chapter it shows a lot of references for  where he got this information.   Continuing with ``Demystifying ObamaCare'' and moving on to page 31  is ``What are ObamaCare Insurance Exchanges?''         ObamaCare insurance exchanges are federally constructed and       state run markets where individuals and families can purchase       insurance plans. Private healthcare insurance companies       participate but the insurance companies are only able to sell       plans that are acceptable to the Secretary of the HHS. Many       individuals and families then could receive subsidies       provided by the government, (i.e. taxpayers funded       subsidies). The subsidies are [to] be on a sliding scale,       families whose income is up to 400% of the federal poverty       level can be in the ObamaCare exchange ($97,000 dollars a       year for a family of four). The program is tightly regulated       by the Federal Government. The choice is limited to four       plans (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.) Each state was       required to set up their own insurance exchanges and then       regulate them. If a state  [[Page S4051]]       did not set up such an exchange, the Federal Government did       that for them.    ``What Effects These Policies Have on Those Inside and Outside the  Exchanges?''         The public must know that the exchanges dramatically       restrict patient care by restricting access to care.       Exchanges decrease access by reducing access to doctors and       hospitals. This includes access to some of the most important       specialized care. The exchanges have a limited network of       providers.        The public must understand that they do [not have]       protection from fraud. Some of the most sensitive information       is given to navigators to help enroll people in the       exchanges. The enrollees then become ``fair game.''        The ObamaCare website, ``Healthcare.gov'' does not       automatically verify enrollee's eligibility, i.e., whether       they legally qualify for subsidies. Various sources indicate       that at least 2 million enrollees (some estimates are       significantly higher) are receiving subsidies that they did       not legally qualify for. Douglas Holtz-Eakins, former       director of the CBO, estimates that over the first 10 years       of ObamaCare, overpayments and inappropriate payments could       add up to $152 billion dollars. Who pays the bill? The       American taxpayer. The website, ``Healthcare.gov'' cost       taxpayers $1.4 billion dollars in 2014.    He goes on to explain how that increases the costs for all taxpayers.   I will continue with some of the other lessons in this book at  another time. The leader is coming to the floor to speak in a few  moments.   What we are trying to do is to find some solutions for the American  people so they have access to healthcare--and more extensively than  now. I recommend for reading this book called ``Demystifying  ObamaCare'' by David Brown. It is very eye-opening. There is a section  I will cover later that covers some of the solutions that will be  useful.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
