 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2409) to allow servicemembers to terminate their  cable, satellite television, and Internet access service contracts  while deployed, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2409         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF MULTICHANNEL VIDEO PROGRAMMING AND                     INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE CONTRACTS.         (a) In General.--Section 305A of the Servicemembers Civil       Relief Act (50 U.S.C. 3956) is amended--        (1) in the section heading, by inserting ``, multichannel       video programming, and internet access'' after ``telephone'';        (2) in subsection (a), by adding at the end the following       new paragraph:        ``(4) Additional individuals covered.--For purposes of this       section, the following individuals shall be treated as a       servicemember covered by paragraph (1):        ``(A) A spouse of a servicemember who dies while in       military service or a spouse of a member of the reserve       components who dies while performing duty described in       subparagraph (B).        ``(B) A member of the reserve components performing       military service or performing full-time National Guard duty,       active Guard and Reserve duty, or inactive-duty training (as       such terms are defined in section 101(d) of title 10, United       States Code).'';        (3) in subsection (b), by striking ``cellular telephone       service or telephone exchange service'' and inserting       ``commercial mobile service, telephone exchange service,       Internet access service, or multichannel video programming       service'';        (4) in subsection (c), by inserting ``for commercial mobile       service or telephone exchange service'' before       ``terminated'';        (5) in subsection (d), in the matter preceding paragraph       (1), by striking ``cellular telephone service'' and inserting       ``commercial mobile service'';        (6) in subsection (e)--        (A) by striking ``For any'' and inserting the following:        ``(1) In general.--For any'';        (B) by striking ``If the'' and inserting the following:        ``(2) Reinstatement of service.--If the''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Return of provider-owned equipment.--If a       servicemember terminates a contract under subsection (a), the       servicemember shall return any provider-owned consumer       premises equipment to the service provider not later than 10       days after the date on which service is disconnected.''; and        (7) in subsection (g)--        (A) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (4); and        (B) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:        ``(1) The term `commercial mobile service' has the meaning       given that term in section 332(d) of the Communications Act       of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(d)).        ``(2) The term `multichannel video programming service'       means a subscription video service offered by a multichannel       video programming distributor, as that term is defined in       section 602 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.       522), over a system the distributor owns or controls.        ``(3) The term `provider-owned consumer premises equipment'       means any equipment that a provider of Internet access       service or multichannel video programming service rents or       loans to a customer during the provision of that service,       including gateways, routers, cable modems, voice-capable       modems, CableCARDs, converters, digital adapters, remote       controls, and any other equipment provided.''.

(2) Table of contents.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act is amended--        (A) by striking the item relating to title III and       inserting the following:  ``TITLE III--RENT, INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS, MORTGAGES, LIENS, ASSIGNMENT,                LEASES, COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE CONTRACTS'';       and  [[Page H7131]]         (B) by striking the item relating to section 305A and       inserting the following:  ``Sec. 305A. Termination of telephone, multichannel video programming,                and Internet access service contracts.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2409, as amended.   The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, SCRA, was enacted by Congress to  protect Active Duty servicemembers and members of the National Guard  and Reserve from financial charges and judicial obligations that could  incur due to their military service.   As most Americans know, cell phone companies charge early-termination  fees if a user cancels an agreement for service with the carrier before  their contract has expired. SCRA currently allows a servicemember who  is ordered to move or deploy for longer than 90 days to cancel their  cell phone contract without paying those fees. However, it does not  explicitly protect servicemembers from having to pay early-termination  fees for cable, satellite TV, or Internet access contracts.   H.R. 2409, as amended, which is sponsored by Congressman Ryan  Costello of Pennsylvania, would fix this inequity. I am grateful for  his efforts in this bill to acknowledge that servicemembers would be  given the same type of protections for cable, satellite TV, and  Internet contracts as those already in place for cell phone devices.   The bill would also extend those protections to surviving spouses of  servicemembers who are killed while on Active Duty.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Costello for bringing this bill  forward, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), author of the bill and former member  of the Committee on Veterans Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I was thinking here, as we were  listening to the testimony, when I went into the Army many, many years  ago to go to Southeast Asia, there was no internet, there was no cable  TV, and there were no cell phones, so it was pretty easy for me to  leave then. There wasn't much to leave. But things have changed a lot  since then. I encourage all Members to support H.R. 2409, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2787) to establish in the Department of Veterans  Affairs a pilot program instituting a clinical observation program for  pre-med students preparing to attend medical school, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 2787         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans-Specific Education       for Tomorrow's Health Professionals Act'' or the ``Vet HP       Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS PILOT PROGRAM FOR CLINICAL OBSERVATION                     BY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS.         It is the sense of Congress that the pilot program       described in section 3(a) should be designed to--        (1) increase the awareness, knowledge, and empathy of       future health professionals toward the health conditions       common to veterans;        (2) increase the diversity of the recruitment pool of       future physicians of the Department; and        (3) expand clinical observation opportunities for all       students by encouraging students of all backgrounds to       consider a career in the health professions.       SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PILOT PROGRAM FOR                     CLINICAL OBSERVATION BY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS.         (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       carry out a pilot program for a one-year period, beginning       not later than August 15, 2021, to provide certain students       described in subsection (d) a clinical observation experience       at medical centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs.        (b) Medical Center Selection.--The Secretary shall carry       out the pilot program under this section at not fewer than       five medical centers of the Department. In selecting such       medical centers, the Secretary shall ensure regional       diversity among such selected medical centers.        (c) Clinical Observation Sessions.--        (1) Frequency and duration.--In carrying out the pilot       program, the Secretary shall--        (A) provide at least one and not more than three clinical       observation sessions at each medical center selected during       each calendar year;        (B) ensure that each clinical observation session--        (i) lasts between four and six months; and        (ii) to the extent practicable, begins and ends       concurrently with one or more academic terms of an       institution of higher education (as defined in section 101 of       the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001)); and        (C) ensure that the clinical observation sessions provided       at a medical center have minimal overlap.        (2) Sessions.--The Secretary shall ensure that the pilot       program consists of clinical observation sessions as follows:        (A) Each session shall allow for not fewer than five       students nor greater than 15 students to participate in the       session.        (B) Each session shall consist of not fewer than 20       observational hours nor greater than 40 observational hours.        (C) A majority of the observational hours shall be spent       observing a health professional. The other observational       hours shall be spent in a manner that ensures a robust, well       rounded experience that exposes the students to a variety of       aspects of medical care and health care administration.        (D) Each session shall provide a diverse clinical       observation experience.        (d) Students.--        (1) Selection.--The Secretary shall select to participate       in the pilot program under subsection (a) students who are--        (A) nationals of the United States;        (B) enrolled in an accredited program of study at an       institution of higher education; and        (C) referred by their institution of higher education       following an internal application process.        (2) Priority.--In making such selection, the Secretary       shall give priority to each of the following five categories       of students:        (A) Students who, at the time of the completion of their       secondary education, resided in a health professional       shortage area (as defined in section 332 of the Public Health       Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e)).        (B) First generation college students (as defined in       section 402A(h)(3) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20       U.S.C. 1067q(a))).        (C) Students who have been referred by minority-serving       institutions (as defined in section 371(a) of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1067q(a))).        (D) Veterans (as defined in section 101 of title 38, United       States Code).        (E) Students who indicate an intention to specialize in a       health professional occupation identified by the Inspector       General of the Department under section 7412 of title 38,       United States Code, as having a staffing shortage.        (3) Assignment to medical centers.--The Secretary shall       assign students selected under paragraph (1) to medical       centers selected under subsection (b) without regard for       whether such medical centers have staffing shortages in any       health professional occupation pursuant to section 7412 of       title 38, United States Code.        (e) Other Matters.--In carrying out the pilot program under       this section, the Secretary shall--        (1) establish a formal status to facilitate the access to       medical centers of the Department by student observers       participating in the pilot program;        (2) establish standardized legal, privacy, and ethical       requirements for the student observers, including with       respect to--        (A) ensuring that no student observer provides any care to       patients while participating as an observer; and        (B) ensuring the suitability of a student to participate in       the pilot program to ensure that the student poses no risk to       patients;        (3) develop and implement a partnership strategy with       minority-serving institutions to encourage referrals;        (4) create standardized procedures for student observers;        (5) create an online information page about the pilot       program on the internet website of the Department;        (6) publish on the online information page created under       paragraph (5) the locations of such centers, and other       information on the pilot program, not later than 180 days       before the date on which applications are required to be       submitted by potential student observers;        (7) identify medical centers and specific health       professionals participating in the pilot program; and        (8) notify the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House       of Representatives and the Senate of the medical centers       selected under subsection (c) within 30 days of selection, to       facilitate program awareness.        (f) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the completion       of the pilot program under subsection (a), the Secretary       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Senate a report on the       results of the pilot program, including--        (1) the number and demographics of all applicants, those       accepted to participate in the pilot program, and those who       completed the pilot program; and        (2) if participating institutions of higher education       choose to administer satisfaction surveys that assess the       experience of those who completed the pilot program, the       results of any such satisfaction surveys, provided at the       discretion of the institution of higher education.       SEC. 4. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements       shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be       appropriated.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2787, as amended, the  Veterans-Specific Education for Tomorrow's Health Professionals Act.  The bill would create a pilot program to provide undergraduate students  with a clinical observation experience at the Department of Veterans  Affairs medical centers.   The pilot would give prospective providers a window into the  healthcare profession that would help inform their educational paths  and careers. It would also provide them an early introduction to both  the VA healthcare system and the medical conditions common among our  Nation's veterans.   VA has a number of recruitment and retention challenges, one of which  is an aging workforce that is increasingly retirement eligible. Given  that, it is imperative that VA take every available opportunity to  engage young clinicians and make a concerted effort to attract them to  a career serving veterans within the VA healthcare system.   This bill is sponsored by the Congresswoman from Ohio, Marcy Kaptur,  and I appreciate her efforts. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   In closing, I, too, came from rural America, and I, too, am a first- generation college graduate and had an opportunity to use the public  education system to go to college and medical school. After that, then  mentored and taught for over 25 years in medical school, so I had a  chance to see young students, and I think this is a fantastic idea.   I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for bringing  this forward. To bring a young person in who has never had a chance to  be in that sort of environment and expose them to this, you don't know  what sort of light bulb you are going to turn on in their head to  encourage them and mentor them. And many of them will become passionate  about medicine, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy,  audiology, PTSD treatment. I could go on and on. I think this is a  great idea. I strongly encourage all Members to support H.R. 2787, as  amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5538) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  provide for the inclusion of certain additional periods of active duty  service for purposes of suspending charges to veterans' entitlement to  educational assistance under the laws administered by the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs during periods of suspended participation in  vocational rehabilitation programs.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5538         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H7134]]            SECTION 1. INCLUSION OF CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PERIODS OF ACTIVE                     DUTY SERVICE FOR PURPOSES OF SUSPENSION OF                     CHARGES TO ENTITLEMENT DURING PERIODS OF                     SUSPENDED PARTICIPATION IN DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION                     PROGRAMS.         Section 3105(e)(2) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``or 12304'' and inserting ``12304,       12304a, or 12304b''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5538.   Under current law, if a member of the Guard or Reserve is called to  Active Duty under certain orders while receiving training through the  Department of Veterans Affairs Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment  program, the charges for that training are waived. However, those  charges are not waived for members of the Guard or Reserve who are  called up under orders regarding emergency response or augmentation of  overseas combat forces. This creates a disparity.   H.R. 5538 would address that disparity and level the playing field by  waiving training charges for all servicemembers, regardless of which  Active-Duty orders they are serving under.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1830     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Peters for bringing up  this much-needed piece of legislation and correcting this inequity. It  wasn't intended, but now this Congress has a chance, in a bipartisan  way, to correct this.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 5538, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the  [[Page H7135]]  bill (H.R. 5649) to amend titles 10 and 38, United States Code, to  amend the Social Security Act, and to direct the Secretaries of  Veterans Affairs, Defense, Labor, and Homeland Security, and the  Administrator of the Small Business Administration, to take certain  actions to improve transition assistance to members of the Armed Forces  who separate, retire, or are discharged from the Armed Forces, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5649, as amended, the  Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder (Ret.) Transition  Improvements Act of 2018.   One of the most important things our government can do to help our  Nation's servicemembers is to ensure that their transition from  military to civilian life is as smooth and seamless as possible. We all  know that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I know  that so many of the problems that veterans encounter later in life  could have been mitigated if they had a more supportive and successful  transition.   I know that the goal of this bill, and of provisions that are aimed  at improving the transition period in the House version of the National  Defense Authorization Act, are to help servicemembers have as smooth a  transition as possible to civilian life.   I will allow Congressman Jodey Arrington of Texas, who is the sponsor  of this bill, to go into the specifics of it in a moment. But before I  do, I want to thank him, Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas, and all of  the members of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity for taking the  time earlier this session to sit down with stakeholders and really  examine the transition process from the very beginning and look at the  need for improvements.   While this bill is a culmination of bipartisan review and work, it is  only a step in the process to ensure a successful transition for all  servicemembers. I know we will remain dedicated to making improvements  to this process to reach this goal.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for helping to expedite the  consideration of the bill today, and I thank Congressman Arrington for  his work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, July 16, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On July 12, 2018, the Committee on       Veterans' Affairs ordered reported H.R. 5649, as amended, the       Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder (Ret.)       Transition Improvement Act of 2018. The bill was referred to       the House Veterans' Affairs Committee with additional       referrals to the House Ways and Means Committee and the House       Armed Services Committee. Based on our previous consultation,       we intend to request H.R. 5649, as amended, be scheduled for       floor consideration.        To expedite floor consideration, I ask that you forego       further consideration of H.R. 5649, as amended. This in no       way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the House       Ways and Means Committee represented on the conference       committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter       and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on       H.R. 5649, as amended, as well as in the Congressional Record       during floor consideration to memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,                                                David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                      Washington, DC, July 17, 2018.      Hon. David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Roe: Thank you for your July 16, 2018 letter       regarding H.R. 5649, the ``Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer       William ``Bill'' Mulder (Ret.) Transition Improvement Act of       2018'' which was ordered favorably reported to the House on       July 12, 2018.        As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       in H.R. 5649 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal       consideration of this bill so that it may move expeditiously       to the floor. The Committee on Ways and Means takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation, and requests your support for       such request.        Finally, would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration of H.R. 5649.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Arrington), chairman of the Economic Opportunity  Subcommittee on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and my good  friend.    I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional  1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), my good friend, a former member of the  committee, and chair of the Subcommittee on Health, also a member of  the House Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Rutherford) a former, very active member on the  Veterans Affairs Committee, and a good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I want to close by thanking Mr.  Arrington and Mr. O'Rourke for bringing this great piece of legislation  to the floor.   As I was listening to the debate and conversation, it sort of took me  back a few years. I recall 53 years ago, when I was a college student,  and I buried a very good friend of mine, who was my Scoutmaster, First  Sergeant Thomas E. Thayer, who was killed in Vietnam. He won the Silver  Star there. He had four children and a family at home. His life was  worth, I think, $10,000. I think that is what it was worth. I thought  about what it did to his family and how little our country did for our  Nation's heroes at that time, and I fast-forward to what we are doing  now. We are making some things right.   I know Mr. Arrington spoke very warmly of his friend, Chief Petty  Officer Bill Mulder, a true American hero, who died.   I know when I separated from the military at the end of 1974, got  back from Southeast Asia, separated from the Army, there was no  transition. It was basically just out the front gate you went, and no  one called, checked, whatever.   We are much better as a country, and we are much better now, Mr.  Speaker, for what we are doing in this bill.   I agree with Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. Arrington. I really believe if you  put these young men and women back in a job, in school, which we just  passed the Forever GI Bill from this committee and the President has  signed it into law, all of these things, I think, will make a huge  difference in the future not only of these young people who have served  our Nation so honorably, but it will also help this country, this  Nation.   I know, as a veteran and as a person who did not benefit from this, I  certainly am more than happy to support this. I think this is a great  piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Mr. Walz, Mr. Takano, and others  who have helped push this through, and I again encourage all Members to  support H.R. 5649, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H7140]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5882) to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act  to provide for the termination by a spouse of a lessee of certain  leases when the lessee dies while in military service, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5882         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gold Star Spouses Leasing       Relief Act''.       SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF LEASES OF PREMISES OF DECEASED                     SERVICEMEMBERS WHO DIE WHILE IN MILITARY                     SERVICE.         Section 305(a) of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50       U.S.C. 3955) is amended--        (1) in the subsection heading, by striking ``by Lessee'';        (2) in the heading for paragraph (1), by striking ``In       general'' and inserting ``Termination by lessee''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(3) Death of lessee.--The spouse of the lessee on a lease       described in subsection (b)(1) may terminate the lease during       the one-year period beginning on the date of the death of the       lessee, if the lessee dies while in military service or while       performing full-time National Guard duty, active Guard and       Reserve duty, or inactive-duty training (as such terms are       defined in section 101(d) of title 10, United States       Code).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5882, as amended, the  Gold Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act.   The death of a servicemember can have a profound impact on their  loved ones. Our government should take every measure necessary to help  family members through such a time of need.   In recognition of that, the Gold Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act  would amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the SCRA, to allow a  spouse of a servicemember who has died due to military service to break  their residential lease without penalty within 1 year of the  servicemember's death.   Mr. Speaker, paying fees for breaking a lease should be the last  thing on someone's mind when they are confronting life without their  spouse.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the sponsor of this bill, Congresswoman  Cheri Bustos of Illinois, for her commonsense solution to this problem.  I also want to thank Ranking Member Walz and his staff for their  suggestion to improve the bill by including in it a provision that  would extend protection to surviving spouses of members of the National  Guard and Reserve whose death occurred while on Active-Duty orders.   We should recognize the service of all servicemembers on Active-Duty  orders, and I am glad the amended version of this bill includes that  provision.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup). He spoke a moment ago. He has previously  served as chair of the Health Subcommittee of the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, associate my comments with  Mr. Takano.   I grew up in a military town, Clarksville, Tennessee, where, during  the Vietnam war, I saw all too many families broken apart, had to move.  I find it almost unimaginable that a landlord would insist that  somebody not separate, not do this when they have lost a spouse.   That beautiful family that she showed, their lives are changed  forever, and the last thing that young widow needed to worry about was  that. She needed to take care of those children, to explain why their  father was not coming home or, in another case, their mother might not  be coming home.   Mr. Speaker, I can't think of any bill that deserves the support more  than this one does, and I encourage all Members to support H.R. 5882,  as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5864) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to establish qualifications for the human resources positions within  the Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans  Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5864         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Hospitals Establishing       Leadership Performance Act''.       SEC. 2. QUALIFICATIONS FOR HUMAN RESOURCES POSITIONS WITHIN                     THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION OF THE                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Establishment of Qualifications.--Not later than 180       days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall--        (1) establish qualifications for each human resources       position within the Veterans Health Administration of the       Department of Veterans Affairs;        (2) establish standardized performance metrics for each       such position; and        (3) submit to Congress a report containing the       qualifications and standardized performance metrics       established under paragraphs (1) and (2).        (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the       establishment of the qualifications and performance metrics       under subsection (a), the Comptroller General of the United       States shall submit to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of       the House of Representatives and the Committee on Veterans'       Affairs of the Senate a report containing--        (1) a description of the implementation of such       qualifications and performance metrics; and        (2) an assessment of the quality of such qualifications and       performance metrics.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements       shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be       appropriated.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5864, the VA Hospitals  Establishing Leadership Performance Act, or the VA HELP Act.   The significant recruitment and retention challenges facing the VA  healthcare system are nothing new. One of my priorities as chairman has  been to help the VA address those challenges and attract high-quality  clinicians and support staff to VA medical facilities. To that end, I  have worked to see two major pieces of legislation--the VA Choice and  Quality Employment Act, and the VA Mission Act--signed into law this  Congress include extensive improvements to the VA's hiring authorities.   However, those improvements will not be nearly as effective as they  could be if the HR professionals that are administering them aren't  operating at the top of their game. Unfortunately, the committee has  found several instances where it appeared that some HR staff working in  VA medical facilities had substandard education and professional  backgrounds, including one HR director at a VA medical center who  lacked both a college degree and relevant work experience.   To prevent that, the VA HELP Act would require the VA to establish  qualification standards and standardized performance metrics for HR  within the VHA. To ensure transparency and to aid the committee in our  ongoing oversight efforts, it would also require the VA to provide  Congress with a copy of those qualification standards and performance  metrics, as well as require the Government Accountability Office to  conduct an assessment of them.   I wholeheartedly believe that this bill will result in better staffed  VA medical facilities, and, therefore, a  [[Page H7142]]  more accessible VA healthcare system for our Nation's heroes.   I am grateful to the sponsor of the VA HELP Act, my colleague and  friend, Congressman  Mike Bost of Illinois. Mike is the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, a tireless  advocate for veterans and their families, and, I might add, a veteran  himself.   Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his leadership on this bill. I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting it, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Bost), the chairman of the Disability Assistance and  Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, who also is a Marine veteran who has  drunk from the Devil Dog fountain at Belleau Wood.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support H.R. 5864, as amended, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5938) to amend the VA Choice and Quality Employment  Act to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a vacancy  and recruitment database to facilitate the recruitment of certain  members of the Armed Forces to satisfy the occupational needs of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, to establish and implement a training  and certification program for intermediate care technicians in that  Department, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5938         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5938, as amended, the  Veterans Serving Veterans Act. This bill is sponsored by my friend and  fellow committee member, the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss  Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon).   Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful for her hard work and leadership on  this bill on behalf of our Nation's veterans in Puerto Rico and across  the country. The Veterans Serving Veterans Act contains two provisions  that would help alleviate staffing shortages at the Department of  Veterans Affairs medical facilities and create employment opportunities  for servicemembers separating from the Armed Forces.   First, it would expand VA's recruiting database to include  information about soon-to-be separated servicemembers whose military  training and experience match open positions within the VA healthcare  system. It is common sense.   Second, it would expand an existing pilot program that recruits  former medics to serve as intermediate care technicians in VA medical  facilities. We all know that, all other things being equal, veterans  prefer being seen and treated by their peers. This bill would create a  pathway for that to happen more often, while addressing the serious  recruitment issues that continue to hamper VA medical facilities coast  to coast.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to our next  speaker, I want to tell Members about this young woman. She represents  the island of Puerto Rico, and before one of the hurricanes hit, I  called her on the phone just moments before the hurricane. I was amazed  that I even got through.   Following that, we led a group. I came to visit the hospital and the  island of Puerto Rico, and the passion that she shows for the people  she represents, and the passion she shows for veterans, is second to  none.   I wanted to pass that along. I saw something in this young woman down  there that I had not seen before I visited her beautiful island.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico  (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), a member of the Veterans Affairs' Committee.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe  for, first of all, visiting the island. This is the first time ever the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs ever visited Puerto Rico. I thank the  gentleman for that, for his leadership, and for his commitment, and the  ranking member's commitment, during the last months.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my bill, H.R. 5938,  the Veterans Serving Veterans Act of 2018. This bill seeks to alleviate  chronic staffing shortages that currently affect the Department of  Veterans Affairs, which hinders their ability to serve our veterans in  an effective and timely manner.   This issue never fails to come up during those meetings with veterans  residing in Puerto Rico and is often discussed by my colleagues here in  the House. H.R. 5938 seeks a remedial option to this issue by doing two  things.   First, amending section 208 of the VA Choice and Quality Employment  Act of 2017 to include the military occupational specialties of soon- to-be discharged servicemembers that correspond to vacant positions at  the VA in the recruiting database, as well as servicemembers' contact  information and the date of discharge. Inclusion in the database is  completely optional for those servicemembers. If included, they will  potentially be matched for vacant positions at the VA that correspond  with the skills they acquired with the Department of Defense.   Second, the bill will also require the VA to implement a program to  train  [[Page H7144]]  and certify former Department of Defense healthcare technicians as  intermediate care technicians, ICTs, to address the large demand for  healthcare providers at the Veterans Health Administration.    These very skilled technicians trained by the DOD have difficulty  gaining employment in their field after separating from the Armed  Forces due to the lack of a certification. At the same time, the VHA  has a significant shortage of providers. The ICT program has a high  satisfaction rate and helps fill this void.   Servicemembers are a remarkable asset upon transitioning from the  Department of Defense. We should do everything we can do to foster this  transition and facilitate this opportunity to our men and women in  uniform to serve our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I need to again thank Chairman Roe for his leadership.  For me, it is an honor to serve on this committee with a gentleman who  has this commitment and who works in a bipartisan manner with Ranking  Member Walz and Congressman Takano. I thank the gentlemen for their  support. It is an honor to improve so many bills like this with these  amendments.   Their leadership and assistance in moving this bill forward make us  all proud, so I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support H.R. 5938, as amended, and I yield back the balance  of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5974) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to use on-site regulated medical waste treatment systems at certain  Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5974         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans       Affairs Creation of On-Site Treatment Systems Affording       Veterans Improvements and Numerous General Safety       Enhancements Act'' or the ``VA COST SAVINGS Enhancements       Act''.       SEC. 2. USE OF ON-SITE REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE TREATMENT                     SYSTEMS AT DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS                     FACILITIES.         (a) Identification of Facilities.--The Secretary of       Veterans Affairs shall identify Department of Veterans       Affairs facilities that would benefit from cost savings       associated with the use of an on-site regulated medical waste       treatment system over a five-year period.        (b) Regulated Medical Waste Cost Analysis Model.--For       purposes of carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary shall       develop a uniform regulated medical waste cost analysis model       to be used to determine the cost savings associated with the       use of an on-site regulated medical waste treatment system at       Department facilities. Such model shall be designed to       calculate savings based on--        (1) the cost of treating regulated medical waste at an off-      site location under a contract with a non-Department entity,       compared to        (2) the cost of treating regulated medical waste on-site,       based on the equipment specification of treatment system       manufacturers, with capital costs amortized over a ten-year       period.        (c) Installation.--At each Department facility identified       under subsection (a), the Secretary shall secure, install,       and operate an on-site regulated medical waste treatment       system.        (d) Use of Blanket Purchase Agreement.--Any medical waste       treatment system purchased pursuant to this section shall be       purchased under the blanket purchase agreement known as the       ``VHA Regulated Medical Waste On-Site Treatment Equipment       Systems Blanket Purchase Agreement'' or any successor,       contract, agreement, or other arrangement.        (e) Regulated Medical Waste Defined.--In this section, the       term ``regulated medical waste'' has the meaning given such       term under section 173.134(a)(5) of title 49, Code of Federal       Regulations, concerning regulated medical waste and       infectious substances, or any successor regulation, except       that, in the case of an applicable State law that is more       expansive, the definition in the State law shall apply.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements       shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be       appropriated.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5974, as amended, the  Department of Veterans Affairs Creation of On-Site Treatment Systems  Affording Veterans Improvements and Numerous General Safety  Enhancements, or, perhaps the most creative naming of a bill since I  have been in Congress, the VA COST SAVINGS Enhancements Act.   This bill will require VA to identify facilities that could benefit  from onsite medical waste management and, in those facilities, install  and operate onsite medical waste treatment capabilities.   The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention both consider onsite medical waste management to be a best  practice. However, only a relatively small percentage of VA medical  facilities have installed onsite sterilization equipment to date.   By considering which VA medical facilities could find value in onsite  medical waste management and making a deliberate effort to transition  those facilities away from off-site medical waste management  arrangements, VA could achieve considerable savings of taxpayer dollars  that could, in turn, be used to fund other VA initiatives. It would  also result in more VA facilities utilizing a waste disposal method  that is both safer and more environmentally friendly.   This bill is sponsored by Congressman Jeff Denham from California,  and I thank him for bringing this issue to the committee's attention. I  applaud the gentleman for his creativity in coming up with an acronym  for a bill of this size.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting it,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Denham), who is my friend and a fellow veteran.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.   At this time, I want to thank both minority and majority staffs for  the hard work they have done on these eight bills. We once again have  shown that we can work in a bipartisan way and close many loopholes  that no one ever attempted in previous law or just common sense, like  when a spouse has lost their loved one to be free to move along with a  cable bill or a lease and other issues that we have dealt with here  today.    I want to thank Mr. Takano, Mr. Walz, the staff on the minority side,  and the staff on the majority side for the hard work that they have  done on all of these bills. The committee will continue to move forward  with other bills later in the year.   Mr. Speaker, I once again encourage all Members to support H.R. 5974,  as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
