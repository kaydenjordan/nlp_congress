 Mr. Speaker, on December 13 through December 15, First  Baptist Church of Jackson will present Carols by Candlelight, a much- loved Christmas music tradition in Mississippi that shares the good  news of the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ, through a magnificent  Christmas concert.   This year, Carols by Candlelight celebrates its 50th anniversary,  with more than 325 choir members, 60 orchestra members, and hundreds of  volunteers. They will present five live performances for more than  16,000 people while many more will watch online.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate First Baptist Jackson on achieving this  special milestone.   May God bless this 50th anniversary performance of Carols by  Candlelight.   ``Soli Deo Gloria.'' To God alone be the glory.                            ____________________
