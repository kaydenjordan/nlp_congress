 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to thank my  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their hard work in  presenting this bill, but I am going to cast a very strong ``no'' vote  on this legislation. This morning I want to say a few words about why I  am voting no, to talk about the number of amendments I have submitted  to this bill, and to express my very serious concerns about our  Nation's bloated military budget, particularly in light of the many  unmet needs we face as a nation.  [[Page S3732]]    Also, I must express a very serious objection to the fact that we are  dealing with a $716 billion piece of legislation that is more than half  of the discretionary budget, yet we will in all likelihood not have a  process that allows for amendments to be debated--$716 billion, at a  time when, in Louisiana, as I understand it, they are now going to be  cutting food stamps for hungry children, when schools throughout this  country don't have enough money for books or for teachers' salaries. We  are talking about a $716 billion military budget and this process, as I  understand it, will allow for no amendments, despite the fact that  virtually every Member of the Senate has concerns about this bill.   Over and over again I have heard my Republican colleagues and a  number of Democratic colleagues come to the floor and talk about a very  serious issue, and that is the $21 trillion national debt we are  leaving our kids and our grandchildren. But somehow, when it comes to  giving huge tax breaks--$1 trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1  percent--suddenly we don't hear much about that national debt. When it  comes to spending $716 billion on a defense bill, my Republican friends  are mute. Suddenly the debt has disappeared because it is OK to spend  unlimited sums of money on the military.   I have heard my Republican colleagues tell us that the United States  just cannot afford to join the rest of the industrialized world--every  other major country--and guarantee healthcare for all of our people as  a right to a Medicare for All program. It is what the American people  want, but I am told we cannot afford that. We can afford $716 billion  in 1 year for the military, but healthcare for our children, for our  working people, for the 30 million people who have no health insurance,  and for the tens of millions of people who cannot afford health  insurance--that we cannot afford.   At the moment that we are engaged in a highly competitive global  economy, I am told over and over again that we cannot afford to make  public colleges and universities tuition-free. Hundreds of thousands of  our young people are unable to go to college because their families  lack the income. Millions leave school deeply in debt. No, no, no, we  cannot afford to make public colleges and universities tuition-free,  but we can afford to spend $716 billion in 1 year on the military.   Over half of older Americans have no retirement savings--no  retirement savings--yet we have Republican colleagues in the House and  here in the Senate who say: Oh, we can't afford Social Security. We  have to cut Social Security for people who are trying to get by on  $12,000, $13,000, $14,000 a year, cutting their prescription drugs in  half. Cut Social Security, yes, but think about dealing with the $716  billion military budget in a rational way? No, no, no, we can't afford  to do that. We can't even afford to accept amendments here on the  floor.   The time is long overdue for us to take a hard look at the enormous  amount of waste, cost overruns, fraud, and financial mismanagement that  has plagued the Department of Defense for decades.   I have heard many of my Republican colleagues worry that low-income  people are taking advantage of this program or that program. Do you  know where the money is? The money is with the Department of Defense,  and it may be time that we take a hard look at the fraud and the  financial mismanagement that exists there. That is why I am offering a  bipartisan amendment. I want to thank Senators Grassley and Lee for  their support on this amendment to end the absurdity of the Department  of Defense being the only Federal agency that has not undergone an  audit.    It will not surprise the Presiding Officer to note that according to  a Gallup poll in February, a few months ago, 65 percent of the American  people oppose spending more money on the Department of Defense; 65  percent say that we should not spend more money, yet over a 2-year  period, we are going to spend some $165 billion more on the defense.   So it shouldn't shock anyone that what happens here is a direct  contradiction to what the American people want. The American people  want healthcare for all; my Republican colleagues want to throw 30  million people off of health insurance. The American people want to ask  the rich and powerful to pay more in taxes; our Republican colleagues  give massive tax breaks to the top 1 percent.   In defense spending, it is just the same thing. The American people  say: I can't afford to send my kids to college, I can't afford  childcare, and I can't afford housing. We need help. But nobody listens  to that. We don't have lobbyists here fighting for working families so  they can find affordable housing or affordable prescription drugs, but  today we are listening to the military industrial complex and talking  about a $165 billion increase in 2 years for the military.   As a point in comparison--and I hope everyone hears this--the  increase in military spending, the $165 billion over 2 years that we  recently approved is larger than the entire military budget of China.  China spends about $150 billion a year on defense. We have increased  military spending by $165 billion over 2 years.   Russia spends about $61 billion on defense annually. So children in  Louisiana may be losing their food stamps and go hungry, but we are  voting on a bill of $716 billion at a time when Russia spends about of  $61 billion on defense.   There are enormous needs in this country in Vermont, in California,  and all across this country. We might want to listen to the needs of  working people rather than just lobbyists from the military industrial  complex.   I believe in a strong national defense, but we cannot continue to  give the Pentagon and defense contractors like Lockheed Martin a blank  check while we ignore the basic needs of working families throughout  this country. What this debate should be about--and, unfortunately, it  will not be about--is our national priorities.   Do we have to spend more money on defense than the next 10 countries  combined when children in America go hungry, when veterans sleep out on  the street, when we are the only major country that does not guarantee  healthcare to all people? I say no, and I say that the time is long  overdue for us to stand up to the lobbyists and the military industrial  complex and fight for rational national priorities.   About half of the Pentagon's $716 billion budget goes directly into  the hands of private contractors, not into the hands of our troops.  Let's be clear. Over the past two decades, virtually every major  defense contractor in the United States has paid millions of dollars in  fines and settlements for misconduct and fraud, all--at the same time-- while making huge profits on government contracts.   Since 1995, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and United Technologies have  paid nearly $3 billion in fines or related settlements for fraud or  misconduct--$3 billion--at a time when oversight, frankly, is pretty  weak. Yet those three companies alone received about $800 billion in  defense contracts over the past 18 years.   One of the amendments I have filed would simply require the Pentagon  to establish a website on defense contract fraud with a list of  companies convicted of defrauding the Federal Government, the total  value of contracts awarded to such companies, and a list of  recommendations for ways the Pentagon can penalize fraudulent  contractors. My guess is that fraud is a way of doing business and  these settlements are simply a cost of doing business for companies who  have huge contracts with the Department of Defense. That has to stop.   Further, I find it interesting that the very same defense contractors  that have been found guilty or reached settlements for fraud are also  paying their CEOs and executives excessive and obscene compensation  packages. Last year, the CEO of Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, two of  the top U.S. defense contractors, were each paid over $20 million in  total compensation. Moreover, more than 90 percent of the revenue of  those companies came from defense spending. So they get the bulk of  their money from the taxpayers of the United States, and then they pay  their CEOs exorbitant compensation packages.   I think the American people might like to know why a defense  contractor can pay its CEO 100 times more than the Secretary of  Defense, whose salary is capped at $205,000. To my mind, that is a  reasonable question. How does the CEO of a defense contractor get 100  times more salary than the Secretary  [[Page S3733]]  of Defense? That is why I have filed an amendment to prohibit defense  contractor CEOs from making more money than the Secretary of Defense.   Moreover, as the GAO has told us, there are massive cost overruns in  the Defense Department's acquisition budget that we have to address.  According to the GAO, the Pentagon's $1.66 trillion acquisition  portfolio currently suffers from more than $537 billion in cost  overruns, with much of the cost growth taking place after production.   I was the mayor of the city of Burlington, VT, for 8 years. Like  other mayors throughout the country--Democrats, Republicans,  Independents, whatever--you sit down and negotiate a contract with  someone who perhaps is going to repave the streets. The contractor  says: ``I'm going to do it for $5 million,'' and you sign a  contract. You don't accept the fact that the contractor comes back and  says: Oh, I am sorry, I made a little mistake. It is going to cost you  people $10 million.    That is not the way it was done in Burlington. That is not the way it  is done in cities or States throughout this country. But apparently  that is the way it is done at the Department of Defense.   Oh, yes, Mr. Secretary, we are going to do this weapons system for $5  billion. We made a mistake; you have to pay us $10 billion.   No problem. No worries. Nobody in Congress is going to raise any  issue about that.   GAO tells us that ``many DOD programs fall short of cost, schedule,  and performance expectations, meaning DOD pays more than anticipated,  can buy less than expected, and, in some cases, delivers less  capability to the warfighter.'' That is not from Bernie Sanders; that  is from the GAO.   Let me repeat. A major reason there is so much waste, fraud, and  abuse at the Pentagon is that the Department of Defense remains the  only Federal agency in America that hasn't been able to pass an  independent audit 28 years after Congress required it to do so. I know  the Federal bureaucracy moves slowly, but 28 years should be enough  time for the DOD to do what Congress demanded that it do.   The amendment Senator Grassley, Senator Lee, and I have filed  couldn't be simpler. It simply says that if the Pentagon can't pass a  clean audit by fiscal year 2022--not tomorrow; fiscal year 2022--then a  small portion of the defense budget--about $100 million--will be  redirected to deficit reduction.   Interestingly, you may recall that on September 10, 2001--1 day  before 9/11--former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who was  George W. Bush's Secretary of Defense, said:         Our financial systems are decades old. According to some       estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We       cannot share information from floor to floor in this building       because it's stored on dozens of technological systems that       are inaccessible or incompatible.    In 2001, Donald Rumsfeld, George Bush's Secretary of Defense, said  that DOD could not track $2.3 trillion in transactions. Yet, 17 years  after Mr. Rumsfeld's comments, the Department of Defense has still not  passed a clean audit, despite the fact that the Pentagon controls  assets in excess of $2.2 trillion, or roughly 70 percent of what the  entire Federal Government owns.   The Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan  concluded in 2011 that $31 to $60 billion spent in Iraq and Afghanistan  had been lost to fraud and waste. Children in America go hungry. Young  people leave school deeply in debt. People in this country cannot  afford healthcare. But $31 to $60 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan has  been lost through fraud and waste. Maybe--just maybe--we might want to  get our priorities right and take a look at that issue.   Separately, in 2015, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  Reconstruction reported that the Pentagon could not account for $45  billion in funding for reconstruction projects. More recently, an audit  conducted by Ernst & Young for the Defense Logistics Agency found that  it could not properly account for $800 million in construction  projects.   It is time to hold the Department of Defense to the same level of  accountability as the rest of the government.   I would also like to briefly mention an amendment that, to me, makes  an enormous amount of sense. In this bill, we are spending $716 billion  in defense spending in order to protect the American people. What this  bill does is spend that money on the production of fighter planes,  bombs, guns, missiles, tanks, nuclear weapons, submarines, and other  weapons of destruction. This amendment I have submitted would reduce  the defense budget by one-tenth of 1 percent. That is not a massive  cut. We would use that $700 million to make our country safer by  reaching out to people throughout the world in ways that bring us  together through educational and cultural programs.   At the end of the day, it is not necessarily true that guns and tanks  and missiles are the only way we will be safe. We will be safer when  people throughout the world get to know each other and understand the  common humanity that they have, when kids from Iran and Burlington, VT,  can sit down and talk about the issues they face.   This amendment is about helping to make us safer by investing in  educational programs, allowing our kids to go abroad to learn about  other countries, and allowing kids from other countries to come into  the United States. Dialogue alone taking place between Foreign  Ministers or diplomats at the United Nations is not the only way  countries can relate to each other. That type of dialogue, that type of  communication, that type of sharing of who we are should be taking  place between people throughout the world at the grassroots level-- among young people, among older people, among working people, among  academics.    Let's try to destroy the hatred that exists throughout the world  based on fear and ignorance by allowing people to get to know each  other. One-tenth of 1 percent would go toward that effort.   On a separate note, since March of 2015, the U.S. Armed Forces have  been involved in hostilities between a Saudi-led coalition and the  Houthis in Yemen. I believe it is long past time that we put an end to  our unconstitutional and unauthorized participation in this war. To my  mind, there is no question that U.S. participation in the war in Yemen  is unauthorized and unconstitutional. It is the Congress of the United  States that decides whether this country goes to war, not the  President.   The truth about Yemen is that U.S. forces have been actively engaged  in support of the Saudi coalition in this war, providing intelligence  and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of  people and made the current humanitarian crisis in Yemen the worst  humanitarian crisis on the face of the planet today.   Even now as I speak, there are reports that an attack on the Yemeni  port city of Hodeidah by the Saudi-led coalition is imminent. Hodeidah  is a key entry point for humanitarian aid into Yemen. The U.N.  Humanitarian Coordinator in the country, Lisa Grande, said last week  that ``a military attack or siege on Hodeidah will impact hundreds of  thousands of innocent civilians. . . . In a prolonged worst case, we  fear that as many as 250,000 people may lose everything--even their  lives.''   The Trump administration has tried to justify our involvement in the  Yemen war as necessary to push back on Iran. Well, another  administration told us that invading Iraq was necessary to confront al- Qaida, and another told us that the Vietnam war was necessary to  contain communism. None of that turned out to be true.   I believe that we have become far too comfortable with the United  States engaging in military interventions all over the world. We have  now been in Afghanistan for 17 years--the longest war in American  history. We have been in Iraq for 15 years. Our troops are now in Syria  under what I believe are questionable authorities, and the  administration has indicated that it may broaden that mission even  more.   The time is long overdue for Congress to reassert its constitutional  responsibility over sending our men and women into war. It is the  Congress that makes that decision. It couldn't be clearer in the  Constitution. It is not the President of the United States. That is why  I have filed a bipartisan amendment, along with Senators Lee, Murphy,  Warren, and several others, that would put an end to U.S. involvement  in the war in Yemen.   Let me conclude by saying this: I think everybody in the Congress  believes and understands that we need a  [[Page S3734]]  strong defense. There is no debate about that. But we do not need a  defense budget that is bloated, that is wasteful, and that has in it  many areas of fraud.   Let me remind some of my Republican colleagues--it is hard to  believe, but Dwight D. Eisenhower, who led American troops in World War  II, was a Republican. This is what he said as he was leaving office,  which is as true today as when he said it in 1960. He said:         Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every       rocket signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who       hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not       clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It       is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its       scientists, the hopes of its children. . . . This is not a       way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of       threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.    That is what Dwight D. Eisenhower said way back when. Those are words  that I think we should remember today.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
