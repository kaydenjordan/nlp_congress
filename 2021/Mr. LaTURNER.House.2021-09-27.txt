 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of energy  producers across our country and especially in my home State of Kansas.   Over the past 9 months the Biden administration has put American  energy producers on the back burner. Kansans are already paying over 40  percent more at the pump than they were last year, and yet my  colleagues across the aisle want to ram through a reckless $3.5  trillion spending spree that would lead to the largest tax increase on  working families and small businesses in decades.   There is a laundry list of bad policy in this spending spree,  including the Clean Electricity Performance Program, a Federal takeover  of our Nation's electricity. This $150 billion program would dictate  how we power our homes, businesses, and everyday lives.   Democrats want to mandate energy providers to distribute a certain  amount of renewable energy to their customers. Those who comply will  get grants from the Department of Energy, while those falling short  would have to pay fees to the Federal Government. This plan is  absolutely ridiculous and will only make energy more expensive,  undermine our grid reliability, and make our Nation even more dependent  on Communist China.    As these massive Democrat spending sprees continue to make their way  through committees and eventually to the House floor, I will continue  to fight for Kansas energy producers.   Our focus needs to be encouraging domestic energy production across  the country, having a robust energy portfolio, and ending our reliance  on foreign energy.   Democrats seem to think it is impossible to have affordable,  bountiful, and innovative energy while also having clean air and water.  That is simply not true. Oil and gas produced here in the United States  is among the cleanest and safest in the world. It is time to end the  assault on our energy producers and return to American energy  independence.
