 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I share my  colleague's concern about making sure our servicemembers don't miss a  paycheck because of a potential government shutdown. In fact, I don't  want  [[Page S4704]]  any of our Federal workers to miss a paycheck or any of the programs  families rely on to be undermined by a completely unnecessary shutdown,  which is why I am working around the clock to make sure we pass the  bipartisan CR package, which we released yesterday, because that is the  only serious issue and solution here. That is the only way we make sure  that everyone is able to keep doing the work the American people count  on and get the paycheck they deserve.   Let's be real. There are a lot of programs I care about, a lot of  programs we all care about, that would be hurt by a shutdown. So we are  not going to solve this problem one by one, bit by bit, carve-out by  carve-out. You do not stop a flood one drop at a time; you build a dam.   We do have a straightforward, bipartisan CR package to avoid a  shutdown and keep our military paid. We should do our jobs, get that  done, and get it passed. That is principle, Mr. President, not  politics. Do our jobs and pass this bill so we don't have a shutdown.   I object.
