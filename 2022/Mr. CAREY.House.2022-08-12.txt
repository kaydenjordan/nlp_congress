 Mr. Speaker, Americans are in the midst of a recession and  the worst inflation in over 40 years, yet my friends across the aisle  are set to pass a $745 billion spending bill that will raise taxes,  fund the Green New Deal initiatives, and hire 87,000 IRS agents to  target Americans--all this while doing nothing to reduce inflation and  adding over $146 billion in debt.   Now, they say it won't raise taxes on people making less than  $400,000, but the Joint Committee on Taxation has said at least half of  all new tax revenue raised will come from those earning under $400,000.   Probably the biggest thing for me is the 87,000 new IRS agents. To  folks back in Ohio, I just want to put this in a way that you can  understand. That is 10,000 more people than live in the city of Parma.  That is 17,000 more people that live in the city of Canton, 23,000 more  than in Youngstown.   This is not the Inflation Reduction Act. This is the audit America  act.                                time  1300
