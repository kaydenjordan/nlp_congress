 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Northside  High School Women's Softball team on winning the class 3 State  championship, the program's first State title since 2010 and its second  win in history.   Beating the York Falcons by 3-1, the Vikings delivered strong  performances needed to win.   These talented athletes include Baylee Compton, McKenzie Taylor,  Leila Aguilar, Sydney Jordan, Karlee Austin, and Abbie Caldwell.   Baylee pitched a five-hitter for the Vikings, striking out 16 of the  Falcons' players and walking one.   The Vikings scored twice in the top of the fifth to grab a 2-1 lead.  In the seventh inning, the ladies scored another run, then held strong  on defense to prevent the Falcons from catching up.   Mr. Speaker, all of these young ladies are a true testament that with  hard work and determination, you can achieve your dreams.   We congratulate, again, all of the players, Coach Kassie Brammer,  their families, as well as the Northside faculty and staff.   Virginia's Sixth Congressional District is incredibly proud of their  accomplishment.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, years of out-of-control government spending  has fueled inflation and skyrocketed our Federal debt. It is far past  time we prioritize those most important core functions of government as  intended by our Founders in the Constitution.   The fiscal year 2024 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill  does just that. It prioritizes programs for those most important: our  Nation's veterans, and facilities for our men and women defending our  country.    My, my, my, what do we hear from the other side? Complaints about not  being able to fly certain flags at military bases, complaints about not  being able to fund climate change bureaucracies in our veterans'  facilities, complaints about actually not being able to use taxpayer  dollars to fund abortion services.   This bill focuses on core government functions. It fully funds  veterans' healthcare, veterans' benefits and VA programs. It ensures  our veterans get the medical treatment and benefits they deserve. It  provides funds to the agencies that ensure our military and veterans  are appropriately honored in our cemeteries and battle monuments, and  it prioritizes our Nation's Active Duty servicemembers and their  families by providing nearly $800 million above the President's budget  request for military construction and family housing. Let me repeat  that: $800 million above the President's budget request.   We can and we must support our Nation's heroes who have sacrificed so  much to defend our freedoms and protect our homeland. That is why we  must pass this strong legislation and make clear that we stand with our  brave men and women in uniform.
