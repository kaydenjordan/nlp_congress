Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today on behalf of a  significant bipartisan benefit for conservation in the United States.   S. 47, the lands package, is the product of many months of  negotiation and many years of committee process.   The bill benefits all Americans.   By protecting ecosystems, preserving our cultural heritage, and  connecting the people to their lands, we demonstrate this Congress'  commitment to public lands that serve all Americans.   I am particularly proud that this package will permanently authorize  the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a program that supports  recreation access and conservation in all 50 States.   LWCF works for the people at no direct cost to the taxpayer. It  enhances Americans' enjoyment of public lands across this Nation. It is  time to guarantee the future of this very important program.   In addition to LWCF, the package would add over 1 million acres of  wilderness, designate new national monuments, and expand three national  parks, to name a few of the over 100 provisions.   I am proud to support LWCF; I am proud to support S. 47; and I hope  my colleagues will similarly support this bipartisan effort.   I want to offer my sincere thanks to my fellow collaborators on the  legislation: Congressman Bishop and Senators Murkowski, Manchin, and  Cantwell. Their willingness to work and to compromise was crucial in  turning this bill into a reality. I congratulate them on their efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone who voiced their support for S. 47.   Before we close and turn to a vote, I again express my thanks to my  colleagues who helped bring this bill before us today. It is a major  win for conservation across the United States, and I strongly encourage  all my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.   The American people need to know from this Congress that there are  opportunities to produce bipartisan wins, whether it is for  conservation or public lands or, more importantly, for the people of  this country. I think this bill represents that.    I extend my appreciation and my thanks to respective staffs on both  sides of the aisle, for their hard work in bringing this together.   As my friend from Utah said at the outset of this conversation today,  it is not a perfect bill, but it is an effort on the part of many of us  who came to this with disparate views, different opinions, and  opposition to some of its content. It was an effort to try to do  something that reflected common ground. I think this bill reflects  common ground. I think it is a win for all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to vote in support of S.  47, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent resolution  and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.
