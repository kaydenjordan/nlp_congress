 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, before I begin, I was talking to my friend from Oregon  earlier--and also, I know, your home State--and our thoughts and  prayers are with everybody on the West Coast. I know some of us have  friends on the Gulf Coast. We have citizens of our country, Madam  Speaker, that are going through some tough times, and our thoughts and  prayers are with them.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7909, the Ensuring Children  and Child Care Workers Are Safe Act. It is a bipartisan piece of  legislation that I introduced with my colleague, Representative  Finkenauer from Iowa, which will provide childcare providers resources  and information on how to safely operate during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Without childcare options, parents can't return to work, which is a  key component to our Nation's economic recovery. Additionally,  childcare benefits and a child's health and development are critical to  building a strong foundation for future success.   Childcare providers, however, are currently grappling with safely  reopening and staying open. A recent article in U.S. News and World  Report noted tens of thousands of childcare providers shuttered across  the U.S., 4,500 in the Washington, D.C., area alone.   In my home State of Kentucky, thanks to the CARES Act, many of our  childcare centers have been fortunate to reopen. However, one-third of  the State's 2,200 licensed or certified childcare centers still haven't  reopened.   In order to reopen for families, childcare providers must follow  certain guidelines and modify their normal routines in order to create  a safe environment for children. Now more than ever, childcare  providers need assistance interpreting and implementing CDC and State  guidelines designed to keep children safe.   My bill, along with Representative Finkenauer, H.R. 7909, requires  the Department of Health and Human Services to work with States to  provide technical assistance for childcare providers as they reopen  across the country.   In a recent study on technical assistance, the Government  Accountability Office found that the current COVID-19 pandemic  underscores the importance of Federal agencies providing technical  assistance to grantees to ensure the continuity of operations of grant  programs and the effective use of funding.                                time  1115    While it is common for Congress to require technical assistance, it  is critical that we tailor these directives carefully to ensure  grantees are receiving necessary and timely support. We in Congress  hear the concerns of childcare providers and are sending the assistance  they desperately need.   Additionally, this bill authorizes $5 million for 1 year for HHS to  issue grants to States so they can provide guidance and technical  support to childcare providers, and it requires HHS to provide  recommendations to Congress on how to ensure there is an adequate  supply of safe childcare during COVID-19. It is critical, and not only  to children and childcare providers, but also to families who need  access to childcare while they return to work.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 7909 so that we can help  put our country on the path forward. I appreciate working with my  colleague from Iowa, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller), a member of the committee and a good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, in these challenging times, childcare providers,  especially those who run small operations, are at risk of shutting  their doors. The call for Congress to act is loud and clear.   With the additional health and safety requirements providers are  expected to navigate, it is important to help them implement these  requirements so the children in their care remain safe and free from  harm. H.R. 7909 will ensure that childcare providers receive guidance  and assistance to safely operate so that parents can return to work and  our economy can continue to recover. I think most of the people, when I  am back home, are just looking to return to normal, and this moves that  forward.   For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 7909, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of S. 2683, the Child Care Protection Improvement  Act of 2020, the same bill offered by my colleagues Representatives  McBath, Keller, Taylor, Finkenauer, and Axne.   In 2014, Congress passed the Child Care Development and Block Grant  Reauthorization Act with broad bipartisan support and it required that  States conduct specified comprehensive criminal background checks for  all childcare staff members.   As part of this crucial requirement, interstate checks must be  completed in any State where the prospective employee lived over the  last 5 years. However, given the variation of individual State laws and  practices, interstate background checks have proven difficult for many  States to complete.   With only three States able to fully implement the Child Care and  Development Block Grant background checks as of March 1st, 2020, it is  time for Congress to determine the root causes of the roadblocks to  interstate background checks.   The Child Care Protection Improvement Act does just that by  establishing a task force at HHS. The task force includes the FBI and  respective CCDBG Federal agencies, as well as those who are operating  State background check systems in order to determine the issues with  the current systems.   By establishing a task force, Congress can take action to improve the  operability and preserve the resources of the grantees who are already  burdened by the red tape in the interstate background check system.   Approximately 1.3 million children receive a childcare subsidy from  the Child Care and Development Fund every month. Their parents deserve  the peace of mind that their children's caretakers have gone through  comprehensive background checks.   While good-faith efforts toward compliance have been shown and  incremental improvement has been demonstrated, more can be done to  expediently implement these crucial safety measures for our children.  The task force established in this bill is a promising step to  achieving criminal background check implementation in every State.   I thank my colleagues for working across the aisle in crafting this  legislation. I thank Chairman Scott of the Education and Labor  Committee and Republican leader Foxx for helping bring this bill to the  floor today.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Murphy), my friend and an important member of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller), who has been an architect of this piece of  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the childcare industry is critical to the well-being  of American families, and each family across our Nation deserves to  know that those who are caring for their children have gone through  thorough and necessary criminal background checks.   The Child Care Protection Improvement Act helps protect children and  gives parents peace of mind when it comes to sending their children to  a childcare facility.   This legislation is a perfect example of what Congress can accomplish  when bipartisanship and meaningful collaboration take priority over  politics.   I encourage a ``yes'' vote on S. 2683.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
