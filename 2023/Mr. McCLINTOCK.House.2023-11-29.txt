 Mr. Speaker, as Homeland Security Secretary,  Alejandro Mayorkas has carried out the Biden administration's open  border policy and deliberately produced the worst illegal mass  migration in history.   Since he took office, he has released 3 million illegal immigrants  directly into the country, a population the size of the entire State of  Arkansas.   While the Border Patrol has been occupied changing diapers and taking  names, an additional 1.7 million known got-aways have entered, as well.  That is an additional illegal population the size of the State of  Hawaii.   The impact on our schools, hospitals, homeless shelters, working  families' wages, social programs, law enforcement, national security  has been catastrophic.   The national security implications of 1.7 million illegal individuals  about whom we know absolutely nothing are terrifying in light of the  October 7 attack on Israel.   Now, in response, many are demanding Mayorkas' impeachment for  ``failing to maintain operational control of the border'' as  Congresswoman Greene's resolution puts it. He is certainly guilty of  that, and a whole lot more: maladministration, malfeasance, and neglect  of duties on a truly cosmic scale, but these are not impeachable  offenses.   We know this because the American Founders specifically rejected  these terms at the Constitutional Convention.   As Madison explained, they feared that such imprecise grounds could  be twisted into a weapon for political grievances and turned against  the executive branch whenever Congress saw fit. This would make the  President a mere minister of Congress and make his subordinates  answerable to the legislative branch instead of the executive powers  that are vested solely in the President. This would utterly destroy the  separation of powers at the heart of our Constitution.   They chose, instead, very specific and limited charges of treason,  bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.   True, many politicians through the centuries have tried to pervert  the term ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' into a similarly vague  definition, but the Founders would not have substituted one vague term  for another, and thus we are left with the plain meaning of the phrase,  clearly defined crimes related to the duties of the office.   If Ms. Greene is successful in redefining impeachment, then the next  time Democrats have the majority, we can expect this new definition be  turned against the conservatives on the Supreme Court and any future  Republican administration. Furthermore, there will be nobody to stop  them because Republicans will have now signed off on this new and  unconstitutional abuse of power.   We must never allow the left to become our teachers. Theirs is a  world of strictly situational ethics antithetical to our Constitution  and to the rule of law. I vigorously opposed the sham impeachments of  Donald Trump for exactly the same reason.   Now, what is the practical effect of impeaching Mayorkas, other than  assuring that Republicans will have no defense when a future Democrat  majority turns this new definition against them?   Even in the delusional fantasy where two-thirds of the Senate were to  remove him, the same policies will remain in place as long as the  Biden-Harris administration holds office.   This crisis was set in motion by voters who elected them and can only  be fixed by voters replacing them with a President determined to secure  our border as Donald Trump did.   Elections have consequences, sometimes terrible consequences, and  this is one of them. The only Cabinet Secretary ever impeached was  Ulysses Grant's Secretary of War for running a family bribery scheme.  The House Oversight Committee is painstakingly assembling evidence that  suggests the Bidens may have been doing exactly this for decades.   Such a serious inquiry can only have legitimacy and credibility if  the rule of law is respected and the constitutional guardrails are  observed.   By failing to abide by due process and constitutional constraints,  Ms. Greene is tainting this serious impeachment inquiry with a shoot- from-the-hip stunt that is reckless, partisan, and manifestly  unserious.   In Robert Bolt's ``A Man For All Seasons,'' William Roper vows ``to  cut down every law in England'' to get at the Devil.   Sir Thomas More replies, ``Oh? And when the last law was down, and  the Devil turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws  all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to  coast, Man's laws, not God's. And if you cut them down, and you're just  the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the  winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil the benefit of the  law, for my own safety's sake.''                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I would first remind the Democrats that  illegal immigration is not a human right. It is a Federal crime.   Now, the national parks were set aside for the use and enjoyment of  the American people, but President Biden is now expropriating these  lands for the benefit of the 3 million illegal immigrants whom he has  deliberately released into our country. This bill would halt that  abomination, and I wholeheartedly support it.   Nevertheless, the misuse of our public lands is, frankly, the least  of our problems. The impact this is having on social services, our  schools, our hospitals, our homeless shelters, the safety of our  neighborhoods, the security of our country, and the rule of law itself  has been catastrophic.   Elections have consequences. The American people need to decide  whether they want this to continue or whether they will replace this  President with  [[Page H5965]]  one who is determined to recover not only our Nation's lands but our  Nation's sovereignty.
