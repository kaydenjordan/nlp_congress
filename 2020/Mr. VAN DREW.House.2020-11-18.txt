 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Oakcrest High School in  south Jersey for engaging all of us to be involved in what this Nation  is built upon: representative government.   Voting is a right that we must all engage in to see the country that  we want to live in. I am proud of them. I am proud of all of you and  your belief in America. America is an exceptional Nation, and we can  never forget that.   Our predecessors built this Nation with mechanisms in place to ensure  that, even though there are problems at times, that we can self-correct  and we can heal the wrongs.   I ran for reelection because I believe in a strong America, which  makes a strong south Jersey. I believe that what made America great  keeps America great. I believe in a strong economy, strong borders, and  a strong military, anchored by strong energy, American-made and  American-supplied goods and services, all while protecting our  environment, our families, and core American values.   To me, this isn't about politics. A strong nation is built upon a  strong economy, built on American-made goods. We must bring American  manufacturing jobs back home where they belong. A strong nation does  not let foreign governments take advantage of us, and I will do  everything in my power to ensure that doesn't happen.   I want to thank all of the professionals at Oakcrest High School, and  I thank them for their work through this pandemic, and all of the  students for the work that they have done. May God bless them all.                            ____________________
