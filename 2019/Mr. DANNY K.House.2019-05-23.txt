 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, when only 39 percent  of Americans have enough savings to cover an emergency costing $1,000  and when 67 percent of Americans say that they will outlive their  retirement savings, the SECURE Act becomes a lifesaver.   It becomes a lifesaver because it makes it easier for small  businesses to offer retirement plans. It gives retirement benefit  opportunities to home healthcare workers, more than half of whom are  women of color, working for extremely low pay.   And I must take note of that, because these individuals are at the  low end of not only quality of life but low end of earnings. They now  have an opportunity for some serious consideration of retirement.   It creates a small employer automatic enrollment credit to make it  easier for workers to participate in 401(k) plans.   These are important changes. It is a great bill, not just a good  bill.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support it, and I urge all my colleagues to  do so.
