 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the INVEST in  America Act.   I am pleased that this bill includes funding for projects that are  critical to our community in coastal Virginia.   The parallel Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel will expand to four lanes,  will make the roads safer, and reduce traffic. Updating Tidewater Drive  in Norfolk will facilitate access to Norfolk Naval Station, the world's  largest Navy base.   The funding will create a much-needed evacuation route for the  Sandbridge community and Virginia Beach in the event of flooding or  extreme weather, which happens more frequently due to climate change.   This bill will also fund the replacement of aging buses that serve  Hampton Roads Transit.   Madam Speaker, finally, the INVEST in America Act will fund planning  for the Craney Island Marine Terminal, connecting Route 164 with the  Commonwealth Railway that services the Port of Virginia, which is  responsible for one in nine jobs in the Commonwealth.   Members of Congress must be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars,  and I advocated for these projects that will support our constituents.  Investing in infrastructure strengthens the backbone of our economy,  keeps America running, and puts a down payment on the future.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for these  critical projects.                            ____________________
