 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the United  States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement negotiated by President Trump and  his team, as well as the strong leadership here in the House.   For more than a year, I have called on Speaker Pelosi to have this  vote on this trade agreement. I am glad the day has arrived.   The stakes for Michigan are extremely high. One estimate is 38.9  percent of Michigan's total GDP depends on trade, the highest in the  Nation. A staggering 65 percent of the State's exports are bound for  Canada and Mexico.   Trade with our Nation's neighbors support more than 338,000 Michigan  jobs.   Ratifying the USMCA will lead to more than $30 billion in investment  in new automotive manufacturing in the U.S. and create more than 75,000  jobs for American auto workers.   Passing the USMCA is also vitally important to our agricultural  community. Michigan's food and agricultural exports total approximately  $1.98 billion annually and support roughly 805,000 food and  agricultural jobs.   This agreement will level the playing field for our farmers, growers,  and producers, and expand market access for commodities such as dairy  goods, poultry, and eggs.   This is a win for Michigan workers, farmers, and job creators, and I  support this bill.
