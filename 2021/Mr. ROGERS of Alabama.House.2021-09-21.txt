 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I, too, rise in strong support of H.R. 4350, the  fiscal year National Defense Authorization Act.   H.R. 4350 represents a truly bipartisan bill, and I want to thank  Chairman Smith for his tremendous leadership and cooperation in helping  fashion it. This has been a truly bipartisan endeavor.                                time  2115    Over the last few months, we have seen the best of our soldiers,  sailors, airmen, marines, and guardians. They have performed in the  toughest of environments with the greatest level of skill and  professionalism. Many gave their lives so others would have a chance  for a better life. Without a doubt, our military is the greatest force  the world has ever seen.   Providing the authorities and resources for our service that our  servicemembers need to defend our Nation and defeat our adversaries is  the greatest responsibility we have here in Congress. We accomplished  that responsibility with the bill before us today. H.R. 4350 ensures  our warfighters are the best equipped and trained in the world.   The bill puts our servicemembers first, providing a 2.7 percent pay  increase and expanding benefits for their families. It also puts  American workers first with historic investments in our defense  industrial base. It also begins divesting legacy systems that will not  help us deter future threats. Instead, it invests in new technologies  like AI, hypersonics, and quantum computing that will help us stay  ahead of our adversaries.   That is important because Russia and China are rapidly modernizing  their militaries. China is outpacing us with advancements in emerging  technologies and weapons systems, and we know China isn't building  these capabilities purely for defense. In recent years, we have seen  China use its military to push out its borders, threaten our allies,  and gain footholds on new continents.   H.R. 4350 is laser-focused on preparing our military to prevail in a  conflict with China. It makes critical investments in new systems  capable of surviving in a contested environment. It includes provisions  that will remove China from our defense supply chain, and it reaffirms  our support to allies in the region, especially Taiwan. Unfortunately,  threats from near peer adversaries like China and Russia are not the  only ones we face. Terrorists continue their plots to destroy our way  of life, and we must continue to take the fight to them anywhere and  anytime they threaten us. With strong investments in new capabilities  and readiness, this bill enables our warfighters to do just that.   Finally, regardless of how you feel about the war in Afghanistan,  Madam Speaker, I think we are all horrified by its disastrous  withdrawal. This bill includes over 20 provisions to provide  accountability to get us answers to questions we have been asking for  here for months.   This is a strong, bipartisan bill that will enhance our oversight of  the DOD and ensure our military is properly resourced and equipped to  defend our Nation and our allies.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), who is the ranking member of the  Readiness Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), the ranking member of the  Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), the ranking member of the  Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly), the ranking member of the  Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), the ranking member of the  Military Personnel Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and Information  Systems.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), a great member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore), one of our outstanding freshman  Members.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice), an outstanding member of our  Armed Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DesJarlais), another fine member of the  Armed Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), another fine member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, as I have made clear, I feel  very strongly that this is a really strong, bipartisan bill. I urge all  Members of the House to support it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, this is a fine piece of  legislation in a stand-alone fashion. In fact, I voted for the  gentleman's stand-alone bill. I think what he is trying to accomplish  is admirable and should be accomplished, but not in the National  Defense Authorization Act.   He knows that I am not picking on his bill. I feel this way about  anything that is not in our jurisdiction.   But having said that, the language is not related to the NDAA, and I  urge opposition.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, it is my understanding that the  ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction is opposed. Therefore,  I must be opposed.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, the amendment allows some of  the most hardened terrorists in U.S. custody a platform to publicly  broadcast their message. Letting these vicious terrorists know there is  a public audience for their hate will do far more harm than good.   It is important to note that Federal courts have consistently stuck  to their guns against broadcasting major terrorism cases, such as the  trial of Zacarias Moussaoui. I see no reason to make an exception for  terrorists at Guantanamo.   DOD has informed us they share these serious concerns and strongly  oppose this amendment.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose the amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a right to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am concerned that adoption of  this amendment would create a major recruiting platform for terrorists  and create security risks.   The Biden administration is opposed to this amendment. I oppose this  amendment, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no.'' I yield back  the balance of my time.
