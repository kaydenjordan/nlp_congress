 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about legislation  that I introduced to protect Nevadans from the pain of another  government shutdown.   Federal employees and contractors shouldn't be on the hook for the  fees, interest, and fines that pile up when the government shuts down.  That is why yesterday I introduced legislation to ensure these workers  don't just receive backpay, but they also get paid back for the late  fees and overdue rent notices they receive, through no fault of their  own, during any government shutdown.   This bill also requires the Federal Government to reimburse States  and Tribes for extra funds that they were forced to spend during  shutdowns, ensuring Nevada taxpayers aren't picking up the tab when the  Federal Government refuses to do so.   The President made clear on Tuesday night that he is willing to  create another self-imposed crisis so that he can get money for a  border wall. This bill will ensure that our Federal workers and State  and Tribal governments aren't footing the bill for that crisis.                            ____________________
