 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize two senior  airmen, brothers from south Jersey whose commitment to this country and  their family embody all that makes America so amazing.   Thomas ``Jeff'' Dahl, Jr., and Charles Dahl are the sons of  Lieutenant Colonel Tom and Jennifer Dahl.   Jeff joined the New Jersey Air Force National Guard in January 2018  as a fuel systems apprentice and currently attends Rutgers University  in New Jersey.   Charles Dahl joined the National Guard in May 2019 as a munitions  assistant apprentice.   Both men are avid and well-known outdoorsmen, and they are committed  to their community and south Jersey.   These young men are in the pool to deploy with the 177th Fighter Wing  in 2021. This carries on a family legacy of combat deployments going  back to their grandfather, who deployed to Korea, and their father, who  deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.   Men, you inspire all of us with your lives and the future that I know  will be an inspiration for many others. I was happy to crash your party  that day and get to know you just a little bit better.   God bless you, God bless what you do, God bless your bravery, and God  bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
