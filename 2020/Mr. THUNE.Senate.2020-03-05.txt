 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as I begin this morning, I want to  associate myself with the remarks of the Republican leader, Senator  McConnell, earlier this morning.   The attacks that were made by the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer,  on the Supreme Court yesterday were not only irresponsible; they were  reckless and they were shameful. I think we need to just call that what  it is.   For them to suggest--for him to suggest--that this isn't what he  meant and that this is somehow manufactured outrage on the part of us  or Republicans in general doesn't fit with the way that these comments  came across either, because I want to read for you from the CNN Supreme  Court reporter: ``Schumer, speaking at a rally of abortion rights  supporters, appeared to threaten Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, President  Trump's two Supreme Court nominees who were confirmed after bruising  nomination fights.''   That is the interpretation not of FOX News but of CNN.   I think we need to be very clear: When comments like that are made  that threaten an independent judiciary in this country, they need to be  called out and they need to be walked back. I appreciate the fact that  the Democratic leader acknowledged today that he should have said it  differently, but it doesn't in any way diminish what was said or the  context in which it was said or the attacks that were made on the  Supreme Court.   It needs to be recognized as that, and I think all of us need to be,  as U.S. Senators, aware--aware--no matter what the audience,  particularly when you are the Democratic leader, of how these things  come across and what they mean to the people who have been threatened  by them.                                 Coronavirus    Madam President, I am pleased that Republicans and Democrats in both  Chambers have quickly come together to provide emergency funding to  combat the coronavirus, and I look forward to voting this afternoon to  send this important funding measure to the President's desk.                                      5G    Madam President, on another subject, our Nation is poised for the  widespread deployment of the next generation of internet technology:  5G. With its incredible speed and connectivity, 5G will usher in a new  era of innovation. Advances in medical care, the large-scale deployment  of precision agriculture, safer transportation technologies--5G will  bring all of these things and more.   But, like any new technology, 5G networks will present new risks and  vulnerabilities. Because 5G will mean a vastly greater number of  connected devices, the risks with 5G will be greater. That is why an  essential part of deploying 5G networks has to be looking at how we can  mitigate security risks.   Yesterday, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation, of which I am a member, held a hearing on supply chain  risks for 5G. We need to ensure that the component parts of our devices  and, critically, the component parts of telecommunications networks,  like cell towers and the small cells that will be required for 5G, are  secure.   That means ensuring that 5G equipment comes from trusted vendors.  Currently, one of the biggest suppliers of 5G equipment worldwide is a  Chinese company--Huawei--which is supported by the Chinese Government.  American security officials have raised concerns that much of Huawei's  equipment is built with ``backdoors,'' giving the Chinese Government  access to global communications networks.   The United States has taken a number of steps to prevent equipment  from Huawei and another suspect Chinese company, ZTE, from being used  in U.S. communications networks, but these companies still pose a risk  to the United States. For starters, some U.S. broadband providers,  often in rural areas, still have equipment from Huawei and ZTE in their  communications networks, and a number of our allies and trade partners,  entities with whom we regularly share information--including sensitive  national security information--have used or are using technology from  Huawei and ZTE.   Yesterday's Commerce Committee hearing focused on both of these  issues. We discussed so-called ``rip and replace,'' an initiative  already underway to replace suspect telecommunications components with  hardware from trusted companies.   Last week, the Senate unanimously passed the Secure and Trusted  Communications Networks Act, which is now with the President to be  signed into law. This legislation will help telecommunications  providers with the cost of replacing network components that pose a  security risk. I cosponsored this legislation, which was developed by  Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker.   Madam President, cost is a major obstacle for small broadband  providers when it comes to replacing telecommunications hardware, but,  as one expert witness at the hearing noted, a lack of qualified  telecommunications workers also poses a barrier to replacement.   I recently introduced legislation, the Telecommunications Skilled  Workforce Act, to help increase the number of workers on the frontlines  of replacing this equipment and deploying new, secure 5G networks. I  hope this legislation will quickly make its way through the Senate.  Replacing problematic hardware in our domestic telecommunications  networks will help ensure the security of our communications for years  to come.   As I said earlier, that is not the only challenge that we are facing.  We regularly exchange information, including sensitive national  security information, with our allies and trading partners, and this  information can only be secure if networks on both ends are secure.  That is why the United States has called for other countries to reject  telecommunications technology from Huawei and ZTE. While some countries  have committed to using trusted companies to build out their  telecommunications networks, other countries are still planning to make  use of Huawei's technology.   That is why I am introducing legislation today to make  telecommunications security a key objective when  [[Page S1513]]  negotiating future trade deals. This legislation is critical as the  United States begins formal trade talks with the United Kingdom and  with other allies. We should be using trade agreements to push for  enhanced network security globally, which would benefit not only our  country but every country with which we do business.   As one witness noted at yesterday's hearing, this legislation is  ``long overdue.'' I could not agree more. Over the past few years, we  have talked a lot about the importance of having the United States win  the global race to 5G. There are important reasons for that. For  starters, having the United States at the forefront of 5G technology  will mean big benefits for our economy and for American workers, but  there are also important security reasons to have the United States at  the head of the 5G revolution. If we lead the world in implementing 5G,  we will have the chance to set standards for 5G deployment--including,  most importantly, network security standards.   It is no exaggeration to say that having the chance to set worldwide  standards for 5G is critical--it is critical--to our national security.  Our telecommunications networks already play a huge role in our  national security, and that role will only grow as we fully adopt 5G  technology. We need to ensure that U.S. networks are as secure as it is  possible for them to be.   I appreciated the witnesses who took the time to address the Commerce  Committee yesterday. There is no better way to learn what needs to be  done for 5G security than to hear from the people on the ground who  spend every waking day managing network security issues. I look forward  to continuing to work with all of my colleagues in the Senate to  advance telecommunications security and ensure that the United States  is fully prepared for the 5G future.
