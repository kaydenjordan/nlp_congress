 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  his time and his leadership on this issue.   I come to the floor today as the co-chair of the largest bipartisan  caucus in the United States Congress: the Congressional Sportsmen's  Caucus. On behalf of the millions of sportsmen and -women around the  country, I say to the Federal Government, enough is enough. We will not  be intimidated; we will not be strong-armed; and we will not be silent.   States have enjoyed a cooperative relationship with the Federal  Government for years on wildlife management, and this is a disturbing  shift that we have seen in the last administration.   Though I come to the floor today in defense of Alaska's management  rights of national wildlife refuges, this sets a disturbing precedent  for the lower 48 States. It is a disturbingly brazen power grab by the  Federal Government against the law, in spite of loud and widespread  opposition at the local level.   The rule removes Alaska's authority to manage fish and wildlife for  both nonsubsistence and subsistence uses in Federal wildlife. The  action by the last administration violated the clear letter of the  Alaska Statehood Act, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation  Act, and the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act.   I encourage my colleagues to support what we are doing today and  stand in support of the good men and women, the outdoorsmen in the  great State of Alaska. I know you have heard from the gentleman from  Alaska who has very clearly articulated the position of the people he  represents in that great State.   I applaud the chairman. I applaud the action that we are taking  today. I urge my colleagues to support it.
