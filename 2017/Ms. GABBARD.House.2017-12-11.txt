 Mr. Speaker, in 3 days, the internet as we know it could  change forever.   On December 14, the FCC will be taking a vote on whether or not to  get rid of net neutrality protections that keep the internet open,  fair, and equal for everyone. Repealing these protections will allow  internet service providers like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T to control  the levers of the internet--stifling access, deciding which websites  you and I can visit and use, and making it virtually impossible for  small businesses to compete against industry giants.   It will hurt our students, entrepreneurs, working families, and all  who rely on the internet for things from education to healthcare to  employment as a level playing field of opportunity.   The FCC must protect the people it is supposed to be serving, not big  corporate interests, and make sure that the internet remains a place  where everyone has a seat at the table.                            ____________________
