 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, last night, President Trump delivered  his first address to the Nation from the Oval Office. In the midst of  this partial government shutdown, the President offered a reminder of  just what is at stake; that is, the security of our Nation's southern  border.   By now, on day 19 of Senate Democrats' latest experiment in  ``absentee negotiation,'' my colleagues are well-versed in the facts on  the ground.   We know Border Patrol agents are encountering historic levels of  illicit substances like fentanyl and heroin at our border. We know that  last year saw thousands of attempted border crossings by individuals  with criminal records and literally hundreds more by known gang  members. We understand the status quo is not enough to keep our  families and communities safe.   Fortunately, we know the solutions on the table--solutions which the  President has placed at the center of the national conversation since  the earliest days of his administration--are actually eminently  reasonable.   As one former Border Patrol Chief's under President Obama put it just  recently, ``If you look in the past, you don't have to go too far back  into history . . . bipartisan legislation passed where they built the  wall, or fence, or physical barrier, or whatever you want to call it.  It's a wall. It works.''   That is what the Border Patrol Chief under President Obama said.   He went on to say:         It is not based on personal political ideology. That's       based on historical data and facts that could be proven. . .       . I cannot think of a legitimate argument why anyone would       not support the wall as part of the multi-layered border       security issue.    So why are we not listening to the experts and the people who are  doing this every day, like that Border Patrol Chief under President  Obama?   The experts know what they are talking about. The facts back them up.  According to CBP, in four border sectors where this administration has  already constructed or improved physical barriers in the last 2 years-- listen to this--illicit traffic has fallen by 90 percent--90 percent.   Of course, not too long ago, my colleagues across the aisle had a  completely different position on this subject. Before the political  winds blew a different way, before this particular President was  inaugurated, Senate Democrats did heed the advice of the men and women  who protect our border.   By very wide bipartisan margins, and on multiple occasions, the  Senate has cleared literally billions of dollars in funding for  physical barriers along the southern border.   In 2006, then-Senator Obama said the Secure Fence Act would provide  ``badly needed funding for better fences and better security.'' That is  what then-Senator Obama said in 2006.   In 2009, the current Democratic leader praised as major progress  ``630 miles of border fence''--fence--``that create a significant  barrier to illegal immigration.'' That is what the then-majority leader  said in 2009, who is now the minority leader.   During the last Presidential election, former Senator Clinton saw fit  to tout the ``numerous times'' she voted to ``build a barrier to try  and prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.'' That is what Hillary  Clinton said. ``Numerous times,'' ``significant barrier,''  [[Page S78]]  ``badly needed,'' that was where leading Democrats stood.   Today, however, it seems there is a new party line. The use of  physical barriers to preserve the integrity of a sovereign Nation is  now, according to the new Speaker of the House, ``immoral''-- ``immoral.'' They went from ``badly needed'' to ``immoral'' in little  more than the span of a Presidency. Talk about a pivot. Talk about a  pivot.   My Democratic friends wanted fencing and physical barriers in the  recent past. Their most prominent leaders actually bragged about voting  for physical barriers. The only thing that has changed between then and  now is the occupant of the White House.   Steel fencing was fine, even salutary, when President Obama was in  the White House, but it is ``immoral'' when President Trump occupies  the office.   All of a sudden--all of a sudden--Democrats have developed this new  partisan allergy to the subject of border security. They are even  prolonging a partial government shutdown just to avoid getting more of  what they themselves have voted for in the past.   This inconsistency doesn't stop with drawing imaginary lines in the  sand between the border security the Democrats once supported and the  virtually identical measures they have decided to oppose today. The  inconsistency also extends to the conduct of the Senate itself during  this tantrum.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday evening, Democrats blocked  the Senate from proceeding to important foreign policy legislation.  This bill, which was blocked last night, included measures of which  they have been outspokenly supportive and even cosponsored, but then  they decided that getting anything done at all this week would clash  with their new political brand.   To be clear, the legislation I am referring to would have addressed  several serious challenges to U.S. interests in the Middle East. It  would have reaffirmed our commitment to the security of Israel, our  closest regional ally. It would have reauthorized defense cooperation  with Jordan, a critical partner, and it would have taken a vital step  toward bringing the perpetrators and the enablers of the Assad regime  atrocities in Syria to justice. Frankly, it would have delivered on  promises to which my Democratic colleagues appeared to be firmly  committed.   In their own words, Senate Democrats have discussed ``the  continuation of America's unshakeable, seven-decade commitment to  Israel's security'' and doing ``everything in our power to fight the  BDS movement,'' but, alas, instead of proceeding to this legislation,  Senate Democrats voted to block it.   My friend the Democratic leader chose to take this partial government  shutdown that he is prolonging and add his very own Senate shutdown on  top of it. They want to shut down the Senate as well--no progress, no  bipartisan work, not even on urgent and pressing matters, nothing that  might take the spotlight off his unreasonable showdown with the  President.   Just as an example, during the 2013 government shutdown, the Senate  kept right on chugging through the people's business. We passed 5  bills, 13 resolutions, appointed conferees on the farm bill, the budget  resolution, and confirmed 28 of President Obama's nominees. The Senate  was not shut down during the last government shutdown. This time, the  Democrats want to hold everything hostage--everything?   Here is more inconsistency. Senate Democrats were for border  security, including billions for physical barriers, before they were  against it, and they were for the Senate working hard during government  shutdowns on other business before they were against it.   Until our Democratic colleagues agree to get back to work--until they  agree to get back to work--the Senate can't make much progress. Rest  assured, Assad has not pressed the pause button on the Syrian civil war  simply because it doesn't suit the Democratic leader's political  strategy this week, Israel's enemies haven't stopped either, and until  Democrats prioritize the public interest ahead of political spite, our  border will not be secured, and the Federal Government will remain  partially closed.   I cannot urge my Democratic colleagues more strongly to get past this  purely partisan spite, rediscover their own past positions on border  security, and negotiate a fair solution with the President to secure  our Nation and reopen all of the Federal Government.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 12, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.
