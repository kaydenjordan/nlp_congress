 Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the news this  week that the President is terminating the Executive action protecting  DACA recipients--Dreamers as we know them--but also putting the burden  on the shoulders of this body, the article I branch, to find an  appropriate solution.   The President often said as a candidate--and even in his early days  as President--that he understood some things about these youngsters. He  called them incredible kids, and he also said they would be fine. He  did not use that language often in talking about immigrants so those  were positive phrases that led many to hope he would continue the DACA  Program. Many in his administration wanted him to. Others in this  body--this speaker wanted him to continue the program, but he announced  he was terminating it in 6 months and asked Congress to step up.   I wanted to just tell you about a couple of youngsters I was with  last week. I had a roundtable on DACA at Northern Virginia Community  College, which is one of the largest and most diverse community  colleges in the United States. I held that this last week. I had eight  students. They were a fascinating mixture of young men and women. I  just wanted to come and share some things about their stories because  it demonstrates how these young people, these Dreamers, are a source of  strength for our country and that we need to accommodate them.   Renata was one of my youngsters. She came to Virginia when she was 3  years old with her parents, her older brother, and sister. She  graduated high school with an advanced diploma. Some of us know the  International Baccalaureate diploma, which is rigorous. Now, with DACA,  she is studying at George Mason, getting a degree in clinical  psychology. She does brain injury research. She wants to do that  research to hopefully help people like returning veterans who suffer  from brain injuries.   Giancarla is a DACA recipient from Virginia. She came here a decade  ago to be reunited with her parents. She hadn't seen her parents in 7  years. She received DACA in 2012. She went to Radford University and  graduated with a bachelor's degree in international economics.  Giancarla described how she is so appreciative of where DACA has gotten  her in life, but she told me the night before we met, she had a  conversation with her sister. Her sister was in high school and calling  her big sister to describe how scared she was about what would happen  if DACA was taken away. She talked about her little sister as a hard- working and studious kid, and she is worried she will not be able to go  to college anymore and may be separated from family.   Min is a young man who is a Korean-American born in Korea and a DACA  recipient who is at George Mason studying cyber. He talked about his  desire to serve the United States and help us with cyber expertise but  how the removal of DACA could hurt his studies and could hurt his  ability to get security clearances to be able to offer his talents to  the country.   Gloria, the fifth of these examples--there were eight students  there--is an  [[Page S5041]]  interesting young lady from Nigeria. She was born in England to  Nigerian parents and brought here as a youngster. She will be the first  DACA recipient in Virginia to graduate from law school, William and  Mary Law School. She wants to graduate in December and help new  Americans with immigration issues.   We talked about all kinds of concerns they have: deportation of  themselves or family members, ability to get a driver's license, the  ability to lawfully work and pay taxes--and all of these young people  work and pay taxes right now--the ability to get instate tuition, which  for many is the difference to being able to get a higher education. We  talked about all of it, but we also talked about their love for this  country, and the fact that for these young students, this country is  all they know. Deportation back to a place they don't know is not  really an option.   I was also happy to have at this roundtable--because we talked about  there is no such thing as a DACA recipient without a DACA ally-- parents, teachers, family members, attorneys. They have a support  group, and it is really important to acknowledge them too. We had  officials from George Mason University, a public, comprehensive  university in Virginia; Northern Virginia Community College, one of our  community colleges; Marymount College; Catholic University in Northern  Virginia--all of these allies, as well as representatives from other  groups.   The former publisher of the Washington Post, Don Graham, came. He is  funding, with others, a scholarship program to help Dreamers cover cost  gaps if they have to pay out-of-State tuition, and this is working to  help hundreds of Dreamers across the country. We talked to them and  expressed our thanks to them for what they are doing.   I also read stories this week--and I will say this and conclude-- about other students. Juan is a 2017 graduate of Virginia Tech and now  makes Blacksburg his home. He came to Virginia at age 5 and he said  this:         It's really hard for me to think of myself as anything but       a Virginian and an American. It's really hard to have that       part of my identity detached from me.    That is how he views the reversal on DACA.   Guadelupe from the Shenandoah Valley--one of Virginia's very rural  areas but has a significant number of DACA recipients. She started her  freshman year at Bridgewater College, a small private college in the  Valley. She says:         This is the only country I've ever known . . . I've pledged       my allegiance to the stars and stripes every day.    This is the country to which these young people pledge their  allegiance, owe their allegiance, want to express and act to  demonstrate their allegiance. They are doing it already. They are  making us proud. We need to step up. It was my great pleasure in June  2013 to join with the Senators from New Mexico, from Vermont, and  nearly 70 others on the floor to do a comprehensive immigration reform  that included many things but included a protection for these Dreamers.  It was part of the education of a naive, young Senator who was in my  first year to think: Great, we did something in the Senate. I am sure  the House will do something, but 4 years later, not only did they not  ever take up our bill even in committee, they didn't even pass anything  by way of comprehensive immigration reform that we could put in a  conference together.   Now the weight of this is on our shoulders with 6 months. Talented  students like these 800,000 nationwide, between 12,000 and 13,000 in  Virginia, have that fear, that anxiety: Are we going to be forced back  into the shadows or, worse, are we or our family members possibly going  to be deported?   I will close and say these youngsters again pledge their allegiance  to the United States, and they are demonstrating every day that we are  richer as a nation because of them. Why would we not want to have these  talented young people pledge allegiance to us rather than elsewhere?  America has always succeeded because we have been a great magnet for  talent--growing our own talent and celebrating it but willing to  attract talent from around the world. The society that attracts talent  in the 21st century is going to be the society that succeeds. The most  precious resource in life right now is not oil. It is not water. It is  talent. These Dreamers have it, and we should want it. I hope my  colleagues will work together in a bipartisan way, both Houses, to  provide a protection.   With that, I yield the floor and notice other colleagues here waiting  to speak on the same topic.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.
