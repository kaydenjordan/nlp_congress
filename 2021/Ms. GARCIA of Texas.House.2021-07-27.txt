 Madam Speaker, my amendment increases the Fossil  Energy and Carbon Management account by $50 million and decreases it by  the same amount.   I want to thank the bipartisan group of cosponsors, including  Representative McCaul, Representative Jackson Lee, Representative  Burgess, Representative Fletcher, Representative Cuellar,  Representative Crenshaw, and Representative Brady.   I offered this amendment because we must prioritize Carbon  Utilization Program activities that are consistent with our existing  energy statute.   In and around my district in Houston, the energy capital of the  world, important carbon capture research is taking place. Carbon  capture utilization seeks to improve our community's air quality and  maintain and provide jobs for workers, many in my district.   Therefore, my amendment just clarifies that carbon capture  utilization research, along with other carbon capture projects  specified in the committee report, are also recognized and prioritized  in this bill.                                time  1800
