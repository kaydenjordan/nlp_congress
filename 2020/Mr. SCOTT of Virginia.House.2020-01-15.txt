 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 1230, the Protecting  Older Workers Against Discrimination Act.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older  Workers Against Discrimination Act, or POWADA.   I want to thank my colleagues, particularly the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), for working to pass this bipartisan  proposal to restore workplace protections for older workers.   In 1967, Congress passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or  ADEA, which recognizes the Federal Government's role in preventing  older workers from being forced out of jobs or denied work  opportunities because of their age.   Importantly, the ADEA was enforced using an evidentiary standard that  gave older workers a fair shot at holding employers accountable for age  discrimination. Under this standard, workers seeking to challenge age  discrimination in employment only had to prove that age was a  motivating factor or one of many motivating factors behind an  employer's discriminatory action.   For decades, this mixed-motive standard was consistent with the  evidentiary standard in title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  which covers claims of unlawful discrimination on the basis of race,  sex, national origin, or religion.   Unfortunately, in 2009, in the Gross v. FBL Financial Services case,  the Supreme Court upended decades of precedent, significantly raising  the burden of proof for older workers.   In its 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that plaintiffs must prove  that age was the decisive and determinative motivating factor for the  employer's conduct. Under this altered framework, older workers cannot  prevail unless they can show that the adverse action would not have  occurred but for the employee's age.   This higher threshold not only makes it harder for workers who have  suffered  [[Page H259]]  discrimination to achieve redress, it also sends a message to employers  that they need not treat age discrimination as seriously as other forms  of discrimination.   By amending the ADEA to clarify that the mixed-motive standard is the  evidentiary standard for evaluating claims, the Protecting Older  Workers Against Discrimination Act would restore workers' protections  and reestablish a consistent burden of proof for claims alleging  discrimination on the basis of age.   The 2009 Gross decision also opened the door for the courts to apply  the but-for standard to other civil rights laws, including the  Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and  the antiretaliation provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The  bill before us clarifies that the mixed-motive standard also applies to  those three civil rights acts as well.   Despite the bipartisan support in both Chambers for this bill, I am  disappointed that the White House has already threatened to veto this  legislation. In reality, the administration has a troubling pattern of  blocking legislation to help the very forgotten workers it promised to  support.   In addition to this legislation, the administration has placed veto  threats on the Raise the Wage Act, which would gradually increase the  minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, and the Workplace Violence  Prevention for Healthcare and Social Service Workers Act, which would  support the safety of healthcare and social service workers.                                time  1345    Mr. Chairman, today the House has a chance to be on record and stand  up for the average American worker. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the  Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume just to respond to the idea that this has been rushed.   There have been several committee hearings over the last 10 years in  the House and one of the Senate, and that information is recorded in  the committee report.   I also would like to point out that the burden of but for that the  Gross decision has saddled older workers with now requires them to show  not only that they have been discriminated against but also that they  would have gotten the job or wouldn't have been fired but for the fact  that they are old. All the older person knows is that when they applied  for the job they were told: We don't hire old people.    Well, that is not enough, because now you also have to show that you  would have gotten the job anyway. You don't know who got hired, and you  don't know what their qualifications were, and it is an almost  impossible burden to prove that not only were you discriminated against  but you know the action would not have been taken but for that action.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici), who is the chair of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and  Human Services on the Education and Labor Committee.  [[Page H260]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), who is the co-chair of the  Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the co-chair of the  Democratic Caucus Task Force on Aging and Families.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chair, it has been more than a decade since the Supreme Court  heightened the burden of proof for workers seeking to legally challenge  age discrimination in the workplace; however, our responsibility to  ensure that no older Americans are forced out of a job or denied a work  opportunity because of age has not changed.   At a time when Americans are working longer into their lives, we need  policy solutions that empower older workers to challenge workplace  discrimination. We know that a 2018 survey by the AARP showed that  three out of five workers age 45 or older had seen or experienced age  discrimination in the workplace.   Some of my colleagues contend that this bill was rushed to the floor;  however, we must remember that this is a bipartisan proposal that has  undergone substantial debate since it was first introduced in 2009.  Over the past 10 years, Congress has deliberated on this legislation  through four hearings, including two hearings in the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Both the House and Senate have introduced and gradually improved this  legislation in the 111th, 112th, 113th, 114th, 115th, and the current  116th Congress. It is long overdue.   The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act is a  bipartisan, bicameral solution that restores protections for older  workers and ensures that we treat all workers facing discrimination,  whether it is on the basis of sex, race, religion, national origin, or  age, with consistency and fairness.   I want to thank Congressman Sensenbrenner for working with us to  bring this important legislation to the floor.   I want to remind everyone exactly what this bill does.   Under the bill and before 2009, if a person could prove  discrimination, that was the beginning of the case. The defendant would  be able to show that they would have been fired or not hired anyway,  but that is on the defendant to show. If they don't show that, then it  is proven discrimination, entitling the plaintiff to damages. If the  defendant can show that it would have done it anyway, discrimination is  already proved, and, as the gentlewoman from North Carolina pointed  out, attorney's fees would be available.   Under the new law, after 2009, not only do you have to prove that you  were discriminated against, told we don't higher old people, you also  have to prove that you would have gotten the job anyway.   Well, you don't have that information. You can't show that you would  have gotten the job. You don't know the qualifications of the person  who was hired.   So, Mr. Chair, we know that this legislation is extremely important.  Older workers want this legislation, as evidenced by a letter of  support from the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, over two  dozen organizations representing senior citizens; another letter,  joined by 26 advocacy organizations supporting the bill; and, finally,  a letter of support from AARP.   Mr. Chair, I include these letters in the Record.                                               Leadership Council                                         of Aging Organizations,                                                   December 9, 2019.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader,      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker,      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,       Speaker Pelosi, and Minority Leader McCarthy: The Leadership       Council of Aging Organizations (LCAO) is a coalition of 69       national nonprofit organizations concerned with the well-      being of America's older population and committed to       representing their interests in the policy-making arena.        We are writing to urge you to vote for passage of the       Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (S. 485,       H.R. 1230). The Protecting Older Workers Against       Discrimination Act (POWADA) is bipartisan and bicameral       legislation sponsored in the Senate by Senators Bob Casey (D-      PA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). The House version is sponsored       by Representatives Bobby Scott (D-VA) and Jim Sensenbrenner       (R-Wl). The House Education and Labor Committee voted on June       11, 2019 to approve POWADA.        Age discrimination is pervasive and stubbornly entrenched.       Six in 10 older workers have experienced age discrimination       and 90% of them say it is common. It is even more pervasive       among older women and African American workers; nearly two       thirds of women and three-fourths of African Americans say       they have seen or experienced workplace age discrimination.        Courts have not taken age discrimination as seriously as       other forms of discrimination and older workers have fewer       protections as a result. Ten years ago, in Gross v. FBL       Financial Services Inc., the Supreme Court set a higher       standard of proof for age discrimination than previously       applied and much higher than for other forms of       discrimination. Since Gross, court decisions have continued       to chip away at protections. As a result, plaintiffs now have       to prove that age was a determinative, ``but-for'' cause for       their employers' adverse treatment of them. Before the Gross       case, it was enough for plaintiffs to prove that age was one       of the motivating factors. POWADA would restore the standard       of proof in age discrimination cases to the pre-2009 level,       and treat age discrimination as just as wrong as other forms       of employment discrimination. Moreover, because courts have       applied Gross' higher burden of proof to retaliation charges       and to disability discrimination, it would also amend the Age       Discrimination in Employment Act, Title VII's provision on       retaliation, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the       Rehabilitation Act of 1973.        Please vote to restore fairness for older workers by       passing the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination       Act (S. 485, H.R. 1230).

June 10, 2019.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx: On behalf of       the undersigned organizations and the millions of workers we       represent, we urge all Committee Members to vote to support       H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older Workers Against       Discrimination Act (POWADA), sponsored by Chairman Scott and       Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI). POWADA is bipartisan, limited       legislation to restore fairness and well-established legal       standards on workplace discrimination that were undermined by       certain court decisions.        To ensure equal treatment and equal opportunity in       employment, the civil rights laws make clear that       discrimination in the workplace ``because of'' a protected       characteristic or activity is unlawful. For decades, this       meant that discrimination may not play any role in employment       practices.        Yet, 10 years ago this month, the Supreme Court erected a       new and substantial legal barrier in the path of equal       opportunity for older workers. In Gross v. FBL Financial       Services, Inc. (2009), the Court imposed a much higher burden       of proof on workers who allege age discrimination than is       required of those who allege discrimination based on race,       sex, national origin, or religion. Proving that       discrimination tainted the employer's conduct was no longer       enough; after Gross, older workers must prove that       discrimination played a decisive role in the employer's       action.        Since the Gross decision, the Supreme Court and lower       courts have extended this same unreasonably difficult burden       of proof to other types of civil rights complaints:        Retaliation--In Title VII cases in which an employer       retaliates against a worker who challenges workplace       discrimination based on race, sex, or other grounds, the       worker  [[Page H264]]       must now prove that retaliation was the decisive cause for       their adverse treatment. University of Texas Southwestern       Medical Center v. Nassar (2013).        Disability discrimination--The Supreme Court has not yet       ruled on whether workers subjected to disability       discrimination must also meet this much higher standard of       causation, but four federal circuit courts of appeal have       ruled that disability-based employment discrimination must be       established under the higher, ``but-for'' causation standard.        This line of court decisions has made it exponentially more       difficult for workers who have experienced discrimination to       have their day in court and prove their case. These decisions       have also sent a terrible message to employers and the courts       that some types of discrimination are not as wrong, or as       unlawful, as other forms of discrimination.        POWADA would restore the causation standard that was in       effect and consistently applied by the courts before 2009,       and make Congress' intent clear that discrimination in the       workplace is never acceptable. Please support H.R. 1230 and       swiftly pass this bipartisan legislation.

Hon.  Robert C. Scott,      Chairman, Education and Labor Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: On behalf of AARP's nearly 38 million       members, including the approximately 91,000 AARP members in       Virginia's Third Congressional District, I extend our sincere       thanks for leading efforts to introduce and move the       Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act.        Older workers are a valuable asset to their employers and       to the nation's economy. Yet, AARP polling shows that over       60% of older workers believe they have seen or experienced       age discrimination in the workplace. Discrimination is       especially devastating when workers are terminated from long-      time jobs, and face entrenched age bias in hiring.        H.R. 1230 will correct the 2009 Supreme Court decision in       Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. (and subsequent       discrimination cases that followed its reasoning) that made       it much more difficult to prove job discrimination, and will       clarify that proven discrimination may not play any role in       employment decisions. We think the Committee's May hearing       helped to highlight the need for POWADA, and thank you for       drawing attention to Jack Gross' presence there.        We look forward to the June 11th mark-up--as you may know,       this will be the first time that POWADA has been marked up       and voted on in committee--and to working with you and your       staff to shepherd this legislation through the House of       Representatives before the August recess. Thank you again for       your leadership and support.            Sincerely,                                                  Nancy LeaMond,                                           Executive Vice President,                               Chief Advocacy & Engagement Officer.     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree), who worked hard with the sponsor  of this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I want to thank the gentleman for his amendment and hope it passes.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Tlaib) having assumed the chair, Mr. Cuellar, Chair of the Committee of  the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that  Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1230) to amend  the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and other laws to  clarify appropriate standards for Federal employment discrimination and  retaliation claims, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution  thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this is, as my colleague has  indicated, a distraction. This has nothing to do with truck drivers or  the PRO Act. We are talking about discrimination against older workers.  We are talking about victims of discrimination, not who gets to  discriminate against them.   We have a problem that older workers are facing discrimination, and  everybody knows it. National organizations representing senior  citizens, advocacy groups, and civil rights groups, including the AARP,  have all written letters asking us to protect workers against  discrimination.   We are correcting the Supreme Court case and the Gross decision,  which makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for older workers to  prove their cases. We need to defeat this distraction and pass the bill  to protect older workers against discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, I hope we can defeat the motion and pass the bill.
