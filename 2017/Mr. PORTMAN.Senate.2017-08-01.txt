 Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of my  colleagues from Iowa and Rhode Island.   (The remarks of Mr. Portman pertaining to the introduction of S. 1693  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    I thank my colleague from Iowa.   I yield back my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to talk today about the  criminal act of sex trafficking.   Today we introduced legislation that is incredibly important to  combating sex trafficking. The Senate also passed a resolution today by  unanimous consent to provide information to the Justice Department that  comes out of an investigation that we did in the U.S. Senate regarding  sex trafficking. This is an important day in pushing back.   Let me talk about this for a second in personal terms. Imagine, if  you will, that your daughter is missing. You do everything you can do  to find her. Finally, you see her picture on the internet, and she is  being sold for sex. That may sound like a horror movie to you, but it  is very real. Unfortunately, it is happening across our country.   Families in Ohio and in your State have experienced this nightmare  situation. Let me tell you about Kubiiki Pride. Kubiiki Pride gave  powerful testimony before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  in the Senate. Ms. Pride said her daughter had been missing for 9  months when she found her picture on the top website for commercial sex  activity--backpage.com. She was actually glad to have found her  daughter. So she called backpage.com and said: That is my daughter. She  has been missing for 9 months. She is 14 years old. Thank you for  taking down the ad.    Backpage.com said to her: Did you pay for the ad?   She said: No. It is my 14-year-old daughter.   They said: We are not going to take down the ad. You didn't pay for  it.   Imagine if this were your daughter. Imagine how you would feel.   These traffickers are using the internet to sell girls and women.  Congress has a responsibility to act. We have a responsibility to act  because human trafficking is now becoming a national crisis.   Human trafficking, including sex trafficking, is a $150 billion-a- year industry. That makes it the second biggest criminal enterprise in  the world, only behind the drug trade. And this ruthless, corrupt  industry is growing significantly. Why? Because of the internet in the  digital age. Victims of sex trafficking told me: Rob, this has gone  from the street corner to the smart phone.   Since 2007, the Polaris Project--a leading anti-trafficking advocacy  group--received 33,000 reports of human trafficking through its various  hotlines.   By the way, Polaris endorsed our legislation, which I appreciate.   In 2016 alone, Polaris-operated hotlines received 8,000 reports of  human trafficking. Almost 25 percent of trafficking incidents reported  to Polaris in the past decade happened just last year. Human  trafficking reports through these hotlines went up dramatically--35  percent--between 2015 and 2016. There is no reason to believe this  trend will reverse unless we act.   This is a 21st-century epidemic. The National Center for Missing and  Exploited Children noted an 846 percent increase in reports of  suspected child sex trafficking through its CyberTipline from 2010 to  2015. In just 5 years, that is an increase of over 800 percent. They  found this dramatic spike to be ``directly correlated to the increased  use of the internet to sell children for sex.'' That is what is going  on.   How is this happening? People are being bought and sold on public  domains accessible from a simple search. And the majority of online sex  trafficking can be traced to one website called backpage.com. The  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said 73 percent-- three-quarters of all suspected sex trafficking it receives from the  general public through its CyberTipline comes from this one website.   According to leading anti-traffic organizations, including Shared  Hope International, service providers working with child sex  trafficking victims have reported that between 80 percent and 100  percent of the victims they help were bought and sold on backpage.com.   My experience in Ohio is similar to that. I will tell you  anecdotally, as I talked to women and girls who had been victims of sex  trafficking, almost all of them tell me they have been sold on  backpage. By the way, almost all of them tell me that they had become  addicted in the process to an opioid, heroin, or prescription drugs and  that is used to keep their dependency on their trafficker.   In January of this year, a nearly 2-year investigation by the Senate  Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations produced a report finding  backpage to be more deeply complicit in illegal online sex trafficking  than anyone imagined. Everyone already knew sex trafficking was taking  place on this website. It is there. But our report found that backpage  actively and knowingly facilitated the criminal sex trafficking of  women and children; then it covered up evidence of these crimes to  increase its own profits. This is the information we have now provided  to the Department of Justice.   We also know from a recent Washington Post report that, despite its  claims, backpage aggressively solicited and created sex-related ads to  lure customers to its website. It claims it ``leads the industry'' in  its screening of illegal activity, including sex ads for children, but  that isn't true. To the contrary, it appears the industry backpage  leads is online sex trafficking, valuing its profits more than the  rights of vulnerable women and young children. They have known their  site has been used for illegal sex trafficking for years, but instead  of putting a stop to it, the company has actively facilitated these  crimes.   That is why Congress has to act. Last month, I, along with Senators  McCaskill and Carper, launched a criminal review of backpage.com.  Today, the Senate passed a resolution releasing materials from our 18- month investigation to the Department. I hope the Department of Justice  will join in this fight against backpage, but I believe achieving  justice for these victims requires a legislative fix once and for all.   There is a recent documentary, and I would encourage you to look at  it. It is powerful and tough, but it is important. It is called ``I am  Jane Doe.'' It chronicles the cases of three young girls who were sex  trafficking victims bought and sold on backpage. In 2014, these girls  brought cases against backpage, accusing them of knowingly assisting in  their trafficking. The ads on backpage for each of these girls  explicitly promoted their youth. These were underage girls.   The court found that the victims made a strong case that backpage  tailored its site to make underage sex trafficking easier, but the  court ruled that third-party websites facilitating sex trafficking are  immune from charges brought on by victims, no matter how complicit the  website was in the crime, citing the blanket immunity granted by a 1996  law called the Communications Decency Act, or CDA.   Around the same time in Massachusetts, three young victims sued  [[Page S4671]]  backpage after they were bought and sold on their website for sex.  They, too, argued that backpage made sex trafficking easier. This case  reached the First Circuit Court of Appeals, but backpage was once again  spared of any legal ramifications because of the Communications Decency  Act, specifically section 230 of that law--the clause courts credit to  giving third-party providers blanket immunity from crimes committed  through their website.   Despite its ruling, the court recognized the immoral nature of  backpage appearing to profit from online prostitution but maintained  they couldn't do anything about it because the law protected these  acts. The court opinion stated that in order to fix the problem, ``the  remedy is through legislation, not litigation.'' That is who we are. We  are the legislators. The court of appeals said: Congress, do your job.   Numerous judicial decisions have suggested that Congress must act,  before the courts, to bring justice to the victims and families of  online sex trafficking. That is my intention in introducing this  legislation today.   I believe that we need to have free internet. All of us do. I believe  that the Communications Decency Act is a well-intentioned law that has  an important purpose. But the law was not intended to protect those who  willingly facilitate illegal conduct, such as sex trafficking, and it  wasn't intended to protect backpage.com. That is why today I, along  with a number of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, have  introduced this bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. It  clarifies section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to ensure that  websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking can be held liable  and the victims can get justice. It is very narrow. You have to  knowingly be involved in supporting, assisting, and facilitating sex  trafficking. This will not be a broad net.   The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act puts in place three narrowly  crafted and commonsense reforms.   First, it allows victims to seek justice against websites that  knowingly facilitate crimes against them.   Second, it eliminates the Federal liability protections for websites  that assist, support, or facilitate a violation of Federal sex  trafficking laws--laws already on the books.   Finally, it will enable State law enforcement--not just the  Department of Justice--to take legal action if these businesses violate  Federal sex trafficking laws. Forty-seven attorneys general asked for  this.   The internet revolutionized illegal sex trafficking, and Federal law  has not kept pace. It is time for this 21-year-old law to be brought  into this century. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act is legislation  our courts have been calling for, our attorneys general have been  calling for, and most importantly, what victims and their families have  been insisting that we do.   Again, this law was never intended to protect sex traffickers who  prey on the most innocent and vulnerable among us. This narrowly  crafted bill gives law enforcement the tools they need to go after  criminals who traffic women and children online for sex.   There are some groups who have been critical of this effort to hold  backpage accountable and stop this online exploitation. They have  suggested that this bipartisan bill could impact mainstream websites  and service providers--the good actors out there. That is false. Our  bill does not amend, and thus preserves, the Communications Decency  Act's Good Samaritan provision. This provision protects good actors who  proactively block and screen for offensive material and thus shields  them from any frivolous lawsuits. That is in the legislation and needs  to be in there.   This bipartisan legislation preserves internet freedom, while holding  those who actively facilitate online sex trafficking accountable.   I recently visited the Ranch of Opportunity in Washington Court  House, OH. This is a place of hope for girls between ages 13 and 18 to  find healing and recovery during a residential treatment program. Most  of the girls at the ranch, I am told, have been victims of sex  trafficking. As I heard heartbreaking stories from these girls who have  had their most basic human rights stripped from them, backpage came up.  As I said earlier, it almost always does. We can never take back the  horrors they had to endure. What we can do and what this legislation  will do is bring justice to these victims and their families.   I am proud to stand with my 20, now 25, bipartisan colleagues, as  well as 18 anti-human trafficking advocacy groups and law enforcement  organizations around this country, to support this legislation as we  fight against this abhorrent evil.   In a letter of support, the president and CEO of the National Center  for Missing and Exploited Children said: ``This bill will help ensure  justice for child sex trafficking victims and clarify remedies  available to civil attorneys and State attorneys general to assist  victims in holding everyone responsible who participated in their  trafficking.''   That is what it is about. It is about securing justice for those who  have had their most basic human rights taken away, and it is about  protecting vulnerable women and children. Victims of sex trafficking  know evil far worse than many of us can ever imagine. The trauma they  go through is unbelievable. We owe it to them to fix flaws in the  justice system that allow people complicit in these crimes to profit  from human misery and suffering. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act  will do that.   Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Coons):   S. 1694. A bill to improve quality and accountability for educator  preparation programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.

TITLE III--ENHANCED VICTIM ASSISTANCE TO ELDER ABUSE SURVIVORS       SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE SENATE.         (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:        (1) The vast majority of cases of abuse, neglect, and       exploitation of older adults in the United States go       unidentified and unreported.        (2) Not less than $2,900,000,000 is taken from older adults       each year due to financial abuse and exploitation.        (3) Elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation have no       boundaries and cross all racial, social, class, gender, and       geographic lines.        (4) Older adults who are abused are 3 times more likely to       die earlier than older adults of the same age who are not       abused.        (5) Up to half of all older adults with dementia will       experience abuse.        (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate       that--        (1) elder abuse involves the exploitation of potentially       vulnerable individuals with devastating physical, mental,       emotional, and financial consequences to the victims and       their loved ones;        (2) to combat this affront to America's older adults, we       must do everything possible to both support victims of elder       abuse and prevent the abuse from occurring in the first       place; and        (3) the Senate supports a multipronged approach to prevent       elder abuse and exploitation, protect the victims of elder       abuse and exploitation from further harm, and bring the       perpetrators of such crimes to justice.       SEC. 302. REPORT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date on       which the collection of statistical data under section       202(a)(1) begins and once each year thereafter, the Director       of the Office for Victims of Crime shall submit a report to       the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the       Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives       that addresses, to the extent data are available, the nature,       extent, and amount of funding under the Victims of Crime Act       of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10601 et seq.) for victims of crime who       are elders.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The clerk will report the bill by title.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         A bill (S. 717) to promote pro bono legal services as a       critical way in which to empower survivors of domestic       violence.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.   The bill (S. 717) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading,  was read the third time, and passed, as follows:                                   S. 717         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Pro bono Work to Empower and       Represent Act of 2017'' or the ``POWER Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Extremely high rates of domestic violence, dating       violence, sexual assault, and stalking exist at the local,       State, and national levels and such violence or behavior       harms the most vulnerable members of our society.        (2) According to a study commissioned by the Department of       Justice, nearly 25 percent of women suffer from domestic       violence during their lifetime.        (3) Proactive efforts should be made available in all       forums to provide pro bono legal services and eliminate the       violence that destroys lives and shatters families.        (4) A variety of factors cause domestic violence, dating       violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and a variety of       solutions at the local, State, and national levels are       necessary to combat such violence or behavior.        (5) According to the National Network to End Domestic       Violence, which conducted a census including almost 1,700       assistance programs, over the course of 1 day in September       2014, more than 10,000 requests for services, including legal       representation, were not met.        (6) Pro bono assistance can help fill this need by       providing not only legal representation, but also access to       emergency shelter, transportation, and childcare.        (7) Research and studies have demonstrated that the       provision of legal assistance to victims of domestic       violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking       reduces the probability of such violence or behavior       reoccurring in the future and can help survivors move       forward.        (8) Legal representation increases the possibility of       successfully obtaining a protective order against an       attacker, which prevents further mental and physical injury       to a victim and his or her family, as demonstrated by a study       that found that 83 percent of victims represented by an       attorney were able to obtain a protective order, whereas only       32 percent of victims without an attorney were able to do so.        (9) The American Bar Association Model Rules include       commentary stating that ``every lawyer, regardless of       professional prominence or professional workload, has a       responsibility to provide legal services to those unable to       pay, and personal involvement in the problems of the       disadvantaged can be one of the most rewarding experiences in       the life of a lawyer''.        (10) As representatives of the Department of Justice, the       duty of United States Attorneys is to present ``equal and       impartial justice to all its citizens'', which should       include, especially, survivors of domestic violence, dating       violence, sexual assault, and stalking who might not       otherwise know how to seek advice and protection.        (11) As Federal leaders who have knowledge of domestic       violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in       their localities, United States Attorneys should encourage       lawyers to provide pro bono resources in an effort to help       victims of such violence or behavior escape the cycle of       abuse.        (12) A dedicated army of pro bono attorneys focused on this       mission will inspire others to devote efforts to this cause       and will raise awareness of the scourge of domestic violence,       dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking throughout the       country.        (13) Communities, by providing awareness of pro bono legal       services and assistance to survivors of domestic violence,       dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, will empower       those survivors to move forward with their lives.

(2) Requirement.--Each comprehensive report submitted under       paragraph (1) shall include an analysis of how each public       event meets the goals set forth in this Act, as well as       suggestions on how to improve future public events.       SEC. 5. FUNDING.
