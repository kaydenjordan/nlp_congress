 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration is  engaged in an assault on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding  citizens.   It was recently discovered that the Biden administration has been  maintaining nearly 1 billion records on gun sales. My colleagues and I  sent a letter to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives demanding answers about this registry. The ATF must be held  accountable.   Federal law prohibits the Biden administration from maintaining a  database of 1 billion gun records.                                time  1030    What makes this more outrageous, this unconstitutional behavior of  the Biden administration, is that, at the same time, they are  continuing to empower Mexican cartels, criminal cartels who are  transporting weapons across the border while threatening the rights of  law-abiding Americans.   Lawful gun owners are rightfully concerned, and it is up to Congress  to investigate further. President Biden and the Democrats want to  defund the police, take away your Second Amendment right to self- defense, and then watch as crime skyrockets across the country,  including in cities like Chicago.   I will continue to stand up for our Second Amendment. As long as I am  here in Congress, every day I will fight for our constitutional rights,  including our Second Amendment.                            ____________________
