 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment on an issue I have  worked on for several years on the Committee on Energy and Commerce as  the authorizing committee.   In 2006, the Committee on Appropriations, without an authorization  from the Committee on Energy and Commerce, included a provision in the  annual Department of the Interior EPA Appropriations bill to allow the  Environmental Protection Agency to begin using a special paid program  that was explicitly and exclusively authorized for use by the Public  Health Service Administration under the Department of Health and Human  Services.   The special pay mechanism allows a government employee to leave the  normal GS pay scale and receive nearly uncapped compensation. This  provision was intended to be used only in unique circumstances for  leaders in the healthcare industry who would never leave the private  sector to work for the Federal Government except for those special,  more competitive salaries.   Under current law, this justification can never be used at the  Environmental Protection Agency. Indeed, some of the employees that the  Environmental Protection Agency pays under title 42, the part of the  U.S. Code that allows for this special pay, were previous government  workers who were merely moved into the special pay scale because they  desired more money.   The Environmental Protection Agency has claimed in the past that  because the Environmental Protection Agency is a health organization,  it may use this statute to pay special hires, and the Committee on  Appropriations has agreed to let them, despite the authorizing  committee's objection.   Originally, the Environmental Protection Agency was granted only a  handful of slots to fill with title 42 hires. That number has now  increased to over 50. The cost to the taxpayers for these employees is  tens of millions of dollars.   This amendment would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from  hiring any new employees under title 42, or transferring any current  employees from the GS scale to title 42. It would not effect current  employees being paid under this provision. This would give the  Committee on Energy and Commerce, the authorizing committee, the time  it needs to address whether the EPA truly deserves the special pay  consideration.   The Government Accountability Office looked into the Department of  Health and Human Services' abuse of title 42 several years ago, and  found problems with the implementation of this program. Within the  Department of Health and Human Services where, arguably, this could be  allowed, why would Congress ever allow the Environmental Protection  Agency to implement the same problematic pay structure?                                time  1745    In multiple hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee, both  former Administrator Lisa Jackson and former Administrator Gina  McCarthy refused to give specifics regarding the program. A Freedom of  Information Act request by the EPA union, the American Federation of  Government Employees, sent to my office showed that title 42 hires at  EPA are, in fact, sowing dissent among workers, with the union asking  the Congress to stop this abusive and unfair hiring technique.   A report by the Environmental Protection Agency's own inspector  general in 2015 discovered that the EPA did not properly demonstrate a  need to use the title 42 hiring authority, nor did it provide clear and  convincing justification for its continued use. This is further proof  that the Environmental Protection Agency's use of the title 42 hiring  authority must come to an end.   I have introduced legislation further clarifying that the Public  Health Services Act, written for HHS, does not permit the EPA to use  this language to hire employees under a special pay structure.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It is a reasonable amendment. It only affects employees who are new  hires in title 42 in the Environmental Protection Agency, not in the  CDC and not in NIH. It is an amendment that would allow the authorizing  committee an opportunity to catch up with what the Appropriations  Committee has done without an authorization.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
