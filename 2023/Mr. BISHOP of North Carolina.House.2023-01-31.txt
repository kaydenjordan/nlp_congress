 Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from  Colorado and my colleagues will show in this hour that censorship of  conservative voices proliferates among social media and other tech  companies, banks and other commercial service providers, and massive  public companies and capital markets pursuing ESG policies.   As Mr. Buck suggested, it is worse than that because the leading and  most insidious censors, whose predominant selection of conservatives to  victimize, by the way, as only an aside, are the powerful and secretive  agencies of Federal law enforcement and the so-called intelligence  community.                                time  1830    In only the most recent example of this egregious wrongdoing, and  solely due to the commendable voluntary disclosure by a social media  company of the Twitter files, we now know that not only the FBI but  also the ODNI, NSA, and CIA audaciously abused their power to  coordinate Big Tech and Big Media to suppress from circulation  information that was highly significant to the 2020 Presidential  election; namely, the New York Post's Hunter Biden laptop story.   But even this jaw-dropping disclosure focusing on an isolated  document brings home just how insidious, how brazen the conduct of  these massive and unaccountable agencies has become.   Here is one. Twitter files Number 7, Tweet 15, by one of the  reporters with integrity, Michael Shellenberger: My colleagues at the  Fort had a query for you. This is from Elvis Chan at the FBI to Yoel  Roth at Twitter.   My colleagues at the Fort is a reference to Fort Meade, the  headquarters of the National Security Agency. He says that Twitter no  longer provides their data feed, as they had in earlier years  apparently, and asked if they would be willing to change it.   Their data feed; comments, postings of 77 million Americans and more  than 330 million people worldwide.   My colleagues, Mr. Chan says, are currently contracting with a vendor  for an analytic tool for open-source intelligence. The commercial  version of this tool includes the Twitter data feed. However, the feed  was disabled because  [[Page H561]]  the vendor said they did not want to violate their terms of service  with Twitter.   My colleagues are wondering if Twitter would be open to revising its  terms of service to allow this vendor to continue having access to the  Twitter feed.   This representative of the FBI is asking for Twitter to reverse its  policy to allow government agencies to conduct analytics on the  discourse of the American people; mass surveillance of the public  conversation; collection and preservation, so it can be searched at  will by government bureaucrats for whatever purposes.   And note, he makes reference to the provision of this, not to the  FBI, but ``to members of the IC,'' the intelligence community.   Bad enough if this were the FBI, but he is talking about the agencies  who are supposed to direct their attention abroad for the sake of  American security and, instead, they are seeking mass surveillance on  Americans' utterances and those of unsuspecting people the world over.   A good Democrat, William Proxmire said, power always has to be kept  in check. Power exercised in secret, especially under the cloak of  national security, is doubly dangerous.   Mr. Speaker, in the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the  Federal Government, we will plumb the depths of powerful agencies gone  rogue; and then this Congress must act to keep in check power exercised  in secret.
