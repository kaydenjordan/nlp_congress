 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the valiant actions  of two Air Force officers from our community who placed their own  physical safety on the back burner to save citizens from a burning  vehicle crash.   Captain Zach Evans, a pilot with the 3rd Airlift Squadron, and  Captain Joshua Saddler, a MQ-9 Reaper pilot with the 65th Special  Operations Squadron, are not just heroes but are sons from Nebraska. I  am proud to say that Captain Evans is a former member of our district  staff.   When Zach joined the Air Force, I knew he would go far. Needless to  say, Zach and Josh are both living up to, if not surpassing, all  expectations and are bringing great honor to our community.   On May 5, Captain Zach Evans and Captain Joshua Saddler, good friends  and graduates of the University of Nebraska, witnessed a truck driving  erratically on a poorly lit road in Dover, Delaware. The truck swerved  between lanes, crossing medians, and ignoring traffic signals.   Captain Evans and Captain Saddler called 911 to report the driver and  kept a safe distance. However, the driver  [[Page H6867]]  soon ran a red light directly into an SUV, resulting in a burning two- car collision.   They pulled over, and along with two civilians, assisted the victims  in both vehicles.   While Captain Saddler attended to the trapped people in the SUV,  Captain Evans, at great personal risk to himself, sprinted to the  burning truck to remove the suspected drunk driver, who had two broken  legs, from the vehicle.   Thankfully, Captain Evans saved the man just before the truck became  fully engulfed in flames. Captain Evans and Captain Saddler stayed with  the victims until first responders arrived on scene and remained to  direct traffic.   Captain Evans and Captain Saddler were each recognized on October 23  with the City of Dover Gold Medal for their lifesaving actions and were  presented with the Dover Police Department's Distinguished Citizen  Award.   I salute both Captain Zach Evans and Captain Joshua Saddler and the  two civilians for their actions that day.                 Recognizing Barbara Felden on her Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Barbara Felden,  who, after 43 years of honorable service to our country as an enlisted  airman in the Air Force and as a senior civilian liaison in Germany, is  retiring.   I worked with Barbara starting in 2008 when I was commander of the  435th Air Base Wing at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.   Since 2011, she has been the Host Nation Advisor to the Commander of  the U.S. Air Forces in Europe and U.S. Air Forces Africa.   At 21, Barbara, a German citizen, married to a U.S. airman, qualified  to join the U.S. military service. She was assigned to Robins Air Force  Base after basic training, and returned to Germany where she served in  various liaison assignments, first as an interpreter, then taking on  command-wide responsibilities dealing with Federal officials.   In 1948, she transferred to the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing liaison  office where she developed first-time liaison initiatives with local  communities, such as the organization of German civic leaders and  familiarization to the United States.   One of Barbara's most challenging assignments was closing down the  historic Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt and transferring their  operations to Ramstein Air Base.   Barbara also served as director of the liaison for the U.S.  Kaiserslautern Military Community, the largest military overseas  community in the world.   During my time as commander at Ramstein, Barbara organized events and  meetings with the community. I recall that one time she helped arrange  for me to deliver the opening remarks at the world's largest wine  festival where I had the opportunity to lead a parade and conduct the  orchestra.   Barbara has provided critical support and assistance for a variety of  major projects during her tenure at headquarters for the U.S. Air  Forces in Europe and U.S. Air Forces Africa.   During the COVID pandemic, she liaised with Federal and State  officials to ensure military missions could continue, while ensuring  alignment with the host nation protective measures.                                time  1030    In the late summer of 2021, the emergency evacuation of Afghan  nationals to Ramstein Air Base presented many challenges for Ms. Felden  and her team. While initial expectations were for 5,000 evacuees, about  35,000 people were actually processed at Ramstein.   Barbara has always displayed the utmost professionalism in the  various positions she held during her 43 years. I am proud of her  accomplishments, and I am honored to call her and her husband, Claude,  my friends. I salute you both. I thank Barbara for all she has done in  her stellar career.                            ____________________
