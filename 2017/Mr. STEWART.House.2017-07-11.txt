 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may  hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 622, a bill  originally introduced by Representative Chaffetz of Utah, for the  purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to  clause 7 of rule XII.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
