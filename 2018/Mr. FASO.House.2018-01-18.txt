 Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise today to  recognize and celebrate the career of Mrs. Kathleen Jimino on the  occasion of her retirement as Rensselaer County executive. Kathy has  retired after 16 years of dedicated service to the people of Rensselaer  County.   Throughout her tenure as county executive, Kathy was a driving force  for economic growth and fiscal solvency in Rensselaer County, actively  responding to the needs of her constituency in an effective and  resourceful manner.   In addition to the time as county executive, I am grateful for the  many years Kathy spent loyally serving the people of New York State and  the city of Troy.   Kathy has been an esteemed leader of the community, and I thank her  for her commitment to New York's 19th Congressional District. I wish  Kathy and her husband, Vince, every happiness as they embark upon this  new chapter in their lives.                            ____________________
