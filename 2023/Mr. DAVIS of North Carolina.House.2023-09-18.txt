 Mr. Speaker, I rise to give a big shout- out to some truly exceptional workers, among many, who are the  heartbeat of our community: the United States postal workers,  firefighters, and TSA workers.   Recently, I had the opportunity to meet with U.S. postal workers who  ensure packages get delivered even in some of our most rural  communities. Indeed, our U.S. postal workers deserve protection.   I also visited with firefighters in Greenville and TSA agents at the  Pitt-Greenville Airport who are doing incredible work, and that is why  we must ensure pay equity.   I extend my deepest gratitude for the exceptional service and the  work that is getting done each day for the American people. Let us  never forget our essential workers who strengthen the Nation.                            ____________________
