 Mr. President, I rise to recognize Bill Raney, a  dedicated West Virginian, who is retiring after serving 28 years as  president and chief executive officer of the West Virginia Coal  Association.   Bill knows the value of coal--to our Appalachian communities, where  it puts food on the table; to our State, where it provides tax revenues  to pave our roads and fund our schools; and to our Nation, where it has  helped power the greatest economic engine the world has ever known for  more than a century. He also appreciates the challenges and dangers  inherent in producing the black gold that creates all that well-being,  starting his career working in public service to protect our miners.   Starting in 1970, Bill--a graduate of his beloved West Virginia  University--became familiarized with the coal industry working as a  surface mine inspector for the West Virginia Department of Natural  Resources Division of Reclamation. In recognition of his service, he  was later promoted to assistant chief of that division. Moving to the  private sector, Bill then served as vice president of the West Virginia  Mining & Reclamation Association from 1977, until being named president  of the West Virginia Coal Association in 1992. When the two  organizations merged in 2000, he remained president of the newly formed  organization, representing the whole of West Virginia's coal industry.   Bill held these leadership positions serving the hard-working coal  miners of West Virginia, while also serving his country in the West  Virginia Army National Guard. During his time with the Guard, he served  in various leadership roles, including commander of the 1092nd Combat  Engineer Battalion, commander of the 111th Engineer Group, and special  assistant to the Adjutant General at the rank of colonel. Following his  personal service, Bill has continued advocating on behalf of our  guardsmen as president of the West Virginia National Guard Association  and chairman of the West Virginia National Guard Foundation.   Bill's participation in civic organizations extends far beyond the  military and the coal industry, as he has served as both chairman and  as a current board member of the West Virginia Business & Industry  Council; current board member of the West Virginia Youth Leadership  Association's Youth in Government Program, former chairman and current  board member of the West Virginia Kids Count Fund; advisory member of  the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection Advisory  Committee; member of the West Virginia University School of Engineering  Mining Program Visiting Committee; as an elder at the First  Presbyterian Church in Charleston; and volunteering his time with  several other organizations. Bill has left an indelible legacy through  his commitment to our State and our Nation's military, impacts that  will be felt throughout and beyond the coalfields.   Bill Raney's passion for the coal industry and the improvement of the  State has earned him numerous honors and awards over the course of his  distinguished career. This includes but is not limited to the  Distinguished West Virginian Award, the WVU Alumni Association's Most  Loyal Alumni Award, the National Multiple Sclerosis Association's Hope  Award, and the Lewis McManus Service Award given by the West Virginia  Youth in Government Program. Mr. Raney has also been inducted into the  West Virginia Coal Hall of Fame and the First Tee Hall of Fame.   It has been an honor to know and work with Bill during his  distinguished tenure representing the coal industry and several  esteemed civic organizations in West Virginia. He has been a great  ally, resource, and friend to me over the years, and I will be forever  grateful for his service. I wish him and his wife Pam many years of joy  in this new phase of life. It is truly an honor to recognize and  congratulate my friend Bill Raney on his well-deserved  retirement.                            ____________________
