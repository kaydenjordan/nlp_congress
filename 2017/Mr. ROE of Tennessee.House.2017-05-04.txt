 Mr. Speaker, the American Health Care Act in no  way changes the existing regulations that allow a veteran who is  eligible but not enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs'  healthcare system from using a tax credit to purchase health insurance.  Language that would have codified that legislation into law was removed  from an earlier version of the bill to comply with Senate rules.                                time  1200    Removing language in no way changes that existing regulation or a  veteran's eligibility to receive a tax credit. By the way, that is the  exact same language that was in the ACA. I repeat that: the American  Health Care Act in no way affects a veteran's ability to access tax  credits.   I am disturbed that our colleagues in the minority, Mr. Speaker,  would assert that it does, in an effort to score political points  against this legislation. Fear-mongering has no place in this debate or  where America's veterans are concerned.   As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, as a medical doctor,  and as a veteran myself, ensuring that veterans' health care is  protected is my highest priority in this Congress, and I would not  stand for language in this bill or any other bill that would compromise  a veteran's ability to access care.    Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, I stood right in this  well to debate the ACA, which the premise was to increase access and  decrease costs. We all agree with that. But that is not exactly what  happened.   In my district, in the State of Tennessee, over one-third of the  counties have no place they can buy insurance; and multiple counties in  my State, including the third largest, have no access. Premiums have  soared over 60 percent. Eighteen of the 23 co-ops went bankrupt,  including one in my State, which required people to search for other  coverage.   No matter what verbiage you hear, nothing in this bill changes how  veterans are treated under the law--nothing. The criticisms are flat- out wrong. I am a veteran, doctor, and chairman of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, and it ain't gonna happen.   In my State, and where I practiced medicine for over 30 years, listen  to this: 60 to 70 percent of the uncollectible debt now are people with  insurance.   So why do I support this bill?   One, it protects preexisting conditions;   Two, it puts patients ahead of special interests and restores a  physician-patient relationship;   Three, it reforms Medicaid so that first-class people don't get  second-class care; and   Four, it repeals individual mandates so that 160,000 Tennesseans  don't get fined for a product they cannot afford.   Mr. Speaker, this bill isn't perfect, but it is a huge improvement  over ObamaCare, and it is worthy of every Member's support.
