 Mr. President, I am pleased that at any moment now, we  will move to invoke cloture on the nomination of Dan Brouillette to be  Secretary of Energy. As folks know, he is currently serving as our  Deputy Secretary of Energy. In my view, he has excelled in that role  since being confirmed by this body in a strong bipartisan vote back in  August of 2017. He has run the Department on a daily basis. He has been  helping Secretary Perry set an agenda that has been focused on energy  security and technological innovation. He has been a good partner of  the Energy Committee--honest, open, and responsive. I have certainly  appreciated all of his leadership.   We commend him to this body. He did very well in his nomination  hearing before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I believe he  will do very well in his new role. I encourage all Members to work with  us to confirm him as soon as possible today.                            ____________________
