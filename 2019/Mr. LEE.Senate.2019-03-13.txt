 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I stand with Senator Sanders and with Senator  Murphy as a cosponsor of the legislation before us, S.J. Res. 7, which  would remove U.S. Armed Forces from Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen.   There were 56 Senators who voted in favor of this resolution just a  few months ago, in December, or at the end of the last Congress. That  vote was, of course, a victory for the Constitution and for the  separation of powers, to say nothing of prudence, of peace, and of  justice. The House of Representatives passed its own version of this  resolution earlier this year. Now it is back to us. Now it is our turn.  Now it is our job to get this passed. We have the opportunity today to  reassert Congress's constitutional role over declaring war and over  putting American blood and treasure on the line.   In this particular case, the evidence is clear that we ought not be  involved in this unconstitutional, unjustified, and, ultimately,  immoral war. The Yemeni war has claimed the lives of tens of thousands  of people, including those of countless innocent civilians. It has  created countless refugees, orphans, widows, and it has also displaced  countless families. The numbers are nothing short of staggering.   Since 2015, more than 6,000 civilians have died, and more than 10,000  have been wounded. The majority of these casualties--over 10,000 of  them--has been as the result of airstrikes led by the Saudi-led  coalition. In one attack last year, the Saudis dropped a U.S.-made bomb  on a schoolbus that killed 40 young children on a school trip and  wounded another 30 children in addition to that.   Yemen is now facing rampant disease and mass starvation. An estimated  15 million people do not have access to clean water and sanitation, and  17 million don't have access to food. Photographs from Yemen depict  malnourished children who have every rib in their tiny bodies exposed  and jetting out as manifestations of their starvation. Over 85,000  children have died of starvation since 2015.   In short, the situation in Yemen has become the worst humanitarian  crisis in the world, and the United States has been abating the horrors  of this war. Indeed, our country has actually made the crisis worse by  helping one side bomb innocent civilians. I don't say that lightly. It  is with great soberness that I raise this very real and very serious  accusation.   So it begs the question: How did we get entangled in this crisis to  begin with? How did we get involved? Why and how and under what  circumstances did this become our war to fight?   In March of 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a war against the Houthi  rebels. Shortly after the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government in  the capital city of Sanaa, the Obama administration--without consulting  Congress, of course--authorized U.S. military forces to provide  logistical and intelligence support to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia-led  coalition fighting that war. U.S. military support has continued ever  since then, for the last 4 years, including with midair refueling,  surveillance, reconnaissance information, and target selection  assistance. In other words, we have been supporting and, in fact, have  been actively participating in the activities of war. We are involved  in this conflict as, no less, cobelligerents.   Some of my colleagues have argued to the contrary and have suggested  that we are somehow not involved in this war in Yemen. Yet, if we are  honest with ourselves, we know that isn't true. We know that this  argument falls dead flat on its face. As Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  himself acknowledged in December of 2017, just a little over a year  ago, our military has been helping the Saudis with target selection  assistance or with ``making certain they hit the right thing.''   In other words, we are helping a foreign power bomb its adversaries  in what is, undoubtedly, indisputably, a war. Previously, we were  helping them even with midair refueling assistance--that is, helping  Saudi jets that were en route to bombing missions and other combat  missions on the ground inside of Yemen. If that doesn't constitute  direct involvement in a war, I don't know what does.   Other opponents of our resolution claim somehow that our involvement  in Yemen is constitutional, that it is lawful under the War Powers Act  of 1973. It is true that under the War Powers Act, the executive branch  is authorized to use Armed Forces in cases of emergencies and in other  certain, rigid, well-established time constraints. Yet, you see, the  conflict in Yemen does not constitute a threat to the safety of  American citizens, and our involvement has far surpassed any emergency  time allotted under the War Powers Resolution.   The Houthis, while, perhaps, no friends of the American people, make  up a regional rebel group that does not itself threaten American  national security. In fact, the longer we fight against it, the more we  give reason to it to hate America and to embrace the opportunists who  are our true enemies in the region--those who make up the regime in  power in Iran. The more we prolong the activities that destabilize this  region, the longer we harm our own interests in terms of trade and  broader regional security.   The War Powers Act also states that the assignment of U.S. Armed  Forces to coordinate and to participate in the hostilities of a foreign  power, of a foreign country, itself constitutes a conflict of war. Some  have argued that we have not been engaging in hostilities and,  therefore, somehow, have not violated the War Powers Act. This claim  falls flat in several respects.   First, the claim itself is categorically untrue. As we heard before,  we are literally telling the Saudis what to bomb, what to hit, and what  and whom to take out.   Second, these opponents are relying on an old, 1976 memorandum that  is internal to the executive branch and internal to the Department of  Defense itself that was written by a lawyer within the Department of  Defense. Talk about the fox guarding the henhouse. It defers to a  Department of Defense lawyer's memorandum from 1976 that uses an  unreasonably,  [[Page S1828]]  unsustainably, indefensibly slim definition of the word  ``hostilities.'' This definition may or may not have been relevant  then. I don't know. I was only 5 years old at the time it was written.  Yet we no longer live in a world in which ``war'' means exclusively two  competing countries that are lined up on opposite ends of the  battlefield, in two columns, and that are engaged in direct exchanges  of fire across the same ground. That is not how war is waged anymore.   War activities, of course, have changed dramatically since 1976. Like  bell-bottoms and so many fads of that era, this is a dynamic that has  changed today. Our war in today's America increasingly relies on high  technology and on high-technology solutions. Our wars have involved  cyber activity, reconnaissance, surveillance, and high-tech target  selection. These, by the way, are the precise activities that we  ourselves are undertaking in Yemen. It is not just that we are involved  somehow on the sidelines. These activities themselves constitute war.   Even aside from this overly narrow, cramped, and indefensible  definition of the word ``hostilities'' and separate and apart from the  definition of the word ``hostilities,'' under the War Powers Act, we  ourselves do not have to technically be involved in hostilities in  order to trigger the responsibilities of the Congress under the War  Powers Act in order to make sure that the legislative branch actually  does its job to declare war or to authorize the use of military force  under the War Powers Act and under the Constitution. The War Powers  Act, in fact, is triggered so long as we are sufficiently involved with  the armed forces of another nation when those armed forces of another  nation are themselves involved in hostilities, which they indisputably  are.   The Saudi-led coalition directing the activities in the civil war in  Yemen against the Houthis is undeniably involved in hostilities. We are  undeniably assisting the coalition in those movements, in those  activities, in those acts of war. We, therefore, by definition under  the plain language of the War Powers Act itself, are subjected to the  terms of the War Powers Act. The Saudis are, without question, involved  in those hostilities. We can't doubt that. No one here can credibly  claim to the contrary.   Finally, some argue that this resolution might somehow harm or  undermine or hurt our efforts to combat terrorism in the region  specifically with regard to al-Qaida and ISIS. Importantly, however,  this resolution explicitly states that the resolution would not impede  the military's ability to fight these terror groups. In fact, U.S.  involvement in Yemen has, arguably, undermined the effort against al- Qaida's affiliates. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism  for 2016 found that the conflict between the Saudi-led forces and  Houthi insurgents has actually helped al-Qaida in the Arabian  Peninsula, or AQAP, as it is often described, and ISIS' Yemen branch to  ``deepen their inroads across much of the country.''   It appears that our involvement in Yemen accomplishes no good at all,  only harm--and significant harm at that. Recent events are bringing  that into an even clearer light. In October, there was the killing of  Jamal Khashoggi. Then, just the week before last, news broke that the  Saudis tortured a man while he was detained there in 2017. He had dual  citizenship in the United States and Saudi Arabia. Shortly before that,  a report also came out that suggested that Saudi Arabia had transferred  American-made, American-manufactured weapons to al-Qaida-linked  fighters and to other militant groups. In other words, the Saudis are  likely using our own weapons in violation of our own end-user  agreements with them, by the way, to commit these atrocities of war.  That is not OK.   It is becoming clearer and clearer that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  is not an ally that deserves our unwavering, unquestioning, unflinching  support. It is not an ally that deserves our support or our military  intervention, especially when our own security--the safety of the  American people--is not on the line, and I haven't heard anyone in this  body maintain otherwise.   Indeed, perhaps we ought not be supporting this regime at all. At a  bare minimum, we ought not be deferring unflinchingly to this regime,  and we ought not be fighting an unjust war on its behalf half a world  away, putting at risk not only U.S. treasure but also, potentially,  U.S. blood and the blood of countless innocent civilians who are in the  line of fire as a result of this. To the contrary, to continue  supporting them in this war would be bad diplomacy and would undermine  our very credibility on the world stage.   Look, regardless of where you stand on this war, these decisions  matter, and we ought to take them seriously. In fact, each and every  one of us has sworn an oath to take things like this seriously.   The Constitution puts the war-making power--the power to declare  war--in the hands of Congress. There was a good reason for this. It has  everything to do with the fact that Congress is the branch of the  Federal Government most accountable to the people at the most regular  intervals, and our Founding Fathers wisely understood that it was  dangerous to allow the powers of government to accumulate in the hands  of the few or in the hands of one person.   One of the reasons they put the war-making power in the hands of  Congress is they wanted to make a strong break away from the system  that had evolved in our old system of government, the one involved in  our old capital based in London, where the chief executive himself had  the power unilaterally to make war.   This was a decided break from that tradition. There were other  traditions that we continued, that we adopted. Many of our rights, our  liberties, our processes in government were patterned after the British  model. This one was not. It was deliberately the choice of the Founding  Fathers not to continue with that tradition, and that is why we and  only we can declare war.   You see, it is not that we are flawless. It is not that we are any  smarter than people in other branches. Quite to the contrary, it has  only to do--and everything to do--with the fact that we are more  accountable to the people at more routine intervals.   When you put the power to declare war or authorize the use of  military force in Congress, you guarantee that this decision will be  made carefully and deliberately in full view of the American people.  Public debates have a way of bringing the American people into the  discussion, into the deliberation.   You see, there is no such thing as a clean war. There is no such  thing as a war that is detached from moral peril, from moral  consequences, from grave and heartbreaking results in which innocent  men, women, and children lose their lives or are subjected to the worst  privations known to human beings.   It is for that very reason that we owe it to those affected by war-- not just the brave men and women who fight for us and protect us but  for people all over the world and for the good name of the United  States to be protected--that as we publicly debate the moral  consequences of war, the grave implications that war has for our  country and others involved in the conflict are the business of all of  the American people and should never be reserved for one person.   We need to carefully weigh the risks and merits of engaging in any  conflict in an open and in an honest manner. So instead of placing this  power in the hands of a King or even just in the executive branch  generally where it can be used unilaterally to declare war, the  Founders placed it here in Congress, knowing that we are more  accountable to the people than the other branches, and the power would  be less likely to be abused here.   There is a lot at stake. There is a lot at stake whenever the lives  of American military personnel are placed on the line and whenever the  lives of innocent men, women, and children are on the line, too-- precious lives, each of immeasurable worth. These decisions result in  the shedding of blood, the shedding of blood that will be on our hands  if we fail both to exercise our constitutional prerogatives and to take  that very responsibility very seriously.   Over the last 80 years, we have tragically seen what happens when the  muscle of the legislative branch begins to atrophy as a result of the  failure of those who occupy these very seats to exercise their  legislative muscle. When we fail to exercise that power that the  [[Page S1829]]  Constitution entrusts to us, entrusted to us in that document to which  each of us has taken an oath, we imperil the entire system and the  safety of our country. We also cheapen the moral certainty with which  our Armed Forces need to be able to proceed in order to make what they  do right and legally and morally justifiable.   So today, I respectfully and with all the passion and energy I am  capable of communicating urge my colleagues once again to vote to end  our involvement in this unauthorized, unjustified, unconstitutional,  and immoral war.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign  Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of S.J.  Res. 7 and that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of  S.J. Res. 7. I further ask that there be 2 hours of debate, equally  divided between the two leaders or their designees, with 10 minutes of  the Democratic time being reserved for Senator Menendez; further, that  the following amendments be called up and reported by number, Paul  amendment No. 193, Inhofe amendment No. 194, and Rubio amendment No.  195; further, that no other first-degree amendments be in order and no  second-degree amendments be in order prior to a vote in relation to  these amendments; finally, that upon the use or yielding back of that  time, the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the order listed  and that following the disposition of the amendments, the joint  resolution, as amended, if amended, be read a third time and the Senate  vote on passage of the joint resolution as amended, if amended, with 2  minutes equally divided prior to each vote.    Mr. President, I want to be very clear about a couple of  things. No. 1, the fact that the word ``hostilities''--    Yes, sir.    Mr. President, I need to make a few points, and I say these  with great respect for my distinguished colleagues on the other side of  this issue, with great respect for my colleagues, the Senator from  Alaska and the Senator from Idaho, from whom we just heard.   I must nonetheless insist on a couple of points being made. No. 1,  this tortured definition of the word ``hostilities'' that we have heard  over and over and over again is itself, No. 1, ridiculous and, No. 2,  utterly at odds  [[Page S1834]]  with and irrelevant under the War Powers Act.   The War Powers Act itself, in title 50 of the United States Code,  section 1547(c), states in pertinent part that ``For purposes of this  chapter, the term `introduction of United States Armed Forces' includes  the assignment of members of such armed forces to command, coordinate,  participate in the movement of, or accompany the regular or irregular  military forces of any foreign country or government when such military  forces are engaged, or there exists an imminent threat that such forces  will be engaged, in hostilities.''   There is absolutely no question here that the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia-led coalition is involved in hostilities. No one doubts that. No  one tries to dress it up in ridiculous language amounting to anything  other than what it is, which is a war. It is also beyond dispute that  our U.S. Armed Forces are, in fact, involved in the commanding, the  coordinating, the participating in the movement of and the accompanying  of those forces, as they themselves are engaged in hostilities.  Therefore, the War Powers Act is itself implicated, and that matters.   Why? Well, because in the absence of an act of Congress authorizing  this, it is unconstitutional for us to send our brave young men and  women into harm's way. It is unconstitutional and unlawful for us to be  involved in a war, and, make no mistake, we are involved in a war.   Next, we hear a lot about Iran--Iran this and Iran that. I get that.  I get that some people in this Chamber really like war or at least  really like this war. I get that some people in this Chamber really  distrust the regime in Iran, and of that latter group, I count myself  among them. The regime in charge of Iran is not a friend of the United  States and is, in fact, an enemy.   I do not understand--for the life of me, I cannot comprehend how the  fact that the Iranian regime is an enemy to the United States in any  way, shape, or form authorizes an unconstitutional war effort, an  undeclared war by the United States in a civil war half a world away in  Yemen. It makes no sense. It is a complete non sequitur. So, look, if  somebody wants to bring a resolution declaring war on Iran, let's have  that conversation. If somebody wants to use military force in Iran or  anywhere else in the world--in Yemen--let's have that conversation too.   Remember a few years ago, when President Obama decided he wanted us  to go to war in Syria. At the time he made that point, Congress  reconvened. I believe it was during a summer recess. Congress came  back. We had a lot of discussions. A lot of us received classified  briefings in the SCIF, and, ultimately, Congress concluded: Let's not  do that. We didn't authorize that, but that is, in fact, for Congress  to decide. That is, in fact, Congress's decision.   The fact that Iran or the regime of Iran may be an enemy of the  United States does not justify our going to war in a civil war against  the Houthi rebels in Yemen. To suggest otherwise makes no sense and  shouldn't carry the day here.   Third, experts--we hear a lot of talk about ``experts.'' I don't care  whether general this, that, or the other or civilian this, that, or the  other in the Pentagon or elsewhere in the executive branch of the  government thinks that our going to war in somebody else's civil war  half a world away makes sense. I really don't care. They don't hold  this office.   I care in the sense that I will listen to them; I care in the sense  that their opinion might be informative to us as we exercise our  constitutional authority to decide whether we should go to war. But it  is a complete non sequitur to suggest that general this, that, or the  other or somebody or other at the Pentagon who is an ``expert'' thinks  that we should be in that war or that we should somehow be able to  circumvent the Constitution and the law in order to go to war.   Finally, with respect to the suggestion that this would somehow  hinder our involvement in international humanitarian aid, that is  completely incorrect. That is not at all what this resolution does.  This resolution wouldn't do that.   What this resolution does is very simple. It says that short of the  U.S. Congress's declaring war or authorizing the use of military force  in the civil war in Yemen, half a world away, we shouldn't be there,  and we should get out. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  resolution.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Menendez's time be reserved; that all other remaining time be yielded  back; and that the Senate begin voting on the amendments, as under the  previous order.    I yield back time.
