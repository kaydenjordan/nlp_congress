 Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to  Mr. Frank Frazier of Oxford, NC, for his 35 years of dedicated public  service to the city of Henderson and surrounding communities. Mr.  Frazier was hired as an engineering technician for the city of  Henderson in 1985 and has since dedicated his career to public service.  He has held a number of roles within local government including, but  not limited to, director of engineering, assistant city manager and  city manager.   As city manager, Mr. Frazier has managed over 200 employees  responsible for all city operations including the Fire and Police  Departments, engineering, human resources, finance, recreation, and  water resources, among many others. Mr. Frazier has led several  significant projects that have benefited the city, county, and region  as a whole, including upgrades to the Henderson Water Reclamation  Facility and an upgrade to the Kerr Lake Regional Water Plant. Not only  did Mr. Frazier successfully execute many accomplishments for the  community, he did so through balanced budgets without tax increases and  simultaneously providing substantial pay raises to city employees.   Mr. Frazier is well respected and acknowledged for his consistent  dedication to improving the quality of life for Henderson and the  greater region. I would like to thank Mr. Frazier for his 35 years of  honorable service, as well as acknowledge his wife Sherrie and their  two sons, Mitchell and Chad, who have supported his service. I wish Mr.  Frazier all the best in his future endeavors as he retires from the  city of Henderson.                            ____________________
