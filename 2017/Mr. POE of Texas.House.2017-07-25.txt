 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I also thank  the ranking member for their work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I have spoken to our military leaders, and they said  that the biggest threat to the United States is North Korea. Strategic  patience is over. It is time for strategic sanctions. This bill will go  a long way to tighten the screws on little Kim and bring the dictator  to his knees. We can no longer stand by meekly while North Korea  terrorizes the world.   This bill includes my bill that has already passed the House that  calls on the State Department to reassess if North Korea should be on  the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Let us not forget that North  Korea helped supply Syria with chemical weapons. It has given Iran  ballistic missiles and advice on how to develop its own nukes.   North Korea and Iran's evil cooperation is even going on as we speak  today. They are now working together to develop an intercontinental  ballistic missile that can reach American shores.   This bill also puts China in the crosshairs. Chinese banks have  enabled the Korean regime to avoid sanctions and build its illegal  weapons programs. China even provided the vehicle used to launch North  Korea's new ICBM.   China also uses slave labor from North Korea to help North Korea  avoid sanctions already in place. China needs to understand how its  support for Kim will not only endanger the United States and South  Korea, but it also endangers its own security.   Mr. Speaker, by targeting these rogue nations, we show we will not go  away quietly in the darkness of silence.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, last Friday night, an Israeli family  sat down for Shabbat dinner to celebrate the birth of a new grandchild,  but a 19-year-old Palestinian terrorist put an end to this joyous  occasion.   The terrorist brutally attacked the Salomon family with a large  knife. Pictures of the family's home show a white floor stained red  with the blood of the innocents.   A father and two of his children were murdered that night. Upon  learning of the tragic event, Palestinians in Gaza took to the streets  to sing, dance, and celebrate. No Palestinian leader has even condemned  this grizzly attack.   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this is our U.S. tax dollars at work. The  millions the United States sends to the Palestinians are funneled to  terrorists and their families through the so-called martyrs fund. The  leaders we prop up glorify terrorists and incite violence.   The American people refuse to continue this insanity. We refuse to  continue enabling terror against the Israeli people.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
