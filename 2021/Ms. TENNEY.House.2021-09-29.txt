 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of my former Congressman, Sherwood Boehlert, affectionately known by  everyone as Sherry.   Sherry was a devout public servant who passed away last week at the  age of 84. After serving in the United States Army, his love for his  community and State led him to begin his career in public service. He  was elected as the Oneida County Executive in 1979. He was then elected  to represent our community in the House of Representatives in 1983 and  served for 24 years, until 2006.   Throughout his time in Congress, Sherry was committed to representing  our region to the best of his ability. He returned home whenever he  could. In 2001, he was elected chair of the House Committee on Science,  a coveted position that built on his love of nature  [[Page H5514]]  and our environment. He actually led the charge to tackle the issue of  acid rain and had tremendous success.   He is remembered by his colleagues as a remarkable individual and  never lost sight of the reason he was elected: to fight for all of us  in upstate New York.   Sherry was born in 1936. He spent his childhood in my hometown of New  Hartford, New York. Prior to elected office, Sherry Boehlert graduated  from Utica College, a local favorite. He went on to serve as chief of  staff to former Congressman Alexander Pirnie and then also served under  former Congressman Donald Mitchell before he actually served as county  executive and later as Congressman. He married his lovely wife,  Marianne, and was immensely proud as a father to his four children.   I just wanted to share a few reflections on Sherry. I obviously had  the honor of working with him while I was a staffer for the Assembly. I  do live in our former Congressman's home, Alexander Pirnie, and while  Sherry was his chief of staff, he often commented to me about what I  have done with the house. Where I was, what I have done with it, how  much time he spent there and how he knew every corner of it, working  with our former Congressman.   I also have a funny story about our family business. Our newspaper,  the Mid-York Weekly, and also the Pennysaver were located in the  district, and I had the occasion to invite Congressman Boehlert to  visit us and to see our operations. It was quite a fun day.   We got to the back--in the newspaper business, as many know, we have  an inserting operation where we put our flyers in the back of the  newspaper, and it tended to be filled with a lot of retired farmers and  a lot of people from our community, particularly a lot of very  energetic senior citizens--and Sherry got back there and was really  excited to meet them all.   One of them put him to the challenge to see if he could actually do  the job. And so Sherry, without hesitation, took off his business coat,  rolled up his sleeves, sat down and started inserting newspapers in our  business. They loved him for that. It was really a fun moment, and I  think he had a really great time with our seniors and with a lot of our  staff.   We are always grateful for him for coming to our newspaper. And also  for his annual support of a publication, a special publication we put  out each February honoring our Presidents, our Vice-Presidents, our  First Ladies, and of course our First Dogs, and Sherry was always so  supportive of us for that.   We are just so glad that we are able to honor him this week with so  many great reflections and so many people reaching out to me in  Congress. Over the last week, it was really heartwarming to get those  messages from Members of Congress, and I might add on both sides of the  aisle. I have seen many tributes, even on the Senate side. He will  always be fondly remembered by all of our colleagues, Republicans and  Democrats.   Earlier this week, I had the distinct honor of participating in his  funeral service alongside previous elected officials from our region,  also other Congress Members. It was a solemn occasion honoring his  life, but also a joyous one to celebrate all that he achieved for our  community.   Today, my thoughts and my prayers are with Sherry's family,  especially his wife, Marianne, who is also a devoted public servant.   I ask that you please join me now in remembering Sherry with a moment  of silence in this great Chamber where he served so many years. Thank  you, all.                            ____________________
