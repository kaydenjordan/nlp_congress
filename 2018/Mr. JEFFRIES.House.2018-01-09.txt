 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  California for yielding and for his forceful advocacy and brilliant  articulation of  [[Page H74]]  the GOP tax scam and all that it represents.   It really is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It is the ultimate hustle.  It is nothing but a classic bait and switch. It is a fraudulent Ponzi  scheme. The notion that this bill is designed to help benefit middle  class folks and working families, those who aspire to be part of the  middle class, is such complete fiction when 83 percent of the benefits  of the GOP tax scam will go to the wealthiest 1 percent in America.   We know that at least 36 million middle class families, if not more,  will experience a tax increase. Medicare, as was just articulated, will  be undermined, the deficit will explode, and our children and  grandchildren are being asked to shoulder at least $1.5 trillion in  additional debt to pay for tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires,  special interests, corporations, and big donors to our friends on the  other side.    Don't take my word for it. There have been Members of this House who  have indicated they needed to get this massive tax cut for wealthy  individuals done or their donors would stop contributing. We didn't say  that. That is folks from this Chamber on the other side of the aisle  when talking about the urgency of jamming this reckless tax scam down  the throats of the American people.   As the Congressman, the distinguished gentleman from California, just  articulated, the whole premise that anyone other than the wealthy and  the well off is going to benefit is built upon the fraud of trickle- down economics, when there is absolutely no evidence that trickle-down  economics has ever done anything for everyday Americans.   When Ronald Reagan cut taxes on millionaires in 1981, we didn't get  explosive economic growth. We got an explosion in the deficit.   When George W. Bush cut taxes on millionaires and billionaires in  2001 and 2003, we didn't get explosive economic growth. We got the  Great Recession in terms of the legacy of the Bush economy.   Then there was the so-called great Republican experiment in Kansas,  where a Republican State Legislature and a Republican Governor  massively cut taxes on the wealthiest, top folks in Kansas.   And was there massive economic growth?   No. We got prison riots, overcrowded classrooms, and crumbling  infrastructure.   Those are the facts. That is what so-called trickle-down economics  has yielded, and now this fraud is being perpetrated on the American  people.   It is shameful. It is our children and grandchildren who are going to  deal with the consequences of this highly partisan effort to benefit  the wealthiest amongst us. It is a raw deal for the American people.   We are going to offer a better deal for the American people; focus on  better jobs, better wages, and a better future; focus on higher pay,  lower cost; and giving the American people the tools to succeed in the  21st century economy by focusing on a real infrastructure bill, real  training, real community college opportunity, real tax reform for  middle class Americans and those who aspire to be part of it.   I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding, for his leadership  in this area, and I look forward to working together to deliver to the  American people the better deal that they deserve.    Mr. Speaker, it certainly is the case that because of  the GOP tax scam, because of the $1.5 trillion in additional debt that  we, as a country, will now have to shoulder so that massive tax cuts  can be provided to millionaires, billionaires, special interests,  corporations, and big donors, that we are not necessarily in a position  to responsibly fund the type of infrastructure plan that the Nation  deserves to fix our crumbling bridges, roads, and tunnels.                                time  1830    We believe, as Democrats, that the American people, in that regard,  deserve a better deal, a better deal, again, focused on higher pay,  lower costs, and the tools to succeed in the 21st century economy.   One of the ways that you deliver better jobs is through a meaningful  infrastructure plan that is appropriately funded, not on the backs of  working families, middle class folks, and everyday Americans. It should  be funded in an appropriate way. Those who can afford to pay should be  paying their fair share. But we just went through a reverse Robin Hood  process as it relates to this tax bill, and that is unfortunate.   I am hopeful that we will proceed in a bipartisan way. The President  has indicated that he thinks that would be an appropriate approach. We  will see whether that is a genuine articulation of a way forward or  not. But we cannot repeat the mistakes that were just attendant to the  process of jamming this tax bill down the throats of the American  people and jamming us in a way that will hurt everyday Americans.    Mr. Speaker, I think that is exactly right. The  gentleman's concerns and suspicions are well-founded based upon the  approach that was taken by this Congress on the other side of the aisle  in connection with the tax bill.   So the individual tax cuts, to the extent that there are any that  will be felt by the American people, are modest; the corporate tax cuts  are massive.   The individual tax cuts are temporary; the corporate tax cuts are  permanent.   The ability of individuals to take a State and local tax deduction  has been decimated; the ability of corporations to use the State and  local tax deduction on their corporate tax return is untouched.   The moving expense deduction for individuals has been eliminated, but  corporations can continue to take moving expense deductions for closing  down a factory or a plant here in America and shipping those good- paying American jobs overseas to China, India, or other parts of the  world.    That is correct.    Absolutely.    It is totally outrageous, and it is exactly why the  gentleman's concern about what our colleagues may be attempting to do  with respect to the infrastructure bill is real. Because what we have  just seen is an effort to massively transfer wealth from individuals  and from everyday Americans to wealthy Americans and incredibly well- off corporations in ways that should never be possible in the United  States of America.    Absolutely. And I found this sort of whole discussion  of trying to punish taxpayers in California, New York, New Jersey,  Connecticut, Illinois, and Pennsylvania to benefit States in the Deep  South or other parts of the country that already receive more from the  Federal Government than they give in return to taxes to be outrageous,  and this will just continue the inequity.   New York regularly sends $40 billion more to the Federal Government  than we get back in return, and they have just made a bad situation  worse. The same for California.    Mr. Speaker, I look forward continuing to work together  for the gentleman's advocacy. We will dissect this tax bill for the  American people, continue to discuss it, expose its fraudulent nature,  and also lay out in clear terms the better deal we are offering,  focused on better jobs, better wages, and a better future.
