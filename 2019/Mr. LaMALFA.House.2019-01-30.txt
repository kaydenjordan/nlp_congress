 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a bipartisan bill  that I have been working on with my colleague from California (Mr.  Garamendi). This week, we introduced H.R. 830, the Flood Insurance for  Farmers Act.   Currently, FEMA's requirements for flood hazard areas essentially  prohibit farmers from expanding or improving operations on what they  deem as floodplains, often requiring barns and silos to be raised  upwards of 10 feet, which can be very cost prohibitive for farmers and  prevent needed buildings. This legislation would remove this  unnecessary red tape, while also allowing farmers to pay more  reasonable flood insurance rates that align with their true level of  risk.   If levees in the area provide a 50-year level of flood protection,  FEMA would then charge rates based on that risk level instead of the  lack of 100-year flood protection of the existing levee system, which,  essentially, means zero availability for flood insurance.   From the north State to the Sacramento Valley and beyond, this  legislation is good for agriculture production in California. I urge  its passage.                            ____________________
