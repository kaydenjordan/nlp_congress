 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 1499, I call up the bill (H.R. 8876) to reauthorize the  Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 8876.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me commend and thank Chairman Neal and  Ranking Member Brady for their cordiality and the outstanding way in  which they have managed the affairs of the Committee on Ways and Means.  That is one of the reasons that we are here today, for such an  outstanding bipartisan bill, to talk about the welfare of children and  families.   For struggling families, home visiting is a life-changing experience.  Research demonstrates that home visiting works. I have seen these  successes in my home city of Chicago, parents and home visitors  partnering to tackle big challenges and making children healthier and  safer.                                time  0915    My friend Jackie Walorski saw home visiting work in her district,  too. Jackie was deeply committed to helping vulnerable children and  families, and she was my partner in our committee's effort to preserve  and strengthen home visiting. I really wish she was here today as we  continue with the work that we did together.   I also thank our colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee-- Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, Health Committee  Chair Eshoo, and Health Subcommittee Ranking Member Guthrie--for their  leadership on this bill.  [[Page H8716]]    The Jackie Walorski Maternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization  Act would reauthorize the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home  Visiting program for 5 years.   Over that 5 years, the bill would double our Federal investment in  evidence-based home visiting, bringing home visiting to more families  and communities.   This bill would more than double our investment in Tribal  communities, where so many residents need home visiting but have been  left out due to a lack of funding.   It would invest in the critical home visiting workforce because it is  the support and relationships that home visitors build with mothers,  fathers, and children that make home visiting work.   And it would ensure that States and territories have reliable,  predictable funding and rules so that they can focus on helping more  families thrive.   The Ways and Means Committee passed this important, bipartisan  legislation on a unanimous vote of 41-0. I urge all my colleagues to  join us in supporting the bill today, as we work to enact it into law  in the coming weeks. I also thank my colleagues at the Ways and Means  and Energy and Commerce Committees for their input and support on the  introduced bill.   The bill also has the overwhelming support of home visiting  stakeholders, including the Home Visiting Coalition, which endorsed the  bill and wrote that it addressed every request the coalition made in a  ``thoughtful and productive manner.''   We have an opportunity to make a real difference for children and  families across America, and so I urge all of my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' and then work with us to enact the bill this year.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  outstanding gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), a fierce defender of poor and  disadvantaged people.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), an outstanding gentlewoman that  many of us call the pride of the South.    DAVIS of Illinois.

Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Let me, first of all, thank Dr. Wenstrup for his leadership. And I  also thank all of those who have spoken to the virtues of the bill as  well as the virtues of Jackie Walorski.   I was able to attend her homegoing services, and I can assure you if  you were in Mishawaka or South Bend, Indiana, you would hear the same  words that have been spoken here today. She was indeed an amazing  woman.   Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would mention another amazing woman  who has been legendary and become legendary in this institution, and  that is our dearly beloved Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who has led this body  for a number of years. And I think that this can indeed be one of its  proudest moments.   Mr. Speaker, I close by quoting Erika Beck, who receives home  visiting services in Chicago. At one of the hearings Jackie and I held,  Ms. Beck said, ``I know that our lives are changed forever and for the  better because of Myia, our home visitor. She is helping me and Louis,  my husband, help our kids succeed, and she is educating all of us.''   Such is the feeling of those who receive these valuable services.   Mr. Speaker, I also take this opportunity to thank all of the  organizations and individuals who have joined our fight to continue and  expand home visiting.   I thank the bipartisan Committee on Ways and Means staff: Staff  director Morna Miller, Taylor Downs, Cheryl Vincent, and Andrew  Gradison.   I also thank the tremendous nonpartisan staff that my staff and I  relied on so much throughout this process. Patrick Landers and Karen  Lynch at the Congressional Research Service; James Grossman at the  Office of Legislative Counsel, and Carolyn Ugolino at the Congressional  Budget Office.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank my legislative staff director, deputy chief  of staff, Dr. Jill Hunter-Williams, who put in so much time, energy,  and effort on this bill. I also thank all of us who worked with her.   I have had some proud moments in this body, but I can tell you that  there is no prouder moment that I have had than to be a force and to  suggest when we vote for this bill, for this home visiting opportunity  for thousands and thousands of children and mothers and families to  experience the help that they need to become everything that America  has the potential of helping them to be.   Again, Mr. Speaker, it is an excellent piece of legislation. I urge  its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.
