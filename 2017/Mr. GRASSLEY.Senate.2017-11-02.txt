 Mr. President, we are about to vote on our fourth  circuit court nominee this week, and I am glad to speak in support of  the nomination of Professor Bibas to serve on the Third Circuit Court  of Appeals. That court sits in Philadelphia. Professor Bibas is a  highly qualified nominee. His background as a well-regarded legal  scholar and Supreme Court advocate will serve him well as a judge on  that circuit.   Additionally, Professor Bibas received a rare, unanimously ``well  qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. My Democratic  colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have expressed to me that the  ABA's ratings are very important to their evaluation of nominees. Yet  all of the Democratic members of the committee voted against Professor  Bibas in the committee, despite his having received the highest rating  possible. This is consistent with their votes against Professor Amy  Barrett, Justice Joan Larsen and Justice Allison Eid, all of whom  received ``well qualified'' ratings. It appears that my Democratic  colleagues don't actually treat the ABA's ratings as particularly  important when it comes right down to practice.   Professor Bibas is the son of a Greek immigrant who came to this  country after surviving the Nazi occupation of Greece. He boasts  impressive academic credentials. He graduated from Columbia University  at the age of 19. He then received degrees from the University of  Oxford and Yale Law School. After law school, Professor Bibas clerked  for Judge Patrick Higginbotham of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Fifth Circuit and then for Justice Anthony Kennedy of the U.S. Supreme  Court.   Following these prestigious clerkships, Professor Bibas became an  assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York. His  experience as a prosecutor gave him a firsthand view of the problems  and injustices in the American criminal justice system. He decided to  pursue a career as an academic, focusing then on improving the criminal  justice system for all involved.    Professor Bibas's first stint as a professor was in my home State of  Iowa at the University of Iowa College of Law. He taught criminal law  and procedure there for 5 years. We were certainly lucky to have a  professor of his caliber. Professor Bibas then took a position on the  faculty of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he has been  teaching since.  [[Page S6988]]    Professor Bibas has been prolific in his academic writings,  publishing numerous articles on all aspects of criminal law. His  academic work culminated in the publication of his book entitled ``The  Machinery of Criminal Justice.'' That book was published in 2012. In  this book and in many of his articles, Professor Bibas criticized the  current model of bureaucratic ``assembly line'' justice and America's  high incarceration rate. Much of his work is devoted to finding  solutions to these problems. His academic work has certainly had an  impact on the law. In fact, Professor Bibas is one of the most cited  law professors in judicial opinions. One study shows that he is the  15th most cited legal scholar by total judicial opinions, and he is the  fifth most cited in the area of criminal law--not bad for a relatively  young professor.   Professor Bibas has also had a positive impact on colleagues and  students. The Judiciary Committee received a letter from 121 law  professors throughout our country representing a diverse range of  viewpoints. These professors support Professor Bibas's nomination,  pointing to his--and this quote comes from the letter--``influential  contributions to criminal law and procedure scholarship,'' as well as  his ``fair-mindedness, conscientiousness, and personal integrity.''   Professor Bibas also received a letter in support of his nomination  from many colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania. They stated  that he has been ``an outstanding scholar, teacher, and colleague'' at  Penn.   Professor Bibas also has extensive litigation experience. He is  currently the director of the University of Pennsylvania Law School's  Supreme Court Clinic. In this role, he and his students have  represented numerous litigants who could not otherwise afford top- flight counsel. He has argued numerous cases before the Supreme Court,  and he obtained a significant victory in the landmark case of Padilla  v. Kentucky, which established a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to  accurate information about deportation before pleading guilty.   One of our Supreme Court Justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a personal  letter to Professor Bibas that the Judiciary Committee received, called  him one of the ``very best lawyers presenting cases to the Court.'' It  is kind of nice, if you are considered kind of a strict  constructionist, that you get a letter like that from one of the more  activist members of the Supreme Court.   Some of my Democratic colleagues criticize Professor Bibas during his  confirmation hearing for two really isolated events in the long and  illustrious career he has had.   First, Democrats criticized Professor Bibas for prosecuting a minor  theft of only $7 when he was an assistant U.S. attorney. This case took  place nearly 20 years ago. But it was Professor Bibas's supervisor who  made the decision to charge the defendant and, of course, required an  underling by the name of Bibas to pursue the case even after it started  to fall apart.   In his hearing, Professor Bibas readily acknowledged that the  defendant should not have been prosecuted, and the professor stated  this to our committee:         I learned from that mistake, and as a scholar, I have       dedicated my career to trying to diagnose and prevent the       causes of such errors in the future--inadequate Brady       disclosure, new prosecutor syndrome, tunnel vision, jumping       to conclusions, partisan mindsets. And I have testified       before this committee on those very issues. And so I made a       mistake. I apologized. I learned from it, and I have tried to       improve the justice system going forward.''    Some of my colleagues have also criticized Professor Bibas for a  single article that he wrote but never published. This article endorsed  limited forms of corporal punishment as an alternative to lengthy  prison sentences. But Professor Bibas reconsidered this idea soon after  completing the article. He concluded that it was a bad idea and did not  publish it. He completely disavowed the position in his book published  shortly thereafter.   When asked about corporal punishment at his hearing, Professor Bibas  stated:         It is wrong. It is not American. It is not something I       advocate. I categorically reject it.    Additionally, Professor Bibas's position on corporal punishment was  well-intended. He was motivated to address overly harsh and  unproductively long prison sentences. As he said at his hearing, he  wanted to offer an answer to the question, ``Is there some way, any  way, we can avoid the hugely destructive effect [of imprisonment] both  on prisoners' own lives and on the families, the friends, the  communities?''   In the time since Professor Bibas wrote the article, he has offered  more creative solutions to the disruptions caused by lengthy prison  sentences. As an example, instead of suffering through forced  indolence, prisoners could work and develop work-related skills in  anticipation of their release from prison.   Professor Bibas's scholarship, as I have stated and quoted from, is a  testimony to his devotion to the rule of law and the notion of equal  justice before the law. It is very clear that he cares very deeply  about how the criminal justice system impacts defendants, victims,  families, and entire communities. As you can tell, I am very confident  that Professor Bibas will make an excellent judge on the Third Circuit  Court of Appeals.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.    Mr. President, today Senators Klobuchar, Tillis,  Schumer, Durbin and I will introduce legislation to help America's  families locate missing loved ones who have Alzheimer's disease, autism  or related conditions that may cause them to wander. Congressman Chris  Smith will introduce a virtually identical companion bill in the House  of Representatives today as well.   Our bill, which was introduced for the first time in the 114th  Congress, extends an existing program that helps locate individuals  with Alzheimer's disease or dementia. It also adds new support for  people with autism.   We have named the legislation in honor of two boys with autism who  perished because their condition caused them to wander. One of these  children, nine-year-old Kevin Curtis Wills, slipped into Iowa's Raccoon  River near a park and tragically drowned in 2008. The other, 14-year- old Avonte Oquendo, wandered away from his school and drowned in New  York City's East River a few years ago.   Theirs are not isolated cases. Just a few months ago, a four year-old  with autism drowned in a pool after wandering away from her caretakers.  We've all read or heard the heartbreaking stories of families  frantically trying to locate a missing loved one whose condition caused  him or her to wander off.   Our bill will give communities the tools they need to help locate  people with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia as well as  children with autism spectrum disorders who wander away from their  families or caregivers and into dangerous situations.   My home State of Iowa has the fifth highest Alzheimer's death rate in  America and we have about 63,000 Iowans living with the disease,  according to the Alzheimer's Association. Additionally, the CDC  identified 1 in 68 children across the country as having autism  spectrum disorders. In Iowa alone, about 8,000 individuals have been  diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.   This bill will make resources available to equip first responders,  law enforcement officials, and other community leaders with the  training and tools necessary to better prevent and respond to these  cases as soon as possible. With better information sharing, communities  can play a central role in reuniting autistic children and other  individuals who wander with their families.   Finally, the bill will ensure that local law enforcement agencies and  nonprofits that educate and train people on how to proactively prevent  and locate missing individuals who wander are eligible for grants from  the U.S. Department of Justice. These grants will facilitate the  development of training and emergency protocols for  [[Page S7003]]  school personnel, supply first responders with additional information  and resources, and make local tracking technology programs available  for individuals who may wander from safety because of their condition.  Grant funding may also be used to establish or enhance notification and  communications systems for the recovery of missing children with  autism.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, which in  the 114th Congress passed the Senate unanimously. The House companion  bill garnered over 90 cosponsors and passed the other chamber by vote  of 346 to 66 in the 114th Congress. Our bill has been endorsed by,  among others, the Autism Society of Iowa, Autism Speaks, the National  Autism Association, SafeMinds, the National Center for Missing and  Exploited Children, ANCOR (American Network of Community Options),  National Autism Society of America, the Alzheimer's Impact Movement,  the National Down Syndrome Society, and the Color of Autism Foundation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today Senators Klobuchar, Tillis,  Schumer, Durbin and I will introduce legislation to help America's  families locate missing loved ones who have Alzheimer's disease, autism  or related conditions that may cause them to wander.
