 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week, a week we set aside  to honor the brave men and women who tirelessly work to protect us and  keep our communities safe.   Unfortunately, their jobs are becoming more and more difficult, more  and more stressful, and as a result, they need our support now more  than ever.   Over the last 2 years, violent crime in this Nation has soared.  Nationally, we saw a 30 percent increase in murders from 2019 to 2020,  which is the largest increase during a single year in our Nation's  history.   That troubling trend continues in 2021 with FBI data indicating that  homicides rose another 5 percent in the Nation's 22 largest cities over  the already inflated levels of 2020.   Overall, in those 22 cities, homicides are up 44 percent since 2019.  Think of that--44 percent. Not surprisingly, these disturbing increases  have accompanied calls in many cities, including in my hometown of  Cincinnati, to defund the police. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, that is  the last thing that we should be doing during a violent crime surge.   That is why the legislation that we are considering today is a  welcome bipartisan step in the right direction.   Law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency medical personnel,  and corrections officers are frequently called to respond to dangerous  and often traumatic situations. As a result, these officers are at a  greater risk of developing stress and trauma-related disorders.   Studies show that public safety officers are 25 times more likely to  develop PTSD compared to the general public. Tragically, more public  safety officers die by suicide every year than those who lose their  lives in the line of duty.   Yet, trauma-related disorders are not covered by the primary Federal  disability benefits program for police officers, and that is the Public  Safety Officers' Benefits Program, or PSOB, which is run by the  Department of Justice.   The PSOB program currently provides death and education benefits to  the family members of public safety officers who die in the line of  duty and also offers disability benefits to public safety officers who  become totally and permanently disabled.   However, the PSOB program does not currently offer death benefits to  public safety officers who tragically take their lives as a result of  PTSD, acute stress disorder, or other stress and trauma-related  disorders.   This bill, H.R. 6943, the Public Safety Officer Support Act,  addresses this oversight. This bipartisan legislation recognizes just  how stressful and difficult being a police officer is nowadays. It  makes sure that those officers who have experienced traumatic events on  the job, and are struggling as a result, receive the support they need  and deserve.   The men and women in law enforcement need to know that they have our  full support and that they will not be punished or stigmatized for  human emotions.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  commonsense, compassionate proposal, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5123]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H5125]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1125, which clearly  and vigorously condemns anti-Semitism. During Jewish American Heritage  Month, it is critical to, once again, call attention to this vile form  of bigotry.   Persecution against any person, or any group on the basis of religion  is absolutely wrong. It is a fundamental value upon which this Nation  was founded, which is why the free exercise of religion is protected in  the very first amendment to our Constitution.   The historic and pervasive nature that makes anti-Semitism a truly  unique problem has, unfortunately, proven to make it difficult to  overcome. In the aftermath of the Holocaust, the world realized just  how pernicious anti-Semitism was and has been for centuries, and  rightly sought to eliminate it.   Unfortunately, despite this recognition, Jewish Americans have  experienced a rise in anti-Semitism. From their places of worship to  their neighborhoods, Jewish Americans experience anti-Semitism all too  often. And the incidents range from mere slurs all the way to outright  violence.   Regrettably, Jewish Americans have even been attacked in major cities  such as Pittsburgh, New York, and Los Angeles just to name some.   At the same time, our Nation's collective memories of the Holocaust,  unfortunately, continues to fade. That is why it is critically  important to condemn anti-Semitism in no uncertain terms, without  drawing false equivalencies or diminishing anti-Semitism just as  another form of bigotry.   I am concerned about the references to government intervention in the  online speech, and I do wish my Democratic colleagues had been willing  to work with us to ensure that that particular portion actually  represented the sentiment of the entire House on those issues. We  cannot allow our shared desire to combat anti-Semitism to lead to  censorship and control, which may only exacerbate the problem.   Our Jewish friends deserve our respect and admiration and  appreciation. That is why, for my time in Congress I have always tried  and always sought to support Jewish Americans, as well as Israel. So  while I am not happy with every aspect of this resolution, I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and would be  willing to close at this time unless the gentleman has additional  speakers.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill  on both sides of aisle, and I yield back the balance of my time.
