 Madam Speaker, as gas prices across the country continue  to soar, and with President Biden's announcement to ban Russian oil  imports, it is time that America looked to our own backyard to meet our  energy needs.   To ease the burden on hardworking Americans, we must increase  domestic production to make America energy independent again.   We can no longer allow Russia, Venezuela, or oil from the Middle East  to meet our energy needs. The Biden administration must commit to an  America first strategy in oil production.   America must increase production so that we are not only energy  independent but so that we can once again become a net exporter of oil  and natural gas.   We must drill America, refine America, and we must buy American oil.  That is why I joined many of my Republican colleagues in a letter to  President Biden requesting the administration open Federal lands to  energy production, end unnecessary and burdensome bureaucratic  regulations, and approve and expedite construction of the Keystone XL  pipeline.   President Biden must commit to these actions immediately to ease the  burden on Americans at the pump.                            ____________________
