 Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday,  September 27, was National Chocolate Milk Day.   Chocolate milk is adored by millions of Americans nationwide and is a  favorite among children. Seventy percent of the milk children consume  is flavored, with chocolate being the most popular flavor. Chocolate  milk is low in fat, high in nutrients, and packed with flavor.   Milk consumption, Mr. Speaker, has been declining, however, and when  the National School Lunch Program removed the most popular and  nutritious option from schools to only serve fat-free milk, the numbers  continued to drop. As a result of these detrimental policies, we have  lost nearly a generation of milk drinkers, and those milk drinkers have  lost access to the best nutrition.   This detrimental policy was partially reversed when the USDA made a  decision to once again allow 1 percent flavored milk back into school  lunches, and I am grateful to Secretary Sonny Perdue for his leadership  on the issue.   To build on this momentum, I introduced the Whole Milk for Healthy  Kids Act last year to once again allow whole milk, both flavored and  unflavored, to be offered within the program because children can  greatly benefit from the essential nutrients whole milk provides.   Taking that one step further, I joined my colleague Fred Keller to  introduce the GIVE MILK Act last month. The GIVE MILK Act, Mr. Speaker,  gives families who use the WIC program, or Women, Infants, and Children  program, more control over the nutrition of their children by making 2  percent and whole milk available through the WIC program to any child  over the age of 2.                                time  0930    Currently, WIC participants are limited to low-fat or nonfat milk,  meaning they are missing all the nutrition that comes from that milk  fat.   This legislation will give families who depend on WIC more options  when considering nutritional options for their children. It will also  help increase milk consumption, which is a win for our dairy farmers.   I talked about this legislation, among other things, when I had the  pleasure of joining the folks at the National Milk Producers Federation  last week on their new podcast, ``Dairy Defined''. We covered a lot of  ground, including the importance that milk plays in our diets and how  coronavirus has impacted the dairy industry.   Safety net programs like the Dairy Margin Coverage program, coupled  with the coronavirus relief efforts, have helped ease the burden  somewhat on our producers, but times remain tough. We must continue to  spread the word about these critical safety net programs so our  Nation's dairy producers, those farm families, can take full advantage  of all the tools at their disposal.   If there has been one positive thing that has come out of this  pandemic, it is that we have seen more families returning to the dining  room table, Mr. Speaker. Milk consumption has seen an uptick in the  past few months and more and more Americans are benefiting from the  essential nutrients that whole milk provides.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by thanking the hardworking men  and women who have the 24/7, 365-day-a-year job of running our dairy  farms. Thank you for working tirelessly to ensure that we have access  to delicious, nutritious, and top-quality milk.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank  and celebrate someone who has been a dedicated member of my team for  many years now. Barb Ives, a field representative and office manager,  recently surpassed a 20-year milestone representing our district.   Barb has selflessly served the district since September of 2000,  initially with  [[Page H5098]]  my predecessor Congressman John Peterson. We were truly blessed to  welcome her to the Thompson Team.   Barb is an active member in her community and never stops working  hard for our constituents, helping individuals get much-needed  assistance on issues related to the VA, Social Security, Medicare, and  so much more. She is the kind of person who is willing to step up, take  charge, and get the job done.   In the little spare time she has when she is not helping others, Barb  is an avid golfer and a wonderful singer. I can't thank Barb enough for  her hard work and dedication and sense of humor over the years.                            ____________________
