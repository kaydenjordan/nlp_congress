 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, ironically, this bill doesn't even serve the interests  of immigrants from around the world except for two countries, China and  India.   By removing the per-country caps on employment-based visas, the  practical effect of this bill is that, for the foreseeable future, the  citizens of only two countries, China and India, will be admitted to  work here. Workers from every other country will have to wait many  years until that backlog clears.   Supporters contend that no one currently awaiting a green card will  be adversely affected. That may be true as far as it goes. But what  they leave out is that this bill will produce long delays for future  applicants from every country except for China and India.   Even the liberal American Immigration Lawyers Association points out  that ``many applicants will now face longer wait times.''   Now, supporters are fond of comparing the populations of various  countries as an argument that uniform percentage caps are unfair. But  what they forget is that when a country's allotment isn't reached, its  vacant slots then spill over to higher-demand countries. India, for  example, accounted for 35 percent of the green cards issued last year,  five times their percentage cap. But that, apparently, isn't enough for  the left.   The bill also threatens our national security. China has been  stealing U.S. technology for years through programs like the H-1B visa.   According to The Washington Post, one such initiative resulted in  ``the arrests of six Chinese researchers accused of lying on their visa  applications about their ties to the People's Liberation Army'' and  ``more than 1,000 researchers who had hidden their affiliation with the  Chinese military'' fleeing the U.S. within months.   The supporters assure us that anyone with direct ties to the Chinese  Communist Party is not eligible, but that completely ignores the fact  that the CCP exerts coercive control over all Chinese nationals,  whether or not they are CCP members, so this assurance is meaningless.   As currently drafted, this bill would also result in the immediate  exclusion from green cards special immigrant religious workers from  around the world for the next few years. Those cards will, instead, go  to special immigrant juvenile green cards for unaccompanied alien  children from the Northern Triangle countries.   It is precisely this provision that has been exploited by the crime  cartels in trafficking unaccompanied minors into this country, and this  bill makes it worse.  [[Page H9713]]    But the most pernicious provision allows certain temporary visa  holders to file an application for adjustment for status despite the  fact that no green card is available to them. That is the reason you  have the long delays that the gentlewoman mentioned.   The result is that many temporary visas will essentially become  permanent because the alien visa holders will be able to live and work  in the U.S. as if they had a green card.   That raises an important question: What is it that the Democrats have  against American workers?   This bill is a direct attack on their job opportunities and  livelihoods. So much for the advice to unemployed fossil fuel workers:  Well, just learn to code.   All this becomes a theater of the absurd in light of the mass illegal  migration that the Democrats have aided, abetted, and encouraged since  they reversed the Trump border measures that had finally secured our  borders.   It was no coincidence that as the flood of illegal migration slowed  to a trickle, working-class families saw their biggest wage gains in  decades, and the income gap between rich and poor began to narrow.   Now that the borders have been collapsed by the Democrats, those wage  gains have been wiped out as millions of illegal aliens are  deliberately allowed into the country to compete with those struggling  American families. The Democrats remain silent on this continuing  crisis.   The American people had trusted the Democrats to look out for their  interests, and they are now discovering how tragically misplaced that  trust has been. That is the crux of this bill, a big fat middle finger  to America's working families, and I am afraid that won't change until  the people responsible for these policies are turned out of office.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close. I think it is important to note why we have those per-country  caps. Ours is a Nation of immigrants. Except for those descended from  Native Americans, every one of us is an immigrant or the descendant of  an immigrant.   The American people are drawn from every country on this Earth; and  from these disparate and diverse populations, we have created one great  Nation, the American Nation. Here there is only one race, the American  race.   This remarkable achievement is made possible by a single word-- assimilation. Our immigration laws were written specifically to  accommodate that process. They were written to assure that as  immigrants come to our country they bring with them a sincere desire to  become Americans, to raise their children as Americans, to acquire a  common language, a common culture, and a common appreciation of  American principles. That is the only possible way to blend so many  discordant, disparate, and diverse populations into a common people  devoted to the same principles that have produced the happiest, most  just, most prosperous, most free, most advanced, and most envied  civilization in the history of mankind.    But assimilation is hard. As Winston Churchill said from that very  rostrum: ``We have not journeyed all this way across the centuries,  across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies because we  are made of sugar candy.''   Becoming an American requires learning a new language, accepting and  adopting new customs, adapting to a new culture, and accepting new  beliefs. Assimilation breaks down if the concentration of immigrants  from any single country reaches a level where assimilation is no longer  necessary for that population. Instead of e pluribus unum, from many  nations one great nation, from many people one great people, we instead  see e unum pluribus: from one nation, many isolated, insular, and  segregated communities that become foreign enclaves rather than an  integral part of our national identity.   We have all heard the heartbreaking tales of American workers not  only being displaced by foreign workers but being forced to train their  replacements as a condition of severance pay. This bill assures a  never-ending supply of foreign labor for American corporations.   Under this bill, any alien on an employment-based green card waiting  list for more than 2 years could apply for adjustment of that status.  Once an alien has filed an adjustment of status application, he or she  is eligible for a work permit. However, unlike an employment-based  green card, which generally requires a showing that the wages and  conditions of Americans are not adversely affected, this work permit is  considered an open-market employment authorization document, meaning  the alien can take any job at any wage, and there are no protections  for American workers.   So this bill essentially converts temporary visa holders to permanent  status at the expense of American tech workers. This rewards the very  same companies who for years have fired their American workers only to  replace them with cheaper foreign labor.   American workers, particularly Black and Hispanic Americans, are  going to be particularly hard hit. Pew Research estimates that each  group only accounts for about 9 percent of the STEM workforce, and this  measure assures that competition for those positions will become much  greater and the wages much lower.   The per-country caps exist to assure that the population of no single  nation can come to dominate the overall immigrant population coming to  these shores. Thus, under current law immigrants from one nation cannot  claim more than 7 percent of the visas, but under this bill, the  employment-based limit is eliminated.   If this is allowed to happen, assimilation breaks down and the entire  foundation of a nation of immigrants is shattered. As I said earlier,  the practical effect of this bill is that the population of only two  countries, China and India, will almost exclusively dominate the  receipt of employment-based green cards for the foreseeable future at  the expense of the people of virtually every other country in the  world. Instead of an equitable distribution of green cards across all  countries, they will in effect be limited to two.   In one employment-based green card category, EB-5, all the green  cards will go to Chinese nationals for several years. In another  category, EB-4, religious workers will be precluded from getting green  cards. Instead, these will go to the alien juveniles from Northern  Triangle countries who crossed our border illegally. This imbalance  would undermine the fundamental mechanism of assimilation, and I fear  that is the point.   Assimilation has become a dirty word to the left. They seek not  unity, not one united people but, rather, a people divided into  warring, racial, and ethnic factions, divided by language, culture,  ethnicity, and ultimately grievances. No nation can survive very long  tearing itself apart this way.   The collapse of our southern border and refusal of the Democrats to  defend the sovereignty of our Nation from the unprecedented illegal  mass migration that they have unleashed will spell the end of this  Nation if it is allowed to continue much longer. This bill is a small  part of that policy, and it is destructive in its effect if not its  intent.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
