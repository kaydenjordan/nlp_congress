 Mr. Speaker, the murderous Putin's war  on Ukraine is recognized worldwide as criminal.   I am grateful that America and our NATO allies have unified to  support Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian  people. I have faith in the Russian people, who I have met on numerous  visits across Russia, that they will reject Putin's war atrocities.   Russia is a nation of world-significant art, music, architecture,  literature, and can change. And that is why I am introducing a bill to  encourage Russian military defectors, true Russian patriots, with  immediate refugee status in America with up to $100,000 for Russian  military equipment transferred to Ukraine. Putin betrays the troops to  death for his purpose of oil, money, power.   Additionally, I will introduce a bill for a bust of President  Volodymyr Zelensky to be placed in the U.S. Capitol, as is the bust of  Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Churchill was the wartime leader of  World War II, and Volodymyr Zelensky is the wartime leader in Putin's  war.    On Saturday, I was very grateful to be part of the Zoom address by  President Zelensky to the U.S. Congress. And today, he is addressing  the British Parliament.   In December, I visited Kyiv, and I was so inspired by the people of  Ukraine. It is a modern, free-market democracy with extraordinary  success for its citizens of eight-lane boulevards with modern SUVs.  [[Page H1344]]    Today, Putin's war is conducting mass murder, defaming the people of  Russia as innocent women and children are being murdered.   God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long live Volodymyr Zelensky.                            ____________________
