 Mr. Speaker, as Halloween approaches, it is  vital that we inform parents of the dangers of fentanyl, which is now  the number one killer of young people in America.   Fentanyl is an extremely lethal opioid that drug cartels are  trafficking across our southern border. We must warn parents that  cartels are trafficking and selling rainbow fentanyl, which are  colorful pills designed to appeal to children. These pills are deadly,  and parents should carefully check their child's Halloween candy.   It is tragic that President Biden and his border czar, Vice President  Harris, have allowed the border crisis to become so dangerous and pose  such a serious threat to our children.   Right now, the immediate danger is fentanyl, and parents must be  vigilant.                            ____________________
