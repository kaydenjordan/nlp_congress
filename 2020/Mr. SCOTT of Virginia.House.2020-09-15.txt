 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Strength  in Diversity Act.   It has been 66 years since the Supreme Court unanimously struck down  public school segregation in the landmark case of Brown v. Board of  Education. In that case, the Court declared that public education where  the State has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made  available to all on equal terms.   The Court went on to say that, ``in the field of public education,  the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational  facilities are inherently unequal.''   More than six decades later, we have failed to fulfill that promise.  According to the Government Accountability Office, our public schools  are more segregated today by race and class than at any time since the  1960s, and segregation is actually getting worse according to the  Government Accountability Office.                                time  1330    School segregation has profound consequences for students. Today,  low-income students of color are more likely to attend schools with  fewer experienced teachers and resources. In fact, schools serving  predominantly students of color face a $23 billion funding gap compared  to schools serving predominantly White students.   Now, we know that integration works. Black students who attend  integrated schools have higher test scores and are more likely to  graduate from high school, complete college, and even earn higher wages  throughout their lives.   Communities across the country have recognized the importance of  school diversity for student success and have developed integrative  strategies to promote diversity in education.   In 2016, dozens of school districts applied for funding under the  Opening Doors, Expanding Opportunities grant program, which was  designed to help schools to pursue voluntary, community-driven school  integration strategies. Regrettably, one of Secretary Betsy DeVos'  first actions in office was to terminate that program before any money  was disbursed.   The Strength in Diversity Act corrects this action by providing  Federal support to help school districts develop, implement, or expand  efforts to integrate their local schools.   The legislation will also shield these resources from the whims of  changing administrations and allow communities to compile best  practices for tackling segregation.   This expertise is critical because of a series of Supreme Court  rulings that have been hostile to integration. Most recently, in the  Parents Involved case, the Court struck down two voluntary integration  plans, one in Louisville, Kentucky, and the other in Seattle,  Washington. The Court held that using race in desegregation plans is  constitutional, but only if the plan is narrowly tailored to address  the compelling interest of integrating the public schools.  Unfortunately, they ruled in those cases that the plans were not  narrowly tailored.   The Strength in Diversity Act will provide resources so that the  localities will be able to design plans that will be not only  effective, but also be able to withstand constitutional challenge.   Addressing America's legacy of racial discrimination is often  uncomfortable and complicated. However, we must confront, not ignore,  inequities in education if we are to reckon with this legacy and  overcome a global pandemic that threatens to worsen the achievement  gaps.   Our former colleague, Congressman John Lewis, once stated: ``When you  see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have to speak  up. You have to say something. You have to do something.''   Let's follow his guidance and vote for the first time in more than  three decades to provide new resources that will help integrate our  public schools and fulfill the promise of equity in education.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the Strength in  Diversity Act. I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Fudge) for her  distinguished leadership in this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.   While I appreciate that the gentleman from Georgia acknowledges the  importance of providing resources to support school diversity,  encouraging the use of IV-A funds for this purpose is not a reasonable  solution.   Schools already rely on a very limited amount of IV-A funding for a  wide range of activities and programs, including mental health  resources, educational technology, STEM education, extracurricular  activities, and other critical needs.   This amendment would effectively force schools to choose between  addressing school segregation and providing mental health services.  Developing, implementing, and expanding school diversity initiatives is  costly and should not come at the expense of important programs already  being supported by title IV. We will not improve services for students,  parents, and communities by cutting the same size pie into even smaller  slices.   The purpose of the Strength in Diversity Act is to provide direct and  additional investments in education that helps communities integrate  their schools without undermining existing school programs and  services.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.
