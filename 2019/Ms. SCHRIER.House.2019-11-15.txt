 Madam Speaker, today is National Recycling Day.   As a Nation and world, we are accumulating single-use plastics at an  alarming rate. By 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the  world's oceans.   This is why recycling is critical, and we need more education for all  of us about how best to recycle.   We also need help from industry to either avoid plastic altogether or  package their goods with the most desirable and recyclable types of  plastic.   As consumers, though, our standard should be ``Made from 100 percent  recycled materials'' and not ``Made from recyclable materials.'' There  is a vast difference.   We all know the three Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle. But we can't just  recycle. That is the third choice. Our top  [[Page H8907]]  priorities should be reducing and reusing.   So what can we do? We can start by making good personal choices, and  here is an easy one: Don't use plastic utensils.   More than 100 million plastic utensils are used and thrown away into  landfills every day across the country. They can't be recycled.   We can think twice about whether we really need our water to come in  plastic bottles. There are far better choices.   And for Democrats, the party that commits to careful environmental  stewardship, we absolutely, positively must lead by example.   Madam Speaker, in the coming months I will be reaching out to my  colleagues to take action on this issue.   Happy recycling day.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
