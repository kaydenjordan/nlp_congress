 Thank you, Mr. President, for the recognition this  evening.   Mr. President, I rise to support the Consumer Financial Protection  Board's arbitration rule that has been spoken about this evening very  eloquently by my colleagues here on the Democratic side.   The new rule protects consumers from predatory financial practices.  These consumers are our everyday constituents. They are servicemembers  and veterans, moms and dads, the elderly, students, and working people.  It protects these folks by limiting binding arbitration clauses.   Now, what is a binding arbitration clause? These clauses take away  consumers' rights to seek relief in court when they are wronged. This  rule puts money in the pockets of consumers who have been taken  advantage of.   The Consumer Financial Protection Board estimates that the rule will  mean $342 million per year in compensation to consumers. Repealing the  rule would take that money, which should go to consumers, and give it  to some of the wealthiest corporations in this Nation.   When millions of consumers are scammed, what is the most logical  remedy? When millions of consumers are scammed, what is the logical  remedy--millions of separate cases before arbiters selected by the  corporation or a class action case before an impartial judge and jury?   The right to go to court before a jury of your peers is enshrined in  the Constitution. The Seventh Amendment states:         In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy       shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall       be pre-      served. . . .    Now, let's talk about the Seventh Amendment and what one of our  Founders said. James Madison wrote:         Trial by jury in civil cases is as essential to secure the       liberty of the people as any one of the pre-existent rights       of nature.    This rule guarantees access to our impartial courts. It is always  good to have the spirit of the Constitution and the Founders on your  side.   I stand with the supporters of this rule. Who are they? There are  many. For example, there is the American Legion. Just today, its  legislative director wrote in no uncertain terms:         A vote to overturn the CFPB arbitration rule is a vote       against the military and veterans.    The Military Coalition, representing 5.5 million servicemembers, also  supports this rule. In July, they wrote: ``Forced arbitration is an un- American system wherein servicemembers' claims against a corporation  are funneled into a rigged, secretive system in which all the rules,  including the choice of the arbitrator, are picked by the  corporation.''  [[Page S6750]]    These are incredibly strong statements of opposition from military  and veterans groups. Also in July, over 300 consumer, civil rights,  labor, and small business groups wrote: ``The rule . . . is a  significant step forward in the ongoing fight to curb predatory  practices in consumer financial products and services and to make these  markets fairer and safer.''   Signers of this letter include the AFL-CIO, the American Federation  of Teachers, Consumers Union, the NAACP, LULAC, and dozens of other  organizations.   Conservatives also support this rule. One of the early tea party  activists, Mr. Judson Phillips, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Times.  He said: ``This time, the CFPB is right and the Republicans should  stand on the side of American citizens and protect the Constitution and  the Seventh Amendment.''   Where are our Republican friends? They are not here on the floor  talking about this rule.   Finally, the American people broadly support this rule. A recent poll  showed 67 percent supported the rule; only 13 percent opposed it. So  who opposes this rule and who is behind this resolution to repeal it?  Corporations that want to avoid penalties in court when they abuse  their customers and big financial industry trade associations and  lobbyists.   It would allow credit card, student loan, and payday lending firms-- which would see big benefits if this resolution passes--to keep forcing  consumers to sign contracts that take away their right to go to court.   Wells Fargo, one of the largest banks in America, spent years  creating millions of fake accounts, just to bill their own customers  more fees. They eventually admitted a complete and total fraud of epic  proportions. Equifax, one of the largest credit bureaus in America,  allowed over half of all American consumers' personal information to be  hacked. These companies should not be able to use binding arbitration  to avoid the legal consequences of their actions. Today's debate is a  perfect example of how policymaking in Washington is broken.   A Federal agency did what is required. It undertook an exhaustive  study and created a rule to protect consumers from abusive contracts.  Now the affected industry is spending millions on lobbying and public  relations to repeal the consumer protection rule--to protect their  bottom line at all costs.   This vote will decide the fate of $342 million per year. Should it go  to consumers who were wronged? Of course, it should. Or should it stay  with the corporations that committed those wrongs? Of course, it should  not.   Congress is not popular these days. Americans overwhelmingly believe  special interests and lobbyists have too much power compared to the  regular people. Today, we can take a step to repair our reputation. We  should side with our constituents on this important vote and reject  this resolution. I urge a ``no'' vote.   I yield back.
