 Mr. Speaker, for 7 years, I have heard story after story  from people in my district about how the Affordable Care Act is  anything but affordable.   Families and small businesses are paying more for less, and insurers  are dropping out of the marketplaces, leaving behind fewer options.  Government-run health care isn't working, and we are repealing and  replacing ObamaCare like we promised our constituents we would do.   The American Health Care Act is the first step of a three-step  process to repair our broken healthcare system. This bill moves power  away from Washington and puts doctors and patients at the center of  their healthcare decisions. It reforms and strengthens Medicaid and  gives States the flexibility to innovate and best meet the needs of  their citizens.   This patient-centered approach will bring costs down, increase choice  and competition, and provide important protections for patients with  preexisting conditions.   Mr. Speaker, these are the types of things we promised, and doing  nothing is not an option. May I remind my colleague from the other side  of the aisle: I have seen those numbers. My constituents will not  simply walk away and do nothing just because the other side says that  they will be uncovered. Now they will have a choice. Those thousands of  people will not walk away. They will choose something better for them.  There will be thousands of people that have insurance that covers their  needs, and not what, Mr. Speaker, my colleague says they will do. They  are not that stupid. They won't walk away.
