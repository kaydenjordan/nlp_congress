 I send a question to the House counsel for a question.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Roberts asks:         Would you please respond to the arguments or assertions the       House managers made in response to the previous questions?    This is directed to the counsel for the President.  [[Page S658]]        Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate. I want  to respond to a couple.   First, with regard to the question or the issues that have been  raised as it relates to witnesses, it is important to note that in the  Clinton impeachment proceeding, the witnesses who actually gave  deposition testimony were witnesses who had either been interviewed by  deposition in the House proceedings, grand jury proceedings, and then,  more specifically, was Sid Blumenthal, Vernon Jordan, and Monica  Lewinsky. New witnesses were not being called. That is because the  House, in their process, moved forward with a full investigation. That  did not happen here.   There was another statement that was raised by Mr. Chairman Schiff,  Manager Schiff, regarding the Chief Justice could make the  determination on executive privilege. And again, with no disrespect to  the Chief Justice, the idea that the Presiding Officer of this  proceeding could determine a waiver or an applicability of executive  privilege would be quite a step. There is no historical precedent.  There is no historic precedent that would justify it.   But there is something else. If we get to the point of witnesses,  then, for instance, if one of the witnesses to be called by the  President's lawyers was Adam Schiff in the role, basically, of Ken  Starr--Ken Starr presented the report and made the presentation before  the House of Representatives. He had about 12 hours of questioning, I  believe, is what Judge Starr had. If Representative Schiff was called  as a witness, would, in fact, then issues of speech and debate clause  privilege be litigated and decided by the Presiding Officer or would it  go to court or maybe they would waive it, but those would be the kind  of issues that would be very, very significant.   Senator Graham presented a hypothetical, which Manager Schiff said,  well, that is not really the hypothetical, but hypotheticals are  actually that; they are hypotheticals. To use Manager Schiff's words,  he talked about how it would be wrong if FBI or the Department of  Justice was starting a political investigation of someone's political  opponent.   I am thinking to myself, but isn't that exactly what happened? The  Department of Justice and the FBI engaged in an investigation of the  candidate for President of the United States when they started their  operation called Crossfire Hurricane.   He said it would be targeting a rival. That is what that did. He said  it would be calling for foreign assistance in that. In the particular  facts of Crossfire Hurricane, it has been well established now that, in  fact, Fusion GPS utilized the services of a former foreign intelligence  officer, Christopher Steele, to put together a dossier and that  Christopher Steele relied on his network of resources around the globe,  including Russia and other places, to put together this dossier, which  then James Comey said was unverified and salacious. Yet it was the  basis upon which the Department of Justice and the FBI obtained FISA  warrants. This was in 2016, against a rival campaign. So we don't have  to do hypotheticals. It is precisely the situation.   To take it an additional step, this idea that a witness will be  called--if this body decides to go to witnesses--would be a violation  of fundamental fairness. Of course, if witnesses are called by the  House managers through that motion, the President's counsel would have  the opportunity to call witnesses as well, which we would.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from California.
