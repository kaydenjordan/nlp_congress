 Mr. President, I thank the minority leader. I would just  say that the presumptive conditions that the fighting men and women  were exposed to in Vietnam are real, and the fact of the matter is  these folks are getting old enough now that these conditions are  putting them in a world of hurt healthwise. It is the right thing to do  to support our Vietnam veterans when it comes to the presumptive  conditions that were caused by Agent Orange, and it needs to be in the  NDAA.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as we come here this week, back to  Washington, DC, to deal with next year's funding package and hopefully  a COVID package, I want to step back for a second and talk about really  what is the most important thing in this body, and that is  relationships.   Now, as a U.S. Senator, we have relationships with the people who  elect us and for whom we work. Some of those relationships are  outstanding; some may be not so outstanding. We also have relationships  with the people who work for us, and, once again, some of those  relationships are outstanding; some of them could use a little work.   Today, I get to talk about somebody who is retiring from my office  who has had an outstanding relationship with everybody in my office,  which is a feat that not a lot of folks are able to accomplish. But she  is retiring. She is my scheduler.   Her name is Trecia Bickford McEvoy. I would just say that Trecia is  not here today. Hopefully, she is watching on C-SPAN. The reason she is  not here is because of COVID. My wife is not here today, and my wife  dearly wanted to be here today to hear this speech in person. She is  not here greatly in part because of COVID.   But the bottom line is, when it comes to Trecia McEvoy--and any  Senator knows this--the most difficult job in any office in the U.S.  Senate is the person who schedules the Senator's time. It is tough  enough to be able to get to the committee meetings on time and be able  to deal with the floor schedule and make sure you are meeting with  constituents all in a timely order, not holding anybody up. But in my  particular case, it is even more difficult because, as the folks in  this body know, I still farm. So getting back to Big Sandy, MT, to that  farm 12 miles west, to be able to do the things that I need to do,  whether it is planting, whether it is harvesting, whatever it is, in a  timely manner is also really important.    Not only did Trecia have to deal with my schedule here in the Senate,  she had to deal with a very, very uncertain schedule on the farm. Let  me give an example. I may be peeling out of here on a Thursday night  with full intentions to plant some peas the next day. When I call my  wife Sharla and say ``What is the weather like?'' she will say ``It is  raining,'' to which I call back Trecia and say ``Trecia, you have to  schedule for me for work in the State because I can't do any farming''  to which she would go to work and over the next 12 hours, starting at  about 4 or 5 in the afternoon, would help schedule, working with my  State schedule  [[Page S7101]]  and working with the staff, a full day of work the next day.   That didn't happen once in a while. That happened almost every  weekend because, as those of us involved in agriculture know, it either  rains too much or not enough; the Sun either doesn't shine enough or it  shines too much.   The truth is, Trecia had to juggle all of those balls in the air to  make sure that everything got done, to make sure that I was able to do  my job as a Senator, that I was able to meet with those constituents,  that I was able to meet with those trade groups that were out there,  and that I was able to meet with different businesses around the State  of Montana and then also have time enough to be able to operate the  farm. She did it, and she did it with a smile on her face. The reason  that is important is because sometimes those calls didn't come at 5 in  the afternoon; sometimes those calls came at midnight Montana time,  which, incidentally, is 2 in the morning here, and she always answered  the phone--always--and she was always there with a solution to any  problem I might have. It made life so much easier. That is why, when I  hired Trecia McEvoy, it was the best hire I have ever made in my nearly  14 years in this body.   Trecia, when I hired her, was already a seasoned veteran. She spent  more than 15 years scheduling for Senator Jim Jeffords before I was  able to hire her. We asked her former colleagues in Jeffords' office to  reminisce on their time working with Trecia. One of them was something  that is perfectly Trecia McEvoy. The quote goes like this: Trecia was a  fierce keeper of the gate and protector of Senator Jeffords. The staff  didn't worry too much about Jim getting mad at us but, rather, Trecia  getting mad at us. Whether she was protecting his time with an  important dignitary, protecting his popcorn and his frozen yogurt  lunches, or making sure that Jim wore his Senate softball uniform  underneath his suit to hit the field after the vote, she never missed a  beat.   Coincidentally, here in the Senate, she met her husband Jeff when she  worked in Jeffords' office. Some of you may know Jeff. He is one of the  Senate's longest serving photographers. Jeff was an Army veteran,  serving from 1981 to 1989. Coming to the Senate after his retirement,  where he has been ever since, he worked his way up, holding positions  as official photographer, lead photographer, photographic services  supervisor, and lastly, branch manager.   Jeff and Trecia still have--at least until the pandemic hit--lunch in  the Dirksen cafeteria every single day. Between the two of them, they  had two kids, Zach and Ian. It has been a privilege of my lifetime to  watch those kids grow up, to go to an occasional hockey game--something  that I know nothing about--and have Trecia tell me how the sport works.   Look, it is never easy when you have somebody who sits right outside  the door of your office--usually the first person you see when you come  into the office, and it is usually the last person you see when you  leave it. But Trecia was a pro. She is a pro.   Today I should feel sad, but I don't. I actually feel very happy for  her because she gets to retire, and she gets to move up to New  Hampshire. I think, if she is watching in Washington, DC, right now,  she is probably sitting on cardboard boxes full of clothes or dishes or  whatever it might be because my guess is, as of tomorrow, she will  probably be in New Hampshire in short order. But the truth is, she will  be able to go up there and enjoy life and look back at her time here in  the Senate and understand that she has done a job well done. I would  just say that the next chapter in her life, I have no doubt, will be  just as exciting as the last one.   Trecia said: I remember there was a day--she told me that when she  retires, she will look up at the dome and no longer feel a sense of  wonder. I don't believe that is true. I think now that she is retired,  she will look up at this dome that we all work under and think of the  incredible stories and the incredible experiences and the incredible  people, that she was able to enrich their lives and make life better  for them.   Even though, Trecia, you are going to be a shot up north in New  Hampshire, you will always be a part of my team, Team Tester. And I  will tell you that Sharla and my kids and my staff and I thank you for  everything you have done. Hopefully you won't be a stranger. Hopefully  you will come back on occasion, come into the office and tell us what  we are doing wrong and what we are doing right, because you are the  best.   I yield my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
