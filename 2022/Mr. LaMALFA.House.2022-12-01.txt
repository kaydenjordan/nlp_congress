 Madam Speaker, why would President Biden rather meet our  energy needs by negotiating with Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, nations  that regularly imprison political dissidents and engage in torture and  execution, than mobilize our own American energy sector and economy?   Why should we support the economies of these brutal dictatorships  while destroying our domestic oil production, which could supply all  the energy we would ever need, plus our friends across the sea?   Instead, burdensome regulations and disincentives to invest in it are  what we get.   At this moment, millions of Uyghurs are suffering horrifically in  concentration camps. Thousands of Chinese protesters are reacting  against these brutal, harsh zero-COVID policies in China, yet America  continues to be dependent on China's supply chains.   To seriously challenge China's atrocious human rights record, we must  expand U.S. manufacturing and assert our own economic competitiveness  and also stop our overdependence on Chinese products.   As we enter a new year and new Congress, we must get started to make  America dependent upon ourselves.                            ____________________
