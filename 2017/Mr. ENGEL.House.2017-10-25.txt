 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   Let me thank our chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my  friend, Ed Royce from California, for his work moving this bill. I was  pleased to join him as the lead Democratic cosponsor when we introduced  this bill in March of this year.   I stand by his entire statement that he has just made. We have an  absolute meeting of the minds on this bill, and that is why we were  able to get 323 cosponsors on both sides of the aisle, because people  understand and realize the threat that Iran poses to us, to the world,  and to our allies.   The Foreign Affairs Committee has been hard at work this year  devising new tools and approaches for dealing with the threat of Iran.  There is no doubt that Iran must be one of our major priorities in our  foreign policy, the world's most prolific state sponsor of terrorism, a  serial abuser of human rights, a lifeline for the murderous  [[Page H8176]]  Assad regime in Syria, and the challenge we are dealing with today:  Iran's illicit development of ballistic missiles.   The chairman and I share the view that when it comes to the nuclear  deal, which we both opposed, the best path forward is to enforce the  hell out of it even while we work to hold Iran's feet to the fire on  all these other harmful activities.   We passed a tough sanctions bill last summer to crack down on Iran,  as well as North Korea and Russia. While the bill before us today  basically contains very similar provisions which we dealt with then  and, as the chairman explained, we go one step further here, I am  always eager to find even more ways to dial up pressure on the regime  in Tehran, which is a malevolent regime, which is a regime that  sponsors terrorism, which is a regime that is hostile to the United  States, hostile to our ally Israel, and hostile to our other allies in  the Middle East. But I worry that the administration isn't taking this  problem seriously.   So far, the White House hasn't fully implemented the previous bill we  sent to the President. The White House's approach to the nuclear deal  sends a bad message to allies and adversaries around the world that the  United States might not live up to its word. Rather than extracting  more concessions with Iran, which I believe may be possible by working  hard to build a strong multilateral coalition, the course of this may  instead push Iran to leave the deal and resume work on a bomb. We can  never allow that to happen.   So I am happy that we keep passing the sanctions bills, but Congress'  role can only go so far. It is up to the administration to lay out its  goals, devise a strategy, and implement the tough sanctions Congress  has passed. It is more than 60 days since we passed the sanctions bill,  and the President has not implemented it. According to the bill, which  the President signed, it was supposed to be implemented within 60 days,  so it sends a mixed message.   Talking tough is not enough. Congress sends a bill to the White  House, the President signs it, it really should be implemented. So I  want to urge the President and the administration to listen to this  Congress in a bipartisan way. We passed this bill. It needs to be  implemented, and it needs to be passed and implemented again.   In the meantime, I am happy to support this bill. I think this shows  that we need to work together when it comes to Iran in a bipartisan way  to show that there is really not a shred of difference, that we will  not stand for Iran's aggression, we will not stand for the mullahs  threatening us, we will not stand for Iran stomping on its own people.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank the chairman for his leadership on this  issue. I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to support it, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we have shown again and again, and you can tell with  all the comments that were made here, there is support on both sides of  the aisle for holding Iran accountable for its dangerous behavior.   While today's bill is similar to the bipartisan sanctions Congress  passed during the summer, the direction we are moving today with this  bill is the right one: going after Iran for something outside the scope  of the nuclear deal.   When the nuclear deal was negotiated, we were told very clearly that  it would not prevent us, would not stop us from slapping sanctions on  Iran for other things, other things like support of terrorism or  ballistic missiles, or all the troublemaking activities that they do.   This is what we are doing today. We are slapping sanctions on Iran  for its behavior. We are slapping sanctions on Iran because we are not  going to stand for their doing whatever they please and helping  terrorism, suppressing rights of its people, and being a general threat  to the United States.                                time  1500    So I hope that we can get a strong, bipartisan, overwhelming vote for  this bill the way we did in the bill that Chairman Royce and I  introduced 3  [[Page H8178]]  months ago, again, which gave the President 60 days to identify  sanctions, which was not done beyond the 60 days, and I hope that the  administration forthwith does that now.   So I think this is an important measure. I think it is an important  measure to have a strong bipartisan vote because we have to show the  Iranians that, while we may disagree on certain things, there is no  disagreement on the fact that we regard Iran as the largest state  sponsor of terrorism.   It is true of both sides of the aisle that we regard Iran as  threatening; that we regard Iran as dangerous in the Middle East; that  we regard Iran, unfortunately, as an adversary of the United States.  The comments with the rallies that the Ayatollah holds, death to  America, death to Israel, is not something that we can countenance in  this country, and so we are going to fight it.   I am very proud of what the House is doing today. I urge a ``yes''  vote. And I want to thank Chairman Royce, once again, for his strong  leadership on this measure and so many other measures.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of this measure. Let me start off by thanking  Representatives Gallagher of Wisconsin and Suozzi of New York. Mr.  Suozzi is a very valued, new member of the Foreign Affairs Committee,  and I want to thank both of them for their hard work on this bill. And,  as always, I want to thank Chairman Royce for his leadership.   This is the first of three measures that we are considering today to  crack down on the terrorist group, Hezbollah. I have been focused on  this challenge for a long time. More than a decade ago, I wrote a law  to get Syria out of Lebanon and, with it, Syria's support for  Hezbollah.   But this is a group made up of extremists, and they will always try  to find new ways to gather resources and spread their reach, all in aid  of its dangerous and violent agenda, which is undermining Lebanon's  political independence; supporting Iran's activities, aggressive  activities throughout the region; fueling chaos and war in Syria; and  threatening our ally, Israel.   We need to do everything in our power to isolate Hezbollah. We need  to crack down on its recruiters and financiers. We need to cut off its  supply of weapons, and we need to silence its propaganda machine.   The three measures we will now consider will help us meet this  challenge. The first is a new sanctions bill aimed at Hezbollah's use  of innocent civilians as human shields. It would ban entry into the  United States to anyone who uses human shields on behalf of Hezbollah,  and it would freeze whatever assets they have in the United States.   This bill would call upon our Ambassador to the U.N. to push for  multilateral sanctions for the same behavior, and it would require the  administration to keep Congress apprised about whether certain  Hezbollah leaders would be caught up in the web of these sanctions.   It is a good bill and a piece of a broader strategy to cut the legs  out from under this odious group.   You know, some our friends in Europe like to say: Well, there are  really two parts of Hezbollah. One is the military wing, and one is the  humanitarian wing, and the so-called humanitarian wing takes care of  people who are in trouble, who need aid, who need help, and that is the  way the story goes.   The fact is, a terrorist organization is a terrorist organization.  You cannot cut it in half and say one wing is good and the other wing  is not. A terrorist organization is not good. A terrorist organization  kills innocent people. A terrorist organization doesn't want peace,  they want war, they want killing, they want people to continue to  suffer. So let us remember, Hezbollah is a terrorist group.   Hezbollah is primarily financed by Iran. Assad was losing the war in  Syria on at least two occasions, and, on those times, Syria had an  infusion of Hezbollah fighters sent by Iran on the side of the Assad  regime to prop up Assad. And after they did it, the Russians came in  and propped up Assad.   So let's remember the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who  have been murdered in Syria in the Syria civil war. That is Hezbollah,  a terrorist organization--bombs in Israel against innocent civilians,  bombs every place else.   We cannot sit idly by. And so this bill, again, is a piece of a  broader strategy to cut the legs out from under this odious group.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support it. I urge everyone to do the  same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi), my colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee, a  fellow New Yorker, and one of the new good members of our committee,  and coauthor of this important bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel), a valued member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time to  close the way I always do.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides for their  hard work on this bill. I want to remind my colleagues that, just a few  years ago when the last war was raging in Gaza, the other terrorist  group, Hamas, used civilians as human shields. We had a resolution on  the floor of this House condemning it, and I was very, very proud that  that resolution passed unanimously.   We need to condemn these terrorist groups no matter what they do, but  when they use people as human shields--innocent people--and then try to  blame the other side for the death, it is not something that we can  countenance or stand for at all. I hope that we rise to the occasion  this time, as well, because I can think of nothing more despicable than  using innocent civilians as human shields.   These bomb factories are built in mosques, they are built in schools,  and they are built in playgrounds. They are built where children are.  They are built because they are daring Israel and the United States to  go after them when we know that there will be human casualties. It is  really a despicable position.   Here you have two terrorists groups, Hezbollah and Hamas. One is  Shia; one is Sunni. It doesn't matter. They are both out to kill  people. They are both out to terrorize people. They are both out to do  the opposite of what we try to do in the United States: lifting people  up.   They need to be stopped, and this Congress needs to keep sending  strong messages with teeth behind them to the world that we will not  sit idly by and allow these terrorist activities to happen.   Using civilians as human shields is really the lowest of the low. The  fact that Hezbollah would put innocent men, women, and children in  harm's way as human shields tells you everything you need to know about  this organization. It is a cowardly practice by a gruesome group, and  it cannot and shall not be tolerated.   This measure puts us on record again condemning this terrorist group,  and it gives the administration more tools to deal with one of  Hezbollah's worst tools, more tools to deal with Hezbollah to stop its  terrorist activities. So I urge a bipartisan ``yes'' vote.   I thank Chairman Royce again for his collaboration with us on both  sides of the aisle. That is one of the great things about the Foreign  Affairs Committee because we realize that partisanship stops at the  water's edge. When we are talking about terrorist groups and we are  talking about antidemocratic groups, they affect us all. It is  important that this Congress sends strong bipartisan measures and a  strong bipartisan voice to say we will not tolerate these atrocities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote from all my colleagues on both  sides, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   Let me again thank Chairman Royce for his leadership and for his hard  work on this bill. I am glad to be the lead Democratic cosponsor of  this legislation, which builds on a law that Ed Royce and I wrote in  2015.   One of the best ways to stop Hezbollah's dangerous activity is to cut  off its financing, which is what we tried to do 2 years ago. We went  after Hezbollah's financial patrons, including Iran. But again, this is  a group that, if you block one path forward, they will do what it takes  to find another way around.   So with this measure, we are broadening existing law by going after a  bigger universe of Hezbollah supporters and enablers. This bill would  impose mandatory sanctions on any third parties or governments  providing money, equipment, or weapons to Hezbollah.   We know that Iran will again get caught up in this dragnet, and this  bill doesn't run afoul of our obligations under the nuclear deal or any  other deal. After all, Iran's support for Hezbollah is outside the  scope of the JCPOA.   But it is not just Iran. In recent years, we have seen Moscow step up  its support of Hezbollah, particularly on the battlefields of Syria,  where Russia has supplied Hezbollah with weapons. It is really  outrageous. Russia claims to be fighting so-called terrorists as they  bomb schools, hospitals, and marketplaces. Yet Russian weapons are  ending up in Hezbollah hands.   Let me be clear: Hezbollah is a terrorist group. It is as simple as  that. Chairman Royce and I have said this many times. The Russia- Hezbollah relationship threatens to undermine global antiterrorism  efforts.   This bill sends a message that any government in cahoots with  Hezbollah, anyone who wants to do business with this terrorist group or  support its violent aims, is going to face the consequences.   This is a timely bill. Iran is building weapons factories in southern  Lebanon that would be buried far underground, out of Israel's reach.  The missiles that will come off that assembly line are more precise and  have a longer range, putting virtually the whole of Israel in their  sights.   Iran's and Hezbollah's presence in Syria, particularly in the south,  right on Israel's borders, is a very serious concern. I worry about the  deescalation zones the United States helped to establish in southern  Syria. We don't want those zones to become hotbeds of Hezbollah.   Several weeks ago, I was in Israel, and we trekked up to the border  between Israel and Lebanon. At the border, as far as the eye can see,  when you are in Israel and you are looking down at Lebanon, you see a  number of flags. Are they the Lebanese flag? No. It is the Hezbollah  flag.   Hezbollah has virtually taken over large parts of Lebanon, strangling  the Lebanese people as well. The Lebanese people are suffering under a  brutal terrorist group that is embedded in a society that disallows  them to act as a free and open society.   My heart really goes out to the Lebanese people, who have a terrorist  group virtually sitting in their lap, refusing to move, and putting  them in all kinds of danger.   These areas have the potential to create a safe haven for Hezbollah  and Iranian actors. They will stoke existing tensions and could create  a corridor from Tehran to the Mediterranean through Iraq, Syria, and  Lebanon. This would present a major shift in the regional balance of  power, and it would present threats to Israel that it could not ignore.   If these deescalation zones end up empowering Iran and Hezbollah,  then we will have betrayed our ally, Israel, at the most critical  moment. That is why we are passing this bill.   I, again, thank Chairman Royce for his continued strong leadership on  this issue. I strongly support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, since I, too, will go over to the Senate  side, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Deutch), and I ask unanimous consent that he may control the time on  this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Royce from  California, and the ranking member, Mr. Engel from New York, once again  for their leadership. They are the dynamic duo of the Foreign Affairs  Committee on this issue. This is a very important day, in terms of  sanctioning evildoers in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor the bill promoted by Chairman  Royce and Ranking Member Eliot Engel, H.R. 3329, the Hizballah  International Financing Prevention Amendments Act. This is yet another  strong, bipartisan bill that they have authored and brought to the  floor, aimed at holding Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah, accountable for  their illicit activity.   I was pleased that my amendment to this bill was included to ensure  that we identify those Hezbollah parliamentarians and cabinet officials  who are subject to the sanctions in this bill and the underlying bill  that it amends.   This is important, Mr. Speaker, because Hezbollah members have  prominent positions in Lebanon's Government, and we want to ensure that  they cannot use government funds to divert to Hezbollah's terror  activity, and, if they do, those institutions that help facilitate such  activity are held to account.   I was also pleased to see other provisions approved that would allow  us to identify and track individuals and entities that are being used  by Iran to supply Hezbollah with arms or support for its missile  production facilities in Syria.   We know that Iran uses commercial civilian aircraft to fly weapons,  arms, and fighters to Syria in support of Hezbollah. We cannot allow  Iran to use these civilian aircraft for such activity. This is the  first step toward making sure that, once these aircraft are identified,  responsible nations will think twice about allowing these Iranian  planes to land in their countries.   This bill also addresses Iran's and Hezbollah's ability to finance  their illicit activities, which is so important, Mr. Speaker. We must  go after those individuals and those institutions that provide  financial safe havens to these terror groups, and we have got to  disrupt their financial networks.   That is why this bill is so important, and I urge my colleagues to  support Chairman Royce's and Ranking Member Engel's measure before us  today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   Let me thank my good friend and colleague from Florida,  Representative Deutch, the Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Middle  East Subcommittee, for bringing forward this measure.   This measure represents another part of a good congressional strategy  for combatting Hezbollah, and that's rallying support among friends and  partners . . . making sure that around the world everyone sees  Hezbollah for what it is: a terrorist group.   This has been a bit of a stumbling block with our friends in the  European Union. Make no mistake: Hezbollah has waged its campaign of  violence in Europe over the years, such as 2012, when a Hezbollah  terrorist killed five Israelis in Bulgaria.   Yet in 2013, the EU announced it would consider only the ``military  wing'' of Hezbollah to be a terrorist organization, drawing a  distinction with the so-called political wing.   Well, Mr. Speaker, that's a distinction without a difference.  Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, and that's all there is to it.  The more shades of grey clouding this issue, the harder it's going to  be to work with our EU allies to stop Hezbollah's violent activities.   So this measure lays out the facts about Hezbollah's presence in  Europe and the other groups that have labeled Hezbollah a terrorist  organization. It commends the work we're already doing with our EU  allies to push back against Hezbollah. And it says that it's time for  the EU to stop the hairsplitting. It calls on the EU to designate all  of Hezbollah for what it is: a terrorist organization.   I'm glad to support this measure. It sends such an important signal  to our friends across the Atlantic.    Mr. Speaker, there are so many different issues. We are  talking about tax reform, but I want to go back to an issue we have  talked about for several months now, and that is the DREAMers.   I rise today to call on the House leadership to bring up the Dream  Act. The DREAMers who came to this country as children were brought by  their parents for a chance to pursue the American Dream.   These young Americans go to our colleges and universities. They are  our teachers and doctors and serve in the military, and we cannot  afford to upend the lives and dreams of these 800,000 DACA recipients-- people like Andres, a DREAMer who lives in my district. He came to this  country as a child, and America is the only home he knows. He attends  school here, earned his associate's degree, and became a building  engineer. He built his personal relationships in our country and  contributes every day to our society. His work, his friends and family  are all in the United States. It would be a cruel mistake to force him  to give all that up and send him back to a country he doesn't know.   Nearly 9 out of 10 Americans support the DACA program. It is our  responsibility to the American people and to the hundreds of thousands  of young DREAMers in this country to pass the Dream Act now.   Mr. Speaker, we should do so as soon as we can.                            ____________________
