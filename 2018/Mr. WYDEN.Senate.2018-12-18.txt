 Mr. President, today I have introduced the Retirement  Parity for Student Loans Act. This legislation would permit employers  to make matching contributions to workers under 401(k) and similar  types of retirement plans as if worker student loan payments were  salary reduction contributions to the retirement plan. This legislation  will help those workers who cannot afford to both save for retirement  and pay off their student loan debt by providing them with employer  contributions to build their retirement savings. This legislation is a  common sense fix to our Nation's rules for employer-sponsored  retirement plans and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Brown, Ms. Smith,          Mr. King, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Van          Hollen):   S. 3776. A bill to improve Federal efforts with respect to the  prevention of maternal mortality, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Finance.
