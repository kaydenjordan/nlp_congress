 Mr. President, first, before I get into the substance of  my remarks, I just heard Leader McConnell's statements on debt ceiling.   The leader's statements on debt ceiling are shameless, cynical, and  totally political. This debt is Trump debt. It is COVID debt. Democrats  joined three times during the Trump administration to do the  responsible thing. The bottom line is that Leader McConnell should not  be playing political games with the full faith and credit of the United  States. Americans pay their debts.    Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  failed cloture vote.    Madam President, I just want to explain what happened on  the floor very briefly.   At the end of the vote, I changed my response to a no so that I may  move to reconsider this vote at a future time.   I yield the floor.
