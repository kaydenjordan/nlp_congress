 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate California's Sikh  American Awareness and Appreciation Month and to recognize the  contributions that Sikh Americans have made not only in California, but  throughout the country.   This community originally came from Punjab, India, like other  immigrant groups from all over the world, to have a better life for  themselves and for their children.   In 1910, the Sikhs had become a cornerstone in California  agriculture's Sacramento, Imperial, and San Joaquin Valleys. In  addition to sharing the rich culture and the contributions that they  have made to our economy, they are farmers, businessowners, physicians,  and in all walks of life.   Sikh Americans stand with all Americans in their patriotism and  values. Beginning with World War I, Sikhs have served in all of the  American wars. Sikh communities promote the values of diversity,  equality, freedom, justice, and giving back to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and  celebrating the many contributions of Sikh Americans, which have made  us a stronger nation and play an integral role in the health of the San  Joaquin Valley and our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on rollcall Vote 642, I had intended to vote  ``nay'' when I voted ``yea.''
