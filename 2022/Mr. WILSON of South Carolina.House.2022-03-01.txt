 Mr. Speaker, on Friday, I was grateful,  as the ranking member of the U.S. delegation to the Organization for  Security and Cooperation in Europe, to address the Parliamentary  Assembly in Vienna, Austria. Our delegation was ably led by Co-Chair    Steve Cohen.   The bipartisan United States delegation of Democrats and Republicans  being transatlantic, with our valued European and Indo-Pacific allies,  have been unintentionally united about the Putin war of mass murder in  Ukraine, violating the principles of the Helsinki Final Act. Here, we  want to emphasize the devastating human cost of the Putin war against  the families of Ukraine, isolating Russia and Belarus from the modern  world.   I was grateful over the years to have visited Russia a number of  times where I was so impressed by the talented citizens. Today, they  are being betrayed by Putin in his obsession for oil, money, and power.  Two months ago, I visited Kyiv and it is horrifying to know of the  attacks.   Sadly, in Belarus, dictator Lukashenko has become a puppet  facilitating the Putin war. It is inspiring that the legal President of  Belarus, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, would have her first loyalty to the  people of Belarus, not the war criminal, Putin.   In conclusion, God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long live  President Volodymyr Zelensky.                            ____________________
