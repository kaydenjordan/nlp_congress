 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 647 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 647         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 477) to       amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to exempt from       registration brokers performing services in connection with       the transfer of ownership of smaller privately held       companies. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-43 shall       be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services; (2) the       further amendment printed in part A of the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, if offered       by the Member designated in the report, which shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order, shall be       considered as read, shall be separately debatable for the       time specified in the report equally divided and controlled       by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to       a demand for a division of the question; and (3) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3971) to amend       the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement       Procedures Act of 1974 to modify the requirements for       community financial institutions with respect to certain       rules relating to mortgage loans, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-44 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services; (2) the       further amendment printed in part B of the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, if offered       by the Member designated in the report, which shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order, shall be       considered as read, shall be separately debatable for the       time specified in the report equally divided and controlled       by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to       a demand for a division of the question; and (3) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 3.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 123) making further continuing appropriations for fiscal       year 2018, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The       joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations;       and (2) one motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on House  Resolution 647.    Mr. Speaker, I hope you were listening as the Reading  Clerk was going through this rule, because there was a lot of meat in  this rule today.   Ordinarily, and, in fact, historically, we will do a bill and we will  do a rule; we will do a rule and we will do a bill. This rule today  makes three bills in order, three important bills in order.   I am proud to be able to carry this rule today. I hope my colleagues  will see the merits of it as I do.   The rule provides a structured rule for the debate of two bills out  of the Financial Services Committee. One is H.R. 477, Mr. Speaker, the  Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage  Simplification Act of 2017. The second is H.R. 3971, the Community  Institution Mortgage Relief Act. The rule also provides for  consideration of a continuing resolution, H.J. Res. 123, which provides  appropriations through December 22, as final year decisionmaking and  negotiating goes on. It also allows the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services, CMS, to reallocate existing funds for the CHIP program  through December 31, 2017.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start off talking about the Financial Services  bills. We will have some members from the Financial Services Committee  come down. They can talk about it in details that I cannot.   It was a fascinating hearing that we had in the Rules Committee last  night, Mr. Speaker. We had the chairman, Mr.  [[Page H9723]]  Hensarling from Texas, and we had the ranking member, Ms. Waters. It  was a conversation about how we protect people, how do we serve people  better.   Now, the Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act, Mr. Speaker, is  the result of small community banks and local credit unions saying: We  are having a tough time providing mortgages to our members because the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has created rules designed to  protect consumers that are protecting them right out of access to a  mortgage at all.   Mr. Speaker, it is a legitimate disagreement that we have here from  time to time about how to protect people best, about how to love people  best, but it is the right kind of conversation to be having. If we pass  this rule today, we will be able to get into debate on that underlying  bill.   The debate will not be about should we protect people, because we all  agree that we should.                                time  1245    The debate will be about how should we protect those people, an issue  on which legitimate, well-intentioned, thoughtful men and women can  disagree. I look forward to this body working its will.   The second bill, Mr. Speaker, from the Financial Services Committee,  H.R. 477, was introduced by a classmate of mine in that big class of  2011, Mr. Huizenga from Michigan. He has worked this bill through the  process one step at a time, trying to build consensus so that, Mr.  Speaker, as we were in the Rules Committee last night, the conversation  between the chairman and the ranking member was: Hey, if we can make  one more amendment in order, one more amendment that Mr. Huizenga and  Mr. Sherman had worked out together, if we can make one more round of  changes, we believe we can get this through on a big bipartisan  majority coming out of the Financial Services Committee.   Mr. Speaker, we don't celebrate those things, we don't talk about  those things. The newspaper will be filled with discord coming out of  this city tomorrow morning, but I can tell you that it gives me great  pride to come on behalf of the Rules Committee today bringing forward  these bills, not that are going to change the world overnight, but are  going to make a big difference for real people facing real challenges  across this country.   It turns out, Mr. Speaker, my experience is if we do a little bit  together every day, a little bit today, a little bit tomorrow, a little  bit the next day, we wake up a year from now finding out we have done a  whole lot together on behalf of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, finally, the continuing resolution. I am not a fan of  continuing resolutions, I just want to tell you. I got to talk to you  about my enthusiastic, optimistic part of this rule earlier. I am going  to lay some tough love on you now, Mr. Speaker. We are not supposed to  be in the continuing resolution business. You know with your  leadership, the leadership of the gentlewoman from New York, the  leadership of the two gentlemen from Michigan here on the floor, this  House passed on time, ahead of schedule, the funding bills to fund the  priorities of the American people for fiscal year 2018.   Folks said we couldn't get it done, folks said we couldn't do it all.  We did, and we did. We sent that to the Senate, Mr. Speaker, before the  end of the fiscal year, which was back on September 30. The Senate  hasn't been able to take it up yet, Mr. Speaker. The Senate hasn't been  able to debate it yet, Mr. Speaker.   I don't know if the Senate is going to get it done in the next 2  weeks, but there are folks in this institution, Mr. Speaker, who say:  You know what? We couldn't get it done in the Senate over these last 2  months, so let's just go ahead and pass a continuing resolution for all  of fiscal year 2018.   A continuing resolution, for folks who don't follow the  appropriations process, means, hey, if it worked well last year, let's  just do the same thing next year. Mr. Speaker, that is awful public  policy.   We came together debating almost 500 amendments. Having moved every  single appropriations bill through the Appropriations Committee, we  came together not just in a bipartisan way in the committee, we came  together here on the House floor, debated these issues, grappled with  these issues, and produced a work product with which the American  people can take great pride.   I don't want to give up on that work product, Mr. Speaker. I don't  want to settle for the way things have been. I believe that we can do  better.   By passing a 2-week continuing resolution today, we ensure that all  the features of government continue to operate as the American people  expect them to, and we provide another window for the Senate to come  together and pass those appropriations bills as we have done here in  the House.   I am optimistic about that coming to fruition, Mr. Speaker. I believe  that we can get that done together.   Mr. Speaker, we can take up these bipartisan efforts from the  Financial Services Committee, we can take up this important effort to  continue the funding of the government if we pass this rule today.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't disagree with a lot of what my friend from New  York had to say when it comes to the facts. I do disagree with the  conclusions that are reached there, Mr. Speaker.   We do need to do a better job of working together. Now, sometimes  that means Republicans and Democrats, sometimes that means the House  and the Senate, sometimes that means the White House and the Congress.  We need to hold each other accountable, but we also need to give each  other credit for our successes.   The gentlewoman talked about important issues relating to education  and improving workforce. We passed together in this institution a  continuation of career and technical education funding. We reauthorized  that program together, led by G.T. Thompson on my side of the aisle, by  Mr. Krishnamoorthi on your side of the aisle, by Chairwoman Foxx on our  side of the aisle, by Ranking Member Scott on your side of the aisle.  We grappled with that issue together. We did it together, because it  was the right thing for the American people, and now it sits in the  United States Senate without action.                                time  1300    We came together, and we funded the government. We grappled, line by  line, section by section, we did it together, and now it sits in the  United States Senate.   Mr. Speaker, what needs to be said, one can describe it as Republican  incompetence. One can describe it as Democrat intransigence. But we, as  a House, have come together and gotten our work done. The Senate  cannot, and why the Senate cannot is because it requires 60 votes to  get something done over there under Senate rules. In order to have 60  votes, you have to have Democrat votes.   If the Senate changed its rules tomorrow and made it just a  Republican majority institution, they could move all of these bills  without delay. Far from being a reflection of incompetence, it is a  reflection of a commitment to a bipartisan effort on the Senate side.   We can poke them and poke them and poke them and, just one day, folks  might get their wish, and we may make that a completely Republican  streamlined process over there. But be careful what you wish for.   We don't have to kick each other in the shins all day long, every  day, over here. We have success after success that we have earned  together. We should spend more time celebrating those successes, Mr.  Speaker. Among those successes is the bill I mentioned earlier, offered  by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Huizenga) to talk about the hard work, the effort, and the success that  he has been able to accomplish in a bipartisan way.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would be interested sometime, Mr. Speaker, having a team building  expert take a look at some of our proceedings here on the House floor  and see if they think that the conversations that happen here bring us  closer to working together on serious solutions, or push us further  away.   I agree with my friend from Michigan; we need to get about the  business of the American people. The business of  [[Page H9726]]  the American people is not figuring out who to blame, it is figuring  out how to fix things. And to continue to perpetuate the inaccurate  message that we don't collaborate on those issues is to do our bosses,  the American people, a terrible disservice.   On bill after bill to combat the opioid epidemic, we have come  together in this institution. We have passed these bills in a  collaborative way and sent them to the United States Senate. Bill after  bill on human trafficking, we have come together in this institution.  We have passed these bills. We have sent those bills to the United  States Senate.   Mr. Speaker, we are talking about funding the American Government. I  have been in this Congress since 2011. I got to vote, for the very  first time, on funding the Centers for Disease Control, which sits  right in my back yard in the great State of Georgia.   I got to vote, for the very first time, on funding the National  Institutes of Health, which do such amazing research, both for our  seniors and for our children. The kind of talent that we have there,  Mr. Speaker, boggles the mind. We came together, and we funded those  institutions in the annual appropriations bill for the first time ever.   Now, we can spend our time together talking about who hates children  and who hates old people, and why it is everybody is an untalented  buffoon; or we can recognize that, on issue after issue, we come  together and get about the business that our bosses sent us to get  about.   I don't think any of us are going to be rewarded by figuring out who  to blame. I think we are going to be rewarded by getting it fixed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Tenney), who has worked, through the Financial Services Committee,  again, in a bipartisan way, to deal with local community financial  institutions and local home buyers who are getting shut out of the  process by an overly burdensome Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I opened with a discussion about how we all care about  these American homeowners who are trying to get, oftentimes, into their  first home, and how it is that we protect them better.   We disagreed about how to protect them.   Do you do it through the CFPB and Federal regulation? Or do you do it  through more local hometown institutions being governed by their  neighbors?   We agreed on what the need was, but we disagreed on how to get there.   What is so frustrating to me--I still feel like a relatively new  Member of this institution, Mr. Speaker. I guess I am not any longer-- is that we seem to have one standard when we are in the majority and a  completely different standard when the other guy takes over the  institution. It seems to me that principles should be principles  irrespective of who sits in your chair.   The very first big vote I took when I got here in 2011, Mr. Speaker,  was to fund the United States Government in February.   Why?   Because when Democrats ran every single facet of government--they  controlled the House, they controlled the Senate, and they controlled  the White House--they didn't get it done. They couldn't get it done. It  is hard to do sometimes, Mr. Speaker.   I will take you back. You weren't in this institution at that time.  The year is 2010. The first CR that they passed went from October 1 to  December 3, about the same length of time as the one that we passed.   They weren't up to anything nefarious when that happened, Mr.  Speaker, and I resent the implication that we have been during that  same path. They needed a little extra time and they took it.   When that CR expired, Mr. Speaker, they then went and passed, lo and  behold, a 2-week CR--a 2-week CR from December 4 to December 18. They  needed a little more time. They passed one for 2 more weeks to get  themselves a little more time.   That didn't work out, Mr. Speaker. They still weren't able to get it  done in those 2 weeks, so their next CR, Mr. Speaker, went from  December 19 to December 21. Three days is what they found to be the  right number to extend funding of the Federal Government so they could  continue to get their work done, Mr. Speaker.   When that 3-day CR didn't work, they then punted altogether; and when  my freshman class came in in 2011, we took over and we funded the  government instead.   Mr. Speaker, we can describe what happened when my friends last  controlled this institution as an abominable failure, or we can  describe it as a frustrating failure but something that happens in this  institution. It happened when my friends ran it. It happens when we run  it. We need, on behalf of the American people, to get on a better  track. Let me stipulate that is true.   But let me ask my friends to stipulate, Mr. Speaker, that for the  first time in a long time we are on a better track because we came  together in this institution and we got our work done. The Senate  hasn't, and I am frustrated by that, but I want to give them a little  more time.   For my friend from Michigan who asked the question, ``What difference  does 2 weeks make,'' I would ask anyone who has that question to Google  ``continuing resolution'' and ``Department of Defense.''   If you think that continuing to fund the government one day at a time  with a continuing resolution, or even 12 months of the time during a  continuing resolution, if you think that is the definition of success,  Google ``continuing resolution'' and ``Department of Defense.''   Every single day that we fail to take up in the United States Senate  the large full-year funding appropriations bill, we do a disservice to  every single man and woman in uniform.   If we have a choice here today, Mr. Speaker, between doing that  disservice to those men and women for 2 weeks or 6 weeks or 8 weeks or  12 months, I choose to.   If you wonder what difference it makes, ask any man or woman in  uniform. There is a reason, Mr. Speaker, as hard as the appropriations  process is, that you and I took up the defense portion, the Homeland  Security portion, the national security portion all the way back in the  summer and passed it out of this House before the end of July, because  we knew how important it was. We knew how mission critical it was, and  we wanted to give the Senate the most time we possibly could.   I am frustrated, too, but let us not describe these failures as  partisan failures, as an effort by one side or the other to subvert the  process. These are failures. But 2 weeks, Mr. Speaker, is going to be  less of a failure for our men and women in uniform than would be 3  weeks, 4 weeks, or 12 months.   I am sorry that we are here, but this is the best circumstance that  we can create to allow our Senate time to succeed.   They cannot succeed alone. Republicans cannot succeed there alone. It  requires a bipartisan majority to succeed. Let us not pretend this is a  partisan problem. This is an American challenge, and I believe we are  up for it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank my friend from New York for helping me to bring the rule  today.   Mr. Speaker, I believe in truth in advertising, and of all the things  that you heard the Reading Clerk read, when he went through word for  word for word from this rule, you heard not one word about taxes today.  Why? Because we are not talking about taxes today at all. Because  nothing that we are doing today has anything to do with taxes at all.  Because of all the successes that we are down here to partner on today,  tax is not one of them.   What is on the list today?   Well, in the spirit of truth in advertising, Mr. Speaker, shutdowns  aren't on the list either. In fact, the opposite is true. If we pass  this rule today, we will fund the government. We will prioritize  keeping the doors open.   Mr. Speaker, habits are hard things to break, and we are in two very  bad habits in this institution. One is failing to see the merit in what  the other side is offering. We have two Financial Services bills today  that break that pattern, that see the merit in working together and  collaborating together, and we bring two bills to the floor that this  entire institution can be proud of.    We have another bad habit of ascribing to the other side's motives  that I believe are not worthy of this institution at all. A government  shutdown would be one of those things. We are, in good faith, working  together--Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, Congress and  White House--to get about the business of the American people, and it  is hard. But it is worth doing, and it is worth doing right.   If I have to choose between fast and right, I choose right. We have  got a chance today, with the passage of this rule, to bring up two  bills that our colleagues, in bipartisan ways, have worked through on  the Financial Services Committee that will make a big difference to  families and businesses across this Nation.   We have an opportunity today, if we pass this rule, to bring up a  continuing resolution that guarantees to every single American that the  doors are open, the lights are on, and we continue and have an  opportunity for the Senate to move final legislation.   I want my colleagues to support this rule. I want my colleagues to  support the underlying bills. But, Mr. Speaker, more than anything, I  want my colleagues to take pride in the successes that we have achieved  here today.   CHIP funding, Children's Health Insurance funding, is at risk, but  not because we haven't succeeded. We have. All we need is one more  signature from the Senate.   CDC funding may be at risk, but not because we haven't succeeded. We  have. We just need that bill to get across the floor in the Senate.   Our troops are on the cusp of receiving a well-deserved pay raise.  Why? Because we came together and we passed it here. We just need it to  get across the floor of the Senate.   And there is not one of those items or a dozen more that I could  list, Mr. Speaker, that will move across the floor of the Senate in  anything but a bipartisan way.   Do you want bipartisanship? If you want cooperation, if you want  success, we have our chance today. Vote ``yes'' on this rule, Mr.  Speaker. Vote ``yes'' on these underlying bills, and let's get together  and get the Senate across the finish line as well.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 647 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:       ``SEC. 4. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ANY TAX BILL THAT RAISES                     TAXES ON MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES BY ELIMINATING                     OR LIMITING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION.         (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House       of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution,       motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or       conference report that repeals or limits the State and Local       Tax Deduction (26 U.S.C. Sec.  164).        (b) Waiver in the House.--It shall not be in order in the       House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that       waives the application of subsection (a). As disposition of  [[Page H9729]]       a point of order under this subsection, the Chair shall put       the question of consideration with respect to the rule or       order, as applicable. The question of consideration shall be       debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point       of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall       otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one       that the House adjourn.''       ``SEC. 5. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ANY TAX BILL THAT REPEALS                     THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE UNDER THE PATIENT                     PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.         (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House       of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution,       motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or       conference report that repeals or limits the individual       mandate under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act       (26 U.S.C. Sec.  5000A).        (b) Waiver in the House.--It shall not be in order in the       House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that       waives the application of subsection (a). As disposition of a       point of order under this subsection, the Chair shall put the       question of consideration with respect to the rule or order,       as applicable. The question of consideration shall be       debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point       of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall       otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one       that the House adjourn.''                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . . When       the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of       the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to       ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then       controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or       yield for the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
