 Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to stand here  tonight as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. To be here at such  a critical point in our country, in our democracy, on the heels of  leaving the South Lawn of the White House where hundreds of people  gathered in honor of supporting the $1.2 trillion bipartisan  infrastructure framework needed when we think about our roads and our  bridges and our broadband.   Tonight, we are so honored to be here. To our chair of this night's  Special Order hour, ``Breaking News,'' I thank Congresswoman Sheila  Jackson Lee, who is anchoring tonight and yielding to me.   Madam Speaker, let me just take this point of personal privilege to  thank her. I thank her for her leadership and say to her and all of her  constituents watching: Texas is all the better because of Congresswoman  Sheila Jackson Lee. When I think of someone leading and talking about  Build Back Better, talking about how great this is for America, thank  you for being part of that leadership.   Now, tonight, let me simply say, Madam Speaker, when I look to build  back better, I see the faces of the Congressional Black Caucus, six  chairs of major committees. So let me do breaking news.   Breaking news, when we look to build back better housing, we know,  across America, that we have a housing problem. We know that we needed  more dollars going into housing, vouchers, and affordable housing.   Breaking news, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, chair of the powerful  Financial Services Committee under which housing and insurance falls,  she was iconic in her leadership, from the White House to the Speaker,  working both sides of the aisle, and, yes, $150 billion.   When I think of Congressman  Bobby Scott, I think of education and  labor. There has not been a stronger voice in the Congress than  Bobby  Scott in the Congressional Black Caucus. You heard earlier from  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Pell grants, HBCUs, historically  Black colleges and universities, billions of dollars going into our  universities.   Madam Speaker, let me take a point of personal privilege because I am  a proud graduate of an HBCU, so I know what this means to young girls  and boys and men and women who are matriculating in our HBCUs. We  cannot have a democracy in a country without protecting our children.  When we talk  [[Page H6261]]  about the child tax credit, when we talk about universal childcare,  this is so critical.   Breaking news, $400 billion--I want to say that again, $400 billion-- into childcare, taking some 40 percent of our children out of poverty.   We know how important our climate is to us, and if we didn't, if you  were out on that South Lawn today, you clearly understood climate  change. Madam Speaker, $555 billion is in for climate change.   I am going to have other colleagues come today, and we are going to  hear how important it is when we talk about taking lead out of our  water, what that does for our children, for our families, for the  environment.   Breaking news, $1.7 trillion is in Build Back Better.   Earlier, one of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus said to  me, ``Tell our story.'' Well, you see, our fingerprints and footprints  are all through this $1.75 trillion, and if you don't claim it, people  don't know it. So, I want everyone to know that the Congressional Black  Caucus is so proud of Our Power, Our Message because we understand that  our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power.   Tonight is so important for us to say: $1.75 trillion, Build Back  Better; $1.2 trillion, bipartisan infrastructure framework. It was the  Congressional Black Caucus that asked for a seat at the table.   The late Congressman John Lewis always said: If you see something,  say something. So, Madam Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus  decided that we were going to say something. We were going to say  something to make sure that all of our friends and colleagues came  together so we could do what is great for America, and that is what we  have done.   Let me say these closing remarks as we then call on our other  colleagues. Let me simply say that I am honored to serve in the United  States Congress, but I am extremely humbled and privileged and honored  to be the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in our 50th year of  existence with the largest membership and the oldest of the caucuses in  the Congress.   Madam Speaker, chair of our Special Order hour, Our Power, Our  Message, we are the Congressional Black Caucus.    Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to yield to  the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence). She is the second vice  chair of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus. She is also one of  the co-chairs of our Women's Caucus.   At this time, I would like to say to my colleague and to my friend:  Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for your strong voice.   As a former mayor, we know she is used to leading, guiding, and  speaking out.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so much, Brenda  Lawrence, for her leadership--breaking news.   Let me just say, as Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence said so well, we  are not going to be quiet. Today, we heard President Joe Biden not be  quiet. We  [[Page H6265]]  also had the opportunity to hear Vice President Kamala Harris not be  quiet.   When we talk about the Congressional Black Caucus, let me say thank  you to Vice President Kamala Harris, a former member of the  Congressional Black Caucus. I thank Vice President Harris for leading  by example, getting out there and fighting for our democracy and making  sure that this is good for America.   As we talk about breaking news and not being quiet and women--Black  women--taking leadership roles, it gives me great pleasure to introduce  and yield to our newest member of the Congressional Black Caucus. She  is someone who comes with a lot of leadership, talent, and skills. It  is a double honor for me because she represents the great State of  Ohio. Madam Speaker, it is always good when you have a partner, so to  be able to have a partner in Ohio's 11th District gives me great honor.  The gentlewoman is someone who works hard, fights for her community,  and understands the value of Build Back Better and what it will do with  this once-in-a-generation action, transformational legislation.   Madam Speaker, that person I am talking about, my friend, my  colleague, and my partner is none other than Congresswoman Shontel  Brown.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Brown).    Madam Speaker, as we bring this hour to a close, let me  again thank our newest member of the Congressional Black Caucus,  Congresswoman Shontel Brown for her words.   Let me conclude tonight's Special Order hour by saying to America:  The Congressional Black Caucus will continue to lead and to take bold,  decisive actions to build back better by passing the Build Back Better  Act. We heard that it will create more housing, it will furnish jobs,  and it will also finish the job of the Affordable Care Act. It will  provide a Medicaid coverage gap, and it will also provide funding, as  you have heard, Madam Speaker, for HBCUs and helping families in need,  giving them a tax cut, as Congresswoman Brown just highlighted for us,  with the child tax credit to help ensure Americans' global  competitiveness for the 21st century and unleashing the full potential  of America's workers and families to thrive in the communities that we  represent, especially those 17 million Americans represented by the  Congressional Black Caucus. There are 17 million Black Americans, and  then we look at some 80 million Americans.   So with that, tonight we bring to it to a close, but we will not be  quiet.   It gives me great pleasure, Madam Speaker, to say thank you for  letting us host the first hour on Build Back Better. Our power, our  message, the Congressional Black Caucus.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous materials on the subject of this Special Order hour.
