 Mr. President, I stand here today to honor the  distinguished veterans of the Northern Colorado Honor Flight who have  made the 21st trip to Washington, DC. Over 120 distinguished veterans  from World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietname war made the trip  to visit our national memorials that were built in their honor.   Military service is an exceptional duty to country. Few words can  describe the sacrifice that these men and woman have made for our  country. They have helped to preserve our rights to life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness. Without reservation or fear, when our country  has been threatened, our veterans have stepped up and have answered our  country's call.   Twice a year, veterans are able to travel to our Nation's Capital,  where we get to recognize their selflessness, fortitude, and bravery.  In 2005 the Honor Flight Program was formed to honor veterans that  served in World War II. Now, 13 years later, the program spans across  our country and recognizes veterans from every generation, who are able  to travel to Washington, DC, free of charge.   Please join me in honoring William Behrns, Leila Morrison, Gail  Wares, Melvin Cook, Eldred Cooley, Eugene Curry, Bead Dennison, James  Dewey, Tito Garcia Jr., Karl Gruber, Manuel Jimenez, Donald Johnson,  Myron Kapperman, Roger Lindgren, Bobby Lewis, John Mansfield, Thomas  Mathias Jr., Dale Mikkelson, Mary Miller, Robert Murphy, Howard Nornes,  James Onorato, Wilbur Smith, Sigvard Stenlund, Bruce Abel, Gary Allen,  Russell Ayer, Roger Baker, John Ballenski, Phillip Ballenski, Robert  Beckman, Delmar Benkendorf, Joseph Bicek, Ivan Birdsall, Roger Booker,  James Boyle, Ronnie Brown, Robert Buchanan, Ronald Byers, Wesley  Carter, Timothy Casseday, Everett Collins, David Cordova, John Cordova,  Keith Cross, Terry Curry, Terry Dack, Scott Dallman, James Ehrlich,  Rodney Enriques, Gary Evans, Brian Finkle, Lewis Finch, Rudolph  Gallegos, Pete Gomez, Clayton Goss, Stanley Graffis, John Haddick,  Michael Hadwick, William Hamlin, Arthur Harris, Michelle Herdengen,  Charles Hill, Richard Hill, William Hilgenberg, Ronald Hoagland, Robert  Johnson, Ronald Klug, Terry Kramer, Lonnie Kruise, Darrel Kyger,  Bertram Langeberg, Gerald Lauer, Jay Lee, James Lichty, Anthony Lucas,  Thomas Mannix, Juan Martinez, Modesto Martinez, James McDaniel, Kenneth  McDonald, Ronald McDuff, Phyllis Minch, Alfred Montoya, Thomas Moreno,  Donald Morris, Stephen Morris, Dennis Moss, Joseph Muzy, Emery Patrick,  Joseph Plummer, Steven Prater, Benjamin Prieb, Ronald Rains, Donald  Ratliff, Richard Regan, Fredrick Reiter, Thomas Robb, Bonnie Rohn,  Fernando Romero Jr., Charles Rossi, Janice Schilling, Dennis Seitz,  William Sladek, Michael Smith, Stephen Smith, Edward Snider Jr., John  Tallman, Bruce Tibboel, Gary Todd, Gary Trippel, Billy Trobee, David  Valdez, Wesley Van Pelt, Louis Velasquez, Stuart Veltkamp, Paul  Wallace, Bryan Warwick, Tom Wasmer, Robert Watters, Steven Wilson, John  Yost, and William Young.                            ____________________
