 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Only two times each decade do we in Congress have the privilege to  effect productive, meaningful change for America's farmers and  ranchers--those same citizens who help feed and clothe the entire  world.   Let us not forget that America's farmers and ranchers make up only 1  percent of our Nation's population, yet they make sure that dinner  tables across the country have food on them. In fact, one farm feeds  165 people in the U.S. and abroad. As such, U.S. farm policy is now a  target due to its own success.   Politically driven think tanks and antifarmer groups believe that  there is no longer a point to have a farm policy in the United States.  They fail to realize that America's farmers and ranchers do business  with foreign competitors who do not share the free market values our  country adopted at its founding, placing them at a disadvantage;  therefore, we have to properly equip our producers to compete with  countries that directly subsidize and own the means of production. It  is, indeed, an issue of national security.    Support this farm bill. Defeat all antifarmer amendments  that hurt American farm families only to enrich multinational soda and  candy makers for more profits. Let us ensure the farmers and ranchers  of this great country continue to plant the seeds and raise the herds  that secure our national abundance, high quality, and least costly food  prices in the world and support the bill.
