 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the next couple hours, we are going to  have another CR vote, and we are going to get some votes on amendments.   When I came to the Senate 3 years ago, a little over that, one of my  main goals--I always respected the Senator from Oklahoma, Dr. Tom  Coburn.   I first saw him when he was actually on one of the shows talking  about the same subject that I harp on all the time. The difference is,  by standards of indebtedness, we had no real worries other than he was  one that could see into the future.   I come from the world of running a business, was on a school board,  State legislature. You couldn't get by with what we get by with here.  You had a budgeting process. When I was a State legislator, you took it  through committees. You brought in witnesses, you fleshed it out. Maybe  you didn't need more money. Generally, even at the statehouse, they  would ask for more. It wasn't necessarily the case.   You did the hard work, rolling up your sleeves, which Hoosiers  appreciated. Do you know what it has given us back in the State of  Indiana? The highest credit rating you can have as a State. It has  given us rainy day funds.   When COVID came along, we could have gotten by without a dollar from  the Federal Government. That is what happens when you live your  everyday life with responsibility, just like every American has to,  just like you have to do in any other level of government.   Think about running a business. Imagine, up until the recent spending  spree, we were only borrowing roughly 23 percent of every dollar that  we spend here--and this isn't on tangible investments; this is on  consumption. There is nothing to show for it.   A lot of the things we do, a lot of the things that people look to us  to do, we need; but we are doing a disservice to our kids and our  grandkids--by the way, who we are actually borrowing the money from-- when we run the biggest business in the world by the seat of its pants.   I am going to tell you just generally how this all plays out. In 4\1/ 2\ years, we are going to completely go through the Medicare trust  fund. And by the way, healthcare expenses based upon a broken  healthcare industry that is not transparent does not deliver the  consumer good value, something that all of us that own businesses other  than the healthcare business have to grapple with every year. They need  to reform themselves, and that would bring Medicare and Medicaid into  where it wasn't costing us so much. But still then, even if you save  there, we probably would find a way to spend the savings.   We are currently, basically the only reserve currency. That is what  keeps our interest rates so low. Historically, they have been three to  four times what they are now. And you cannot run now probably close to  $1.5 trillion deficits on to the $30 trillion we are already in debt  and think that is a good business plan for the biggest business in the  world.   So especially for the folks on the other side of the aisle, but I am  going to say we have been complicit as Republicans. We roll over to  give them what they want on domestic spending, and they do the same on  defense spending, which I think is probably the most important thing we  do. And all of a sudden, everybody is happy. It is called bipartisan,  but it is not honest to the American public.   So, here, we are going to do what we have been doing for years. We  are going to vote on a CR later. But if we are ever going to get this  place back in good shape, we have to have the political will and the  discipline to get back to budgeting and not spend beyond our means  because, some day, we may not be the reserve currency. And after we go  through the Medicare trust fund, which will probably replenish by  borrowing more money, Social Security depletes in about 11 years. I say  that because nobody here talks about it, and it wouldn't be that  difficult to solve.   In the real world, you make the tough decisions, you get through it,  and you are better off for it when you get that behind you.   So I am going to leave it there this evening. I am going to ask all  of my colleagues to please vote on a balanced budget amendment that  makes it so easy that it just says your resolution that you bring up  each year--you have got to do it, you have got to do it on time--has to  balance the budget in 10 years. That even gives a lot more latitude  than what I really thought was necessary, but I also want to make it to  where every one of us can say yes to a balanced budget amendment like  this because we owe it to our kids and our grandkids.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4930 and ask  that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the amendment by  number.   The bill clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Braun] proposes an amendment       numbered 4930.    The amendment is as follows:  (Purpose: To strike the Statutory PAYGO exemption and require balanced              budgets in concurrent resolutions on the budget)         On page 8, strike lines 3 through 6 and insert the       following:        (a) Point of Order Against Budget Resolutions That Do Not       Include a Balanced Budget.--        (1) Point of order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate       to consider a concurrent resolution on the budget that does       not reduce the deficit to zero on or before the end of the       9th fiscal year after the budget year.        (2) Waiver and appeal.--Paragraph (1) may be waived or       suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of two-      thirds of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative       vote of two-thirds of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen       and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the       ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under       paragraph (1).    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will be 2  minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No.  4932, offered by the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Braun.   There are 2 minutes of debate.    I came here 3 years ago with a mission to rein in debt and  deficits. I think few of us actually care much about that here, in my  observation. If we did, we wouldn't be passing our third short-term  spending measure in 5 months. It should have been done last year.   In a few weeks, we will pass an Omnibus bill that we will all say was  bipartisan, and we will go on down the road. Meanwhile, inflation will  be surging ahead--7 percent, 8 percent--the highest since 1982. The  last time we voted on a balanced budget amendment was in 2011. By the  way, both Democrats and Republicans supported it back then.   I am proposing something very simple, very low-threshold. It creates  a point of order against any budget resolution that doesn't reach a  balanced budget in 10 years. That is so simple, everyone, including the  Presiding Officer banging the gavel, ought to be for it for the sake of  our kids and our grandkids.
