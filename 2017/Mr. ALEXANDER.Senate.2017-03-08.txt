 Mr. President, I wish to address the resolution the  Senate is now considering.   In 2015, 85 U.S. Senators voted for the law fixing No Child Left  Behind, which reversed the trend to a national school board and  restored decisions to classroom teachers, local school boards, and  States. The Wall Street Journal said it was the ``largest devolution of  federal control to the states in a quarter of a century.''   The Department of Education regulation this resolution seeks to  overturn does exactly the reverse. It begins to restore the national  school board, and it takes away responsibilities from classroom  teachers, local school boards, and States. It does this in direct  violation of the law that 85 Senators voted for just 15 months ago. So  the question before us, today, is not only whether we believe in a  national school board or local school boards. More important, perhaps,  the question is: who writes the law? Does the U.S. Congress write the  law, or does the U.S. Department of Education write the law? Article I  of the U.S. Constitution says that the Congress, elected by the people,  writes the law.   The purpose of this resolution is to overturn a regulation of the  Department of Education that in 7 cases directly violates the Every  Student Succeeds Act, passed just 15 months ago, and in 16 other cases  exceeds the authority allowed by that law.   This regulation would say to States: Ignore the law 85 Senators  passed 15 months ago. Ignore the law that President Obama called a  Christmas miracle. Ignore the law that Governors, teachers, school  boards, and superintendents all supported, and even ignore why they  supported it. Instead, listen to the unelected bureaucrats at the U.S.  Department of Education.   This regulation issued by the Department of Education specifically  does things or requires States to do things that Congress said, in our  law fixing No Child Left Behind, that the Department of Education  cannot do. Therefore, it violates the law.   In this law, Congress said to the Department: You cannot tell States  exactly what to do about fixing low-performing schools; that is a State  decision. But this regulation does that anyway.  [[Page S1667]]    Congress said to the Department: You cannot tell States exactly how  to rate the public schools in your State. But this regulation does that  anyway.   This is not a minor matter.   The remarkable consensus that developed in the 2015 bill in support  of fixing No Child Left Behind was to reverse the trend toward a  national school board and restore to States, classroom teachers, and  school boards decisions about what to do about their children in  100,000 public schools. Teachers, Governors, and school board members  were fed up with Washington telling them so much about what to do about  the children in their schools. So this regulation, which contravenes  the law specifically, goes to the heart of the bill fixing No Child  Left Behind.   It is very unusual in Federal law to specifically prohibit a  department from regulating on an issue, but that is exactly what  Congress did in 2015. Here are seven specific examples of how the  regulation which we seek to overturn violates prohibitions that  Congress explicitly wrote into the law:   No. 1, the regulation prescribes the long-term goals and measurements  of progress that States establish for student subgroups.   The law says, for example, that the Secretary may not tell a State  that goals set for students of one race must improve their progress 20  percent better than the progress of a group of students of another  race. Yet the regulation says that States must establish goals and  measurements for lower performing subgroups who ``require greater rates  of improvement,'' which would necessarily mean that students of one  race would have to do better than students of another race.   No. 2, the regulation requires federally prescribed actions to be  taken in schools that do not annually test at least 95 percent of  students.   The law says that States must annually test not less than 95 percent  of all students and each subgroup of students, but States determine how  to hold schools accountable for ensuring that 95 percent of students  participate on annual tests. The law says that the Secretary of  Education may not prescribe ``the way in which the State factors'' the  95 percent testing requirement into their accountability system. Yet  the regulation we seek to overturn prescribes four different specific  ways that States must take action in schools that miss the 95 percent  requirement.   No. 3, the regulation prescribes that schools with consistently  underperforming subgroups of students be identified with a lower  summative determination.   The law says that States are required to identify schools for  targeted support when a subgroup of students is ``consistently  underperforming'' in a manner ``as determined by the state.'' So under  the law, the Secretary can't tell States how to identify the lowest  performing schools or what a school's rating should be. Yet the  regulation we are seeking to overturn says that States are required to  ``demonstrate that a school with a consistently underperforming  subgroup . . . receive a lower summative determination. . . . than it  would have otherwise received.'' The Department of Education is  meddling into the methodology of school ratings again, despite the fact  that Congress said it could not.   No. 4, the regulation prescribes the timeline for identifying schools  with consistently underperforming subgroups.   The law says that States are required to identify schools for  targeted support when a subgroup of students is ``consistently  underperforming'' in a manner ``as determined by the state.''   We had lengthy discussions about this. These issues in education are  filled with conflict and filled with different opinions. I said many  times during the debate that working on an education bill in the Senate  is kind of like being in a football stadium on game day at Penn State  or the University of Tennessee: Everybody in the stands has played  football, and they know what play to call, and they usually do. So  everybody had a point. We had to work these things out and we wrote  down carefully the agreement we had. We wrote down that the Secretary  of Education may not impose new requirements or criteria on State  accountability systems, such as a timeline for the identification of  lowest performing schools. Yet the regulation prescribes an exact  timeline of 2 years.   No. 5, the regulation requires States to resubmit their plans to the  Secretary every 4 years.   The law says that each State plan ``shall . . . be periodically  reviewed and revised as necessary by the State educational agency.''  Yet the regulation says States must review and revise their State plans  ``at least once every four years'' and ``submit its revisions to the  Secretary for review and approval.''   No. 6, the regulation dictates exactly how school districts with  significant numbers of low-performing schools must measure resources  for students.   The law says States must ``periodically review resource allocation to  support school improvement'' in districts that are serving a  significant number of low-performing schools. The law says the  Secretary cannot tell States what to review. Yet the regulation says  that in addressing resource inequities, States must review differences  in the following: rates of ineffective, out-of-field, or inexperienced  teachers; access to advanced coursework; access to full-day  kindergarten and preschool programs; access to specialized  instructional support personnel; and per-pupil expenditures of Federal,  State, and local funds.   But the law said the Secretary could not tell States what to review.   No. 7, the regulation tells States how to count students in  subgroups.   The law says each State decides the minimum number of students who  should be included in the State's count of subgroups. So, a State might  decide that for students to be included in the State's subgroup data,  there needs to be at least 35 students, for example, of a subgroup in a  school. The law says the Secretary may not impose new requirements or  criteria on State accountability systems. Yet the regulation we are  seeking to overturn says States must pick a number below 30 or States  will have to explain themselves to the Secretary. That is in violation  of a specific prohibition passed by this body with 85 votes and signed  by the President of the United States.   Those are seven ways the regulation specifically violates  prohibitions in the law that were intended to keep the Secretary from  doing what the Secretary then turned around and did.   Here are 16 more ways the regulation exceeds the authority of the  U.S. Department of Education. To some, this may seem minor. To some, it  may seem dull. It is not dull to me. I don't think it is dull to most  Senators. Article I of the Constitution isn't dull. We are elected to  write the laws, and anytime we turn over to somebody else--whether it  is the court, whether it is the executive branch--that constitutional  prerogative, we violate our oath, in my opinion.   No. 1, the regulation limits how States measure school quality or  student success. The law says States must include at least one measure  of school quality or student success that has to be ``valid, reliable,  comparable, and statewide.''   The Secretary cannot tell States what measures to use in their State  accountability system. Yet the regulation tells States they can only  choose indicators that meet the criteria the Department came up with.   No. 2, the regulation limits how States measure school quality or  student success for indicators used specifically in high school.   The law says States must include at least one measure of school  quality or student success, specific to high schools, and it has to be  ``valid, reliable, comparable, and statewide.'' The Secretary cannot  tell States what measures to use in their State accountability system.  Yet the regulation tells States they can only choose indicators that  meet criteria the Department came up with.   No. 3, the regulation tells schools marked as low-performing that  they will always be low-performing unless they improve on indicators  the U.S. Department of Education has identified.   The law says something different. The law says that tests and  graduation rates have to count more in the State accountability systems  than indicators of school quality or student success. The Secretary of  Education may not prescribe ``the weight of any measure or indicator  used to identify or meaningfully differentiate schools.''  [[Page S1668]]    The regulation says that a low-performing school must continue to be  identified as low-performing unless it improves on tests and graduation  rates, even if the school is making significant progress on other  measures of school quality or student success, such as, for example,  absenteeism or family engagement, something chosen by the State.   No. 4, the regulation requires school districts where schools aren't  testing 95 percent of students to develop and implement a Federal  improvement plan.   The law says States must annually test not less than 95 percent of  all students and each subgroup of students. The law leaves it to States  to determine what to do in school districts with schools that are  failing to meet the participation requirement. Yet the regulation tells  States how to address school districts where schools aren't testing 95  percent of students. It invents out of whole cloth the idea of a  Federal improvement plan, and then it mandates it.   No. 5, similarly, the regulation requires schools that aren't testing  95 percent of students to develop and implement a Federal improvement  plan.   The law says that States must annually test not less than 95 percent  of all students and each subgroup of students. The law leaves it to  States to determine what to do in schools that are failing to meet the  participation requirement. Yet the regulation tells States how to  address schools that aren't testing 95 percent of students.   Again, it invents out of whole cloth the idea of a Federal  improvement plan with four federally prescribed elements, and then it  mandates it.   No. 6, the regulation tells States how to measure high school  graduation rates.   The law says each State will establish long-term goals for ``all  students and each subgroup of students in the State,'' including the  goal of high school graduation rates using either the ``four-year  adjusted cohort graduation rate'' or ``at the State's discretion, the  extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.'' Yet the regulation  says States can only use the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate  to identify low-performing schools in their accountability systems.   You can see that throughout these examples there appears to be a  deliberate attempt by the Department of Education not to interpret the  law but to ignore the law or, specifically, to contravene the law, to  thumb the nose of regulation writers at the Congress and the President  who passed and signed the law.   No. 7, the regulation requires each State to come up with a  definition for an ``ineffective teacher.'' The law says each State will  describe how low-income and minority children enrolled in schools are  not served at disproportionate rates by ineffective teachers. Yet the  regulations says States have to define ``ineffective teachers.'' It is  going to make it nearly impossible for States not to implement an  entire teacher evaluation system.   No. 8, in the same way, the regulation requires each State to come up  with a definition of an ``out-of-field teacher.''   That is what the regulation does, but the law just says States will  describe how low-income and minority children enrolled in schools are  not served at disproportionate rates by ``out-of-field teachers.'' The  regulation says you have to define that.   No. 9, the regulation requires each State to come up with a  definition for an ``inexperienced teacher.''    The law simply says a State will describe how low-income and minority  children are not served at disproportionate rates by ``inexperienced  teachers.'' Yet the regulation goes on to require a definition.   No. 10, the regulation tells States to report on the number and  percentage of all students and subgroups of students who are not  included in the State's accountability system.   The law says each State will report a clear and concise description  of the State's accountability system, including the minimum number of  students that the State determines are necessary to be included in each  of the subgroups of students. Yet the regulation requires States to  provide new information outside of the scope of what is required by the  law.   No. 11, the regulation tells States how to rate schools and that the  State accountability system has to produce a single rating for each  school.   That was not envisioned by the law. The law says that States must  create a system of evaluating all public schools in the State. It says,  further, that the Secretary of Education may not prescribe the specific  methodology used by States to evaluate schools. Yet the regulation  tells States that the results must lead to a ``single summative  determination'' for each school.   A State might choose to do that or a State might choose not to do  that. That was the decision of the Congress, but the Department decided  differently.   No. 12, the regulation adds a requirement that the State's  accountability system has to include at least three levels of  performance.   The law says that States have the flexibility to establish a system  of meaningful differentiation of schools without any parameters or  federally prescribed methodology. That couldn't be clearer--without any  parameters or federally described methodology. Yet the regulation  prescribes a requirement that States use at least three distinct levels  of performance for schools.   No. 13, the regulation prescribes when schools may exit from  identification as the lowest-performing.   The law says States must establish statewide criteria for schools to  exit from being identified as in need of improvement. The law says that  the Secretary of Education may not prescribe what the exit criteria  are. That is a decision left up to States, but the regulation narrows  the States' ability to develop their own criteria for schools to no  longer be identified as the lowest performing.   No. 14, the regulation prescribes how States intervene in school  districts with schools that are labeled as the lowest-performing. The  law says that if a low-performing school does not meet a State's  criteria for no longer being identified as lowest-performing, then the  State must take a ``more rigorous State-determined action.'' The  Secretary of Education cannot prescribe, under the law, any specific  strategies to improve schools. Yet the regulation requires the State to  tell school districts to take interventions the Department has  prescribed.   No. 15, the regulation prescribes how school districts intervene in  schools that are labeled as low-performing.   The law says if a low-performing school does not meet statewide  criteria for no longer being identified as lowest-performing, the State  must take a ``more rigorous State-determined action.'' The Secretary  cannot prescribe any specific strategies to improve schools. Yet the  regulation requires a school to take federally prescribed actions.   We have already tried Federal one-size-fits-all actions under the  School Improvement Grant program in No Child Left Behind. We rejected  that. We don't think Washington should be in the business of telling  schools how to fix themselves.   Finally, No. 16, the regulation limits how States award school  improvement funding to school districts and schools.   The law says States must establish the method they will use to award  school improvement funding to school districts. The regulation dictates  to States how much they have to award to low-performing schools  receiving school improvement funds.   Here is what this resolution overturning the regulation would do. The  resolution would ensure that the law fixing No Child Left Behind is  implemented as Congress wrote it. The regulation violates the law and  its clear prohibitions on the Secretary by prescribing new requirements  through regulation or as a condition of a State plan approval.   In the law we passed, Congress reached an agreement about requiring  States to identify a certain number and types of schools that need to  be improved, but we left it to the States to determine how to go about  fixing those schools and how long they had to fix the schools. The  regulation prescribes how States and school districts intervene in and  improve schools that do not improve.   Secondly, this resolution restores State flexibility. The regulation  is in direct conflict with the intent of the law to allow States and  school districts  [[Page S1669]]  to have greater flexibility to implement the law, as Congress intended.   Congress reached an agreement that there are some essential elements  of a State accountability plan that need to be included in a State  plan. The other half of the agreement was that we left to the States  the decisions about how to include these factors into their  accountability systems. This is about article I of the Constitution.   Congress wrote the law with specific rules in mind. The Secretary of  Education and his or her bureaucracy do not get to treat Congress as a  minor impediment to the education system of their choosing. If they  want to write the laws of the land, they should run for Congress and  get themselves elected, draft a bill or an amendment--not wait for  Congress to finish our work and try to undo it through a simple  regulation.   This resolution, overturning the regulation, would preserve local  decision-making. As I mentioned, the Wall Street Journal editorialized,  when we passed the law, that it was ``the largest devolution of Federal  control to States in a quarter-century.''   The regulation tried to restore Washington, DC, decision-making with  mandates that States comply with specific requirements instead of  letting States determine how to best proceed.   This resolution scuttles new and burdensome reporting requirements.  The regulation created new reporting requirements on States and school  districts that will drive up compliance costs and divert resources away  from students and classrooms.   Let me conclude by dealing with some of the arguments and  misinformation that I have been hearing about the resolution. No. 1, I  want to make clear that this resolution overturning the regulation  strengthens accountability in our public schools the way Congress  determined to do it in the law fixing No Child Left Behind.   We transferred most of that responsibility for accountability from  Washington, DC, to States and local school boards. We did not want a  national school board.   The law also includes Federal guardrails to ensure a quality, public  education for all students, including, for example, requiring States to  identify and provide support to low-performing schools--at least the  lowest performing bottom 5 percent of each State's schools--and  requiring academic and English language proficiency indicators to be  included in each State's accountability system. The law's Federal  guardrails will shape how States design their accountability systems  because a State plan would not be following the law if the State fails  to include accountability provisions in their plan.    The repeal of this regulation does not let States--the ones who are  supposed to be addressing accountability--off the hook by any means.  Repealing this regulation simply ensures that individual States and  their Governors, legislators, chief State school officers, local school  boards, superintendents, principals, parents, and classroom teachers  are responsible for these decisions.   This resolution, overturning the regulation, will allow States to  implement the new law on the existing timeline to submit their plans  and have the Department review and approve State plans.   U.S. Education Secretary DeVos has said that she favors the current  timeline, the one established by former Secretary King. She said this  at her confirmation hearing before our committee. She confirmed that  again after taking office.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Secretary DeVos's letter  of February 10 to the Chief State School Officers outlining the  timeline be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  February 10, 2017.        Dear Chief State School Officer: Thank you for the       important work you and stakeholders in your State are engaged       in to develop new State plans and transition to the Every       Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which reauthorized the       Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). I am       writing today to assure you that I fully intend to implement       and enforce the statutory requirements of the ESSA.       Additionally, I want to provide you with an update on the       timeline, procedures, and criteria under which a State       Educational Agency (SEA) may submit a State plan, including a       consolidated State plan, to the Department. States should       continue to follow the timeline for developing and submitting       their State plans to the Department for review and approval.        On November 29, 2016, the Department issued final       regulations regarding statewide accountability systems and       data reporting under Title I of the ESEA, as amended by the       ESSA, and the preparation of State plans, including       consolidated State plans. However, in accordance with the       memorandum of January 20, 2017, from the Assistant to the       President and Chief of Staff, titled ``Regulatory Freeze       Pending Review,'' published in the Federal Register on       January 24, 2017, the Department has delayed the effective       date of regulations concerning accountability and State plans       under the ESSA until March 21, 2017, to permit further review       for questions of law and policy that the regulations might       raise. Additionally, Congress is currently considering a       joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional       Review Act (CRA) (5 U.S.C. 801808) to overturn these       regulations. If a resolution of disapproval is enacted, these       regulations ``shall have no force or effect.''        In a Dear Colleague Letter dated November 29, 2016, the       Department notified SEAs that it would accept consolidated       State plans on two dates: April 3 or September 18, 2017. The       Department also released a Consolidated State Plan Template       that States were required to use if they submit a       consolidated State plan. Due to the regulatory delay and       review, and the potential repeal of recent regulations by       Congress, the Department is currently reviewing the       regulatory requirements of consolidated State plans, as       reflected in the current template, to ensure that they       require only descriptions, information, assurances, and other       materials that are ``absolutely necessary'' for consideration       of a consolidated State plan, consistent with section       8302(b)(3) of the ESEA. In doing so, the Department, in       consultation with SEAs as well as other State and local       stakeholders, will develop a revised template for       consolidated State plans that meets the ``absolutely       necessary'' requirement by March 13, 2017. The Department may       also consider allowing a State or group of States to work       together to develop a consolidated State plan template that       meets the Department's identified requirements through the       Council of Chief State School Officers.        The regulatory delay and review, and the potential repeal       of recent regulations by Congress, should not adversely       affect or delay the progress that States have already made in       developing their State plans and transitioning to the ESSA.       The Department will be notifying States and the public of the       revised template once it becomes available. In the meantime,       States should continue their work in engaging with       stakeholders and developing their plans based on the       requirements under section 8302(b)(3) of the ESEA. In doing       so, States may consider using the existing template as a       guide, as any revised template will not result in       descriptions, information, assurances, or other materials       that States will be required to provide other than those       already required under the ESEA. The Department will still       accept consolidated State plans on April 3 or September 18,       2017.        For your reference, the following programs may be included       in a consolidated State plan:        Title I, part A: Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local       Educational Agencies;        Title I, part C: Education of Migratory Children;        Title I, part D: Prevention and Intervention Programs for       Children and Youth Who Are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk;        Title II, part A: Supporting Effective Instruction;        Title III, part A: English Language Acquisition, Language       Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act;        Title IV, part A: Student Support and Academic Enrichment       Grants;        Title IV, part B: 21st Century Community Learning Centers;       and        Title V, part B, subpart 2: Rural and Low-Income School       Program.        In addition, pursuant to ESEA section 8302(a)(1)(B), I am       designating the Education for Homeless Children and Youths       program under subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento       Homeless Assistance Act as a program that may be included in       an SEA's consolidated State plan.        I appreciate the hard work and thoughtful attention you are       giving to implementing the ESEA, as amended by the ESSA. I       understand that a great deal of work has already gone into       the planning and preparation of your State plans, whether       that is a consolidated State plan or individual program       plans. One of my main priorities as Secretary is to ensure       that States and local school districts have clarity during       the early implementation of the law. Additionally, I want to       ensure that regulations comply with the requirements of the       law, provide the State and local flexibility that Congress       intended, and do not impose unnecessary burdens. In the near       future, the Department will provide more information on its       review of existing regulations, as well as additional       guidance and technical assistance.        We have a unique opportunity as we implement the ESSA. I       look forward to working with you, districts, and parents to       ensure every child has the opportunity to pursue excellence       and achieve their hopes and dreams.            Sincerely,                                                       Betsy DeVos.   [[Page S1670]]          So there is no confusion, let me clearly state what  that timeline is. No. 1, States should continue to submit State  accountability plans by the April or September 2017 deadlines. No. 2,  States should continue to implement a State accountability system in  the 2017-2018 school year. No. 3, States should continue to identify  the lowest performing schools in need of comprehensive support and  improvement by the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year.   To write these plans, States need simply to consult the law. The  Every Student Succeeds Act requires States to submit a plan for peer  review and approval by Secretary DeVos and the Education Department.  The Department is committed to working with States by providing  technical assistance, issuing non-regulatory guidance and other support  materials.   If questions arise, there are a variety of ways to answer the  questions. The Department will continue to provide States with  clarification on how to comply with the law through the use of non- regulatory guidance, ``Dear Colleague'' letters, frequently asked  questions documents, webinars, phone calls, and in-person conferences.  In other words, if there are any questions about how to comply with the  new law, there are plenty of ways for Chief State School Officers and  others to ask the U.S. Department of Education to provide the answers.   It is important to emphasize that this resolution does not in any way  give the Education Secretary a path to creating a new Federal voucher  program. Some of my friends on the other side of this debate have been  resorting to scare tactics and alleging Secretary DeVos will use this  opportunity to regulate into existence a mandate that State and local  school districts adopt a school voucher program. The Secretary of  Education does not have that power, and this Secretary of Education has  said she does not want it. Secretary DeVos has repeatedly affirmed her  opposition to federally mandating school choice, saying that she does  ``not and will not advocate for any Federal mandates requiring  vouchers. States should determine the mechanism of choice, if any.''   A school choice program cannot be unilaterally created by the U.S.  Department of Education. Only Congress could create a voucher program.  I tried to do that on the floor of this Senate during the debate about  fixing No Child Left Behind. I offered an amendment called Scholarships  for Kids that would have allowed States to use existing Federal dollars  to follow the children of low-income families to schools of their  parents' choice. Senator Scott of South Carolina offered a similar  amendment, but only 45 Senators voted for our proposals. If you pay  attention around here, you know that the most important things usually  take 60 votes to gain approval.   Also, the 2015 law that we passed actually includes provisions that  would prohibit the Secretary from mandating, directing, or controlling  a State, school district or school's allocation of State or local  resources, and it bars the Department of Education from requiring  States and districts to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for  under the law--for example, vouchers. Now I agree that previous  Secretaries of Education have imposed their own personal, policy  preferences on States and school districts. I opposed such mandates and  worked against them. Congress writes the law, not the Secretary and not  the bureaucracy.   Instead of using this scare tactic to rile up teachers and parents  around the country, misleading them and confusing them about what the  Secretary of Education might do, I would take that argument and turn it  around. If Congress takes a stand here and now and says that this  regulation exceeds the authority granted by Congress--the authority  delegated to the Secretary of Education--because the Secretary imposed  conditions on States not allowed by the law, then that means any  current or future Secretary of Education would be similarly prevented  from imposing their own conditions on States.   So there could be no legal method of forcing States to adopt a  voucher program, unless Congress passes a new law. There could be no  legal method of reinterpreting the Every Student Succeeds Act to impose  the next good education idea--however well-intended--unless Congress  acts first.   The suggestion has been made that this new law requires regulations.  This regulation is not required by the law. The law does not  specifically call for accountability regulations. The law allows for  accountability regulations, but ``only to the extent that such  regulations are necessary to ensure that there is compliance.'' So  there is no requirement for this regulation. It is allowed, but it is  not required.   Congress wrote prohibitions on the Secretary so that States would not  be faced with a bunch of new mandates that ``add new requirements that  are inconsistent with or outside the scope'' or ``add new criteria that  are inconsistent with or outside the scope'' or are ``in excess of  statutory authority granted to the Secretary.'' That is what Congress  did. In the law, we laid out requirements for State plans. States can  simply follow the law. A regulation isn't necessary.   Future Secretaries will still be able to write regulations on this  subject. Under the Congressional Review Act, which is the procedure  under which we are operating, if Congress overturns a regulation--as I  hope it will in this case--the Department of Education is prevented  from making final a new regulation that is ``substantially the same''  as the overturned regulation, unless Congress passes a new law to  create an opportunity for that new regulation. But no court has defined  what ``substantially the same'' means. But the commonsense  interpretation of that is very simple: The Department simply can't turn  right around and do the same thing Congress has just overturned. It  could do something else by regulation, but it could not do precisely  that.   So this is a question of whether we are going to restore the national  school board that 85 Senators voted to reverse 15 months ago. And this  is also a question of whether you believe that the U.S. Congress writes  the law or the U.S. Department of Education writes the law. I believe  that under article I of our Constitution, the U.S. Congress writes the  law, and when signed by the President, then that is the law. The  regulations must stay within it, and that is especially true when  Congress has written explicit prohibitions about what a Secretary may  do and may not do.   The remarkable consensus around the bill fixing No Child Left Behind  was to reverse the trend to a national school board and restore to  States, to classroom teachers, and to parents the decisions about what  to do about their children in public schools. Teachers, Governors,  school boards, and parents were all are fed up with Washington telling  them so much about what to do with their children in 100,000 public  schools.   So this regulation, which contravenes the law specifically, goes to  the heart of the bill fixing No Child Left Behind, which received 85  votes here in the Senate. And this resolution to overturn that  regulation upholds the law that received ``aye'' votes from those 85  Senators. I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution and to  vote aye one more time.   I believe that overturning the regulation preserves the consensus and  the compromise that we achieved when we enacted the law fixing No Child  Left Behind.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record a copy of the Tennessee General Assembly's proclamation  recognizing the city of Kingsport, TN, centennial celebration.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            Kingsport Centennial         Whereas, it is fitting that the members of this legislative       body should pause in their deliberations to recognize and       honor those venerable communities of this State that are       marking special occasions in their histories; and        Whereas, the new city of Kingsport was incorporated in       1917, using the historical name of a nearby town that was       previously incorporated in 1822 but lost its charter after       the Civil War; and        Whereas, Kingsport is the first thoroughly diversified,       professionally planned, and privately financed city in       twentieth-century America; and        Whereas, Kingsport was the first city in Tennessee, and one       of the first in the nation, to adopt the ``model city       charter'' establishing a city manager form of government; and        Whereas, Kingsport was produced by the marriage of New       South philosophy and Progressivism, born at a time when       capitalists turned their attention to Southern Appalachia;       and        Whereas, the seeds planted in 1917 grew to become the       corporate headquarters of Eastman, a Fortune 300 company with       a significant global presence that has provided economic       opportunity for generations of Tennesseans; and        Whereas, early founders coined the term ``Kingsport       Spirit'' to describe the work ethic, can-do attitude, and       caring culture that are still widely prevalent today; and        Whereas, Kingsport continues to be a leader in innovation       and collaboration to redefine the economic future of       Tennessee and Tennesseans; and        Whereas, on this milestone occasion, it is fitting that we       recognize and honor the city of Kingsport and its residents:       Now, therefore,        I, Randy McNally, Speaker of the Senate of the One Hundred       Tenth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, at the       request of and in conjunction with Senator Jon Lundberg, do       hereby proclaim that we honor and commend the fine citizens       of Kingsport as they celebrate their city's centennial and       extend to them our best wishes for continued success and       prosperity in the future. Proclaimed in Nashville, Tennessee,       on this the 13th day of February 2017.                            ____________________
