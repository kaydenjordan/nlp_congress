 Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve policies that  will protect our planet, keep loved ones healthy, and preserve access  to clean air, water, and land for future generations.   Lately, there has been a relentless assault on the environmental  policies that were crafted to protect us, including the commonsense  prohibition of offshore drilling in the Atlantic. Despite the Defense  Department stating that offshore drilling may impede and hamper  military readiness activities, the American people were told that our  oceans were open for exploitation.   Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable. That is why, today, I introduced  the bipartisan Defend Our Coast Act with my friend, Congressman Walter  Jones of North Carolina. The Defend Our Coast Act will prohibit the  Department of the Interior from issuing leases for the exploration,  development, or production of oil and gas on the Outer Continental  Shelf in the mid-Atlantic.   Prior tragedies such as Deepwater Horizon's oil spill proved that  drilling accidents can be dangerous, expensive, and life-threatening.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you to bring the Defend Our Coast Act up for a  vote. Offshore drilling negatively impacts our coastal communities. It  is not worth the risk.   Let us commit ourselves to leaving the Earth a healthier and safer  place for future generations.                            ____________________
