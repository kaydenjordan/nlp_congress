 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Lisa  Romero-Muniz.   Not only was Lisa the mother to her son, Anthony, but she was also  known as a second mother to all the children she worked with. Lisa  attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1.   Lisa was a discipline secretary at Miyamura High School in Gallup,  New Mexico. The students she worked with remember her as a woman who  looked out for children dealing with personal issues and for never  turning her back on a kid who needed help.   Lisa would give anyone the last dime she had with no questions asked  and would treat everyone like they were family.   Lisa loved purses, Jason Aldean, and Las Vegas. She was always  smiling, outgoing, kind, and considerate.   Lisa is remembered as being incredibly generous and always wearing  her heart on her sleeve.   I would like to extend my condolences to Lisa Romero-Muniz' family  and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of  Nevada, and the whole country grieves with you.                            ____________________
