 Mr. President I strongly support the nomination of  Cecilia Rouse to chair the Council of Economic Advisors. Dr. Rouse's  career has focused on strengthening labor markets for American workers,  improving our education system, and addressing the structural  inequities that stand in the way of making the economy work for all  Americans. She brings exactly the right experience and expertise that  we need to help our Nation weather the economic storm caused by the  pandemic and build back better.   Dr. Rouse was one of the clearest voices on the problem of long-term  unemployment following the last recession. The discussions that my  colleagues and I have already had with Dr. Rouse make clear that she  remains focused on helping workers who lost their jobs get back to work  as the economy recovers it and, going forward, on preventing the  problem of chronic long-term unemployment that we saw even before the  pandemic.   If confirmed, Dr. Rouse would be the first African-American and the  fourth woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisors in its 74 year  history. She has been a strong leader in academia and government, and I  urge my colleagues to support her confirmation.                         Vote on the Rouse Nomination     Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for  the confirmation of Governor Gina Raimondo, an experienced and  dedicated public servant, to be Secretary of the Department of  Commerce. I believe Gina Raimondo's extensive leadership experience  serving the people of Rhode Island as Governor positions her well to  lead the Biden administration's ambitious agenda at the Department of  Commerce.   As Secretary of Commerce, Governor Raimondo will take on challenges  that directly affect my home State of Maryland. That starts with  fighting for an inclusive economy with shared prosperity that truly  works for everyone. The struggles of low-income and minority  communities hardest hit by the pandemic have shone a harsh light on  inequities ingrained in our economy. We must root out these structural  problems by supporting the work of vital institutions like the Minority  Business Development Agency and Economic Development Administration.  And small businesses will continue to need assistance for the remainder  of the COVID-19 pandemic and long afterward to ensure that we emerge  from this crisis with a more resilient economy. We also need to ensure  that the United States can compete in international trade by leveraging  the International Trade Administration's enforcement capabilities and  strengthen our manufacturing sector by harnessing the power of the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, located in  Gaithersburg. We must also support the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration's work to fight the devastating impact of climate change  and protect Maryland's Chesapeake Bay. Finally, we must improve and  depoliticize our census process, which still faces challenges of data  accuracy, quality, and protection.   I am confident in Gina Raimondo's ability to take on these urgent  challenges. I voted yes on her nomination and look forward to working  closely with her in the years ahead to build a resilient economy that  works for every American.                            ____________________
