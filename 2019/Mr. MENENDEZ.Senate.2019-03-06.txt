 Mr. President, today I rise to oppose the nomination of  Chad Readler to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.   I remember the 2018 campaign season, when so many Republicans  suddenly became the world's most passionate defenders of patients with  preexisting conditions. They told voters that never ever could they  even imagine doing anything that would weaken the protections that stop  health insurance companies from discriminating against people with  preexisting conditions.   Whether they be breast cancer survivors or children born with birth  defects or any of the tens of millions of Americans who manage chronic  conditions like diabetes or depression or high blood pressure, well,  Americans are about to find out whether my American colleagues meant a  word of what they said on the campaign trail. Americans will soon see  whether Republicans stand up for patients with preexisting conditions  or vote to confirm Chad Readler to the Ohio Sixth Circuit Court.   This nominee's record of threatening patients with preexisting  conditions is not up for debate. Chad Readler was the mastermind behind  the Trump administration's effort to strip away the core of the  Affordable Care Act--the principle that health insurance companies  cannot deny coverage or kick a patient off their policy just because of  their medical history.   On the campaign trail, President Trump spoke of protecting Americans  with preexisting conditions, but we now know that was just another lie.   Apparently, it wasn't enough for this administration to stop  defending the Affordable Care Act in court; the President sought to  attack it in court. Initially, the Trump administration struggled to  find someone at the Department of Justice willing to take on this  cause. In fact, three separate career attorneys at the Justice  Department refused to argue the administration's position in court. One  employee even resigned.   Chad Readler, the nominee we are voting on today, was more than happy  to take on this cruel and unjust cause. He became the chief architect  of the Trump administration's legal brief, challenging the very  constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's protections for people  with preexisting conditions. In other words, Chad Readler's legal brief  took the administration's effort to sabotage the Affordable Care Act to  a whole new level, threatening to bring us back to a time when health  insurance companies didn't have to cover cancer survivors, or  individuals with substance abuse disorder, or anyone who has ever  faced, ever confronted a health challenge in their life. How does  President Trump reward Chad Readler for leading this assault on  patients and their families? Well, the day after he filed this reckless  and morally repugnant legal brief, the President nominated him to serve  on the Sixth Circuit.   Now, let me tell you, I spent a lot of time crisscrossing New Jersey  over the past year, and I don't think I met a single constituent who  came up to me and said: Senator, what my family really needs you to do  is once again let health insurance companies deny us care. On the  contrary, I heard from and continue to hear from New Jerseyans who  depend on these protections. They can't even believe this is still an  issue.   Last summer, I spoke with a woman from Highland Park named Ann  Vardeman who told me she was diagnosed with PTSD after surviving a  sexual assault. Ann told me that health insurers shouldn't be able to  ``charge me more for something that is a horrible thing that happens to  millions of people in this country through absolutely no fault of their  own.'' Indeed, without the Affordable Care Act, there would be no  Federal health protections for survivors of sexual violence like her.   Perhaps one of my constituents--Anne Zavalick of Middlesex, NJ--said  it best when she wrote about her battle against bladder cancer. She  wrote:         It is crucial that I continue to receive scans to make sure       there is no recurrence of the cancer. . . . If I don't have       coverage for preexisting conditions, I will go bankrupt. . .       . Then I will probably die. So, yeah, this is kinda super       important to me, personally.    It should be personal to all of us. Everyone in this body should take  it personally when this administration attacks protections that 130  million Americans rely on for their health and financial security.   People remember what it was like before the Affordable Care Act, and  they don't want to go backward. They remember how a woman could be  denied coverage for maternity care or charged higher premiums simply  for being a woman. Today, being a woman is no longer a preexisting  condition. They remember how infants born with heart deformities could  hit lifetime caps within days of being born. Today, families don't have  to worry about lifetime caps. They remember how cancer survivors and  Americans with chronic conditions like diabetes or asthma lived in fear  of being denied coverage or dropped from their policies at a moment's  notice.   Today, patients are protected from discrimination, but they will not  be if the courts side with Chad Readler's shameful arguments on behalf  of this administration.   This issue is personal for millions of Americans across our country-- from 3.8 million in New Jersey, to 4.3 million in Georgia, to 4.8  million in Ohio, Mr. Readler's home State. All told, 130 million  Americans with preexisting conditions may suffer the consequences of  Mr. Readler's assault on the Affordable Care Act. These Americans are  not Democrats or Republicans or Independents; they are human beings  with a right to access affordable, quality healthcare.   Does this Senate really want to reward someone largely responsible  for endangering the coverage our constituents depend on with a lifetime  appointment to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals? I sure hope not.  That is not the kind of judgement we want on any court.   Last fall, we heard a lot of talk from Republicans about protecting  people with preexisting conditions. We know that actions speak louder  than words, and it is action that we need right now. We need every  Member of this body to stand up for the right of all Americans to get  quality healthcare coverage. We need every Member of this body to stand  up for the proposition that Americans cannot be discriminated against  in their healthcare coverage because of a preexisting condition. We  need every Member of this body to vote against the nomination of Chad  Readler for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
