 Madam President, like many Members of Congress who have  long supported efforts to help build an independent judiciary and  reduce public corruption and impunity in Guatemala, I have observed a  pattern of alarming actions by President Morales's administration and  his allies in Guatemala's Congress to thwart these efforts.   In the latest development, earlier this week, the Guatemalan Ministry  of Foreign Affairs withdrew the diplomatic immunity of 11 investigators  and other personnel of the International Commission against Impunity in  Guatemala, CICIG, and ordered them to leave the country. This followed  an announcement by the Minister of Interior of the removal of another  15 high-ranking police officials from their posts.   Over the years, the United States has invested many tens of millions  of dollars to support the national police, the attorney general's  office, and CICIG. These actions by the Morales's administration  directly undermine those investments and indicate that it cannot be  trusted to keep its word and is not serious about upholding the rule of  law.   Working jointly with the Attorney General's Office, CICIG has  investigated cases of public corruption and other serious crimes. It  has helped to strengthen the investigative capabilities of the attorney  general's office and the police and promoted key criminal justice  reforms. For this reason, CICIG, its commissioner, and the former  attorney general have been the target of acts of intimidation and a  smear campaign orchestrated by the Morales's administration and its  allies in the military and the media. These actions by the government  threaten CICIG' s independence and its ability to function effectively.  According to information I have received, the professionals whose  diplomatic immunity and visas were revoked include investigators and  lawyers involved in some of the most sensitive cases related to alleged  corruption and illicit campaign financing by top government officials.   Other actions by Guatemalan authorities are equally disturbing. Since  assuming office in January 2018, Minister of Interior Enrique Degenhart  has, on multiple occasions, removed or relocated senior national police  officers and detectives. Most of these officers had many years of  experience in criminal investigations, counternarcotics, and other  specialized areas. Most were trained by the United States. Even worse,  the Minister has reportedly appointed police officials with alleged  links to the military and promoted officers without transparent, merit- based processes, undermining efforts to build a professional,  transparent, and accountable police force. This threatens our ability  to continue working with the police, which has in the past been  infiltrated by organized crime, to combat narcotics trafficking, money  laundering, and other transnational criminal activity.   In 2009, working with key Guatemalan law enforcement agencies,  [[Page S8012]]  CICIG helped establish a wiretapping unit within the Attorney General's  Office. Prior to that, wiretaps were illegal. The unit, which has been  supported by the United States, has been instrumental in helping the  Attorney General investigate and dismantle complex criminal networks.  Reportedly, among the officers recently removed by Minister Degenhart  was the director of the wiretapping unit.   If we have learned anything over many years of trying to assist the  countries of Central America build the institutions of government  necessary to effectively combat corruption and impunity, it is that  without partners who care at least as much about these issues as we do  it is a fruitless exercise and a waste of U.S. taxpayers' money.   What is happening today in Guatemala is a repeat of what we have  observed many times before. New government officials take office, they  profess their commitment to democratic ideals, the rule of law, and  judicial independence, and then, when their own misdeeds become the  focus of criminal investigations, they show their true colors.   They ignore rulings by the country's highest courts. They seek to  replace magistrates who cannot be intimidated, with cronies who will  shield them from the law. They expel international prosecutors on  grounds of ``sovereignty.'' They threaten those whose job it is to  apply the law. They try to intimidate their political opponents. It is  the same sad story.   I recently met Constitutional Court Magistrate Gloria Patria Porras  Escobar, an experienced and internationally respected jurist and former  prosecutor known for her independence and courage. She, like others who  have honored their professions, is an example of what Guatemala needs;  yet she is being vilified by those who seek to subvert the institutions  of justice.   The people of Guatemala deserve better. They have demanded an end to  corruption, an end to impunity, and an end to public officials who care  more about enriching and protecting themselves than they do about  addressing the needs of their people. The Guatemalan people  overwhelming support the attorney general's office and CICIG, which  have, for the first time in the country's history, shown that public  officials who abuse their authority are not above the law.   President Morales's administration has less than a year left in  office. Let us hope that he quickly reverses course because the path he  is on will jeopardize further U.S. support for his government's  participation in the Alliance for Prosperity. Otherwise, we will have  no choice but to wait for a government in Guatemala that has the  integrity to be a credible partner of the United States.
