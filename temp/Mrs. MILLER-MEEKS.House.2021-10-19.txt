 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of an exceptional healthcare  [[Page H5645]]  professional in my district. Recently, Dr. Stuart Weinstein, the  Ignacio V. Ponseti chair and professor of orthopaedic surgery and  professor of pediatrics at the University of Iowa, was awarded the  Lifetime Achievement Award from the Scoliosis Research Society for his  incredible work studying pediatric spinal deformity.   Since joining the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University  of Iowa in 1976, Stu has worked to make our community and the whole  world a better place.   Stu has published over 250 scientific articles in some of the most  well-known and prestigious peer-reviewed journals. His research has  focused on spinal deformity in children and the natural history and  long-term outcome of pediatric musculoskeletal disorders.   Listing and discussing all of Stu's accomplishments would take much  longer than one minute, so I will close by saying how grateful I am to  have people like Stu living in Iowa's Second District. I also tell  anyone I meet that Iowa is the best place to live, work, and raise a  family. With outstanding citizens like Stu, we will continue to hold  that title.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to extend my enthusiasm with a happy  birthday to our colleague from California, the Honorable Young Kim.  Happy birthday to Young.                            ____________________
