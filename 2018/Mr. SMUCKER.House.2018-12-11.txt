 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and to honor  the young women of the Donegal Indians field hockey team, who won the  PIAA State championship this year, their second in 3 years.   The Donegal Indians held an impressive 28-1 season record, with 235  points scored and only 19 points scored against them. They can be  described in one word: dominating.   They finally met their match in the State championship game, where  they were scoreless through regulation. When the team needed to score,  they turned to one player, Captain Mackenzie Allessie, who holds the  national record for scoring in girls high school field hockey.   Mackenzie racked up an impressive 351 goals during her tenure at  Donegal. The last goal that Mackenzie scored lifted the Indians to  their second championship.   The team members' drive is a trait that will serve them well in the  future. I congratulate them, their coaches, and the community for their  victory. I wish them all continued success.                          Recognizing Casey Kaufhold     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the amazing  accomplishments of Ms. Casey Kaufhold, a 14-year-old freshman at  Conestoga Valley High School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.   Casey is a winner and a world record holder. Last month, she competed  with Olympic-class archers from around the world at the World Archery  Indoor Series GT Open in Luxembourg. She earned 589 out of 600 possible  points to win the gold medal for this event and set a world record for  the highest score earned by an archer under the age of 17 during  competition.   We are all incredibly proud of Casey's achievements, and we are  looking forward to all that is in store for her in the future, which I  believe will be as a future Olympian. And if she does so, she will  represent our Nation well. We wish her continued success in all of her  endeavors.                          Recognizing Linn Moedinger     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a man synonymous with  railroading in Lancaster County: Mr. Linn Moedinger.   After 51 years--51 years--working for the Strasburg Rail Road, Linn  is retiring as president of the Strasburg Rail Road Company.   Strasburg Rail Road was founded in 1832. It is the oldest  continuously operating railroad in the Western Hemisphere. After 125  years of declining revenue, 24 individuals, including Linn's parents,  decided to buy the railroad.   Today, it is a top tourist destination in the district that I  represent. They brought new life to Strasburg Rail Road, turning it  into a tourist railroad and helping educate and entertain thousands of  visitors in our community each year.   Linn took his first paying job at the Strasburg Rail Road when he was  17. He cleaned the restrooms. Year after year, his responsibilities  increased and so did his love for the railroad.   Linn was named president in 2000 and has overseen great expansion of  the Strasburg Rail Road, and it is a historical marker in the State of  Pennsylvania.   Thank you to Linn for his many years of service, and I wish him all  the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
