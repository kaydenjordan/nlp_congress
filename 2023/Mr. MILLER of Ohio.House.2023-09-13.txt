 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Katja Bullock. If I could summarize Katja's life into two words, they  would be compassion and service.   I met Katja while working for the Trump administration. From the  moment I met her, she took me under her wing. As she did for so many  and for those who knew her, they knew that is what she would do.   She always made sure that I had a seat at the table every Sunday  dinner and had a place to go for every single holiday.   When visiting her home, you would be mesmerized by the countless  number of photos and artifacts she had from 50-plus years of service  working for a Senator, two Maryland Governors, and most notably, the  last four Republican Presidents.   Katja's remarkable journey began in war-torn Germany and culminated  in her undisputed status as a legend in Republican politics.   Her life was the definition of living the American Dream. I am  blessed to have been just a small part of it.    God bless you, Katja. We love you. We miss you.                            ____________________
