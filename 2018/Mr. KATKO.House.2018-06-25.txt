Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5081, the Surface  Transportation Security and Technology Accountability Act of 2018.   America's transportation sector has long been, and continues to be, a  top target for terrorism. In addition to persistent threats to  aviation, terrorists continue to see surface transportation as soft  targets that can yield high numbers of casualties.   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective  Security, I have held numerous hearings, briefings, and roundtables  dedicated to providing congressional oversight of the Transportation  Security Administration's role in surface transportation security.   The U.S. surface transportation system is a dynamic, interconnected  network of passenger and freight railroads, mass transit systems, over- the-road bus operators, motor carrier operators, pipelines, and  maritime facilities. These systems are the bedrock of the American  economy and way of life, which is precisely why they are such  attractive targets for terrorists.   In addition to a number of horrific attacks against surface targets  by terrorists overseas, we have recently experienced an attempted  suicide bombing in New York City's Port Authority Bus Terminal. This  attack was the first attempted suicide bombing on American soil and  represented a startling shift in the threat landscape.   Luckily, this incident only yielded injury to the would-be attacker.  However, it served as an important reminder that we must be prepared to  respond to threats in all modes of transportation.   While TSA is responsible for securing all of America's transportation  systems, surface transportation security has been consistently  overshadowed by the amount of attention and resources dedicated to  aviation security.   This imbalance is aptly illustrated by the glaring absence of surface  transportation at TSA's ``Strategic Five-Year Technology Investment  Plan'' as well as the ``Biennial Refresh.''   The plan is a key communication tool for TSA to help stakeholders  understand the agency's priorities and to enable them to align  investments and product investment initiatives accordingly.   I would like to reiterate that TSA is responsible for securing all of  America's transportation systems, and that surface transportation is a  key and integral element of that mission.   TSA does not procure technology for local surface transportation  operators, but it does set the standards for viable security  technologies and equipment for that environment. Therefore, investments  related to research, development, testing, and evaluation of security  technologies for surface transportation systems should be included in  TSA's ``Strategic Five-Year Technology Investment Plan.''   My legislation will enhance the visibility of the surface  transportation sector and ensure that TSA is positioned to address  emerging threats through this critical infrastructure, which serves  more than 10 billion riders in the United States annually.   My bill authorizes the establishment of a Surface Transportation  Security Advisory Committee that will provide stakeholders the  opportunity to coordinate with TSA and comment on policy and pending  regulations.   The Surface Transportation Security Advisory Committee is a necessary  and long-overdue complement to the Aviation Security Advisory  Committee,  [[Page H5627]]  which has been a critical resource for the agency and stakeholders, and  has led to a number of improvements in aviation security, as well as  TSA processes.   Additionally, this bill explicitly directs TSA to expand the scope of  its technology investment plan to incorporate investments related to  surface transportation security and air cargo security.   My bill will signal to TSA that this committee takes its oversight of  all transportation modes seriously and that the security of surface  transportation modes should be a higher priority for the agency.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the ranking member of the  Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee, Mrs. Watson  Coleman, for cosponsoring this legislation and for her dedication to  securing all modes of transportation.   I also wish to thank Chairman McCaul for his support of this bill and  for ensuring its swift markup at committee.   Whether we talk about mass transit, passenger rail, buses, trucking,  freight rail, or pipelines, I understand that surface transportation is  of critical importance to all our communities, including my home  district in central New York. For that reason, I urge all of my  colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Rhode  Island for his kind words about this bill and for the bipartisanship  that pervades our committee. It is a model, I think, that, Congress- wide, we could use more of. The bipartisanship that we have on this  committee really is helping to keep America safer.   Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5730) to require testing and evaluation of advanced  transportation security screening technologies related to the mission  of the Transportation Security Administration, and for other purposes,  as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5730, the  Transportation Security Technology Innovation Reform Act of 2018. This  legislation represents a culmination of years of bipartisan oversight  efforts by the Homeland Security Committee and, more specifically, the  Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security, which I chair.   My committee colleagues and I have seen, firsthand, the challenges  facing TSA in delivering advanced security technologies to the front  lines at airports. Technologies such as Computed Tomography and  Credential Authentication Technology are years behind where they should  be in deployment due to unnecessary delays, opaque testing timelines,  and capacity challenges at TSA.   What is even more frustrating is that these technologies, made by  American companies, are already deployed at a number of airports  overseas in foreign countries, while our own government cannot  efficiently test and deploy these already-proven technologies.   For far too long we have seen the traveling public wait for cutting- edge technologies while bureaucratic hindrances and government  inefficiencies plague TSA's testing and evaluation process. Today, the  House has the opportunity to pass a solution to this problem.   H.R. 5730 will reform and galvanize efforts to bring 21st-century  solutions to persistent security challenges facing America's  transportation systems. Specifically, this legislation will authorize  the core functions of the TSA Systems Integration Facility, or TSIF for  short.   The TSIF will be charged with conducting efficient and transparent  testing of critical security technologies in a manner that is  responsive to stakeholders and the needs of the traveling public.   One key problem that I often hear from technology stakeholders is  that TSA does not have the bandwidth or resources to efficiently  conduct testing and evaluation of new screening technologies in a  timely manner.   This legislation will ensure that adequate staffing and resources are  allocated to the TSIF, and that TSA is authorized to collaborate with  outside laboratories and stakeholders to expedite the much-needed  testing of these technologies.   Further, this legislation provides significant accountability by  requiring TSA to share test plans with original equipment manufacturers  in order to ensure the integrity and consistency of testing and  evaluation processes. The bill includes specific metrics for reporting  to Congress and stakeholders on delays in testing so that there is  greater visibility into potential bureaucratic hiccups.   H.R. 5730 directs the TSA Administrator to conduct a wholesale  evaluation of the agency's testing and acquisition processes and  identify areas that can be streamlined and improved. This legislation  emphasizes the agency's need to engage and leverage other government  agencies, transportation stakeholders, and small businesses, to more  effectively and expeditiously deploy critical security technologies.   Mr. Speaker, the Transportation Security Technology Innovation Reform  Act of 2018 cuts straight to the heart of the problems plaguing TSA,  and directly addresses issues identified by stakeholders.   As any of my committee colleagues can tell you, the threats facing  transportation security now are more severe and more troubling than  ever, and our ability to effectively mitigate these threats with  advanced technology is of the utmost importance.   I wish to thank my friend, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Transportation and Protective Security, Mrs. Watson Coleman, whose  partnership and leadership on this issue has been critical to bringing  this bill to the floor today.   I also would like to thank the full committee chairman, Mr. McCaul,  for his support of the bill and for shepherding it through the  committee process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    First of all, I want to thank my colleague from Rhode Island for his  comments in support of this bill as well, and shepherding it through  the process here today on the floor.   I will note--and I want to digress for a moment. We went on a  congressional delegation. I led that delegation to Europe and the  Middle East several months ago, and it was a bipartisan effort to  evaluate the technologies in use at other airports in Europe and in the  Middle East. And it was stunning for us to go to those airports and see  American-made computed tomography, or 3-D scanners, already on the  front lines, already doing the job, already making those airports much  safer than ours are today, and those products are made here in the  United States.   It is maddening that we had this bureaucratic bottleneck of testing  procedures and algorithms and everything else, while the front lines  are not being addressed. So this bill attempts to address that backlog,  and I am very proud to have been a sponsor of it.   Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am prepared to close once  the gentleman from Rhode Island does. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   To use an old saying that I like to use, TSA seems to be engaged in  the practice of polishing the brass while the fire bell is ringing; and  the fire bell is, indeed, ringing with the bad guys trying to get scary  technology through our security measures in order to do harm to the  American people. And the technologies that are already existing out  there are not being put on the front line, and that is a shame. This  bill attempts to address that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5766) to improve the security of public areas of transportation  facilities, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5766         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5766, the Securing Public  Areas of Transportation Facilities Act of 2018. This legislation will  improve security coordination among transportation stakeholders by  establishing a working group between the Department of Homeland  Security and public and private stakeholders to develop recommendations  for enhancing public area security of transportation facilities.   H.R. 5766 directs that the working group focus on key areas including  information sharing, interoperable communications, incident response,  and the prevention of terrorist attacks through strategic planning and  security exercises. Taking steps to improve upon these critical  components to security preparedness and resiliency is directly  correlated to America's ability to mitigate the constantly-evolving  threat to our transportation system.   The traveling public must be secure in all modes of transportation  security, and the millions of Americans who utilize surface  transportation networks every single day to travel to work and school  rely upon strong Federal, State, local, and private sector  collaboration.   Over the last several years we have seen a marked increase in attacks  to public areas of transportation networks. From airports like LAX in  Los Angeles, Fort Lauderdale, Istanbul, Brussels, to mass transit hubs  in New York City, London, Madrid and Belgium, we have witnessed  horrific scenes of attack in crowded public spaces of transportation  systems.   I am glad this bill seeks to improve upon the resiliency,  preparedness, and overall security infrastructure of these networks,  which are absolutely crucial to our economy and the American way of  life.   The free movement of people and goods across the United States must  never be stymied by violent extremism. That is why it is incumbent upon  those of us in Congress to ensure that Homeland Security and TSA are  doing all they can to promote effective collaboration among the litany  of stakeholders charged with securing the traveling public.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for  his focus on this important issue. I also thank the chairman of the  full committee, Mr. McCaul, for seeing this bill through the markup  process.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Rhode  Island for supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, my time on the Homeland Security Committee  over the past 3\1/2\ years has been a true testament to bipartisanship:  trying to get the right things done, putting aside political  differences to keep the country as safe and secure as we possibly can.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support the bill of my colleague from  New Jersey (Mr. Payne). I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
