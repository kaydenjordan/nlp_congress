 Madam President, first, let me thank Senator Murkowski  for her leadership on behalf of women's issues here in the U.S. Senate.  I join her in calling for the reauthorization of the Violence Against  Women's Act. I am glad that she mentioned that. I join her as her  partner in the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. We have to  pass a resolution here extending the date. Senator Murkowski has been a  leader on all these issues.   During Women's History Month, I am using this time to point out the  progress we have made. Senator Murkowski mentioned that we have made  tremendous progress on behalf of gender equality in the United States,  but we still have a path in front of us. I was pleased to see Senator  Murkowski point out the challenges that still exist and the reason why  we need to be active in regard to gender equity issues, including the  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and the passage of  the Equal Rights Amendment. So I thank her for her leadership, and I am  glad to be her partner on many of these issues.   So today, we can celebrate the progress that has been made and call  attention to the obstacles that exist. Throughout our Nation's history,  generations of women have won hard-fought battles in pushing closer and  closer toward securing full citizenship and all that entails.   Our Nation today is stronger from this progress, reaching new  milestones in gender equality. President Biden announced earlier this  month his historic selection of Judge Jackson to fill the role of the  retiring Supreme Court Justice Breyer on the highest Court in our land.  Judge Jackson would be the first Black woman to serve on the Court and  only the fifth woman to serve as a Justice of the total of 115 who have  served on the Supreme Court throughout our history.   I was pleased, along with Senator Van Hollen, to recommend Lydia  Griggsby to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of  Maryland. She is the first Black female judge to serve in the State of  Maryland.   Yes, we have a lot to celebrate during Women's History Month here in  March.   During President Biden's recent State of the Union Address, which I  attended, I was struck by the image of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and  Vice President Kamala Harris flanking President Biden. Vice President  Harris is our first woman and first woman of color to hold the second  highest office in the land. Though they undoubtedly both experienced  significant challenges and obstacles on their career path due to their  gender, they are now serving in two of the highest ranking offices in  our government.   President Biden has appointed one of the most diverse Cabinets in  history, including the first women to serve as Treasury Secretary and  Director of National Intelligence.   We have a lot to celebrate on our path for gender equality in  America, but we still have more that needs to be done.   At the same time, structural disadvantages and inequalities on  account of gender persist across so many areas here in America. As one  example, as chair of the Small Business Entrepreneurship Committee,  where the Presiding Officer also serves, I have been working over the  course of the COVID-19 pandemic to understand the economic effects on  small businesses and to help provide needed resources. In this role, I  have seen firsthand the structural disadvantages experienced by women- owned small businesses and how they have been compounded by the  challenges of this pandemic. We need to take action to help in regard  to that issue.   Further, the Supreme Court actions to date in cases related to  reproductive freedom indicate an alarming openness to overturning the  precedents that have given women control over their own bodies and  futures for decades. Among many other very important reasons, full  reproductive autonomy is essential in ensuring that women are able to  participate fully as citizens in all facets of our democracy.    I am pleased that President Biden established the first Gender Policy  Council to advance gender equity across the entire Federal Government  and that the Gender Policy Council issued the first-ever national  gender strategy to support the full participation of all people,  including women and girls in the United States and around the world.   Yes, we have unfinished business in regard to gender equity issues. I  am committed to working to advance the Equal Rights Amendment that  Senator Murkowski talked about. The two of us are the lead sponsors of  the resolution in this body that would remove the arbitrary time limit.   This simple amendment, the Equal Rights Amendment, first written by  Alice Paul in 1923, states:         Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or       abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.       The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate       legislation, the provisions of this article.    I can't understand any objection to including that fundamental  protection in the Constitution of the United States.   As President Biden stated in his Presidential Proclamation during  this Women's History Month, ``But despite the progress being made,  women and girls--especially women and girls of color--still face  systemic barriers to full participation and wider gaps in opportunity  and equality . . . The Congress sent the Equal Rights Amendment to the  States for ratification 50 years ago and it is long past time that the  principle of women's equality should be enshrined in our  Constitution.''   And as Senator Murkowski said, the requisite number of States have  ratified the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution. The arbitrary  time limit that was put on by Congress is the only reason we haven't  had a certification process.   The vast majority of Americans agree with this principle today. A  2020 AP poll found that 74 percent of Americans--74 percent--favor the  Equal Rights Amendment. A second spring poll conducted by Pew found  that 78 percent of respondents were in support of adding women to the  Constitution. In a nation as divided as ours has become, a principle  with this level of support on this important topic compels our  attention and our action.   Given that so much has changed since this amendment was first written  and since it was first proposed by Congress to the States, it is worth  explaining some of the practical effects it  [[Page S1031]]  could have if formalized today. First, it would expand legal recourse  against gender discrimination. Second, it would empower those of us in  Congress to enact stronger laws preventing gender discrimination across  a wide array of issues. Third, it would require the Supreme Court--or  courts--to use a higher standard of review than is currently applied in  the cases of gender discrimination.   The ratification of the ERA could be expected to have effects across  such diverse areas as pay discrimination, LGBTQ rights, gender-based  and domestic violence, sexual harassment, and more. This constitutional  amendment would provide a firmer foundation for existing laws and  create new authority for Congress to pass laws in areas in which it has  historically lacked a constitutional prerogative.   Our Constitution is a framework of, by, and for the people. It must  be able to evolve to meet the changing views and beliefs of the people.  Already a majority of the U.S. Senate has cosponsored the bipartisan  resolution that I referred to, S.J. Res. 1, that Senator Murkowski and  I introduced to remove the procedural deadline that Congress once set  to honor the clear will of the people and to make the legitimacy of our  28th Amendment clear beyond a doubt.   The House of Representatives has already passed this resolution  twice. It is time for us to do the same. I look forward to the  opportunity to bring this resolution to the floor in the coming months  and would strongly urge every one of my colleagues to support that  resolution. Thirty-eight States have already ratified it. Most  Americans already think it is in our Constitution. Let's get that job  done.                     Bicentennial Birth of Harriet Tubman    Madam President, March 8, as has been pointed out, is International  Women's Day. It happens during the month of March, which is Women's  History Month, here in the United States.   I wish to commemorate the bicentennial birth of one of Maryland's  most iconic leaders, a true American hero who has inspired global human  rights' defenders, and that is Harriet Tubman.   As we close this year's chapter of Black History Month and ring in  Women's History Month, what better way to celebrate these annual  observances than by honoring the valor, journey, and life of Harriet  Tubman and her fight for freedom, which intersects with our modern-day  fight for civil rights, climate action, and environmental justice.   Harriet Tubman was born Araminta Ross in Dorchester County, MD, along  our Eastern Shore, around 1822. She was the ``Moses of her people,''  personally leading at least 70 enslaved people to freedom. She is a  cherished daughter of Maryland. She did this at great personal  sacrifice to her own safety and freedom on the Eastern Shore of  Maryland.   This year, in 2022, we observe the bicentennial of the start of her  life as a key leader in the abolition and women's suffrage movements.  She embodied extraordinary courage and took immeasurable risks as a  soldier, spy, and conductor on the Underground Railroad, leading her  family and communities to freedom. In an unjust country to her race,  she was there, working for America's future and helping to liberate the  enslaved people.   In Maryland, this year also marks the 5-year anniversary of the  Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center, which opened its  doors to the public in 2017. In its first year, it drew nearly 100,000  visitors from every State and more than 70 countries, exceeding all  expectations. It is inspirational to see this visitor center and to see  her journey through life and what she was able to accomplish. One  person can make a difference. As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., told us  frequently, ``Each one of us in this world can make a difference.''  Harriet Tubman made such a difference throughout her lifetime.   The visitor center houses exhibit space that shares Tubman's  compelling story, surrounded by landscape and waterways preserved to  resemble how they would have appeared to her over 200 years ago in her  early life as an enslaved child, young woman, and freedom seeker. The  Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument and National  Historical Park preserve these characteristics in her early home on  Maryland's Eastern Shore.   The visitor center serves as an orientation center to the national  monument and historical park and gateway to the larger Harriet Tubman  Underground Railroad Scenic Byway, which includes the Brodess Farm,  where Harriet Tubman lived as a child; Bucktown General Store, where  she first stood up against the oppressors as a young girl; and other  places that were part of the Underground Railroad in Dorchester,  Talbot, and Caroline Counties.   I recently introduced legislation with my colleagues in the Baltimore  congressional delegation, S. 3744, reauthorizing the designations of  the Baltimore National Heritage Area, which encompasses listings on the  Underground Railroad network.   Harriet Tubman was not only a fierce defender for freedom from  slavery but also for the women's rights movement, particularly for  Black women. Following her treacherous journey to freedom, Harriet  Tubman spoke on the importance of women's suffrage in New York,  Washington, and Boston. In 1896, she was one of the first guests to  speak at the National Association of Colored Women and was hailed a  strong advocate. Women secured the right to vote in 1920 with the 19th  Amendment, but it wasn't until 1965 that voting rights became a reality  for Black women.   Let me conclude my comments on Women's History Month by once again  quoting from President Biden.   As President Biden proclaimed Women's History Month this month, he  said:         As we reflect on the achievements of women and girls across       the centuries and pay tribute to the pioneers who paved the       way, let us recommit to the fight and help realize the deeply       American vision of a more equal society where every person       has a shot at pursuing the American dream. In doing so, we       will advance economic growth, our health and safety, and the       security of our Nation and the world.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now recess until 2:15 p.m.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:19 p.m., recessed until  2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Ms. Sinema).                            ____________________
