 Madam Speaker, some many years ago, with a bush as  big as a bush on my head, an Afro, of which I was enormously proud,  young, fragile ego, probably not that strong in my frame, some would  say, skinny legs and high heels, an early teen, trying to express the  pain that I felt, living in a segregated world, trying to assert the  prominence of my community, my race of people, trying to associate  belatedly with the foot soldiers and the battering and the insults that  they received, trying to come to grips with the assassination of Dr.  Martin Luther King, Bobby Kennedy, Malcolm X, I wore this bush, which I  had to do extreme things; for the original style, as was done to young  girls, is processed. It burned beyond recognition.   And I went out with my grandmother, a woman of tradition and, fearful  for me, she asked me to go back because she couldn't walk with me with  an Afro. The reason, of course, was her fear what an Afro signified,  what it would do, how I would be harmed. Those were the conflicts and  strife that Black people went through trying to come to grips with  their identity.   Madam Speaker, I say to my good friend, Mr. Jordan, we never  encounter each other because we have mutual respect, as I do for him,  and he does for Sheila Jackson Lee. We don't really get into it because  we know we are the kind of folk that stand down from each other. But I  enjoy engaging with the gentleman. I enjoy his leadership. And his  constituents have every right to be concerned about gas prices.   My constituents are concerned about eating, being able to pay their  rent. And I believe we can walk and chew gum at the same time. Let's  get together about gas prices, and paying rent, and people eating, and  having jobs, and ending discrimination. Why can't we do that together?   Because the gentleman has not walked in my skin. He has got to  understand what it means when we are talking about a report that has  been given. In 2019, the Joy Collective, the CROWN Act coalition: Black  people are disproportionately burdened by policies, and practices in  public places, including the workplace, that target, profile, or single  them out for their natural hairstyle.    The CROWN Study found that Black women's hair is  more policed in the workplace, thereby contributing to the climate of  group control.   Black women are more likely to receive formal grooming policies; and  80 percent of Black women believe that they had to change their hair to  be in the workplace.   Just imagine, just imagine the beauty of these hairstyles, Mr.  Jordan, the beauty of these hairstyles. This is what we are talking  about; people who are severely discriminated against, young boys, young  girls. A little girl in a Catholic school could not wear her hair, had  to go home.   Or the fabulous Serena, who gives joy to all of us and, yet, these  are the locs that she is wearing.    And this young boy, who, like me, felt diminished  because someone thought it was wrong for me, an Afro, for him, his  braided hair.   Mr. Jordan, we have engaged in a lot, but I will not stand down on  the CROWN Act. We must pass the CROWN Act to give dignity and reaffirm  the rights of all people. Wear your hair as you desire.   Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 2116, the Creating  a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act of 2021.   This legislation prohibits discrimination based on hair texture or  hairstyles if that style or texture is commonly associated with  particular race or national origin.   The bill also prohibits this type of discrimination against those  participating in federally assisted programs, housing programs, and  employment.   I have long believed that discrimination based on hair texture and  hairstyle is an impermissible form of race discrimination.   According to a 2019 report, known as the CROWN Study, which was  conducted by the JOY Collective (CROWN Act Coalition, Dove/Unilever,  National Urban League, Color of Change), Black people are  ``disproportionately burdened by policies and practices in public  places, including the workplace, that target, profile, or single them  out for their natural hair styles--referring to the texture of hair  that is not permed, dyed, relaxed, or chemically altered.''   The CROWN Study found that Black women's hair is ``more policed in  the workplace, thereby contributing to a climate of group control in  the company culture and perceived professional barriers'' compared to  non-Black women.   The study also found that ``Black women are more likely to have  received formal grooming policies in the workplace, and to believe that  there is a dissonance from her hair and other race's hair'' and that  ``Black women's hairstyles were consistently rated lower or `less  ready' for job performance.''   Among the study's other findings are that 80 percent of Black women  believed that they had to change their hair from its natural state to  ``fit in at the office,'' and that they were 83 percent more likely to  be judged harshly because of their looks.   The study indicated that Black women were one and a half times more  likely to be sent home from the workplace because of their hair, and  that they were over three times more likely to be perceived as  unprofessional compared to non-African American women.   Eight years ago, the United States Army removed a grooming regulation  preventing women servicemembers from wearing their hair in dreadlocks,  a regulation that had a disproportionately adverse impact on Black  women.   The decision was a result of the 2014 order by the Secretary of  Defense at the time, Chuck Hagel, who was reviewing the military's  policies regarding hairstyles popular to African American women.   This decision to review these policies came after complaints from  members of Congress, including myself, saying that these polices  unfairly targeted black women.   Hair discrimination is common, and the CROWN Study demonstrates that,  but I would also like to take the time to share numerous stories from  many Americans across the country in order to put faces and names to  these statistics.   In 2017, a Banana Republic employee was told by a manager that she  was violating the company's dress code because her box braids were too  ``urban'' and ``unkempt.''   A year later, in 2018, Andrew Johnson, a New Jersey high school  student, was forced by a white referee to either have his dreadlocks  cut or forfeit a wrestling match, leading him to have his hair cut in  public by an athletic trainer immediately before the match.   Again in 2018, an 11-year-old Black girl in Louisiana was asked to  leave class at a private Roman Catholic school near New Orleans because  her braided hair extensions violated the school's policies.   In 2019, two African American men in Texas alleged being denied  employment by Six Flags because of their hairstyles--one had long  braids and the other had dreadlocks.   In the following year of 2020 there were news reports of a Texas  student who would not be allowed to walk at graduation because his  dreadlocks were too long.   Finally, I'd like to share the story of a young man from my district,  who was suspended from school just last year for his natural  dreadlocks.   DeAndre Arnold was a senior at Barbers Hill High School in Houston,  Texas.   Arnold had his dreadlocks for years and this hairstyle had become a  part of his identity and allowed him to embrace his culture.   Arnold's family is from Trinidad and the men in his family often grow  their locks near or below their waist.   Arnold had complied with the dress code throughout high school by  keeping his hair up.   His high school routinely inspected his hair for violating a hair  length school policy; upon inspection they ultimately decided to  suspend him for violating the policy.   Arnold was not allowed to return to school, attend his senior prom,  or his graduation ceremony unless he cut his hair.   Thankfully Arnold was able to take this decision to court, where the  judge ruled that he could return to school without fear of  recrimination.   However, Arnold's high school failed him, as students in our society  should not have to undergo litigation just to peacefully obtain an  education.   Students like DeAndre Arnold should not be faced with the impossible  choice of either suppressing their cultural heritage and Black identity  by cutting their natural hair, or forfeiting their right to equal  educational and extracurricular opportunities.   People of color, especially Black people, have long felt pressure to  alter their natural hair to conform to what society has deemed  ``acceptable.''   The CROWN Act prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs  and activities based on an individual's hair texture or hairstyle if it  is commonly associated with a particular race or national origin,  including ``a hairstyle in which hair is tightly coiled or tightly  curled, dreadlocks, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, and Afros.''   The legislation also provides that the prohibition will be enforced  as part of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits  discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally  funded programs, and that violations of Section 3(a) will be treated as  if they were violations of Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   The CROWN Act would end the demeaning practice of forcing conformity  onto people of color.   It would make it illegal for employers and educators to deny an  individual employment or educational opportunities due to the length,  texture or style of their hair.   To be frank, it is a tragedy that we need federal legislation to end  these discriminatory practices and give people of color the dignity  that is their inherent right.   The CROWN Act says to Americans facing discrimination that the  Congress of the United States hears them, sees them, and affirms their  beauty and dignity and pride in their culture.   I rise in strong support of this bill so that men and women of color  no longer feel that they cannot or should not enter certain spaces  because they wish to wear the hair that they are born with.   I strongly urge all Members to join me in voting for the passage of  H.R. 2116, the CROWN Act.   I include in the Record a May 20, 2021 article entitled: ``Opinion:  Stop policing people of color's hair and pass the CROWN Act.''                       [From Chron.com, May 20, 2021]    Opinion: Stop Policing People of Color's Hair and Pass the CROWN Act         Texas seems to be hell bent on policing Black peoples'       hair--and it needs to stop. Immediately.        In Troy, an 11-year-old Native and African-American student       spent more than a week in in-school suspension after       administrators said his braided hairstyle violated the dress       code, per 25 News KXXV's Jarell Baker.        Barbers Hill Independent School District voted unanimously       in July of 2020 to uphold a school policy that allowed the       district to suspend DeAndre Arnold and his cousin Kaden       Bradford for refusing to cut their dreadlocks, even barring       Arnold from his senior prom and high school graduation.        Such incidents are far from isolated in the Lone Star       state, which begs the question: Why are Texas schools so       determined to uphold dated rules that seemingly exist only to       police the appearance of Black and brown students?        People of color, especially Black people, have long felt       pressure to alter their natural hair to conform to what       society has deemed ``acceptable.'' It's demeaning, and--quite       frankly--sad. And it's time we proudly rocked all of our       kinks and curls without being punished for it.        That's why the CROWN Act is important.        ``Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair,''       or CROWN, is an act that would prohibit race-based hair       discrimination in Texas schools and workplaces. The CROWN Act       would make it illegal for employers and educators to deny an       individual employment or educational opportunities due to the       length, texture or style of their hair.        It's sad that there even has to be a law in place,       considering no other race has to deal with their hair being a       Civil Rights issue. But here we are.        The law hasn't passed in Texas (yet), but with April 27       being Texas' CROWN Act Day, Texas Legislative Black Caucus       members are working around the clock to see that it happens.  [[Page H3841]]         As a Black woman, I am tired of feeling like I can't or       shouldn't enter certain spaces because my hair ``isn't done''       or straightened. I am tired of being asked if my hair is real       or if someone can touch it. It's the hair I was born with,       not a science experiment.        This is also the reason people of color get so upset about       outside races wearing braids or other protective hairstyles.       The issue is not the style itself, but the fact that you have       an entire group of people who are seen as ``less       professional'' in the workplace and even denied jobs for       rocking styles they created while others are allowed to copy       it and receive compliments? It's disgusting.        The CROWN Act is necessary for the culture, and the fact       that Texas isn't moving quicker to pass it is quite telling.        Whether anyone wants to admit it, hair discrimination is       race discrimination. And we've had enough.     Madam Speaker, as President Zelenskyy said, we are  the leaders of peace. The President is the leader of world peace.   Thank you, President Biden, for recognizing the crisis and the murder  and pillage and slaughter of babies in Ukraine.   Let us continue to stand together, but I am fighting as much to be  able to solve the Ukraine crisis as I am for peace.   Let me also acknowledge this past week the remembering of those who  were killed in Atlanta, which exhibited the worst kind of Asian hate.  Let us stand together against such hate and stand together for what is  right.   Let me also mention the fighters at the Pleasant Village senior  citizen housing. They have been fighting against eviction, against  disrespect, and against a complete altering of their living quarters.   They determined that they should have quality-of-life housing. I am  asking the new owner to stand down and to allow this housing project or  this housing facility to be for seniors in their later lives so they  can have a better quality of life.   I will continue to fight to ensure that they have a place to live  that is safe and best for them.                            ____________________
