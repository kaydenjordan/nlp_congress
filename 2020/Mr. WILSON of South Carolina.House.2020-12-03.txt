 Mr. Speaker, congratulations to  Ritedose Corporation of Columbia, a South Carolina company on the front  lines of America's spectacular effort to secure a coronavirus vaccine.  [[Page H6059]]    Thursday, it was announced that Ritedose has been selected as a  subcontractor of ApiJect Systems America, led by CEO Franco Negron, to  produce prefilled single-dose syringes for the vaccine.   In 4 months, Jody Chastain, the president and CEO of Ritedose, and  his talented team have up-fitted a facility that will produce up to 45  million doses a month of the vaccine. That is American ingenuity at its  best, and it is our capable workforce in South Carolina at their best.   The Ritedose success in Operation Warp Speed, led by Vice President  Mike Pence, is a historic achievement and another Donald Trump victory,  which the fake media will distort.   I am grateful that The Ritedose Corporation is integral in this  effort for the health and safety of American families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the courage of Claudia Tenney.                            ____________________
