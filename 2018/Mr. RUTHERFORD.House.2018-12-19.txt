 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Raines  High School football team for winning the Florida 4A State championship  and, also, the Mandarin High School football team for winning the  Florida 8A State championship.   Raines High School now has won two straight State titles, while  Mandarin just captured their first State football championship ever.  This marks the first time in history that two public schools from Duval  County, Florida, have won the State championship in the same season.   Football is a big part of Florida culture. Many kids grow up with  dreams of winning the championship under those Friday night lights, and  these student athletes have demonstrated the commitment and work ethic  to be successful both on the field and in the classroom.   I congratulate them for bringing home some hardware to northeast  Florida where it belongs, and I look forward to more championships to  come.   Congratulations once again to Mandarin and Raines football on a  victory these players will remember for the rest of their lives.                            ____________________
