 Mr. President, these are the big leagues for a Senator.  Depending on how long you serve here, you get only a handful of  opportunities to vote on the confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice.   We may know how this is going to go tomorrow, but many of us who have  very serious concerns about the precedent that this confirmation  creates for this country that we love are going to be here on the floor  tonight--through the night--trying to implore our colleagues to think  differently about this or at least think about how we can do this  differently the next time around and how we can come to some common  understanding as to what the rules of the game should be and what the  standards should be when we are interviewing candidates for one of the  most important jobs in the world, the U.S. Supreme Court.   I have a few things to say here tonight, as the hour gets late. I  wanted to start by talking a little bit about what the standard is.  What is the standard that we should apply when we are considering a  submission from the executive branch to sit on the Supreme Court?   It seems to me as if this whole exercise has been conducted in a  manner to suggest that, A, there is no one else eligible for the  Supreme Court, other than Brett Kavanaugh, as if we live in an Adam and  Eve world in which we have few, if any, alternative choices  [[Page S6638]]  and, B, that this body owes some significant and potentially binding  obligation to the President when he makes his choice.   I just want to go back over the standard for a moment because it is  not uncommon for the Senate to reject Supreme Court nominees who have  been sent to this body. In fact, if you walk out the door on the other  side of this Chamber and you hang a left, you will quickly come to the  Senate Reception Room. In that room, there is a relatively freshly  painted picture of Oliver Ellsworth and Roger Sherman. This is one of  the newer portraits here in the Capitol, and it depicts two Connecticut  delegates to the Constitutional Convention scheming over what would  become called the Connecticut Compromise.   This is the breakthrough at the Constitutional Convention that  establishes the Senate with two Members per State and the House of  Representatives elected by proportion of population per State.   Oliver Ellsworth is a significant figure in the history of my State  and in the history of this country but not only because of his  contribution to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution; he also plays a  significant role in the beginning of the American judicial system. He  is the father of the American judiciary in that he authored, as a  Senator, the first Judiciary Act, which established the Federal court  system.   Then he plays another important role in the early history of the  courts because when it was time for George Washington to nominate a  second Supreme Court Chief Justice, the name he sent to the Senate was  rejected. He sent his friend John Rutledge, but because his friend John  Rutledge had played a fairly controversial role in the adoption of the  Jay Treaty, the Senate voted Rutledge down.   Washington, not wanting to be embarrassed again, knowing that he  needed the consent of the Senate to get someone into that role, picked  one of the Senate's own. He picked Oliver Ellsworth, who was the  foremost expert on the judiciary in the Senate. Oliver Ellsworth became  the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. His bust sits inside the Old  Supreme Court Chamber here in the Senate today.   I tell that story only because it is a reminder that at the very  earliest stages of the American Republic, the Senate decided to  exercise its independent discretion when it came to choices for the  Supreme Court by the President of the United States.   George Washington figured out very quickly that the Senate does not  owe the executive automatic deference when it comes to the choices that  are placed before the Senate. It is advice and consent. In fact, that  practice of refusing to give complete and total deference to the  executive has continued up until this day. From World War II until this  moment, I think the number is seven selections by the President that  ultimately did not get confirmed.   Sometimes the Senate gives a hint ahead of time that a nomination  isn't going to go so well, and the President withdraws that nominee.  Not in every case is there actually a vote before the Senate.  Oftentimes, the signal is clear enough from the Senate that consent is  not going to be given, and the administration withdraws that nominee.   Let's be clear that there is no binding obligation on behalf of the  Senate to say yes to a nominee whom we believe to be flawed or wrong  for the moment--no obligation on behalf of Members of the President's  party and no obligation on behalf of Members of the opposition party.   Second, I have heard my Republican colleagues, ad nauseam, treat this  selection as if we are a court of law with a defendant sitting in front  of us whose freedom is going to be taken away if he doesn't get a  positive vote for confirmation. Why do I say that? Because over and  over again, I have heard this idea that Brett Kavanaugh is innocent  until proven guilty, that there is a presumption of innocence with  respect to the claims that surround him. Those are not traditionally  terms that have been used with respect to the choices we make about  nominees to the judicial branch or to the executive branch. Those are  terms that are used in courts of law.    The presumption of innocence is given to a defendant. The high burden  of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is placed on the prosecutor  because the stakes in a criminal trial are fundamentally different from  the stakes in an appointment to the Supreme Court or to become the head  of a department.   In a court of law, in a criminal court of law, the bar, the standard  is set high because the consequence to that defendant is his liberty  being taken away from him or her. That is not the case for Brett  Kavanaugh or any other name that gets sent to this body for  confirmation. If Brett Kavanaugh were not to receive a confirmation  vote to the Supreme Court, he would go right back to the appellate  court with a nice job and a nice salary, as would many other nominees  who don't get a confirmation vote from this body. Their liberty isn't  taken away. They go back to some pretty good jobs.   That is why it is nonsensical to suggest that the standard we apply  here to a nominee is similar to that of a criminal court. We don't have  to prove that reservations about a nominee can ultimately be held to  the same standard as in a criminal court. Why? Because the consequences  are lower but also because there are other people who can serve that  role. You err on the side of caution often when it comes to nominations  because the consequences for the country of simply moving on to the  next nominee for a Cabinet post or a judicial job are, frankly, fairly  low. The standard is not a criminal standard.   We have often talked about the fact that this is much more like a job  interview. I think that is right. I don't think it is a perfect  analogy. This is a pretty special and important job. There are some  procedures around this job interview that we don't hold ourselves to  when we are interviewing somebody for a position in our office. Let's  all be honest with each other. If somebody showed up in our office  looking for a position and their file looked like the file of Brett  Kavanaugh, none of us would hire that individual--not a single one of  us.   Tell me that a Senator would hire an individual who came to their  office, who might have looked qualified, who might have a sterling  resume, but whose file included several credible allegations of serious  misbehavior. You probably wouldn't even go through the trouble of  conducting an exhaustive inquiry into whether those allegations were  true or not, as I think we had an obligation to do with respect to this  case. I would argue, we had an obligation to do that investigation here  because this is different from a job interview for a legislative  assistant or a person who answers our phones.   Let's be honest that if those allegations were before us as  employers, we wouldn't hire that individual. And we certainly wouldn't  hire an individual who conducted themselves in the job interview in the  same way that Brett Kavanaugh conducted himself when he came before the  Judiciary Committee last week. It is much more like a job interview  than it is a criminal trial. It doesn't neatly fit into either  category, but we wouldn't hire that individual in our office because we  know that there are plenty of other qualified applicants for the jobs  we are looking for. Why take a chance on someone who might be  fundamentally wrong for the position we are interviewing for?   I think it is important at the outset to get the standard right. The  terminology that gets thrown around here as if this is a criminal trial  just misunderstands the nature of the job that we have before us.   I want to turn to the arguments that I would use if I thought I had  the chance to change the mind of some of my Republican colleagues this  evening. That is probably impossible at this late stage, but we are  here, so I might as well give it a try.   I agree with everything Senator Cantwell said about the jurisprudence  of Judge Kavanaugh on the appellate court. I think he is a dangerous  nominee because he does fall fairly far out of the judicial mainstream.   I heard Senator Collins on the floor earlier today talking about how  she hoped that he would be a bridge between the two sides of the Court,  how she thought that he might ultimately be someone who would lead to  fewer 5-to-4 decisions being rendered on the Court.   She used as evidence of that hope a statistic that is curious. She  talked about the fact that he voted with Merrick Garland 93 percent of  the time  [[Page S6639]]  on the court. Brett Kavanaugh voted with Merrick Garland 93 percent of  the time on the court because the appellate court in DC--as is the case  with most appellate courts in the country--renders most of their  decisions in unanimous form. All of the judges are agreeing with each  other on the vast majority of cases. That statistic does not tell you  whether Brett Kavanaugh is a bridge builder or whether he is an  outlier.   Fortunately, there is another, more relevant statistic; that is, the  percentage of times a judge dissents, who stands away from his  colleagues, who has formed a consensus and rendered an opinion of his  or her own.   No one on the DC Circuit dissented during Judge Kavanaugh's time on  that court more often than Judge Kavanaugh. Some of those dissents were  pretty creative dissents. Some of the things we are most worried about  with respect to the friendliness of Judge Kavanaugh to corporate power,  his distaste for regulation, comes from those dissents in which  Democrats and Republicans--or, put better, judges appointed by  Democrats and Republicans--on the DC Circuit found a way to agree, but  Judge Kavanaugh stood over here with some novel theories of the case as  to why regulatory bodies couldn't get into the business of big  corporations.   The history in appellate court is not of being a bridge builder; it  is of standing outside of that mainstream, challenging the consensus.  That is who Judge Kavanaugh is going to be on the Supreme Court.   I will give you an example, something that is close to my heart. I  had a lot of arguments in Connecticut about the future of gun policy in  this country, just like we have a lot of arguments here. By and large,  people in my State--even the folks who don't agree with all the things  I would do if I were in charge of America's gun laws--generally think  it should be up to us to decide. They might not think the Second  Amendment allows us to pass a bill banning all guns in the country, but  they think the question of who can own guns and what kind of guns can  be sold is a question better left to legislature.   Brett Kavanaugh has a novel theory about the limits of the  legislature's ability to regulate gun ownership. It is a theory that  even for him is pretty far outside of the mainstream. He actually laid  it out for the Judiciary Committee in a series of questions and answers  with the ranking member. He said: Listen, I think if a gun is in the  commercial space, the Constitution grants it permanent protection. His  argument is that once a gun is sold privately, you can never ever ban  it. That is ridiculous. That is not how any courts have read the law  prior to this time.   This Congress has regularly made the decision that some weapons are  not proper for commercial sale and have pulled them out of the  commercial market. In the 1930s, Congress decided that automatic  weapons that were out in the streets--the so-called Tommy guns--should  come out of the commercial market. In the 1990s, we made the decision  that assault weapons--the semiautomatic tactical weapons--should be  restricted. Kavanaugh says: No, once a gun is sold privately, you can't  ever take it back, no matter how dangerous. No matter how dangerous it  becomes, no matter the mistake that Congress thinks it might have made  in legalizing that weapon, once it is out there, you cannot take it  back--so says the Second Amendment. It is a radical idea, as is his  theory of the case on abortion rights.   We can talk about the case that came before his court in which he  denied the ability of a young immigrant woman to seek an abortion  despite the fact that she fit all the other legal requirements for that  procedure, or we could just look to the fact that in his testimony, he  parroted the political jargon of the anti-choice movement. He used  phrases that courts don't use when talking about the issue of abortion  or reproductive healthcare. He used the phrase ``abortion on demand,''  which is a ridiculously politically loaded term. I have no idea what  that means, but it is a term that is regularly used by the anti-choice  political movement. You can't get an abortion from a vending machine,  but that is what the phrase ``abortion on demand'' seems to suggest  exists in the world, and Judge Kavanaugh used it.   He also called birth control an abortion-inducing drug, which it is  not. Simple science can serve to explain that birth control certainly  can prevent a pregnancy, but it does not cause an abortion. But Judge  Kavanaugh used that term in his confirmation hearing because it is part  of the political opposition. It is part of the basket of propaganda  that gets used to try to pull down protection for reproductive choice  around the country.   I share many of the reservations that my colleagues have expressed  when it comes to Judge Kavanaugh's record on the Second Amendment,  Judge Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judiciary Committee in his first  hearing on the issue of reproductive choice, as well as the  reservations many of my colleagues have about what he will do to the  Affordable Care Act.   I will concede that his writings on the Affordable Care Act are  limited. He has expressed some hostility to the Affordable Care Act. He  said in one of his decisions that if the Congress could go so far as to  require people to buy healthcare, there was no limit to the potential  reach of Congress's power.   On this one, I take the President at his word. The President said he  would never make the mistake George Bush did in appointing someone to  the Supreme Court who would uphold the Affordable Care Act, as John  Roberts did. He promised he wouldn't make that mistake again. On this  one, given the over-the-top, incessant, persistent hostility the  President has expressed for the Affordable Care Act, I trust he has  made good on his promise and that he has sent someone to us who is  going to work with him to try to unwind the Affordable Care Act.    I was an early opponent of Judge Kavanaugh's. I didn't wait very long  to express my opposition because I see he is so far out of line with  Connecticut values that he is not going to be a judge in the model of  those true centrist judges who maybe I didn't agree with on issue after  issue but I thought gave each question before them a fair look.   I also don't think that is my best case with my Republican friends  because you feel differently about the Affordable Care Act and about  the Second Amendment and about the issue of choice than I do. It is  probably not the best tactic at 1 o'clock in the morning to try to  convince you to vote against Brett Kavanaugh based upon his  conservative, I would argue rightwing record as an appellate judge. So  let me try some different arguments out on you. Some of these will have  to do with process. Process is important. Process is important because  it is kind of all we have. When it comes down to it, democracy holds  together because of a set of rules we all agree to follow. It is called  the rule of law, broadly.   In this place, it is a set of precedents and traditions that have  held up pretty well over 240 years. As those precedents and traditions  start to fall, so do the edges of democracy itself. I know to some it  feels like insider politics--beltway jargon--to be talking about the  process we have gone through here, but there are some important  precedent-shattering decisions that have been made by the majority with  respect to the Kavanaugh nomination.   The first is the documents surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy.  As many of my colleagues have said, we have seen somewhere around 6  percent to 7 percent of all the documents relative to Brett Kavanaugh's  time as a judge and as a staff person in the executive branch. We have  seen a small slice of those documents. I think the 7-percent number  applies to the documents relative to his time in the White House.   I listened to Senator Lee earlier tonight talk about the fact that it  wasn't his fault that we didn't see the documents because those are in  the possession of the administration, and the Bush administration and  representatives of the Bush White House are making the decisions about  what documents Congress can see and can't see independently of Brett  Kavanaugh.   That is not true. The individual who is overseeing the decision about  which documents Congress can see and can't see is a close confidant,  ally, and colleague of Brett Kavanaugh's. In fact, 2 weeks ago when the  nomination of Brett Kavanaugh was thrown into doubt and the White House  convened a war room--a war room of Judge  [[Page S6640]]  Kavanaugh's most loyal, trusted advisers--the individual who was  vetting the documents for the Bush White House was in the war room.  This was not an independent exercise of discretion on behalf of the  Bush White House; this was one of Judge Kavanaugh's primary backers  making decisions on which documents we could see and which ones we  couldn't. This was a political job.   We are left to wonder why we get so few. What is in those other  documents that were so explosive that you had to put a political ally  of Brett Kavanaugh's in charge of the disclosure of those documents and  give us so few?   Here is why the process matters. Once you have made the decision that  you are going to create a structure by which you withhold evidence that  would be relevant to the decision the Senate makes because--well, just  because--it becomes the new rule. I am not here to say what goes around  comes around; I am telling you that once you make the decision that  ``You don't need to see evidence on a particular nominee because we are  not going to give it to you because we think it might be damaging,''  that becomes the new rule. Then, all of a sudden, there will become a  day when my friends on the other side of the aisle want evidence they  are not getting either. The withholding of documents really matters. If  we can't make sound decisions, then this whole institution becomes  weaker.   Second, I want to move to last Thursday's hearing. I think there is  also some precedent-shattering decisions we are making in the wake of  what was a stunning performance by a nominee before the Judiciary  Committee.   Let me talk about the lies.   I believe Dr. Ford. I think she was credible, thoughtful. Everything  she said in that hearing seemed to be an effort to try to get to the  truth. I, frankly, don't know whether Judge Kavanaugh wasn't telling  the truth or legitimately doesn't remember what happened because he was  so intoxicated.   I can set aside the question of whether Judge Kavanaugh was telling  the truth about that particular assault and still have serious concerns  about all of the other smaller lies he told during the testimony.   I understand some of the stuff that came up was embarrassing to him,  some of these terms and phrases. Yet he was asked the questions, and no  matter how embarrassing it was to talk about what boofing is or what a  devil's triangle is, he was obligated to tell the truth, and he didn't.  We have plenty of corroborating evidence to suggest that he and his  friends knew exactly what those terms mean, knew exactly what they were  referring to with respect to the young women with whom they were part  of an alumni club.   I know it sounds trivial to be talking on the Senate floor about  words and phrases that high school kids were using. The fact that they  were using those terms, said certain things when they were kids,  doesn't bother me at all. What bothers me is that a nominee for the  Supreme Court has such a casual association with the truth that he  couldn't admit to us what were some embarrassing admissions and lied  instead.   The precedent of letting a nominee get away with that--even if you  don't believe he told a big lie, even if you only believe the mistruths  were on the smaller things--is another precedent-shattering decision,  because all of a sudden, we send the message to people who want to  apply for the most important jobs in the world that telling the truth  is not that important.   I get it. The cat is out of the bag. The horse has left the barn. I  get it that the top of the Pandora's Box is open. We have a President  of the United States who doesn't tell the truth every single day. We  have a President of the United States who goes on Twitter and makes up  stuff about U.S. Senators. Our bigger problem is not the small  mistruths--the potentially small mistruths of Brett Kavanaugh's; our  bigger problem is that we have a President who literally can't get  through a day without making up something.   That sends a worse message to our kids than the mistruths of Brett  Kavanaugh, but, nonetheless, the Supreme Court is the Supreme Court. It  is a lifetime appointment. At least if an Executive gets into office  and starts making stuff up, we can get rid of him or her after 4  years--not the Supreme Court. You send somebody up to the Supreme Court  who fibs, and that individual is there forever. Thus, maybe our  standards should be a little bit higher.   Third, I want to talk about Judge Kavanaugh's disposition in that  hearing and some of the things he said about how the allegations came  forward. I talked about this on the Senate floor, I think, now 2 days  ago. So I will not repeat it all. But his belief that Dr. Ford's  allegations or Ms. Ramirez's allegations came forward as part of some  vast conspiracy led by progressive groups and Democratic Senators on  behalf of Hillary and Bill Clinton is delusional.   I understand that politics in this town are rough. We have all been  subject to character attacks we think are unfair, but that doesn't mean  there are these vast cabals of people on the left and the right wing  who are out there spinning tales on a daily basis about each other.   What we know is that Dr. Ford brought this forward to her Member of  Congress before Brett Kavanaugh was even the nominee. What we know is  that it got leaked to the press, likely by somebody who didn't have an  interest in Brett Kavanaugh as a nominee, but not by a Democratic  Senator.   What we know is that the allegations that followed came out as a  consequence of that first allegation. There is zero evidence that there  is some grand conspiracy of Democrats in league with the Clintons to  try to bury Brett Kavanaugh.   Further evidence of that is that if that were our MO, why did we wait  a year and a half to employ it on Brett Kavanaugh? If Democrats' method  of operation was to gin up a whole bunch of false allegations about  individuals and make accusations about sexual assault that weren't true  just to muddy them up and smear them, why didn't it occur to Neil  Gorsuch who, frankly, engendered much more hostility among many of our  friends and backers, because that was the seat that we believe was  stolen from Merrick Garland. Why didn't we gin up those kinds of  allegations about the President's early nominees to the Cabinet who,  frankly, spun up a lot more grassroots anger than Brett Kavanaugh did  in the summer of 2018?   The answer is because this wasn't a conspiracy. This wasn't a whole  bunch of Democratic Senators sitting around. These allegations came out  organically, and whether or not you believe they are true, to go before  the Judiciary Committee as a judge and make the allegation that there  is a conspiracy including Democratic Senators against you, when you  have no evidence for it, tells us all we need to know about your  fitness to serve on the Bench.   If you are making things up in order to fit the narrative that you  think will be most helpful to make your case before the Senate, why  would we think that you wouldn't do the same thing on the Court, which  leads me to the most troubling passage of his testimony, and I heard  Senator Lee launch a defense of it. I have heard others launch a  defense of it, but I watched it again before I came down to the Senate  floor just to make sure that I had it right.   At the end of his diatribe against Democrats, at the end of this  description of a Clinton-connected conspiracy that he believes is  launched against him, he uses this phrase--and I am paraphrasing the  beginning of this. He says: As we all know in the political world of  the early 2000s, ``what comes around, goes around.''   Now, I listened to it again today just to make sure that that wasn't  a lead-in to some other thought, and it wasn't. He starts a new thought  after that. He starts talking about how he is a generally optimistic  guy.   The passage about the conspiracy theory and about how badly he has  been treated by the Democrats ends with a punctuation point right  before which is the admonition ``what comes around, goes around.''   There is little way to read that other than as a threat to those who  are going to oppose him in the Senate and to those political interest  groups outside the Senate who are working to oppose him.   I don't think I am making too much of this, and I know that last  night in  [[Page S6641]]  the Wall Street Journal Brett Kavanaugh wrote a somewhat apologetic op- ed in which he said that he might have gotten a little bit too heated  at times in the hearing. He didn't specifically refer to which  statements he would take back, but that line--``what comes around, goes  around''--and those allegations about this dangerous Democratic-led  conspiracy theory weren't statements that he just came up with in the  heat of the moment. Those were statements in his prepared text. Those  were statements that he wrote down on paper, thought about overnight,  thought about again as he listened to Dr. Ford's testimony, and then  read before the Judiciary Committee: ``What comes around, goes  around.''   How does any petitioner who is aligned with any of the groups that  Judge Kavanaugh might think was involved in the political opposition to  his candidacy have faith that they will get a fair audience before the  Supreme Court when Judge Kavanaugh is on it? Do you really think, given  how angry he was, given what he believes was organized against him,  that he is going to fairly give causes aligned with Democrats a fair  shot before the Court? Do you really think he now can say that he will  be a neutral-colored umpire as a Supreme Court Justice?   Here is why this is a precedent-breaking decision that we are making.  In the past, we have actually put political people on the Supreme  Court. We have. Centuries ago we selected people for the Supreme Court  who had actually served in political positions. That was at a time when  our politics was, maybe, a little bit less heated, where there was more  opportunity for common ground. But in recent times, that has not been  the way in which we have selected people for the Supreme Court. We  traditionally select jurists.    There has been in the American public this belief that even in a  super politically charged time, there are at least nine people who are  above all of that, who are above the regular partisan barbs and  allegations that we tend too often to throw at each other. Those nine  people are on the Supreme Court, and that is really important, because  once the American public starts to think that the Supreme Court is just  another political arm, that is the day when the rule of law really  starts to fall apart.   That is why nominees to the Court are so careful not to unveil any  political bias, even if they may have one, because they don't want to  shatter that image that the American public still has, by and large,  that at least those nine people are immune from the political biases  that we hold here in the Senate.   Well, that belief has been forever compromised because Judge  Kavanaugh has told you his political bias. He has told you what he  thinks of Democrats, and now he is headed for the Supreme Court.   Senator Lee spent some time earlier this evening talking about  Federalist No. 78. Senator Lee is not the only one who has read  Federalist Papers.   Federalist No. 78 is an important one. It is where Hamilton lays out  the importance of seeing the judiciary different than the legislative  body, and Senator Lee got it right. He talks about the judiciary  exercising judgments, whereas the legislature exercises will. That is a  good way to think about the difference between the two.   Yet inside Federalist No. 78 is another idea that is really, really  important. What he says inside that document is this. Hamilton says:         I agree, that ``there is no liberty, if the power of       judging be not separated from the legislative and executive       powers.'' And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty       can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would       have everything to fear from its union with either of the       other departments. . . .    Hamilton is saying in that edition of the Federalist Papers that the  judiciary is the weakest of the three branches because it doesn't have  the power of the sword as the executive does, nor the power of the  purse as the legislative branch does. Though he admits that the  judiciary can overrule an act of Congress and that gives it power, he  suggests that so long as the executive is independent and is not a tool  or a part of the legislative branch or the executive branch, we have  nothing to fear.   Now, he doesn't lay it out in as explicit terms as I might today, but  what he is essentially saying is that the judiciary has to be  apolitical. As long as it is apolitical, you have nothing to worry  about because it doesn't have some of the inherent powers of the  branches in article I and article II.   We have broken through that wall in the nomination of Brett  Kavanaugh. By making these blatantly partisan allegations, by  associating himself in his confirmation hearing so clearly with one  side of the partisan fight inside the U.S. Congress, he has now brought  at least his seat on the Supreme Court that much closer to one of the  two departments that Hamilton feared would ultimately become joined.   Alexander Hamilton spent a lot of time thinking about the importance  and writing about the importance of an independent judiciary. Brett  Kavanaugh, by jumping into the political fray, by translating his  biases, has started to break down that wall.   Now, I don't want to be apocalyptic about this. Maybe what I am  suggesting is that it just is going to make it a lot easier to put more  people on the Supreme Court who are more and more political, ultimately  continuing to tear down that wall.   Lastly, I want to talk for a moment about the investigation that took  place regarding some of these allegations.   One of the precedent-shattering decisions that was made was the  decision on behalf of the majority to do no work to try to figure out  whether those who were making these allegations were telling the truth,  beyond a hastily scheduled hearing in which only two witnesses were  called, as compared to the Anita Hill hearings, where there were over  20 witnesses called. It was a sham of a process. That is not too strong  a word. There was not an attempt to get to the truth. There was an  attempt to provide cover, to make it look as if the Senate was having a  fair hearing.   There was also no intention to do what had been done back during the  Clarence Thomas nomination--to have the FBI go out and gather some  facts for themselves.   It was only because of a last-minute demand by a handful of  Republican Senators that the FBI went out and conducted an  investigation but was given only 1 week to do that investigation.   There is reporting in the New York Times today that suggests that the  White House intentionally limited the scope of that investigation, but,  frankly, I didn't need the New York Times to tell me that that is how  this went down. I read the report, and it was very clear in that report  that the FBI could do some things and couldn't do other things.   This is not me telling you this. I am referring to independent  reporting that only eight people were actually interviewed, and there  were clearly some subjects that were off limits in those interviews and  some things that would have been very important for Congress to know  that we cannot know because those interviews only went so far.   Now the Times is reporting that that was intentional. In fact, the  Times reports that the President's Chief Counsel told the President  that if there was a full investigation of all of the claims and all  potential claims around Judge Kavanaugh, it would be very bad for his  nomination.   So I think the FBI do good work, but not when they are given unfair  parameters around their investigation. That, in and of itself, is  another precedent-shattering decision, constraining the FBI when they  are trying to go out and gather facts for us.   Yet another precedent-shattering decision was the way in which we  were allowed to see the report. It was one of the most humiliating  things I have ever gone through as a U.S. Senator--to sit in a secure  room with 10 of my other colleagues, with 60 minutes to review a  document, look at it, digest it, and ask questions about it. The scene  was chaotic.   We are sitting there with a bunch of our colleagues, trying to share  different pieces of the report: I will read that page. You read that  page. Wait. Did I read page 6? Wait. Do you have page 7? Oh, boy, we  have to get out of here because we only have 60 minutes.   It was not becoming of the U.S. Senate, and it didn't have to go down  like that. It would have been easy for the  [[Page S6642]]  Senate majority leader to work out an arrangement with the White House  to have more than one copy of the FBI report. And, of course, the  Senate leadership could have given us more than a half day to review  that report.   Neither of those things happened, and they have consequences because  the next time there is a complication, there is incentive to do the  same thing again--to rush a nominee through the process.   I have with me a statement from a gentleman by the name of Keith  Koegler. This is a statement that comes to the Senate from Christine  Blasey Ford's lawyers. It is a statement of an individual whom the FBI  did not interview. This is a friend of Dr. Ford's who had conversations  with Dr. Ford prior to Judge Kavanaugh's nomination regarding the  allegations of assault that Dr. Ford told the committee. One of the  things he says here is that he has a copy of an email thread ``between  Christine and me'' in which he made it clear that Brett Kavanaugh was  the judge who assaulted her as a teenager.    He says: ``We exchanged those emails . . . two days after Justice  Kennedy's retirement announcement, before there was a shortlist for his  replacement.''   He is submitting this to us so that we can put it in the Record,  given the fact that it was not included in the FBI's investigation,  because they never came and interviewed Mr. Koegler.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this document be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  Keith Koegler,                                     Palo Alto, CA, October 5, 2018.        Members of the U.S. Senate: My name is Keith Koegler. I am       one of Christine Blasey Ford's corroborating witnesses. For       those of you who aren't lawyers, the term ``corroborating       witness'' is not synonymous with ``eye witness''--someone can       be a corroborating witness without having physically been       present at the scene of a crime. Indeed, in matters involving       sexual assault, there are often no eyewitnesses.        Since attending the hearing 8 days ago, I have grown       increasingly concerned that Senators would ignore the import       of Christine's testimony in their rush to confirm Judge Brett       Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. For the record:        I believe, with every fiber of my being, that Christine       Blasey Ford has testified truthfully about her assault by       Brett Kavanaugh. I have the benefit of knowing Christine, but       if you saw her testimony and you didn't find her credible,       you know nothing about sexual assault.        The process by which the Senate Judiciary Committee has       ``investigated'' the facts relating to the assault has been a       shameless effort to protect Judge Kavanaugh. The fact that       the FBI did not interview either Christine or Judge       Kavanaugh, by itself, renders absurd any assertion that the       investigation was ``thorough.'' There are a minimum of 7       additional people, known to the White House, the Senate       Judiciary Committee and the FBI who knew about the assault       prior to the nomination who were not interviewed. I am one of       them.        Here are some of the things the FBI would have learned by       interviewing me:        I have a copy of the email thread between Christine and me       in which she made it clear that Brett Kavanaugh was the judge       who had assaulted her as a teenager. We exchanged those       emails on June 29, 2018, two days after Justice Kennedy's       retirement announcement, before there was a shortlist for his       replacement. It wasn't until July 9, 2018 that the President       nominated Judge Kavanaugh.        Christine has accurately described the sequence of events       that occurred in the months that followed, including her       interactions with the Washington Post, Representative Anna       Eshoo's office and Senator Diane Feinstein's office. I know       because I had regular contact with her during that time.        There was no ``grand-conspiracy'' to conduct a ``political       hit job'' on Judge Kavanaugh--this was always about one woman       struggling with a perverse choice: Suffer a brutal toll on       herself and her family to fulfill a sense of civic duty and       (possibly, though not likely) avoid spending the rest of her       life looking at the face of the man who assaulted her as a       teenager on the United States Supreme Court or,       alternatively, live in silence with the knowledge that she       might have been able to make a difference.        Christine has been afraid of flying her entire adult life.       Prosecutor Rachel Mitchell repeatedly challenged Christine       about her fear of flying, in an effort to impugn Christine's       general credibility. I could have provided the FBI with the       names of at least half a dozen people who have flown with       Christine and can attest to the fact that she has panic       attacks before she flies. She controls those attacks with       medicine prescribed by a doctor.        As Senator Flake anticipated in a speech before the hearing       last week, coming forward has forced Christine, her husband       and their two sons to endure treatment that no human being       should have to suffer. Within hours after the first news       story, throngs of reporters descended on their home, driving       the family (perhaps permanently) out of the neighborhood. The       family has been subjected to a near constant barrage of       harassing emails, phone calls and social media attacks       (``die, you fucking cunt''), many of them obviously       coordinated and many threatening death or bodily harm.       Because of the attacks, Christine hasn't spent more than 3       consecutive nights in the same place. They have had to hire a       security firm 24/7, and they have to be transported from       place to place in secret. Christine hasn't slept more than 3       hours at a time since September 16th. She has trouble eating.       She has had to relinquish her teaching responsibilities for       the semester. And the list goes on. Perhaps Forever.        I have no power. I can only ask you to do what is right.       Please ask yourselves if you want to spend the rest of your       lives looking at the face of Brett Kavanaugh, the man who       lied about assaulting Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager, on       the United States Supreme Court.                                   ____                         Declaration of Keith Koegle         I, Keith Koegler, hereby state that I am over eighteen (18)       years of age, am competent to testify, and have personal       knowledge of the following facts:        1. I graduated from Amherst College in 1992 with a       Bachelor's Degree in History. I earned my Juris Doctor decree       from Vanderbilt Law School in 1997.        2. I have known Christine Blasey Ford and her husband.       Russell Ford, for more than five years, and consider them       close friends.        3. We met when I was coaching their son's baseball team.       Our children are close friends and have played sports       together for years. I have spent a lot of time with Christine       and her husband traveling to and attending our kids' games.       Our families have also gone on vacation together.        4. The first time I learned that Christine had experienced       sexual assault was in early summer of 2016. We were standing       together in a public place watching our children play       together.        5. I remember the timing of the conversation because it was       shortly after Stanford University student Brock Turner was       sentenced for felony sexual assault after raping an       unconscious woman on Stanford's campus. There was a common       public perception that the judge gave Mr. Turner too light of       a sentence.        6. Christine expressed anger at Mr. Turner's lenient       sentence, stating that she was particularly bothered he it       because she was assaulted in high school by a man who was now       a federal judge in Washington, D.C.        7. Christine did not mention the assault to me again until       June 29, 2018, two days after Justice Anthony Kennedy       announced his resignation from the Supreme Court of the       United States.        8. On June 29, 2018, she wrote me an email in which she       stated that the person who assaulted her in high school was       the President's ``favorite for SCOTUS.''        9 On June 29, 2018, I responded with an email in which I       stated:        ``I remember you telling me about him. but I don't remember       his name. Do you mind telling me so I can read about him?''        10. Christine responded by email and stated:        ``Brett Kavanaugh''        11. In all of my dealings with Christine I have known her       to be a serious and honorable person.        I solemnly swear or affirm under the penalties of perjury       that the matters set forth in this Declaration are true and       correct to the best of my personal knowledge, information,       and belief, Executed on this 24th day of September, 2018.                                                     Keith Koegler.     Mr. President, this is just one piece of evidence that  none of us saw prior to this moment that would have provided important  back up to Dr. Ford's testimony. I don't know why this person wasn't  interviewed who can testify that Dr. Ford told him of this abuse before  Judge Kavanaugh was placed on any shortlist.   I don't know if the FBI made their own decision not to talk to this  individual, whether they were time-limited so that they were unable to  get to him or whether the White House told them whom they could  interview and whom they couldn't, but this would have been really  important information for us to have beforehand.   I will end where I ended the other day. All of these decisions that  have been made, I think, have long-term consequences for this body. I  am not saying that we can't recover from this. We are all adults. I do  believe that everybody here in the Senate believes in this place and  wants it to be better. I don't run into many people on either side of  the aisle who are having a lot of fun these days, given the fact that  we can't get along on almost anything except for the budget, which is  not insignificant.   So I have to trust, as a relatively new entrant to this place, that  we can  [[Page S6643]]  do better, that we can try to learn from what has happened here. The  damage has been done at this point to survivors of sexual assault who  are going to be thinking twice about coming forward because they are  not going to be believed. The damage has been done to the precedent  surrounding nominations to the judiciary. The damage has been done to  the idea of objective truth and the belief that folks who are applying  for important jobs should tell the truth. But I have faith that we can  learn from what happened here and try to be better the next time.   Ultimately, what I think about a lot and what I have thought about a  lot these last few weeks is this: Why Brett Kavanaugh?   I come back to where I began. At the outset, I said that our standard  should be educated by the fact that there is not one person in the  world, in the United States, who is qualified for this job. There are  lots of them. So if you have serious doubts or reservations about an  individual, you can move on to the next person. That is what George  Washington did when John Rutledge was rejected by the Senate. He had  somebody else who was great in reserve--a great early American, Oliver  Ellsworth.   There are, no doubt, other conservative jurists who would probably  fulfill most of the jurisprudential aims of the Republican majority  just as well as Brett Kavanaugh. It can't be because Brett Kavanaugh is  the essential man.   So given all of these doubts, given all of these allegations, given  his precedent-breaking performance before the Judiciary Committee, why  stick with Brett Kavanaugh? This is what I come back to when I try to  answer that question for myself.   I know that it is hard being a Republican today. Your party doesn't  look like it did 10 years ago because you have a President who really  doesn't have an ideological core. He doesn't have a set of beliefs. He  is a cult of personality. He makes it up as he goes along. So it is  difficult being a Republican in Congress today because the party is  just fundamentally different than it was 5 years ago, and there is very  little that binds together a President without an ideological core and  Republicans in the Senate who do have a set of beliefs that they are  fairly regularly consistent about. I know that is uncomfortable. So I  fear that the reason the Senate Republican majority is sticking with  Brett Kavanaugh is because the one thing on which can agree with this  President is your antipathy for the Democratic minority.   There is this theme--this phrase on social media--that gets used by  the right, called ``owning the libs.'' It is the idea that you win if  you dominate your opponents. Winning isn't about passing a bill.  Winning isn't about doing something good for the country. Winning is  about owning your political opposition.   I worry that is what this is about--that we are sticking with Brett  Kavanaugh even with all of these problems and questions that surround  him because the worry is that to give up on him and move on to somebody  else would be a show of weakness and would be interpreted as a victory  for Democrats. The one thing that binds together congressional  Republicans and this President is an unwillingness to give Democrats  any perception of victory.   Now, it wouldn't really be a victory for Democrats because we know  there would be another conservative Justice--maybe, one even more  conservative than Brett Kavanaugh--who would be coming down the pike.  But maybe in the short term, it would be scored that way, and thus, it  becomes unacceptable.   It is sort of the definition of power politics--dominance no matter  the cost, no matter the policy implications, no matter the precedent. I  might be wrong about this. It may be that my colleagues just feel like  Brett Kavanaugh is telling the truth on everything, down to the  definition of some of those terms, or maybe they see a talent in him  that is unique that the rest of us don't see.   But I worry that what matters in this place these days is just  winning, and I worry about that for Democrats too. I worry that  ultimately what drives us when we get up in the morning in Washington,  DC, these days is just beating the other side--that it is just a game,  that it is just an athletic contest, and that we have become what the  news media and the cable shows want us to be, a sporting event.   I think that of late my Republican colleagues have been more guilty  of this than Democratic colleagues. I have that bias, I admit it. I am  allowed to have it as a partisan, but I believe it exists on both sides  of this body. This, I would argue, is just the worst episode of that  desire for political dominance and something that we should all, in the  wake of this nomination, step back from and think long and hard about.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
