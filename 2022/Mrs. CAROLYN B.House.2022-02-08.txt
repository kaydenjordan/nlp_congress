 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding and for his leadership.   I rise today in strong support of the rule on my bill, H.R. 3076, the  Postal Service Reform Act. The Postal Service Reform Act has been years  in the making, and I am proud to say that it is bipartisan.   As we all know, the Postal Service is one of our Nation's most vital  and respected institutions. It provides service to every American no  matter where they live, binding us together in a way no other  organization does.   What's more, it is one of the oldest institutions in the United  States. In fact, the Postal Service is older than the United States. It  has been operating in some form since 1775 when Benjamin Franklin was  appointed the first Postmaster General by the Continental Congress.   Ensuring that this vital American institution has the tools that it  needs to prosper and serve the American people for years to come is of  the highest priority. This bill does just that. This bill would require  postal employees to enroll in Medicare when they are eligible and  retire. All postal employees already pay into Medicare through their  careers, and the Postal Service has paid about $35 billion into the  program since 1983, and it is the second largest contributor to the  Medicare trust fund.   In short, Postal Service employees have already earned these  benefits. The bill would also eliminate the unfair requirement that the  Postal Service prefund its retiree health benefits for 75 years into  the future, a provision that has already passed the House in previous  Congresses. These two reforms would save the Postal Service nearly $50  billion over 10 years.   I want to emphasize that these changes do not cost American taxpayers  one single dime. In fact, the nonpartisan CBO just last week determined  that this bill would save $1.5 billion over the next 10 years.   In addition to these savings, the bill includes a provision that will  allow the Postal Service to work with States and localities to provide  non-postal service in post office locations. This provision would allow  the Postal Service to more effectively serve communities based on their  individual needs and raise revenue from currently untapped sources.   It is abundantly clear that this bill is good for both the Postal  Service and the American people.   I thank Representative Comer for working diligently with me on this  important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this rule.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 912, I call up the bill (H.R. 3076) to provide stability to  and enhance the services of the United States Postal Service, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials on H.R. 3076.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3076, the Postal  Service Reform Act, which I introduced along with my distinguished  ranking member, Mr. Comer.   I am proud to say that our bill, the bill before us today, is the  result of a truly bipartisan effort from the beginning until our time  on the floor today. We have jointly over 100 cosponsors almost evenly  divided between Democrats and Republicans. And according to the  nonpartisan CBO, this bill actually reduces Federal spending by $1.5  billion over the next 10 years.   The administration also supports the bill's efforts to ``strengthen  the U.S. Postal Service.''   Madam Speaker, I include the President's statement in the Record.                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 3076--postal service reform act of 2022--rep. maloney, d-ny, and                               102 cosponsors         The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3076, the       Postal Service Reform Act of 2022. The United States Postal       Service and its dedicated employees provide an essential       public service and the critical public infrastructure for the       delivery of mail and packages to all Americans in every       corner of the country. The Postal Service provides crucial       support to millions of Americans, including our Nation's       veterans, including by ensuring their ability to vote and       providing access to prescription medications. Furthermore,       the Postal Service is an indispensable complement to and       foundational support for American businesses and communities.        The Administration supports efforts to strengthen the       United States Postal Service, including by providing Postal       employees with the dignity, fair pay, and employer-provided       benefits they have earned. The Administration is committed to       ensuring that the Postal Service delivers the highest       quality, most reliable service possible to every American.       This legislation would advance these goals in several ways.        Under current law, the Postal Service is required to       annually prepay future retirement health benefits, a       requirement not imposed on most other public or private       entities. Consistent with the President's longstanding       commitment, H.R. 3076 would repeal this requirement, which       unfairly and unnecessarily burdens the Postal Service.        H.R. 3076 would also establish a new, separate Postal       Service Health Benefits Program (PSHBP) within the existing       Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), that       integrates Postal employees and annuitants into Medicare.       Making these changes would improve the Postal Service's long-      run financial outlook, without sacrificing quality,       affordable health coverage for Postal employees and retirees.       The Administration is mindful that these reforms would impose       administrative burdens on the Office of Personnel Management       and FEHBP, and further, that there could be potential       challenges with operationalizing Medicare integration and       with ensuring ongoing funding to support administration of       the new PSHPB. The Administration looks forward to working       with Congress to ensure that the goals of H.R. 3076 are met       in an efficient, equitable, and cost-effective manner, while       safeguarding the continued stability of the FEHBP.        Finally, H.R. 3076 would establish new transparency and       reporting requirements for the Postal Service and its       regulator, the Postal Regulatory Commission; require the       Postal Service to provide semi-annual reports to Congress on       the implementation of its strategic plan; provide for a       public dashboard using nationwide delivery metrics to track       delivery performance; and mandate a review of the costing of       competitive and non-competitive products. The Administration       supports these efforts to improve accountability, reliability       and transparency at the Postal Service.     MALONEY of New York. The Postal Service is one of  America's most vital and respected institutions. Originally established  in Article I of the Constitution, for over two centuries it has  provided service across our country to every single address whether you  are in an urban skyscraper or rural family farm. It binds our Nation  together in ways that no agency or organization does, and it adds over  1 million new delivery points every year.   This bill is an agreement to fix some of the serious problems that  have been looming over the post office for years and threatening its  financial stability.   It is an agreement that was reached with input from Democrats,  Republicans, the postal unions, the postal professionals, and a wide  array of private- and public-sector stakeholders. Over 200 different  organizations have come out in support of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a list of the organizations in  support of this bill.

MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, it is an  agreement that contains two major reforms that together will save the  post office over $50 billion in the coming decade.   First, the bill requires postal employees to enroll in Medicare when  they are eligible and retire. All postal employees have already been  paying into Medicare throughout their careers, but not all retirees  could or would enroll when they reached 65. So the bill simply ensures  that Postal Service employees can fully utilize the benefits that they  have already paid for.   Second, the bill will eliminate the unfair requirement that the  Postal Service prepay its retiree health benefits for 75 years into the  future. This commonsense change will help reduce the burden on the  retiree health benefit fund and help it remain solvent.                                time  1430    And the bill would provide Congress and the American people with a  whole new level of transparency and accountability. It would establish  an online, public-facing database that shows weekly service performance  information by zip code.   The bill also requires the Postal Service to continue to deliver mail  6 days a week, using an integrated network, ensuring that Americans can  receive their mail and medications on weekends.   The bill also enables our Postal Service to increase revenue through  nonpostal services, such as selling permits to go fishing or hunting.   I would like to thank my friend, Ranking Member Comer, for his  partnership on this bill and for helping to shepherd it to the floor.  It has truly been a joint effort.   I would also like to thank Representatives Connolly, Lynch, Lawrence,  and Foxx, for their work and dedication and devotion to getting this  bill done.   I also would like to thank Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer,  Whip Clyburn, all of whom supported this and helped move it to the  floor.   Let's do the right thing by all Americans and pass this bill, and  send it to the Senate with a large support from this body.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this historic, bipartisan  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.           Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of             Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, February 8, 2022.      Hon. Carolyn Maloney,      Chairwoman, Committee on Oversight and Reform,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Maloney: I write concerning H.R. 3076, the       ``Postal Service Reform Act of 2021,'' which was additionally       referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce.        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 3076, the Committee agrees to waive formal consideration       of the bill as to provisions that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee. The Committee takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I also request that       you support my request to name members of the Committee to       any conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter       into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of       H.R. 3076.            Sincerely,                                                 Frank Pallone, Jr.      Chairman.                                   ____           Committee on Oversight and Reform, House of             Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, February 8, 2022.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 3076, the ``Postal Service Reform Act.'' As you know,       the bill was referred to the Committee on Oversight and       Reform, with an additional referral to the Committee on       Energy and Commerce, due to provisions in the legislation       that concern health care, including Medicare.        I thank you for allowing the Committee on Energy and       Commerce to be discharged from further consideration of the       bill to expedite floor consideration. This discharge in no       way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Energy and Commerce represented on the conference       committee.        I would be pleased to include this letter and your       correspondence in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration to memorialize our understanding.            Sincerely,                                             Carolyn B. Maloney,                                                         Chairwoman,                                 Committee on Oversight and Reform.     MALONEY of New York.

Madam Speaker, I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, as we have heard many times on the floor today, the  Postal Service is vital to the United States. It is so important that  the Founding Fathers put it in the Constitution, right there under  Article I. They did this because they knew that the Postal Service  would keep our people connected and would ensure that no matter where a  person lives in this country, they can receive mail and other critical  deliveries.   As the gentleman, the dean, from Alaska said, one stamp can take you  from across the street in an urban area all the way to Alaska to some  of the most remote areas. It is a critical, critical service.   Madam Speaker, this bipartisan bill will dramatically improve the  financial situation of the Postal Service--and I would say the country  that depends on it--and enable it to continue performing these  essential services for the American people.   We all know firsthand the incredible job that the postal workers did  during the COVID-19 crisis, risking their lives to deliver our mail  every day. While many of us were quarantined and safe in our homes,  they were out interacting with people every day providing the service.  At times in my district, half the Postal Service was out sick with  COVID because of the interaction that they did to save our lives.   Just as 9/11 was helped so dramatically by the police and fire, along  with the healthcare workers, this COVID crisis was helped dramatically  by the Postal Service. They are really the heroes and heroines of this  crisis.   Madam Speaker, I share my thanks for the support of so many of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle who understand and support the  necessity of these reforms. A vote for this bill is not only a vote for  the post office, I would say it is a vote for yourself, for the  services that we all receive, for America, for our institutions, and  our values.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that lists all the  Members who reached out to indicate that they would have cosponsored  the bill had they had the opportunity to do so.

United States Postal Service,                                      Washington, DC, June 28, 2021.      Hon. Gary C. Peters,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental           Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Rob Portman,      Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and           Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Carolyn P. Maloney,      Chairwoman, Committee on Oversight and Reform, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. James Comer,      Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Reform, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Peters, Chairwoman Maloney, Ranking Member       Portman, and Ranking Member Comer: I want to salute your       leadership in introducing bipartisan, bicameral legislation       to restore the Postal Service to financial sustainability       while advancing service and operational accountability. You       have struck an important balance in the Postal Service Reform       Act, evident by the impressive list of bipartisan original       cosponsors. The American people and the men and women of the       Postal Service will be the beneficiaries of this outstanding       work for years to come.        The Postal Service supports the bill and has provided your       staff with modest technical refinements that we hope will be       adopted as the legislative process advances. We have provided       similar feedback to the Office of Management and Budget at       their request. Postal reform legislation has faltered in past       Congresses when language is added that unsettles the kind of       careful balance you have achieved in this bill. Accordingly,       I would commend your collective resolve in advancing a reform       bill limited to the current set of provisions.        I wanted to particularly comment on Section 202, the       Integrated Delivery Network provision, which as introduced       requires six-day delivery through an integrated delivery       network for market-dominant and competitive products. This       provision sets forth important principles that underlie the       Postal Service's provision of universal mail and package       delivery service and that therefore benefit the American       people. I strongly urge you to retain the wording as       introduced, despite what we consider to be a parochial and       misguided effort to modify or eliminate it.        I have elaborated in an attachment on the reasons this       provision is so essential to our mission.        I look forward to continuing to work with you to advance       the postal reform legislation you have put forward to serve       the interests of the American people. Each of you have       already shown yourselves to be exceptional leaders to       preserve this essential institution and its noble mission.       Please let me how we can assist in your important efforts.            Sincerely,                                                       Louis DeJoy,      Postmaster General, CEO.                                   ____                 an integrated network enables six-day delivery         I offer the following context regarding the merit of the       language proposed in Section 202 of your bill, which would       amend how the Postal Service's universal service obligation       is described in our enabling statute, Title 39 of the United       State Code. Specifically, that provision would amend 39       U.S.C. 101(b) by adding the following: ``The Postal Service       shall maintain an integrated network for the delivery of       market-dominant and competitive products (as defined in       chapter 36 of this title). Delivery shall occur at least six       days a week, except during weeks that include a Federal       holiday or in emergency situations, such as natural       disasters.''        Initially, the Postal Service took the position that it was       not necessary to codify in Title 39 the requirement to       deliver six days a week. We argued the ``Delivering for       America'' plan includes at its core the ``maintenance of       universal six-day mail delivery and expanded seven-day       package delivery reach.'' Recognizing, however, that it is       Congress's prerogative to interpret and define the scope of       the Postal Service's universal service obligation, we       understand the policy goal of including a requirement to       deliver six-days a week in Title 39, rather than continuing       to include it as a rider to annual appropriations       legislation. In particular, we understand that Congress       wishes to make it clear in our enabling statute that it is       appropriate public policy, and in the best interests of the       American people, that the Postal Service provide at least six       days of mail and package delivery as a central aspect of our       universal service mission.        This same rationale applies equally to the language       requiring the retention of the ``integrated network for the       delivery of market-dominant and competitive products''       concept with any codified six-day delivery requirement. This       language properly reflects that the unitary postal delivery       network has delivered letters as well as packages at the same       time and through the same delivery network for well over a       century. American businesses and consumers benefit from the       economies of scope and density resulting from the delivery of       packages across the Postal Service's universal service       network, which reduces the average cost of every mail-piece       in the network and leads to more affordable prices for both       mail and packages. These benefits accrue to other shipping       companies as well, who can access the Postal Service's       delivery network through our Parcel Select product. Overall,       society as a whole benefits from these economies, and there       is nothing unfair or inappropriate about them. Simply put,       and just like 6-day delivery, an integrated network for the       delivery of mail and packages is in the best interests of the       American people.        The Postal Service also considers this language to provide       the appropriate operational flexibility. It does not prevent       us from structuring our delivery network in an optimal       fashion, such as by running special parcel routes as a       supplement to our normal integrated routes when business       conditions warrant. It also does not inhibit our ability to       structure our middle mile processing network in the manner       that we see fit, as it only applies to the delivery of mail       and packages, not processing.         an integrated network enables our universal service mission         Congress has recognized the importance of universal package       delivery, and we see the inclusion of this provision as       consistent with that fundamental principle. In this regard,       the universal delivery of packages is a core component of the       Postal Service's universal service mission. The Postal       Service provides affordable, universal package delivery       services to the American people in all communities whether       urban or rural, and to American businesses of all sizes. This       enables full participation by all Americans in the e-commerce       economy. The importance of this public service mission has       become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now,       more than ever, there can be no doubt that the Postal Service       is part of the critical infrastructure of the country,       providing an essential service to the American people,       delivering packages with life-sustaining medications and       other necessary consumable goods throughout the pandemic, and       thereby shoring up the resilience of our nation.        Not only do competitive products themselves represent an       important service, they also provide critical financial       support to other universal services. Package delivery enables       us to generate revenue that is absolutely necessary to       support the provision of prompt, reliable, and affordable       universal services in a self-sufficient manner, and therefore       critical to our financial sustainability. Our package       products generate an increasingly vital level of contribution       to support the Postal Service's universal service network and       thereby ensure the continued provision of reliable and       efficient universal postal services to all American people       and to all American businesses. Efforts that limit our       ability to compete equally or chip away at our revenue       generation capabilities are contrary to the public policy       goal that we be self-funded while continuing to provide       essential universal service to the nation.        Therefore, if Congress believes that six-day delivery is       critical enough to the universal service obligation to codify       it in Title 39, then as a matter of sound public policy, it       should also recognize the equally critical importance of the       Postal Service providing both mail and package delivery       across an integrated postal delivery network.        I encourage you to retain the language of Section 202 of       the Postal Service Reform Act of 2021 (H.R. 3076/S. 1720) as       introduced.   [[Page H1050]]          MALONEY of New York. And I would again thank Ranking  Member Comer for his partnership on this widely supported bill. It  would not have happened without his partnership, and I am deeply  grateful.   Madam Speaker, with that, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  historic bipartisan bill. We rarely get a chance to vote for a bill  that helps so many people, that actually saves taxpayers money, that  reforms our government, doesn't cost anything. We are just reforming  and making government work better to serve the people. That is what  this bill is. It is a win-win-win in every direction.   Madam Speaker, I hope that this body would unanimously vote for it  and send it to the Senate with a message that they should pass it as  quickly as possible.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Comer, for his leadership,  his friendship, and for the long path we went through together to make  this happen. I thank all my colleagues who participated in making this  happen, particularly our Speaker and our leadership in this Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this manager's amendment to  H.R. 3076, which makes minor technical changes to the bill. We have  already discussed this bill at length so I will be brief.   The Postal Service is one of America's most vital and respected  institutions. Every American benefits from the services it provides.  This bill will dramatically improve the financial situation of the  Postal Service and will allow it to continue providing its essential  services for years to come. The technical changes made by the manager's  amendment will help ensure that the bill is implemented swiftly and  effectively.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment,  but before that, I want to really give my heartfelt thanks to the  Committee on Oversight and Reform, the staff, that made this happen,  particularly Mark Stephenson and Ethan VanNess.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Comer), my friend, the ranking member.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I urge passage of  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
