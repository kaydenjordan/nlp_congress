 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In 2018, Democrat Leader Nancy Pelosi, Leader Hoyer, Whip Clyburn,  and 116 other House Democrats voted to default on the debt, shut down  the government, and refuse disaster relief to devastated communities  across America like mine.    One even said, Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the  White House; responsibility to govern rests squarely on their  shoulders.   Well, right now the Democrats control the House, the Senate, and the  White House. Responsibility rests squarely on their shoulders.   Make no mistake, Democrats have known this day has been coming for 2  years and did absolutely nothing. They passed no budget, passed no  appropriations bills, and they didn't spend a moment in bipartisan  outreach to address the debt ceiling.   I agree, Congress should not play political games with the debt  ceiling, but neither should it ignore the future financial crisis at  risk of accelerating if President Biden and congressional Democrats  pass their nearly $5 trillion socialist welfare plan.   Despite its desperate bid to shift blame for this debt ceiling crisis  Democrats themselves created, increasing America's national debt is  necessary to make room in the so-called Build Back Better bill for  trillions of wasteful spending and special interest handouts for the  wealthy and big business.   Make no mistake, the debt ceiling is not merely about paying for past  spending, it is about making room for new wasteful spending, trillions  that will pour more fuel on the inflation fire that marks Joe Biden's  Presidency, the highest rate in decades, that has robbed families of  their real wage gains from the past 3 years.   Although the President and Democrats in Congress continue to deny  that inflation is real, this is now a crisis for families, and  especially seniors on fixed incomes. Their claims that this costs zero  has been debunked by the independent Congressional Budget Office and  multiple organizations, and fact-checked as false and misleading by The  Washington Post.   And Democrats' insistence that future permanence will be paid for  begs the question they refuse to answer. How? Everyone knows there are  only two ways to raise trillions of dollars more: Tax middle-class  families or rob from entitlement programs like Social Security,  Medicare, Medicaid.   The truth is, the Democrats need this debt ceiling to fund special  interests, give tax subsidies for luxury electric vehicles, and tax  windfalls to millionaires, while the middle class gets nothing, or even  a tax hike.                                time  2340    They need this debt ceiling to give tax breaks to trial lawyers,  local media corporations, and pay 1.5 million workers more to stay home  than go back to work.   Democrats need a quarter of a trillion dollars to lift the SALT cap  so that two out of three millionaires will get a huge tax break.   Meanwhile, for working families, inflation grows worse. Main Street  businesses continue to struggle hard to find workers, and many parents  will pay over $1,000 a month more for childcare under Build Back  Better.   These are President Biden's priorities. Congressional Democrats,  these are their priorities. The question to America is, are these your  priorities? The answer is no, which is why so many Americans  overwhelmingly question the competence of President Biden and Democrats  to lead this country.   I urge a strong ``no'' vote on this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Davidson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Palmer).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, sort of a gentle reminder, 2018 Democratic leader  Nancy Pelosi, Leader Hoyer, Whip Clyburn, and 116 other Democrats voted  to default on America's debt to shut down our government at the same  time and refused disaster relief to devastated communities across  America, including in Texas. And as they said, Republicans controlled  the House, the Senate, and the White House, and the responsibility to  govern rests squarely on their shoulders.   And another gentle reminder to the American public, our Democratic  friends have known this day has been coming for 2 years. This is a  crisis that they created. Didn't bother to pass a budget, didn't do  their appropriations bill, no bipartisan outreach. Waited again and  again for this cliff and created this crisis. It has been frustrating  to watch this go on.   And, too, I know middle-class Americans, one out of every three, will  see a tax hike in the Build Back Better bill, but two out of three  millionaires get a huge tax cut. A quarter of a trillion dollars of  this debt ceiling, a quarter of a trillion dollars of this increase  will go to millionaires and billionaires and other wealthy Americans.                                time  2350    Not to mention the heat your home tax on middle-class families, the  toddler tax on middle-class families, the made in America tax on our  Main Street businesses. What is now clear is that President Biden is a  pay-cut President. Even as most Americans work hard to get ahead in  their careers and their workplaces, they are now falling behind every  month of this Presidency.   They have lost 3 years' worth of real wage growth, went backward in  getting ahead. And just since spring, Americans are losing an average  of $377 a month in real purchasing power.   Who is the party for the middle class and working families? Not  Democrats, who are robbing--inflation--from their paychecks. Adding  another $5 trillion to the inflation fire will only cause prices to  continue to grow faster than paychecks.   The middle class is on the hook for Democrats' handouts to the  highest earners, including their government checks to the top 1 percent  and the biggest corporations, lavish subsidies for luxury electric  vehicles, and tax cuts for the wealthiest.   Over half of families with two kids who pay for childcare will be  forced to pay a $27,000 toddler tax each year under the Democrats'  Washington takeover of childcare. All this hurts American workers and  their families, the poor, and the seniors.   We ought to stop this economic strain. We ought to stop this economic  suppression. We ought to stop this attack on middle-class and working  families. We ought to make progrowth tax reform permanent. It lifted  millions of Americans out of poverty, brought jobs back from overseas,  and, for the first time, started to shrink income inequality.   Madam Speaker, you may remember, in 2019, families in America, their  household income grew more in 1 year under President Trump and the  Republicans than in all 8 years of President Obama and Biden combined.   We believe there is a smarter way to help American working families,  but I know this: Democrats are wrong to fight for $5 trillion of social  spending that will send jobs overseas, limit choice in childcare,  worsen healthcare, and lower paychecks by flaming inflation longer and  making the worker shortage worse.   Madam Speaker, we can't afford this pay-cut Presidency. I once again  urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
