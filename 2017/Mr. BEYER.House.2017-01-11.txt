 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Colonel  Howard Merritt Steele, Jr.   Colonel Steele was the epitome of a soldier. He loved his family, his  country, his God, the Army, and West Point. He attended the prestigious  Peekskill Military Academy, Yale University, and the United States  Military Academy.   Colonel Steele fought in Korea, where he was awarded the Silver Star  for gallantry in action. He received the Bronze Star for his service as  a rifle company commander. After the war, he was company commander in  the 3rd Infantry, The Old Guard, at Fort Myer, Virginia; two tours in  Vietnam; Commander of the 54th Infantry Battalion; and a graduate of  the Army War College.   Colonel Steele's awards include three Bronze Stars, Meritorious  Service Medals, three Legions of Merit, three Air Medals, Army  Commendation Medal, the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm, and a  number of other service and foreign medals.   He is survived by Dotsie, his beloved wife of 65 years; his son,  Howard Merritt Steele, IV; two daughters, Cynthia Steele Vance and  Susan Steele; and six adoring grandchildren.   Colonel Steele, you led a long, brave, generous life of service to  others--a soldier's soldier. Your legacy is a growing family who basked  in your love and a country just and free.                            ____________________
