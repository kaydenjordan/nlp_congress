 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 787, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4566) to amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act to provide relief to nonbanks from certain  stress test requirements under such Act, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4566, the Alleviating  Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act.   Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Poliquin), one of the most hardworking, enthusiastic, cheerful members  of the House Financial Services Committee for all the work that he has  done to advance this very strong piece of bipartisan legislation,  which, incidentally, passed the Financial Services Committee again with  another strong bipartisan vote of 47-8.   Now, the financial crisis led to questions, both domestically and  internationally, about how to address financial stability and create a  regulatory framework to mitigate systemic risk, all the while ensuring  robust economic growth.   At the heart of this bill of the gentleman from Maine is a  recognition that our economy can suffer when we get it wrong, when  government attempts to dictate the business models and operational  objectives of so many of our businesses. It is also a recognition that  one-size-fits-all regulations can stifle economic growth and ultimately  harm consumers and harm our constituents.   Current bank-centric standards and assessments to nonbank industries,  such as the asset management industry, have needlessly saddled Main  Street investors with increased costs while they are trying to save for  college or retirement or some other important need, and this is perhaps  no clearer than in this stress testing regime.   As a former SEC chief economist observed in 2016, who said that, in  the current law, ``stress test the big banks; and, oh, you might as  well go ahead and do the asset management companies.'' That is his take  of what the law says.   In other words, asset management firms that, again, our constituents  depend upon for their retirement security or for their financial  planning are now subject to bank regulations simply because they  operate under the financial services umbrella, even though such firms  plainly have legal, structural, and operational characteristics that  make them very, very different from banks.   By the way, none of the asset managers had anything to do with the  financial crisis that brought about the legislation that we are  debating in the first place. For example, unlike banks, asset managers  do not have access to the deposit insurance fund or the Fed's discount  window.   If that is not enough for you, Mr. Speaker, here is more. Asset  managers are legally separated--legally separated from the funds they  manage, meaning that the asset and liabilities of the manager are  distinct from the assets and liabilities of the funds.   On the other hand, the bank business model directly subjects the bank  to the risks and obligations of its assets and liabilities. Again,  applying a one-size-fits-all regulatory structure--in this case, a  bank-centric model--is not only bad for the asset management industry,  but, far more importantly, for our constituents that they serve, who  choose to save and invest.   Registered funds are the investment vehicle choices for millions of  Americans seeking to buy a home, pay for college, plan for financial  security and retirement. Application of unnecessary, ill-suited, bank- centric stress testing requirements to register funds  [[Page H1713]]  and advisers will undoubtedly increase cost for these funds and  advisers, and, ultimately, this gets passed on to investors without any  corresponding benefits that we can discern.   The recent asset management and insurance report issued by the  Department of Treasury confirms these concerns. The bill of the  gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin) would fix this unequal regulatory  structure by exempting certain nonbank financial institutions that have  not been designated for supervision by the Federal Reserve Board from  the act's stress testing requirement.   Further, in the true spirit of bipartisanship, I want to thank the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) for recognizing the  underlying need for this relief and for working with Mr. Poliquin to  offer an amendment during markup that allows the SEC and the CFTC to  issue regulations to require certain financial companies they supervise  to conduct periodic analysis of the financial condition of such  companies under adverse economic conditions.   The approach is common sense. It is not one size fits all. It  recognizes that the primary regulator of nonbank financial companies is  better suited than a bank regulator to determine whether these stress  tests might be useful to address risk. And it recognizes that, as a  general matter, stress testing asset managers is difficult and often  needless.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this great  bipartisan legislation. I believe we have an amendment forthcoming from  the ranking member, which I expect our side of the aisle to support. I  am led to believe that, with the adoption of her amendment, she would  support the underlying bill. I hope that proves to come to fruition, in  which case we can have a very strong bipartisan vote on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin), who is the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), who is the vice chairman of our Financial  Services Committee and the chief deputy majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I am just amazed that anybody from North  Carolina, after being beaten by Texas A&M by 21 points, would make any  allusion to basketball whatsoever. I trust our next speaker will not  make that mistake.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Luetkemeyer), who is the chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), who is the vice chairman of the Financial  Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Williams), who is the vice chairman of the Financial  Services Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), who is a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to encourage all of my colleagues to  support H.R. 4566, the legislation from the gentleman from Maine. I  want to commend him once again. He is one of our most hardworking  members on the committee, and he cares passionately about his  constituents in Maine.   I also want to commend him for once again working on a very  bipartisan basis. He has managed to change his bill from its original  concept many times to try to garner more support from the other side of  the aisle.   With the acceptance of the ranking member's amendment, again, I am  hopeful that we will have a very, very strong vote in the House. Again,  this came out of committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 47-8.   Mr. Speaker, very often we debate regulation. I think that now,  fortunately, we have a 3 percent growth Tax Code which has been passed  by Congress, but, unfortunately, I do not believe we have a 3 percent  growth of finance in the banking system.   That is important. It is important to our constituents who still need  credit to buy that first home, a factory worker who needs to get their  transmission repaired so that they can go to work, some parent trying  to send a kid to college, or people trying to plan for their  retirement.   Too often, I think we have a dichotomy between regulation and  deregulation, when the real dichotomy is between smart regulation and  dumb regulation. It is always incumbent upon us in Congress to look  very carefully at these regulations. Sometimes they look very good on  the chalkboard, but in reality, they don't quite render the results or  benefits that we had hoped for. So we always have to take a look at  what this is doing not just to consumer and investor protection, but  what it is doing to economic growth as well.   I agree with the ranking member. Stress testing is a good concept. It  is one of the reasons why banks and other financial firms typically  stress-test themselves daily, weekly, monthly, annually.   What doesn't make sense, though, is that there be no recognition to  the cost that it imposes, as the gentleman from Missouri, the chairman  of our Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee, was  very articulate in reminding us that these submissions can cost us  millions and millions of dollars. The reports are not measured in  pages; they are measured by the pound. There can be 10- and 20-pound  submissions of paper that we wonder if anybody ever reads.   But what especially doesn't make sense is trying to apply a bank  stress test to a nonbank financial institution, particularly an asset  manager. I know the ranking member was talking a little bit earlier  about using an analogy to auto inspections: It makes no sense to have  the home inspectors inspect your auto; it makes no sense to have the  auto inspectors inspect your home.   The gentleman from Maine is ensuring that whatever stress test is  applied, it is applied properly to the business model that needs to be  tested for its potential stress of our financial system.   So, again, I just want to commend the gentleman from Maine for his  hard work, and I urge all Members to vote in favor of H.R. 4566  because, indeed,  [[Page H1717]]  maybe it is not a catchy title, but it is an accurate title. As we  alleviate stress test burdens, we do help investors.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to claim the  time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 20, 2018, on page H1717, the following appeared:   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Speaker, I am not thrilled with the amendment,  but in the spirit of compromise and the spirit of bipartisanship, we  have worked with the ranking member and the sponsor of the legislation.  It wouldn't be my preferred approach, but that is often what we do  around here.   I want to thank the ranking member for working with the majority side  in order to advance this, again, as a very strong bipartisan vote in  the House, which I hope and anticipate with the inclusion of this  amendment.   I would point out, Mr. Speaker, again, I am very happy. On the other  side of the Capitol, they have recently advanced a number of kind of  smart regulatory measures and capital formation measures. We look  forward to negotiating with our friends in the Senate. I am hoping that  an overwhelming vote on a bill like H.R. 4566 is one that could be in a  final package before it goes to the President's desk.   Again, I still think that, although we have all compromised a little  something here, I think we all advance our principles. I think it is  something that will help, actually, both financial stability and  investor protection, including protecting their opportunities to have a  better future.   So again, I want to thank the ranking member for working with us, and  I would urge the House to adopt her amendment and adopt H.R. 4566 by  Mr. Poliquin of Maine.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
