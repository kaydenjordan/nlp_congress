 Mr. President, I come forward today to recognize  the 100th anniversary of Lehman Caves National Monument, the precursor  to Great Basin National Park. Today, Great Basin National Park is a  77,000-acre expanse known for its natural beauty and wonderful trails.  The Lehman Caves Monument has been managed by the National Park Service  for more than half a century, prior to the creation of the larger park.  Lehman Caves attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year,  providing them with the opportunity to explore underground wonders.   The caves themselves were first used by Native Americans and later  ``rediscovered'' by settlers in the late 1880s before President Warren  Harding established Lehman Caves National Monument on January 24, 1922.  This declaration provided for custodians of the caves to make  improvements, including much-needed repairs and the creation of safer  routes for tourists to explore the caves' beauty. In the 1930s,  President Franklin Roosevelt transferred control of Lehman Caves to the  National Park Service, enhancing work to repair and rehabilitate the  caves. The caves were then added to the larger National Park  legislation that officially created Great Basin National Park, which  was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan  on October 27, 1986. As a part of Great Basin National Park, Lehman  Caves remains accessible today through tours led by park rangers.   Further, the quarter-mile long cavern is filled with spectacular  geological formations, including stalactites, stalagmites, popcorn, and  a wavy rock pattern of colorful flowstone, commonly referred to as  ``cave bacon.'' The cavern is also home to a number of unique species.  The Great Basin cave pseudoscorpion and the Lehman Caves millipede, for  example, were first found in Lehman Caves and exist only in Great Basin  National Park. From its geology to its ecosystem, Lehman Caves has  provided visitors with an experience unlike any other in the world.   The joy that outdoor recreation brings Nevada's residents and  visitors is invaluable, and the ongoing success of monuments and parks  like Lehman Caves is yet another reason that we must work to keep our  natural resources healthy and available for future generations. From  Lehman Caves to Lake Tahoe, Nevada's public lands are treasured by  visitors and locals alike.   I am pleased to recognize Lehman Caves' 100 years of official service  to our great State, and I wish Great Basin National Park staff well in  continuing their work to preserve and enhance the park for many years  to come. Nevadans are fortunate to have this precious natural wonder in  our State, and we will continue to protect it as a part of our home.                            ____________________
