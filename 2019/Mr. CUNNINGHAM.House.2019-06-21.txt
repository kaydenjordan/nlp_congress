 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my bipartisan  amendment which makes clear that no funding made available by this bill  can be used to carry out another wasteful round of base realignment and  closure, or BRAC.   Folks in the Lowcountry still remember the disastrous effects BRAC  had on our economy in the past. Our region lost more than 20,000 jobs,  according to some estimates, after the 1993 BRAC Commission recommended  the closure of the Charleston Naval Shipyard.   My amendment would make sure that the Joint Base Charleston, Parris  Island, Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, and the Beaufort Naval  Hospital do not suffer the same fate.                                time  1000    Combined, these important national security assets are estimated to  account for nearly $13 billion in economic impact and support 78,000  jobs.   But this amendment isn't just about preserving my district's economy.  It is also about fiscal responsibility. The last BRAC round in 2005  cost taxpayers over $35 billion and is not expected to save even one- third of that.   This is funding that should have gone to rebuilding our military and  improving its readiness but was, instead, spent devastating military  communities across the country.   This is why I am asking that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  join me in supporting this amendment, which will ensure that military  communities in the Lowcountry and across the Nation are spared the  effects of another reckless BRAC round.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, in closing, I thank the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) for joining me in offering this amendment. I also  thank Chairman McGovern and my colleagues on the Rules Committee for  allowing this important amendment to come to the floor for debate.   I ask that my colleagues vote in favor of this amendment to ensure  that our military's limited resources are not wasted on another round  of BRAC.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment, which  would further emphasize our need to ensure our military is prepared for  the ever-growing risk of climate change and rising sea levels. To that  end, my amendment would make sure further DOD construction projects  meet military resilience standards.   I have said time and time again that climate change is our greatest  nonmilitary threat, but climate change also poses a significant threat  to our military's readiness. Nowhere is this clearer than in the  Lowcountry, which is home to some of our Nation's most critical  national security assets. Parris Island, one of only two military bases  that makes enlisted marines and the only military base that makes  female enlisted marines, faces frequent flooding and could be flooded  for over a third of the year by 2050.   Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, the only place in the world where  pilots are trained to fly the F-35B, faces similar flooding risks,  which threaten to disrupt training and fielding of these aircraft.   Just this year, Joint Base Charleston was identified by the Air Force  as one of the top five bases most susceptible to the risks associated  with climate change.   I am offering this amendment because it is imperative that these  important defense assets are prepared, not only because they are  critical to our national security, but also because they are an  indispensable part of our economy in the Lowcountry.   Combined, these important national security assets are estimated to  account for nearly $13 billion in economic impact and support 78,000  jobs in our district.   Mr. Chair, this is an urgent issue that threatens military  installations across this Nation, so I ask that my colleagues join me  in support of my amendment and the readiness of our Armed Forces.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Chair, in closing, I thank the gentlewoman from  Florida for speaking in favor of my amendment and for all of her hard  work in constructing this year's Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs appropriations bill.   This legislation makes significant investments toward ensuring our  men and women in uniform have the facilities they need to keep our  Nation safe and improving services at the VA. I hope my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle join me in supporting my amendment as well as  the underlying bills.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
