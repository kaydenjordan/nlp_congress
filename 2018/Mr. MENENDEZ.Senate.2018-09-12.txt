 Mr. President, I rise today to oppose President Trump's  nominee for Commissioner of the IRS, Mr. Charles Rettig. Now more than  ever, the American people need government officials who are willing to  stand up and speak truth to power. Unfortunately, Mr. Rettig failed to  convince me that he is up for that part of the job.   During his time before the Senate Finance Committee, on which I  serve, Mr. Rettig gave me no indication that he would protect New  Jerseyans facing the threat of double taxation under the tax bill  passed by this Congress and signed into law by President Trump late  last year, nor did Mr. Rettig express any respect for the rights of  States to administer their own constitutionally upheld charitable  contribution tax credit programs. Instead, Mr. Rettig left me all but  certain that he would be a rubberstamp for this administration's  politically motivated tax policies and would allow a backdoor tax  increase on countless middle-class families. At a time when we need  independence and impartiality at the IRS, that is absolutely  unacceptable.  [[Page S6123]]    As we speak, the Treasury Department and the IRS are trying to make  sense of the deficit-exploding corporate tax cuts rushed through  Congress by the Republican majority last December--tax cuts that,  according to the Congressional Budget Office, will drive us toward  trillion-dollar annual deficits by 2020 and by undermining the  Affordable Care Act, eventually will strip 13 million Americans of  their healthcare coverage.   As the IRS attempts to implement these misguided policies,  corporations are pulling every string to rig the Tax Code in their  favor. Apparently, it wasn't enough for them to get a massive trillion- dollar tax windfall from President Trump. So now they are amassing  armies of accountants and legions of lobbyists to get even more out of  the IRS. That is why drug companies are rushing to reclassify their  cash stocked overseas as assets so they can pay a fraction of what they  would otherwise owe. That is why oil companies are drilling into the  law to find new loopholes in the way we tax foreign profits. CEOs want  no stone left unturned, no loophole left unopened.    But there is one group that is not getting any special access or  sweetheart deals, and that is middle-class families like those in my  home State of New Jersey. I have said before and I will say again that  the Trump tax bill was one giant hit job on New Jersey's middle class  and that of States similarly situated.   You would think that with $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, Republicans  could have cut taxes for everyone. Yet, under the Trump tax plan, 40  percent of New Jersey taxpayers will either face an average tax  increase of $2,100 or get no tax cut at all. That is because  Republicans gutted the State and local tax deduction, which 1.8 million  homeowners across my State alone depend on to avoid being taxed twice  on the same money. These people aren't high rollers. They weren't born  into multimillion dollar trust funds. They are middle-class families  who work hard for everything they have.   As you can see, 83 percent of New Jerseyans who deduct their property  taxes make under $200,000 a year. Nationwide, half of all taxpayers who  claim these deductions make under $100,000. In New Jersey, the average  deduction totals about $18,000 per filer--far above the arbitrary cap  imposed by Donald Trump and his corporate-sponsored Republican  Congress. It means the average New Jersey taxpayer who itemizes their  returns could lose $8,000 in deductions this year alone.   Even the President's own top economic adviser agrees. Larry Kudlow  made this quote before he was Director of the National Economic  Council, which means the quote is really clear and unvarnished in its  truthfulness. He said:         When you end the state and local deduction, because rates       are still relatively high, you are going to hurt a lot of       different people. So the internal logic was not good and this       is not a true tax-reform bill.    Only in Washington could Republicans borrow $2 trillion from China to  cut taxes for big corporations and still need to hike taxes on New  Jersey families and families like New Jersey families in other States  in order to pay for it. That is exactly what Republicans did by capping  the State and local tax deduction and hitting our middle class with an  even higher property tax burden.   But we New Jerseyans aren't known for being pushovers. That is why,  last December, several mayors across our State allowed homeowners to  prepay their 2018 property taxes before Trump's harmful policies took  effect in January. That is why, back in May, I proudly joined Governor  Phil Murphy as he signed a new law to shield homeowners from higher  property tax burdens.   Under this program, homeowners who contribute to a State-approved  charity may receive a property tax credit worth up to 85 percent of  those donations. In this regard, New Jersey didn't reinvent the wheel  with this new law. It was modeled after existing tax credit programs on  the books for at least 32 other States. All of those here in red offer  tax credits to residents who contribute to certain charities.   In our case, we are not shielding families from higher property tax  bills but making sure New Jersey has the resources needed to keep cops  on the beat, firefighters on the job, and New Jersey schools on the  cutting edge.   The IRS has consistently respected these programs. Back in 2011, the  Chief Counsel of the IRS released an advisory memo clarifying that  State tax credits do not--I repeat--do not prohibit taxpayers from  writing off the full value of their charitable donations from their  Federal taxes. In other words, getting a tax credit doesn't mean you  made more money, and thus you shouldn't be taxed more as a result. That  is what is happening across the land in all of these 32 States.   It is not just the IRS that upheld these programs. This issue has  gone before the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court ruled that  these tax credits are not considered things of value but rather amount  to ``the government declin[ing] to impose a tax.''   So let's review. The IRS never had a problem with the 32 other States  who had charitable deduction tax credit programs on the books--never.  The IRS never had a problem; that is, until New Jersey and States like  New Jersey decided to create one--until New Jersey and similar States  decided to create one. As soon as New Jersey and other States  established this perfectly legal tax credit program, the IRS suddenly  decided to reverse course. All of a sudden, they are willing to go to  court over this and challenge a well-established precedent.   Apparently, the Trump administration is so intent on sticking it to  New Jersey and States like New Jersey that they are willing to  jeopardize all of these programs in all of these States--all of them,  all of them.   Let me give a few examples of these programs that will be endangered  if Mr. Rettig fails to stand up for the rights of States. In Alabama,  there is a program that offers families a 100-percent tax credit for  contributing to private school scholarship funds. In Missouri, there  are several very worthy programs that offer tax credits for  contributions--one for shelters for domestic abuse survivors, another  for donations for campuses focused on the STEM fields. There are tax  credits for donating to State colleges in Indiana, water conservation  in Colorado, and public road construction in Arkansas. There are  similar programs in Missouri, Kansas, and Georgia.   I could go on and on, but here is the bottom line: At least 30 State  tax credit programs are now in jeopardy because the Trump  administration changed the rules in the middle of the game--changed  their previous counsel's decision, changed course from what the Supreme  Court said.   I have heard a lot of lip service from my colleagues about States'  rights over the years. They are all about States' rights--until it  comes to States like New Jersey and their rights.   Some say that President Trump and the Republican Congress capped the  property tax deduction because they have it out for so-called blue  States. But at the end of the day, the States most affected by this  foolish policy aren't red States or blue States; they are America's  blue-chip States, America's innovation States, America's economic  powerhouse States.   New Jersey didn't become an economic powerhouse by accident. Our  success wasn't born overnight. It is the result of the priorities we  set and the investments we make.   Take it from Kathryn, a constituent of mine from New Jersey. She  wrote to me after she saw what happened with the tax bill:         My husband and I pay nearly $13,000 a year in property       taxes to the town of Oradell. For this, we receive excellent       services and have reputable public schools. I pay taxes to       the state of NJ which support our infrastructure, other       cities, and necessary programs.        I am fine paying what I already pay. That being said, I       feel very strongly that it is unacceptable to be taxed on       taxes that I already pay.    Kathryn is right. She is right. It is no coincidence that New Jersey  claims more in State and local tax deductions than other States in the  Nation and also has some of the best schools in the Nation. We pay for  them. Yet, with the Trump tax scam, Republicans want us to pay for them  twice.   The Federal income tax system has historically allowed taxpayers to  deduct the taxes they pay at the local level. This is one of the  longest standing deductions in the Nation's history--to deduct from  their Federal returns--and for good reasons. States  [[Page S6124]]  that invest in education, infrastructure, and opportunity for all have  higher per capita incomes, enjoy more prosperity, and rely less on  Federal handouts. These are the types of investments that make New  Jersey a great place to live, work, and raise a family.   You don't have to take my word for it. Earlier this year, Save the  Children named New Jersey the No. 1 place in America to raise a child.  I want it to stay that way.   In New Jersey, we invest in public schools because we know that they  prepare students to compete in high-paying fields like biotechnology,  sustainable agriculture, and medicine. In New Jersey, we invest in  public health and law enforcement because we know we are all better off  when our streets are safe and our families are healthy. In New Jersey,  we invest in mass transit and infrastructure because we know it  connects workers with opportunities to climb the income ladder.   We do these things for a reason. New Jersey is stronger when we open  the doors of opportunity for as many people as possible. We see it  here: State investments, better education, higher wages, a stronger  middle class, top three States by SALT deduction. They also do  incredibly well in educational achievement and income. There is a clear  correlation.   But the Republican Congress has put these job-creating, economy- growing, opportunity-expanding investments in the crosshairs by gutting  the property tax deduction. In the process, they are threatening the  validity of legitimate programs operating in 30 other States.   The Federal Tax Code has always worked to ensure that Americans don't  pay taxes twice on their hard-earned money; that was until Donald Trump  came along. Then Republicans abandoned their so-called fiscal  conservatism, and together they passed a tax scam that subjects  hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans, and many more in other States,  to double taxation.   For as long as I can remember, I have heard my Republican colleagues  preach about protecting, not punishing, success. But the Republican tax  law is a tax on New Jersey's success, slamming hundreds of thousands of  families with higher property tax burdens, not in a few years, not in a  decade--no, right now--now. It is not fair, and it is not right. It is  wrong to force New Jersey families to pay more just so that big  corporations and wealthy CEOs can pay less.   In the end, I can't in good conscience support this nominee. He will  not protect New Jersey's middle class--and those in other States like  it--from higher property tax bills. He will not respect perfectly legal  State-based programs like those 32 other States that offer tax credits  in return for contributions to nonprofits that do critical work in  their communities. He will be nothing more than a Republican  rubberstamp for President Trump's politically motivated tax policies.  The last thing we need is an IRS that is politically weaponized.   Whether you want to take a stand against double taxation or you don't  agree with the Trump administration's politically motivated assault on  the rights of States to set their own tax policies, I hope Republicans  and Democrats alike will join me in voting down this nomination.  Taxpayers in New Jersey and across the Nation deserve better than tax  policies that knock the knees out from underneath them and an IRS  Commissioner who kicks them while they are down.   I yield the floor.
