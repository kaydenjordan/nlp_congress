 Mr. Speaker, I mistakenly voted ``no,'' when I meant to  vote ``yes'' on rollcall No. 285.                             personal explanation    Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, the man who has served as a father figure  to me for the past twenty years has taken a turn for the worse in his  battle against cancer and his health is rapidly deteriorating. As such,  I have returned home and will miss votes today, Thursday, May 25. Had I  been present, I would have voted: ``NAY'' on rollcall No. 283, ``YEA''  on rollcall No. 284, and ``YEA'' on rollcall No. 285.                            ____________________
