 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Sergeant  Jim Smith, who died tragically in the line of duty this past Friday  night in Iowa.   Sergeant Smith honorably served as an Iowa State trooper for 27  years. He was an incredible man who loved his family, his State, God,  his fellow troopers, and his community in Independence, Iowa.   My heart goes out to his wife, Kathy, and their two children. I hope  that the family can find some comfort in knowing that he died a hero  protecting his community, as he did every day for well over two  decades.   Sergeant Smith and his service and sacrifice for Iowans will never be  forgotten.                            ____________________
