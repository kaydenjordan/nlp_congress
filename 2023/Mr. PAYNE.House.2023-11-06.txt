 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for the  opportunity to discuss this very important issue.   I rise today to oppose the Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2024.   Today is a monumental day for transportation in America. It is the  day the Biden administration announced billions of dollars in funding  for much-needed transportation projects and the day that the  Republicans brought this bill to the floor to cut funding designated to  make transportation in this country safer.   The differences are severe. The Biden administration is building and  repairing bridges and subway tunnels to make American transportation  more efficient. Republicans seem to want to make it more dangerous.   Here are a few of the drastic cuts Republicans want to enact:   They want to cut $7 billion in funding from the Department of  Transportation.   They want to eliminate the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity  Passenger Rail program. This program funds projects to improve rail  performance and expand it into underserved communities.   They want to cut Amtrak funding by 65 percent and cut it by 92  percent in the most populous Northeast corridor.   In addition, they want to cut funding for Consolidated Rail  Infrastructure and Safety Improvements Program grants in half. This  program funds rail safety technology, eliminates deadly railroad  crossings, and installs safety fencing around the Nation's rail  network. It will save lives across the country, but Republicans want to  cut it anyway.   In the process, they are showing the American people they do not care  about their safety nor their transportation system.
