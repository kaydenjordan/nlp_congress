 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this very  shortsighted amendment.   As the chair of the Congressional Arts Caucus, I strenuously disagree  with the idea that this funding is wasteful or nonessential. Frankly, I  think the amendment demonstrates a real misunderstanding about the  nature of diplomacy.   The Art in Embassies program was established 60 years ago by  President John F. Kennedy. President Kennedy knew something important:  Art is a bridge. It forges connections, and it starts conversation that  we may not otherwise be able to have. In addition, it is one of the  best ways to reflect our American values, ideals, and our culture  abroad.   Over 20,000 participants globally have taken part in the program,  which has presented exceptional works by American and host country  artists in over 200 diplomatic properties around the world. It has also  engaged over 200 American artists as cultural envoys, participating in  workshops, collaborative art projects, and public events, all to  strengthen ties with local communities.   The program does all of this on a shoestring budget, primarily  facilitating donations from artists. It is not a frivolous expense. It  is a tool of diplomacy just as valid as any bilateral meeting or  negotiation. It reflects our vibrant democracy.   I urge Members to oppose this amendment.
