 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5673) to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster  Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to make technical corrections to  the hazard mitigation revolving loan fund program, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5673         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Safeguarding Tomorrow       through Ongoing Risk Mitigation Technical Corrections Act''.       SEC. 2.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5673.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5673. This bill will make  technical corrections to the STORM Act, which was enacted in the 116th  Congress.   The STORM Act is bipartisan and bicameral legislation that created a  hazard mitigation revolving loan fund that helped States and Tribal  governments finance mitigation projects. This bill corrects clerical  errors in the enacted language of the STORM Act.   I urge my colleagues on both sides to join with me and support this  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5343) to direct the Administrator of the  Federal Emergency Management Agency to submit a report to Congress on  case management personnel turnover, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5343         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``FEMA Caseworker       Accountability Act''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON STAFF TURNOVER.         Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to Congress a report containing--        (1) the turnover rate for case management personnel of the       Federal Emergency Management Agency;        (2) the average and median length of employment for the       personnel described in paragraph (1);        (3) the steps that the Agency is taking, or plans to take,       to lower the rate of turnover for the personnel described in       paragraph (1);        (4) the number of personnel of the Agency that is detailed       to work disaster recovery and then return to such personnel's       full time assignment after a disaster, disaggregated by full-      time, part-time, temporary, and contract personnel; and        (5) the average time and median length of the rotations of       personnel described in paragraph (4) and how often rotations       and reassignment of personnel occur for each disaster       recovery position and function, disaggregated by full-time,       part-time, temporary, and contract personnel.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5343, as  amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5343. This bill addresses  the high rate of turnover for disaster case management personnel at  FEMA.   FEMA's case management personnel are critical to the disaster  recovery process. They help survivors access basic needs such as  housing, childcare, and transportation assistance.   This legislation requires FEMA to provide a report to Congress with  data on case management personnel turnover and any Agency plans to  reduce turnover.   I urge my colleagues on both sides to join with me and support this  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5547) to amend the Public Works and Economic  Development Act of 1965 to require eligible recipients of certain  grants to develop a comprehensive economic development strategy that  directly or indirectly increases the accessibility of affordable,  quality care-based services, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES.         (a) In General.--Section 302(a)(3)(A) of the Public Works       and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C.       3162(a)(3)(A)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``and'' before ``balances resources''; and        (2) by inserting ``, and directly or indirectly increases       the accessibility of affordable, quality care-based services,       including child care, early childhood education, disability       and long-term care, and elder care'' after ``sound management       of development''.        (b) Guidance.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall issue       guidance on implementing the amendments made by subsection       (a), to include how to increase access to the affordable,       quality care-based services described in section 302(a)(3)(A)       of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42       U.S.C. 3162(a)(3)(A)) in a comprehensive economic development       strategy developed under section 302 of such Act.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5547, as  amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the Care  is an Economic Development Strategy Act.   I would like to start by honoring my coauthor of this bill, who  recently passed away unexpectedly, Congressman Don Young, the longest- serving Member of this body, the dean of the House. As my partner on  this bill, I got to see his dedication to serving the people up close.   Even though he is no longer with us in this Chamber, I know that  Congressman Young would be proud that the full House is considering the  bill we worked so hard on together to help our kids and our  communities.   We authored this legislation with a simple idea in mind: Investing in  care will help get people back to work, create good-paying jobs, and  create a stronger economy for everyone.   I know this firsthand as the working mom of my 6-year-old son, my  Carter Cakes. My ability to be standing before you today is dependent  on making sure that my Carter Cakes is safe and cared for. Let me tell  you all, it can even be difficult for families like mine.   When I was pregnant with Carter, we struggled to find childcare that  was affordable and accessible. Today, it is up to my husband, Leslie,  and me to make sure that Carter continues to be cared for so I can  serve the people.   Just this month, my husband had to take a day off from his job so  that I could make a last-minute trip to D.C. when school was closed for  a teacher workday. Later that same week, it was my turn. It became  ``Bring Carter to Work Day.'' So, in Atlanta, Leslie traveled to do his  job, and I was home with Carter as he attended many Zoom sessions in  Congress.   We have made it work, but unfortunately, during this pandemic, not  everyone has been as lucky as my family.   Earlier this week, I visited Our House, a childcare center in my  district that serves some of the most marginalized families, families  experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity. One of the providers  told me that, during the height of the pandemic, a parent told her that  she had to reopen because: ``Corona may kill me, but poverty definitely  will if I can't go to work and provide for my family.''                                time  1245    Care is not a luxury; it is a lifeline. Women, especially women of  color, have been forced to drop out of the labor market at record rates  during the COVID pandemic. This impacts the prosperity of our families  and our economy at large.   Care is an economic development strategy, and it is time that we  treated it like one. My CEDS Act will ensure care accessibility is  prioritized for all communities and all constituents.   Currently, economic development districts must consider  transportation access, workforce development, technology use, and  environmental protection when creating their comprehensive economic  development strategies. Right now, there is no mention of considering  quality, affordable care-based services. The CEDS Act would simply add  this as a consideration.   This bill will treat childcare, early childhood education,  disability, long-term care, and eldercare as essential to communities'  economic development. When we do this, we can help folks return to  work, provide for their families, and invigorate our economy while  knowing that their loved ones are in good hands.   I bring this bill before you today for every caregiver who has been  forced to leave the workforce, for every working parent who has given  up on finding a solution that works, for every person who feels forced  to choose between their loved ones and their livelihoods. It doesn't  have to be this way, y'all.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, for  our children, our seniors, and our families nationwide.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                      Washington, DC, March 7, 2022.      Hon.

In order to       permit H.R. 5547 to proceed expeditiously to the House Floor,       I agree to forgo formal consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 5547 in light of our       mutual understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration       of H.R. 5547 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this or similar legislation moves       forward with regard to any matters in the Committee's       jurisdiction.

Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 5547.

Dear Chairwoman Waters: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 5547, the Care is an Economic Development Strategy Act.       I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation.        I acknowledge that by foregoing formal consideration on       H.R. 5547, the Committee on Financial Services does not waive       any future jurisdictional claims to provisions in this or       similar legislation, and that your Committee will be       consulted and involved on any matters in your Committee's       jurisdiction should this legislation move forward. In       addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number  [[Page H3992]]       of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       provisions within this legislation on which the Committee on       Financial Services has a valid jurisdictional claim.        I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation,       and I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R.       5547.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation as care is an economic development strategy.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (S. 2938) to designate the United States Courthouse  and Federal Building located at 111 North Adams Street in Tallahassee,  Florida, as the ``Joseph Woodrow Hatchett United States Courthouse and  Federal Building'', and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2938         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JOSEPH WOODROW HATCHETT UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE                     AND FEDERAL BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The United States Courthouse and Federal       Building located at 111 North Adams Street in Tallahassee,       Florida, shall be known and designated as the ``Joseph       Woodrow Hatchett United States Courthouse and Federal       Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       United States Courthouse and Federal Building referred to in       subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the       ``Joseph Woodrow Hatchett United States Courthouse and       Federal Building''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 2938.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2938, which designates the  Federal Building at 111 North Adams Street in Tallahassee, Florida, as  the Joseph Woodrow Hatchett United States Courthouse and Federal  Building.   Born during the days of segregation, Judge Hatchett grew up in  Clearwater, Florida. He graduated from Florida A&M University in 1954  and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army.  He entered Howard University School of Law in 1956, and when he took  the Florida Bar Exam in 1959, Jim Crow regulations prevented him from  staying in the hotel where the test was administered.   After admission to the Florida Bar, Judge Hatchett entered private  practice in Daytona Beach, practicing criminal, civil, administrative,  and civil rights law in State and Federal courts.   A series of judicial appointments that began in 1971 ultimately led  to his placement on the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals by  President Jimmy Carter in 1979, making Judge Hatchett the first Black  man appointed to a Federal appeals court in the Deep South. Judge  Hatchett retired from the bench in 1999 and passed away in April of  2021 at the age of 88.   A House companion to this bill, H.R. 4771, was introduced by  Congressman Lawson and had the support of the entire Florida  Congressional delegation. The Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure passed H.R. 4771 in 2021.   Madam Speaker, I support S. 2938, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, S. 1226, which names  the United States courthouse in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, after Judge  Sylvia H. Rambo.   S. 1226 was introduced by Pennsylvania Senators Casey and Toomey, and  a House companion was introduced by Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure member, Representative Scott Perry, and cosponsored by  several members of the Pennsylvania delegation.   Upon introduction of the bill, Senator Casey said: ``Judge Rambo's  trailblazing career serves as an ongoing inspiration to countless young  women across the Commonwealth, the Third Circuit, and the entire  Nation. Her dedication to the judiciary is unparalleled, and there is  no better way to honor her service to our Nation than by naming the new  Federal courthouse in Harrisburg after her.''   Senator Toomey said: ``As the first woman to serve on both the  Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas for Cumberland County and on the  bench of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Judge Rambo is a  trailblazer. During her time on the bench, Judge Rambo has served  Pennsylvania with great integrity and distinction. I am proud to  introduce this legislation honoring a Pennsylvania public servant with  Senator Casey.''   The courthouse is currently under construction. Upon completion, it  will contain a total of 8 courtrooms and 11 chambers. Tenants for this  new courthouse are the U.S. Courts, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S.  Attorneys, U.S. Trustees, Homeland Security, and Federal Public  Defender.

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 233, to designate the  Rocksprings Station of the U.S. Border Patrol in Rocksprings, Texas, as  the Donna M. Doss Border Patrol Station.   Donna Doss was a U.S. Border Patrol agent who served for 16 years on  the Del Rio Border Patrol. On February 2, 2019, while working, Agent  Doss was struck and killed by a vehicle.   Agent Doss was a wife, a daughter, a sister, a stepmother, and a  colleague who was mourned by her community. S. 233 will recognize Agent  Doss' tragic passing and sacrifice, and I ask for the bill's adoption.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (S. 2126) to designate the Federal Office Building  located at 308 W. 21st Street in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as the ``Louisa  Swain Federal Office Building'', and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2126         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. LOUISA SWAIN FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The Federal Office Building located at       308 W. 21st Street in Cheyenne, Wyoming, shall be known and       designated as the ``Louisa Swain Federal Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       Federal Office Building referred to in subsection (a) shall       be deemed to be a reference to the ``Louisa Swain Federal       Office Building''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  [[Page H3995]]  all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 2126.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2126, which names the Federal  office building located at 308 West 21st Street in Cheyenne, Wyoming,  as the Louisa Swain Federal Office Building.   In 1869, Wyoming became the first State or territory in the U.S. to  continuously recognize women's voting rights as equal to the voting  rights of men. Louisa Swain was the first woman to vote under that law.  When she cast her vote in the general election of 1870, she was 70  years old. It would be another 50 years before women's voting rights  were recognized in the rest of the country.   Swain, born in Norfolk, Virginia, was orphaned by the age of 10. She  married and moved to Baltimore, where she and her husband raised four  children before moving to Wyoming. Shortly after voting in the 1870  election, Swain and her husband returned to Baltimore, where Swain died  in 1878.   S. 2126 was sponsored by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis and Maryland  Senator Chris Van Hollen, and cosponsored by Maryland Senator Ben  Cardin and Wyoming Senator John Barrasso. In October 2008, Congress  passed a resolution making September 6, 2008 ``Louisa Swain Day.''   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support and highlight the history of  voting rights in this country. I support this legislation and I  encourage my colleagues to join me. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation in the spirit of voting rights in this  country, and I yield back the balance of my time.
