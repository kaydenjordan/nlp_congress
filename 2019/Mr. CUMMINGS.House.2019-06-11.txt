 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration is engaged in one of the most  unprecedented coverups since Watergate, and it is not just about  Russia. It is so much broader than that. This coverup spans across  numerous investigations, and it extends from the White House to  multiple Federal agencies of government to completely separate outside  parties.   The administration officials now question the fundamental basis of  Congress to conduct oversight. They object to committee rules and  precedence that have been in place for decades under both Republican  and Democratic leaders, and they make baseless legal arguments to avoid  producing documents and testimony. The Trump administration is  challenging the very constitutionality of congressional oversight, and  it is happening in broad daylight.   Several weeks ago, President Trump vowed, ``We're fighting all the  subpoenas.'' Since then, he has refused to work on legislative  priorities such as infrastructure until Congress halts oversight and  investigations of his administration. He wants us to forgo our  responsibility under the Constitution as a condition of passing laws to  help our constituents and his constituents.   The President's arguments are baseless. He suggests that all  subpoenas that Congress puts out are partisan and somehow related to  the Russia probe, but that is simply not correct. In the Oversight and  Reform Committee, we have issued eight subpoenas: six of them are  bipartisan and none of them are about Russia. They involve issues like  the census, immigrant children being locked in cages and separated from  their families, and the President's finances.                                time  1445    This entire year, the White House has not produced one document to  the Oversight and Reform Committee. Let me say that again: In all of  our investigations, the White House has not produced one single shred  of paper in response to our requests.   The hurricanes in Puerto Rico, the White House has produced nothing.  Security clearance abuses, the White House has produced nothing.  Efforts to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, the White House  has produced nothing. Hush-money payments, the White House has produced  not a thing. Even on issues like spending taxpayer dollars to pay for  private jets, the White House has produced absolutely nothing.   Over and over again, it does not matter what the topic is, the  tactics are the same. This begs the question: What are we covering up?   Tomorrow, our committee will vote on whether to hold the Attorney  General and the Secretary of Commerce in contempt of Congress for  refusing to produce documents relating to the Census. Again, these  subpoenas are bipartisan, and this issue has nothing to do with Russia.  Yet, the Trump administration has delayed, stonewalled, obstructed, and  challenged the authority of the Congress on even those questions.   I support today's resolution because it makes clear that in addition  to seeking criminal contempt on the House floor, committees may seek  authority to enforce their subpoenas directly in civil court actions.  Nobody is above the law.    Mr. Speaker, nobody is above the law, not even the  President of the United States.   Today's resolution reaffirms that Congress has the independent  authority under the Constitution to investigate waste, fraud, abuse,  and wrongdoing so that we can pass laws that are effective and  efficient on behalf of all of our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.
