 I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks), my  friend and colleague from the Hoosier State.   Looking back over the last year under the leadership of this  President and single-party rule, for a guy who wants my team to win, my  team is not the Republican Party, Madam Speaker. It is the great United  States of America. It is my children, quite frankly. Personally, it is  my children who I want to inherit the blessings of liberty and  opportunity in this great country.   That is our greatest calling, to hand this country back better than  we found it, take on the challenges that face our country, work  together to solve the problems, and make this a better, stronger,  safer, more prosperous, more free Nation for the next generation. That  has not happened, not even close, not even close.   I am disappointed to say that this President and his colleagues in  the Democratic Party have absolutely failed our country. I didn't say  they were bad people. In fact, there are many of them I would call  friend and proudly. As a team elected by the American people to do the  job I outlined, they have failed miserably. As we say in west Texas on  Saturday morning after Friday night lights, when we are looking at the  film, the eye in the sky doesn't lie. If you look at the footage, you  watch the film, you can't help but see one self-inflicted disaster  after another.   Madam Speaker, let's start with the tone and the promise to unify  this country and its leaders, to usher into this Chamber and to  politics and political rhetoric civility and unity. That is a big F.   This President, I would say, took more unilateral actions and, along  with his Democrat leaders in Congress, have jammed through more  partisan bills than they have worked together to address the issues  facing this country. We are more divided today than we were.   If our Speaker, Ms. Pelosi, would actually focus on the things that  would be required to prevent another riot on this Capitol, then you  would have the Capitol Police and the Inspector General of the Capitol  Police saying, we are better prepared than we were a year ago. We are  actually less prepared today because there has been so much hyper- partisanship and so much political weaponization and theater than there  has actually been real governing of our great country. So there is the  tone which is failure.   The most important job of the Federal Government is to provide for a  common defense. It is the safety and security of the American people. I  know you have heard Chairman Banks. I am sure the remarks today have  been replete with the debacle in Afghanistan and the sadness with which  all Americans watched that. At the same time that they watched this  needless, senseless incompetence, they saw America's credibility slip  quickly, not only with our enemies but with our allies. I don't know if  there was ever a time that the American troops packed up and left with  Americans, our fellow citizens, crying out because we left them behind.   There is a litany of problems with what happened in Afghanistan. This  President is ultimately responsible. He didn't listen to his advisors.  People died. Our troops, we spent 20 years and trillions of dollars, we  lost the lives of our sons and daughters in uniform to the tune of  roughly 2,400. What do we have to show for it besides that  embarrassment of a withdrawal?   I live in Texas. We are at ground zero with respect to the chaos at  the border and the record number of people and crime activity and drugs  that are powering into our country. This President has been derelict in  fulfilling his sacred duty to uphold the law, plain and simple.   Worse, working with his Democrat colleagues in this Chamber, they  have poured fuel on the fire that is burning out of control at the  border by saying we will give you more carrots. We will create more  incentives. We will turn the volume up so that people will come in by  the millions with the offer of reparation, with the offer of  citizenship, mass amnesty, the ability to vote in our elections.   You can't make this up, but this border crisis is real. The American  people who live along the border feel like this President and their  government has given up on them and has failed them. I would agree.   With respect to the economy, I know we had a tough job for all  Americans and all leaders for both parties to get us up and out of the  recession related to the pandemic. For this President and my Democrat  colleagues, to put policies in place that incentivize people to stay at  home rather than to go back to work, I am talking about enhanced  unemployment policies. I am talking about welfare expansion without  work requirements, actually a repeal of work requirements. To put  massive amounts of government spending into the marketplace, it is no  wonder that we are seeing runaway inflation in every corner of our  marketplace and in every good and every service that our working  Americans depend on.                                time  2015    The majority of Americans who live paycheck to paycheck have lost  almost $400 a month on account of the real wage decrease because of  inflation, self-inflicted, one after another, and the state of the  Union is more fragile now than ever. It is less hopeful than it was 1  year ago.   I don't see any posture of change or relenting on the horizon from  this President, even with these startling statistics and facts that are  laid out plainly for everybody to see. I am not bashful to give blame  or credit to either side when it is due, but this is a one-party rule.  We haven't even talked about the crime spree, we haven't talked about  the promises made and broken with respect to COVID, the authoritarian  mandates in one breath and action and in another breath saying that we  are going to work together and defer to States, this isn't a Federal  solution. I am confused. I am concerned.   I have got to say 1 year in review is bleak and dismal. I don't say  that with partisan glee, I say it with tremendous sadness and with  profound grief over the opportunities lost in a backslidden country  where we can do so much better. We have done better together.  Republicans don't have all the answers. I don't have all the answers.  But this has not been the great, strong, and constructive leadership  that our Nation has seen in the past from, quite frankly, from both  parties.   So I hope and pray, Madam Speaker, that this President will hear not  my voice but the voices of the American people, the voices who cried  out from the will of the people in Virginia where the We the People  wave has begun, and that we will make changes, and that he will focus  on the real needs; he will stop placating the left, which seems to  [[Page H214]]  be the MO and has been for the last year, and start focusing on the  priorities that are important to the American people and to working  families: safer neighborhoods; a secure border; strong, effective, and  respected military and law enforcement; real growth; real  opportunities; real wage increases like we saw when we cut taxes; and  just a better quality of life and better hope over the horizon for our  children.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Banks for allowing me to be a part of  today's Special Order.
