 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  joint resolution (H.J. Res. 27) making further continuing  appropriations for fiscal year 2019, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 27         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That the       Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (division C of Public Law       115-245) is further amended by striking the date specified in       section 105(3) and inserting ``February 1, 2019''.         This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Further       Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 27, currently under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we are now in the 25th day of the Trump shutdown, the  longest Federal Government shutdown in United States history.   This past Friday, hundreds of thousands of dedicated Federal  employees went without a paycheck. It is shameful that the stubborn  whims of this President have harmed the security of America's public  servants. That includes Federal law enforcement officials at the FBI,  the very Secret Service agents who protect the President, and those who  work tirelessly to protect our air travel, our national parks, our  environment, and public health.   The bill before us is the seventh--let me repeat, the seventh--piece  of legislation Democrats have put on the House floor to end the Trump  shutdown and get the government back to work for the American people.  It will reopen government through February 1, providing time for  Congress to come to a full-year agreement without further jeopardizing  vital services or the pay of Federal workers.   It is long past time that Senate Republicans join us to reopen the  government, pay our Federal employees, and then negotiate on border  security and immigration policy. Madam Speaker, I hope that my  colleagues across the Capitol come to their senses and end this  shutdown.   I urge support for this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), my good friend, an outstanding  legislator, who is the chair-designate of the Energy and Water  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.    Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), my good friend,  who is the chair-designate of the Military Construction, Veterans  Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, it is time to end the Trump shutdown.  Let's vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
