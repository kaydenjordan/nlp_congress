 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share with you the  inspiring story of a Philadelphia doctor who has gone above and beyond  the call of duty in this extraordinary time to combat the  disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black and Brown communities in  my district and across the country.   As evidence mounted that Black Americans were suffering both from  greater exposure to COVID-19 and from less access to testing, Dr. Ala  Stanford, a board certified surgeon, was done waiting. She took the  community into her own hands, as so many Black women have done when our  institutions have failed them, and she recruited a group of Black  healthcare workers to form the Black Doctors Consortium.   Staffed by Black doctors, med students, and nurses on their days off,  the Black Doctors Consortium has spent the past few months using their  own resources to test thousands of patients in church parking lots,  union halls, and rec centers, going into our communities to deliver  testing services where they are most needed.   The group recently received a $1 million grant to expand and plans to  start testing 250 to 350 people a day.   Looking ahead, the Black Doctors Consortium plans to use their  successful community-based approach to distribute COVID vaccines once  they become available.   Dr. Stanford represents the very best of who we are and the  leadership we so desperately need in times of crisis.   I thank Dr. Stanford and her entire group for their courage and  commitment to addressing inequality with direct action.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on this busy legislative day, I would  like to focus my attention on both the George Floyd Justice in Policing  Act and the Emergency Housing and Relief Act.   The sickening police murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor,  Rayshard Brooks, Ahmaud Arbery, Elijah McClain, and so many other Black  Americans have rightfully brought our country to a place of moral  reckoning that is long overdue. We must confront the harsh truths about  racism in our country.   Black lives do matter and changing our systems will take each and  every one of us. This bill is a start.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act will end no-knock warrants,  ban chokeholds, it will limit the transfer of military-grade machinery  in local police forces, it will create a national registry to prevent  the worst police officers from simply transferring to another police  force when they have been found guilty of misconduct.   The Justice in Policing Act is the reform that Americans are  demanding to  [[Page H2437]]  enact real change. This bill must be the starting point for  negotiations with the Senate, not empty gestures from Senate  Republicans or the White House.   We are a country in desperate need of leadership, both to make the  change needed for a civil society and to navigate the economic and  health challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle may choose to deny that  we are in the middle of a pandemic, but we have seen in recent days  that we are far from out of the woods.   Our constituents are struggling, in no small part due to the White  House's single-minded focus on the stock market rather than American  families, but while the White House and congressional Republicans are  denying science and peddling in conspiracy theories, House Democrats  are working to help American families.   The Emergency Housing and Relief Act will help those families by  providing rental assistance, helping landlords, homeowners, and those  experiencing homelessness by providing billions in grants to help cover  rent and other fees, as well as expanding the moratorium on evictions  and foreclosure.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation,  because it is vital to the health and well-being of American families.
