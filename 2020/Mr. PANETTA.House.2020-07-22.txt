 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Great  American Outdoors Act.   In my district on the central coast of California, we protect, we  promote, and we never put a price on our environment. Partly because it  is what drives our local economy, but also we appreciate what it means  for those after us.   By fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund, this bill  ensures the type of necessary care needed for our National Parks,  forests, and critical wildlife areas. This is needed today, because  those treasures have been put under extreme pressure with this  pandemic, but also previously with increased visitors and decreased  budgets.   That is why this legislation is so important, as it will not only  address needed infrastructure projects and deferred maintenance, but  also because it will promote conservation, recreation, and access to  the outdoors.   By passing this bipartisan bill that ensures investments in our parks  and forests, we are ensuring that our natural treasures, our postcards  to the future, actually get delivered to future generations.
