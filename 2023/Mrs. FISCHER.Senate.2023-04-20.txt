 Madam President, this Presidential administration has  consistently been marked by egregious overreach. Over the past few  months, we have seen them trying to regulate everything from our State  water to our personal retirement funds. Now the Biden administration  wants to control which cars Americans are able to drive.   Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency issued new regulations  cracking down on vehicle emissions. These new standards make it harder  for people to drive gas-powered cars in an attempt to coerce Americans  into purchasing new electric vehicles, or EVs--vehicles that cost about  as much as the average family makes in a year.   These regulations are part of a so-called emissions plan, but there  is nothing realistic about what the Biden administration is trying to  do. The administration says it wants 67 percent of the cars in this  country to be electric by 2032--just 9 years from now. Last year, EVs  only accounted for 6 percent of new car sales. And the International  Energy Agency predicts that, by 2030, EVs will only make up 15 percent  of the vehicles in our country.   We need to tell it like it is. The White House's plan is based on the  speculative wish that EVs will make an inconceivable jump from a tiny  fraction of our vehicles to the majority of them in less than a decade.  The so-called plan is really a pipe dream, and the facts show that the  EPA's goals are highly unlikely, if not impossible. The administration  is using its imagination to try and create a world that real Americans  don't even want, and, in the process, it is ignoring the many  complexities at play when it comes to electric vehicles.   Let's talk about some of those complexities.   Electric vehicles rely on the electric power grid, and a massive  increase in EV use, like the Biden administration wants, could cause  serious issues with the grid. During a heat wave last September, power  authorities in California had to ask residents to avoid charging their  electric cars in the evenings for fear that the power grid would  malfunction from being overwhelmed.    Imagine what would happen if EV use increased exponentially like the  Biden administration wants. If EV use is going to increase, it should  be a natural growth driven by consumers rather than an artificial spike  manufactured by the government. That way, power producers and  electrical grids would have time to grow and adapt to new spikes in  electricity demand.   The EV mandate also overlooks some serious public safety concerns.  Electric vehicles can weigh up to three times as much as gas-powered  cars because of their heavy batteries. The force of an EV hurtling  toward another car in a crash is intensified by all that weight. A  heavy EV accidentally crashing into a lighter, older car is a recipe  for severe injury or death--the heavier the car, the higher the risk of  fatality in a crash.   The Biden administration itself admits this. National Transportation  Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said that she was ``concerned about  the increased risk of severe injury and death for all road users from  increasing size, power, and performance of vehicles on our roads,  including electric vehicles.''   I would point out that this safety risk disproportionately affects  women. A report released last month by the Government Accountability  Office found that crash tests, which identify car safety issues that  might endanger passengers in an accident, don't use physiologically  accurate female dummies. Some only use male dummies. They don't even  attempt to test car safety on the female body. This is part of why  crashes injure and kill women at higher rates than men. Before  mandating a rush of electric vehicles on the roads, the Biden  administration needs to find a solution to the risk these cars can  pose, especially to women.   Heavy cars, like EVs, put extra stress and damage on our roads as  well. Their weight pulverizes the roadbed, causing more maintenance,  more upgrades, and more costs. But, right now, only gas-powered cars  pay into the highway trust fund, or the HTF, which provides 90 percent  of Federal highway assistance. This fund repairs wear and tear from  vehicles on the highway. The sale or charging of EVs doesn't contribute  anything to the highway trust fund, but the highway trust fund exists  to fix exactly the type of damage that heavy EVs can cause. So it is  only fair that both gas-powered and electric vehicles pay into that  fund.   I plan to introduce a bill soon that would fix this discrepancy. We  need to do this to address some of the complexities at play with  electric vehicles and especially a unilateral government mandate that  would push for so many on our roads so soon.   The electricity and road concerns related to EVs should be enough to  temper the Biden administration's fanciful ambitions for a massive  electric vehicle push, but the repercussions of a Federal EV mandate go  beyond America's borders. We know that China completely dominates the  EV battery supply chain, and, you know, that is not going to change  anytime soon, as 60 to 100 percent of all battery minerals are  processed in China, according to an energy think tank known as SAFE.  Our domestic supply--well, it is not anywhere near the demand that  would result from this new legislation.   And it is so ironic that many of the same activists who support an  electric vehicle mandate oppose--they oppose--the U.S. mining needed to  make EV batteries. They would rather use horrible mining practices in  other countries and support very dangerous working conditions for those  miners.   Also, this means that a push for EVs is a push for energy dependence  on China, and China, we all know, is not our friend, as news this week  about a secret Chinese police station in New York City reminds us. Our  turbulent relationship with the Chinese Communist Party means it will  use any dependence that we have on China to its own advantage.   Americans don't want to rely on China for our vehicles, but studies  also show that Americans aren't even interested enough in EVs to merit  a government mandate. A recent Pew Research poll found that the  majority of Americans opposes the Biden administration's plan to phase  out gasoline-powered cars and trucks by 2035. A Gallup poll found that  4 percent of Americans own an EV--4 percent--and that only 12 percent  are seriously considering getting one. And 41 percent claim that they  would never buy an EV.   Sixty percent of people say they think EVs are too expensive. The  price of EVs would have to come down by about $15,000 for the average  American to see them as real competitors to gas-powered cars.   Americans have the right to buy electric vehicles if they so choose,  and I support that right, but they should also have the right not to  buy one. Our government is supposed to be of the people, by the people,  and for the people, but, frankly, this Federal mandate is of the EPA,  by the EPA, and for the EPA. It is not based on the interests of the  American people, only the interests of a power-hungry White House.   President Biden is prioritizing electric vehicles--and, by extension,  the small slice of Americans that wants and can afford EVs--without  adequately considering the effects of a top-down government mandate on  energy security and the lives of the American people.   In closing, the Biden administration's plan for a utopia of perfectly  green vehicles is a cute idea, but it is completely out of touch with  reality. It is also out of touch with Americans' real needs and  desires.   This administration has got to stop with these top-down mandates that  force Americans into outcomes that  [[Page S1284]]  they wouldn't choose themselves. In the meantime, I hope my Senate  colleagues will join me in advocating for what Americans really want  and pushing back on this administration's overreach.   I yield the floor.                                    S. 870
