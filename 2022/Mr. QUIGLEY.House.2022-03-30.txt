 Madam Speaker, as we stand here on the House floor,  Ukrainians are bravely defending their country against an illegal  invasion by Russian forces ordered by Vladimir Putin.   We have seen hospitals attacked and mothers and children crushed by  the rubble. We have seen civilians fleeing this tragic conflict via  humanitarian corridors, agreed to by the Russian Government, attacked  by Russian troops. We have seen a theater-turned-shelter, with the word  ``children'' clearly displayed, reduced to rubble.   The blood of all of these innocents lost in this senseless war is on  the hands of one man: Vladimir Putin.   Ukrainians are standing up to this tyrant. They are fighting to stop  the advance of an autocratic leader who has launched an illegal,  premeditated invasion.   Yet, if you listen to certain prominent voices, you will hear some  conservative leaders not condemning Vladimir Putin's war, not praising  the heroism of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, Ukrainian troops,  and Ukrainian citizens. No, they are instead lauding the so-called  genius of a violent, power-hungry dictator.    There is a term we use in politics for people who propagandize for a  cause whose goals they don't understand and who are then used by the  cause's leaders: useful idiots.   I will not purport to know if the individuals who are praising Putin  and spreading misinformation genuinely believe their own words, but I  do know that Putin finds them useful.   There is a concerningly long list of American conservatives who have  turned themselves into Putin's useful idiots. When the invasion first  began, one host claimed on his news show that Ukraine was not a  democracy. This is the very same lie that Putin himself has used in the  effort to justify his invasion of Ukraine. In fact, these comments were  aired on Russian state television, and a member of the Russian Defense  Ministry's public council said these remarks were excellent.   Another conservative voice has used her platform to criticize  Zelenskyy and echo Russian propaganda, including a Kremlin talking  point that Russians created Ukraine, which has been used to justify  this invasion. Her social media posts have been amplified and shared by  other Russian accounts.   Even our own former President has praised Putin, calling the horrific  invasion of Ukraine ``genius.'' A Member of this very body called  President Zelenskyy a ``thug'' and the Ukrainian Government  ``incredibly evil.''   Exactly 2 weeks ago, every Member of this body had an opportunity to  hear from President Zelenskyy directly as he joined us virtually from  Ukraine's capital. His bravery and courage were on full display. He is  a hero.   Vladimir Putin is a thug, and the repeating of these lies by American  voices is playing into his hands. Aiding Putin in this way is not just  disturbing because of the role it plays in enabling his messaging of  this premeditated invasion; it also speaks to a broader trend among  some American conservatives toward sympathizing with autocrats that  should worry us all.   Last year, I spoke before this body to condemn conservative American  pundits who were praising Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Like  Putin, Orban is an autocratic leader who wields strict control of the  media, restricts LGBTQ rights, and suppresses free speech. At that  time, I expressed my concern at what this may indicate about the  growing sympathy for autocrats in our own country. Unfortunately, this  latest trend of praising Putin and condemning Zelenskyy tells me the  slide toward autocracy continues.   Praise for autocratic leaders and what they represent is dangerous.  At a time when political polarization has reached new heights and  American vulnerability to misinformation is increasing, we cannot  afford to watch anyone of influence, whether they be a  [[Page H3975]]  Member, or a member of the media, peddle in propaganda.   Conservatives should shake off the role of useful idiots and present  Putin, this war, and all demagogic leaders as what they truly are.   Vladimir Putin has poisoned journalists and jailed his opposition. He  has bombed hospitals and schools. He has slaughtered innocents in  Syria. Today, he is murdering civilians in Ukraine.   If this has not been enough for these useful idiots and their ilk, I  urge them to find the red line Putin would have to cross.   To the puppets that are on our screens, our social media, and in the  Halls of Congress perpetrating his lies, I say: Enough. You are helping  Putin in this war. You are helping him strip Ukrainians of their  freedom. You are helping our own country slide further from democracy.   Lincoln reminded us that we cannot escape history, that we will be  remembered in spite of ourselves. In the end, history will remember  those who stood up for the truth and the cowards who did not.                            ____________________
