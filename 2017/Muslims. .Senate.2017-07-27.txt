REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF GOVERNMENT OF NORTH                     KOREA AS A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The United States Government designated the Government       of North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism on January 20,       1988.        (2) On October 11, 2008, North Korea's designation as a       state sponsor of terrorism was rescinded, following       commitments by the Government of North Korea to dismantle its       nuclear weapons program. However, North Korea has failed to       live up to these commitments.        (3) On October 22, 2015, the U.S. Special Representative       for North Korea Policy with the Department of State testified       before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism,       Nonproliferation, and Trade that North Korea's ``conduct       poses a growing threat to the United States, our friends in       the region, and the global nonproliferation regime'' and the       Deputy Coordinator for Homeland Security, Screening, and       Designations with the Department of State noted that       ``weapons transfers that violate nonproliferation or missile       control regimes could be a relevant factor for consideration,       depending on the circumstances, consistent with the statutory       criteria for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism''.        (4) The Government of North Korea has harbored members of       the Japanese Red Army since a 1970 hijacking and continues to       harbor the surviving hijackers to this day.        (5) On July 16, 2010, in the case of Calderon-Cardona v.       Democratic People's Republic of Korea (case number 08-01367),       the United States District Court for the District of Puerto       Rico found that the Government of North Korea provided       material support to the Japanese Red Army, designated as a       foreign terrorist organization between 1997 and 2001, in       furtherance of a 1972 terrorist attack at Lod Airport, Israel       that killed 26 people, including 17 Americans.        (6) In the case of Chaim Kaplan v. Hezbollah (case number       09-646), a United States district court found in 2014 that       North Korea materially supported terrorist attacks by       Hezbollah, a designated foreign terrorist organization,       against Israel in 2006.        (7) In June 2010, Major Kim Myong-ho and Major Dong Myong-      gwan of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau pled       guilty in a South Korean court to attempting to assassinate       Hwang Jang-yop, a North Korean dissident in exile, on the       orders of Lieutenant General Kim Yong-chol, the head of North       Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau. The court sentenced       each defendant to 10 years in prison.        (8) In March 2015, the South Korean government concluded       that North Korea was responsible for a December 2014 cyber       attack against multiple nuclear power plants in South Korea.       The South Korean government stated that the attacks were       intended to cause a malfunction at the plants' reactors, and       described the attacks as acts of ``cyber-terror targeting our       country''.        (9) On December 19, 2015, the Federal Bureau of       Investigation (FBI) concluded that North Korea was       responsible for a cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment       and a subsequent threat of violence against theaters that       showed the film ``The Interview''. The FBI concluded that the       ``Guardians of Peace,'' which sent the threat to Sony       Pictures, was a unit of North Korea's Reconnaissance General       Bureau, its foreign intelligence service.  [[Page S4530]]         (10) South Korean and Malaysian authorities have alleged       that officials from North Korea's secret police and Foreign       Ministry were involved in the poisoning and killing of the       estranged half-brother of the country's leader, Kim Jong-nam,       using the chemical weapon VX nerve agent, a substance banned       for use as a weapon by the United Nations Chemical Weapons       Convention, on February 13, 2017, in Kuala Lumpur.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress       that the Government of North Korea should be designated as a       state sponsor of terrorism.        (c) Determination.--Not later than 90 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall       submit to the appropriate congressional committees a       determination as to whether North Korea meets the criteria       for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.        (d) Form.--The report required by subsection (c) shall be       submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified       annex, if appropriate.        (e) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate; and        (B) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives.        (2) Foreign terrorist organization.--The term ``foreign       terrorist organization'' means an organization designated by       the Secretary of State as a foreign terrorist organization       under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8       U.S.C. 1189).        (3) North korea.--The term ``North Korea'' means the       Democratic People's Republic of Korea.        (4) State sponsor of terrorism.--The term ``state sponsor       of terrorism'' means a country the government of which the       Secretary of State has determined, for purposes of section       6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C.       4605(j)) (as in effect pursuant to the International       Emergency Economic Powers Act), section 620A of the Foreign       Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371), section 40 of the       Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2780), or any other       provision of law, is a government that has repeatedly       provided support for acts of international terrorism.                                  ______                                     SA 539.

PROTECTING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AGAINST CYBER                     ATTACKS FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Authoritative evidence and testimony to Congress       indicate that the United States Government cannot prevent       cyber attacks by determined and capable adversaries from       reaching critical infrastructure in the United States and       that, absent major efforts to identify and eliminate       vulnerabilities in the most critical nodes of the most       critical infrastructure, such attacks would succeed in       causing unacceptable damage to the United States.        (2) To secure the United States against cyber attacks, it       is necessary to develop deterrence capabilities through a       combination of offensive cyber attack means and greater       survivability, resilience, and recovery capabilities in the       critical infrastructure of the United States.        (3) Defense of the United States against cyber attacks from       foreign adversaries, including foreign governments, is a       responsibility of the Federal Government.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Federal Government should provide funding in a       collaborative effort with the owners of the most critical       infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities to cyber attacks       in the most critical nodes and develop solutions either       through alternative equipment and practices, or by assured       redundancy and recovery capabilities; and        (2) Government funding should also help cover the cost of       any inefficiencies caused by changes in equipment, practices,       or recovery capabilities to protect critical infrastructure       against cyber attacks from foreign governments.        (c) Analysis and Solution Designs.--The President shall--        (1) conduct an analysis of cyber vulnerabilities in the       most critical nodes of the most critical infrastructure; and        (2) design solutions to eliminate such vulnerabilities.        (d) Report.--        (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to       Congress a report on the vulnerabilities identified under       paragraph (1) of subsection (c) and the solutions designed       under paragraph (2) of such subsection.  [[Page S4539]]         (2) Contents.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall       include the following:        (A) A description of the vulnerabilities identified under       paragraph (1) of subsection (c).        (B) A description of the solutions designed under paragraph       (2) of such subsection.        (C) A strategy for working with owners of relevant critical       infrastructure to eliminate vulnerabilities identified under       subsection (c)(1).        (D) An estimate of the cost of carrying out the strategy       included under subparagraph (C) and a schedule to implement       such strategy.

ENHANCEMENT OF CYBER CAPABILITIES OF UNITED STATES                     ALLIES AND PARTNERS IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC                     TREATY ORGANIZATION.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (commonly known       as ``NATO'') remains a critical alliance for the United       States and a cost-effective, flexible means of providing       security to the most important allies of the United States.        (2) The regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin is       actively working to erode democratic systems of NATO member       states, including the United States.        (3) According to the report of the Office of the Director       of National Intelligence dated January 6, 2017, on the       Russian Federation's hack of the United States presidential       election: ``Russian efforts to influence the 2016       presidential election represent the most recent expression of       Moscow's longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal       democratic order.''.        (4) As recently as May 4, 2017, the press reported a       massive cyber hack of French President Emmanuel Macron's       campaign, likely attributable to Russian actors.        (5) It is in the core interests of the United States to       enhance the offensive and defensive cyber capabilities of       NATO member states to deter and defend against Russian cyber       and influence operations.        (6) Enhanced offensive cyber capabilities would enable the       United States to demonstrate strength and deter the Russian       Federation from threatening NATO, while reassuring allies,       without a provocative buildup of conventional military       forces.        (b) Sense of Congress on Cyber Strategy of the Department       of Defense.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Secretary of Defense should update the cyber       strategy of the Department of Defense (as that strategy is       described in the Department of Defense document titled ``The       Department of Defense Cyber Strategy'' dated April 15, 2015);       and        (2) in updating the cyber strategy of the Department, the       Secretary should--        (A) specifically develop an offensive cyber strategy that       includes plans for the offensive use of cyber capabilities,       including computer network exploitation and computer network       attacks, to thwart air, land, or sea attacks by the regime of       Russia President Vladimir Putin and other adversaries;        (B) provide guidance on integrating offensive tools into       the cyber arsenal of the Department; and        (C) assist North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners,       through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Cooperative       Cyber Center of Excellence and other entities, in developing       offensive cyber capabilities.        (c) Strategy for Offensive Use of Cyber Capabilities.--        (1) Strategy required.--The President shall develop a       written strategy for the offensive use of cyber capabilities       by departments and agencies of the United States Government.        (2) Elements.--The strategy developed under paragraph (1)       shall include, at minimum--        (A) a description of enhancements that are needed to       improve the offensive cyber capabilities of the United States       and partner nations, including North Atlantic Treaty       Organization member states; and        (B) a statement of principles concerning the appropriate       deployment of offensive cyber capabilities.        (3) Submittal to congress.--Not later than 180 days after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall       submit to the congressional defense committees the strategy       developed under paragraph (1).        (4) Form of submittal.--The strategy submitted under       paragraph (1) may be submitted in classified form.        (d) International Cooperation.--        (1) Authority to provide technical assistance.--The       President, acting through the Secretary of Defense and with       the concurrence of the Secretary of State, is authorized to       provide technical assistance to North Atlantic Treaty       Organization member states to assist such states in       developing and enhancing offensive cyber capabilities.        (2) Technical experts.--In providing technical assistance       under paragraph (1), the President, acting through the North       Atlantic Treaty Organization Cooperative Cyber Center of       Excellence, may detail technical experts in the field of       cyber operations to North Atlantic Treaty Organization member       states.        (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall       be construed to preclude or limit the authorities of the       President or the Secretary of Defense to provide cyber-      related assistance to foreign countries, including the       authority of the Secretary to provide such assistance under       section 333 of title 10, United States Code.                                  ______                                     SA 585.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE UNITED STATES STRATEGY FOR                     AFGHANISTAN AND SOUTH ASIA.

       (2) to secure the national security interest of the United       States in Afghanistan, the United States should pursue an       integrated civil-military strategy with strategic objectives       to--        (A) deny, disrupt, degrade, and destroy the ability of       terrorist groups to conduct attacks against the United       States, its allies, and its core interests;        (B) prevent the Taliban from using military force to       overthrow the Government of the Islamic Republic of       Afghanistan and reduce the Taliban's control of the Afghan       population;        (C) improve the capability and capacity of the Government       of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, to the extent       feasible and practicable, to defeat terrorist and insurgent       groups as well as to sustainably and independently provide       security throughout Afghanistan;        (D) establish security conditions in Afghanistan necessary       to encourage and facilitate a negotiated peace process that       supports political reconciliation in Afghanistan and an       eventual diplomatic resolution to the conflict in       Afghanistan; and        (E) forge a regional diplomatic consensus in support of the       long-term stabilization of Afghanistan through integration       into regional patterns of political, security, and economic       cooperation;        (3) the United States should pursue an integrated civil-      military strategy that would achieve United States strategic       objectives by--        (A) bolstering the United States counterterrorism effort in       Afghanistan by--        (i) increasing the number of United States counterterrorism       forces in Afghanistan;        (ii) providing the United States military with status-based       targeting authorities against the Taliban, the Haqqani       Network, al-Qaeda, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and       other terrorist groups that threaten the United States, its       allies, and its core interests; and        (iii) pursuing a joint agreement to secure a long-term,       open-ended counterterrorism partnership between the United       States and the Government of the Islamic Republic of       Afghanistan, which would include an enduring United States       counterterrorism presence in Afghanistan;        (B) improving the military capability and capacity of the       Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANSDF) against       the Taliban and other terrorists groups by--        (i) in the short term, establishing United States military       training and advisory teams at the kandak-level of each       Afghan corps, and significantly increasing the availability       of United States airpower and other critical combat enablers       to support Afghan National Security and Defense Forces       operations;

(2) Discriminatory pricing.--For the purposes of paragraph       (1), a cost based reasonable pricing formula that is utilized       shall be considered to result in discriminatory pricing if       the contract for sale of the drug, biologic, or other health       care technology places a limit on supply, or employs any       other measure, that has the effect of--        (A) providing access to such drug, biologic, or technology       on terms or conditions that are less favorable than the terms       or conditions provided to a foreign purchaser (other than a       charitable or humanitarian organization) of the drug,       biologic, or technology; or        (B) restricting access to the drug, biologic, or technology       under this section.        (c) Waiver.--No waiver shall take effect under subsection       (a) before the public is given notice of the proposed waiver       and provided a reasonable opportunity to comment on the       proposed waiver.

SHARK FIN TRADE ELIMINATION.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Sharks are critically important species for their       economic, cultural, and ecosystem value.        (2) Many shark populations are in peril worldwide and are       on the decline.        (3) One of the greatest threats to sharks is the global       trade in shark fins. It is estimated that fins from as many       as 73,000,000 sharks end up in the global shark fin trade       every year.        (4) Shark fins have no medicinal or nutritional value.        (5) The trade in shark fins is primarily focused on large       coastal and pelagic species that grow slowly, mature late,       and have low reproduction rates.        (6) Shark fins are often removed and retained while the       remainder of a shark is discarded due to the high market       value of shark fins relative to other parts of a shark.        (7) Shark fins are removed primarily to be commercialized       as a fungible commodity.        (8) Shark finning is the cruel practice in which the fins       of a shark are cut off on board a fishing vessel at sea. The       remainder of the animal is then thrown back into the water to       drown, starve, or die a slow death.        (9) Although the United States has banned the practice of       shark finning aboard vessels in waters controlled by the       United States, there is no Federal ban on the removal and       sale of shark fins once the fin is brought ashore.        (10) Once a shark fin is detached from the body, it becomes       impossible to determine whether the shark was legally caught       or the fin lawfully removed.        (11) It is difficult to determine which species of shark a       fin was removed from, which is problematic because some       species are threatened with extinction.        (12) The States of Texas, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois,       Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island,       California, and Washington and American Samoa, Guam, and the       North Mariana Islands have implemented bans on the sale of       shark fins.        (13) Shark fins possessed, transported, offered for sale,       sold, or purchased anywhere in the United States are part of       a large international market, having a substantial and direct       effect on interstate commerce.        (14) Abolition of the shark fin trade in the United States       will remove the United States from the global shark fin       market and will put the United States in a stronger position       to advocate internationally for abolishing the shark fin       trade in other countries.        (b) Prohibition on Sale of Shark Fins.--        (1) Prohibition.--Except as provided in subsection (c), no       person shall possess, transport, offer for sale, sell, or       purchase shark fins or products containing shark fins.        (2) Penalty.--A violation of paragraph (1) shall be treated       as an act prohibited by section 307 of the Magnuson-Stevens       Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857) and       shall be penalized pursuant to section 308(a) of that Act (16       U.S.C. 1858(a)), except that the maximum civil penalty for       each violation shall be $100,000, or the fair market value of       the shark fins involved, whichever is greater.        (c) Exceptions.--A person may possess a shark fin that was       taken lawfully under a State, territorial, or Federal license       or permit to take or land sharks, if the shark fin is       separated from the shark in a manner consistent with the       license or permit and is--        (1) destroyed or discarded upon separation;        (2) used for noncommercial subsistence purposes in       accordance with State or territorial law;        (3) used solely for display or research purposes by a       museum, college, or university, or other person under a State       or Federal permit to conduct noncommercial scientific       research; or        (4) retained by the license or permit holder for a       noncommercial purpose.        (d) Dogfish.--        (1) In general.--It shall not be a violation of subsection       (b) for any person to possess,  [[Page S4589]]       transport, offer for sale, sell, or purchase any fresh or       frozen raw fin or tail from any stock of the species Mustelus       canis (smooth dogfish) or Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish).        (2) Report.--By not later than January 1, 2027, the       Secretary of Commerce shall review the exemption contained in       paragraph (1) and shall prepare and submit to Congress a       report that includes a recommendation on whether the       exemption contained in paragraph (1) should continue or be       terminated. In preparing such report and making such       recommendation, the Secretary shall analyze factors       including--        (A) the economic viability of dogfish fisheries with and       without the continuation of the exemption;        (B) the impact to ocean ecosystems of continuing or       terminating the exemption;        (C) the impact on enforcement of the ban contained in       subsection (b) caused by the exemption; and        (D) the impact of the exemption on shark conservation.        (e) Definition of Shark Fin.--In this section, the term       ``shark fin'' means--        (1) the raw or dried or otherwise processed detached fin of       a shark; or        (2) the raw or dried or otherwise processed detached tail       of a shark.        (f) State Authority.--Nothing in this section may be       construed to preclude, deny, or limit any right of a State or       territory to adopt or enforce any regulation or standard that       is more stringent than a regulation or standard in effect       under this section.        (g) Severability.--If any provision of this section or its       application to any person or circumstance is held invalid,       the invalidity does not affect other provisions or       applications of this section which can be given effect       without the invalid provision or application, and to this end       the provisions of this section are severable.                                  ______                                     SA 695. Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr.  Portman, and Mr. Peters) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed  by him to the bill H.R. 2810, to authorize appropriations for fiscal  year 2018 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for  military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of  Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year,  and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as  follows:         At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:       SEC. ___. SHARK FIN TRADE ELIMINATION.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Sharks are critically important species for their       economic, cultural, and ecosystem value.        (2) Many shark populations are in peril worldwide and are       on the decline.        (3) One of the greatest threats to sharks is the global       trade in shark fins. It is estimated that fins from as many       as 73,000,000 sharks end up in the global shark fin trade       every year.        (4) Shark fins have no medicinal or nutritional value.        (5) The trade in shark fins is primarily focused on large       coastal and pelagic species that grow slowly, mature late,       and have low reproduction rates.        (6) Shark fins are often removed and retained while the       remainder of a shark is discarded due to the high market       value of shark fins relative to other parts of a shark.        (7) Shark fins are removed primarily to be commercialized       as a fungible commodity.        (8) Shark finning is the cruel practice in which the fins       of a shark are cut off on board a fishing vessel at sea. The       remainder of the animal is then thrown back into the water to       drown, starve, or die a slow death.        (9) Although the United States has banned the practice of       shark finning aboard vessels in waters controlled by the       United States, there is no Federal ban on the removal and       sale of shark fins once the fin is brought ashore.        (10) Once a shark fin is detached from the body, it becomes       impossible to determine whether the shark was legally caught       or the fin lawfully removed.        (11) It is difficult to determine which species of shark a       fin was removed from, which is problematic because some       species are threatened with extinction.        (12) The States of Texas, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois,       Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island,       California, and Washington and American Samoa, Guam, and the       North Mariana Islands have implemented bans on the sale of       shark fins.        (13) Shark fins possessed, transported, offered for sale,       sold, or purchased anywhere in the United States are part of       a large international market, having a substantial and direct       effect on interstate commerce.        (14) Abolition of the shark fin trade in the United States       will remove the United States from the global shark fin       market and will put the United States in a stronger position       to advocate internationally for abolishing the shark fin       trade in other countries.        (b) Prohibition on Sale of Shark Fins.--        (1) Prohibition.--Except as provided in subsection (c), no       person shall possess, transport, offer for sale, sell, or       purchase shark fins or products containing shark fins.        (2) Penalty.--A violation of paragraph (1) shall be treated       as an act prohibited by section 307 of the Magnuson-Stevens       Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857) and       shall be penalized pursuant to section 308(a) of that Act (16       U.S.C. 1858(a)), except that the maximum civil penalty for       each violation shall be $100,000, or the fair market value of       the shark fins involved, whichever is greater.        (c) Exceptions.--A person may possess a shark fin that was       taken lawfully under a State, territorial, or Federal license       or permit to take or land sharks, if the shark fin is       separated from the shark in a manner consistent with the       license or permit and is--        (1) destroyed or discarded upon separation;        (2) used for noncommercial subsistence purposes in       accordance with State or territorial law;        (3) used solely for display or research purposes by a       museum, college, or university, or other person under a State       or Federal permit to conduct noncommercial scientific       research; or        (4) retained by the license or permit holder for a       noncommercial purpose.        (d) Dogfish.--        (1) In general.--It shall not be a violation of subsection       (b) for any person to possess, transport, offer for sale,       sell, or purchase any fresh or frozen raw fin or tail from       any stock of the species Mustelus canis (smooth dogfish) or       Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish).        (2) Report.--By not later than January 1, 2027, the       Secretary of Commerce shall review the exemption contained in       paragraph (1) and shall prepare and submit to Congress a       report that includes a recommendation on whether the       exemption contained in paragraph (1) should continue or be       terminated. In preparing such report and making such       recommendation, the Secretary shall analyze factors       including--        (A) the economic viability of dogfish fisheries with and       without the continuation of the exemption;        (B) the impact to ocean ecosystems of continuing or       terminating the exemption;        (C) the impact on enforcement of the ban contained in       subsection (b) caused by the exemption; and        (D) the impact of the exemption on shark conservation.        (e) Definition of Shark Fin.--In this section, the term       ``shark fin'' means--        (1) the raw or dried or otherwise processed detached fin of       a shark; or        (2) the raw or dried or otherwise processed detached tail       of a shark.        (f) State Authority.--Nothing in this section may be       construed to preclude, deny, or limit any right of a State or       territory to adopt or enforce any regulation or standard that       is more stringent than a regulation or standard in effect       under this section.        (g) Severability.--If any provision of this section or its       application to any person or circumstance is held invalid,       the invalidity does not affect other provisions or       applications of this section which can be given effect       without the invalid provision or application, and to this end       the provisions of this section are severable.                                  ______                                     SA 696.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FIRE PROTECTION IN DEPARTMENT                     OF DEFENSE FACILITIES.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) A 2009 Consumer Product Safety Commission study found a       full 370,000 residential fires are suppressed by portable       fire extinguishers annually.        (2) Throughout the United States, of the 48,460 fires in       buildings equipped with sprinklers from 2007 to 2011, 40,440,       or 83 percent, never grew large enough to activate       sprinklers, indicating many fires are successfully suppressed       by portable fire extinguishers.        (3) Section 9-17.1 of the Unified Facilities Criteria 3-      600-01 changes the Department of Defense building code by       stating, ``General purpose portable fire extinguishers are       not required when the Facility is provided with complete       automatic sprinkler protection and a fire alarm system in       accordance with this UFC.''        (4) This new language is a departure from national model       fire codes, and is also a significant change from the last       Unified Criteria governing portable extinguishers.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) portable fire extinguishers are essential to the safety       of members of the Armed Forces and their families;        (2) the current United Facilities Criteria provides members       of the Armed Forces, their families, and other Department of       Defense personnel with less fire protection than that of       civilian counterparts by deviating from fire safety codes       used across the country and not requiring portable       extinguishers on military installations;        (3) United Facilities Criteria 3-600-01, Section 4-9, dated       September 26, 2006, clearly keeps Department of Defense       Facilities in line with the national and international       standards for fire safety; and        (4) the Secretary of Defense should amend current United       Facilities Criteria Section 9-17.1 to reflect the standards       established by United Facilities Criteria 3-600-01, Section       4-9, dated September 26, 2006.                                  ______                                     SA 710.

(b) Other Authorities.--Nothing in this section shall       affect or prohibit the Secretary from procuring launch       services of evolved expendable launch vehicle launch systems,       including with respect to any associated operation and       maintenance of capabilities and infrastructure relating to       such systems.        (c) Notification.--Not later than 30 days before any date       on which the Secretary publishes a draft or final request for       proposals, or obligates funds, for the development under       subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall notify the       congressional defense committees of such proposed draft or       final request for proposals or proposed obligation, as the       case may be. If such proposed draft or final request for       proposals or proposed obligation relates to intelligence       requirements, the Secretary shall also notify the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of       Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of       the Senate.        (d) Assessment.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in coordination       with the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation,       shall submit to the congressional defense committees, the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of       Representatives, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of       the Senate a report containing an assessment of the most       cost-effective method to meet the assured access to space       requirements pursuant to section 2273 of title 10, United       States Code, with respect to each of the following periods:        (1) The five-year period beginning on the date of the       report.        (2) The 10-year period beginning on the date of the report.        (3) The period consisting of the full lifecycle of the       evolved expendable launch vehicle program.

SUPPORT OF EUROPEAN DETERRENCE INITIATIVE TO DETER                     RUSSIAN AGGRESSION.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Military exercises, such as Exercise Nifty Nugget and       Exercise Reforger during the Cold War, have historically made       important contributions to testing operational concepts,       technologies, and leadership approaches; identifying limiting       factors in the execution of operational plans and appropriate       corrective action; and bolstering deterrence against       adversaries by demonstrating United States military       capabilities.        (2) Military exercises with North Atlantic Treaty       Organization (NATO) allies enhance the interoperability and       strategic credibility of the alliance.        (3) The increase in conventional, nuclear, and hybrid       threats by the Russian Federation against the security       interests of the United States and allies in Europe requires       substantial and sustained investment to improve United States       combat capability in Europe.        (4) The decline of a permanent United States military       presence in Europe in recent years increases the likelihood       the United States will rely on being able to flow forces from       the continental United States to the European theater in the       event of a major contingency.        (5) Senior military leaders, including the Commander of       United States Transportation Command, have warned that a       variety of increasingly advanced capabilities, especially the       proliferation of anti-access, area denial (A2/AD)       capabilities, have given adversaries of the United States the       ability to challenge the freedom of movement of the United       States military in all domains from force deployment to       employment to disrupt, delay, or deny operations.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that,       to enhance the European Deterrence Initiative and bolster       deterrence against Russian aggression, the United States,       together with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and       other European partners, should demonstrate its resolve and       ability to meet its commitments under Article V of the North       Atlantic Treaty through appropriate military exercises with       an emphasis on participation of United States forces based in       the continental United States and testing strategic and       operational logistics and transportation capabilities.        (c) Report.--        (1) In general.--Not later than March 1, 2018, the       Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional       defense committees a report setting forth the following:        (A) An analysis of the challenges to the ability of the       United States to flow significant forces from the continental       United States to the European theater in the event of a major       contingency.        (B) The plans of the Department of Defense, including the       conduct of military exercises, to address such challenges.        (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be       submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified       annex.       SEC. 1249. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE EUROPEAN DETERRENCE                     INITIATIVE.

SHORT TITLE.         This subtitle may be cited as the ``Iraq and Syria Genocide       Emergency Relief and Accountability Act of 2017''.       SEC. 1292. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On March 17, 2016, Secretary of State John Kerry       stated, ``in my judgment, Daesh is responsible for genocide       against groups in areas under its control, including Yezidis,       Christians, and Shia Muslims . . . the United States will       strongly support efforts to collect, document, preserve, and       analyze the evidence of atrocities, and we will do all we can       to see that the perpetrators are held accountable''.        (2) Secretary of State Kerry stated in the ``Atrocities       Prevention Report'', transmitted to Congress on March 17,       2016, ``The Department of State has a longstanding commitment       to providing support for the urgent humanitarian needs of       conflict-affected populations in Iraq, Syria, and across the       world, including but not limited to members of ethnic and       religious minorities.''.        (3) The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on       the Syrian Arab Republic stated in its February 3, 2016,       report, ``The Government has committed the crimes against       humanity of extermination, murder, rape or other forms of       sexual violence, torture, imprisonment, enforced       disappearance and other inhuman acts. Based on the same       conduct, war crimes have also been committed. Both Jabhat Al-      Nusra and some anti-Government armed groups have committed       the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, and torture.''.        (4) The International Criminal Investigative Training       Assistance Program and the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial       Development Assistance and Training of the Department of       Justice have provided technical assistance to governmental       judicial and law enforcement entities in Iraq, including with       funding support from the Department of State.        (5) There were an estimated 800,000 to 1,400,000 Christians       in Iraq in 2002, 500,000 in 2013, and less than 250,000 in       2015, according to the annual International Religious Freedom       Reports of the Department of State.        (6) Although Christians were an estimated 8 to 10 percent       of the 21,000,000 person population of Syria in 2010, ``media       and other reports of Christians fleeing the country as a       result of the civil war suggest the Christian population is       now considerably lower'' as of 2015, according to the annual       International Religious Freedom Reports of the Department of       State.        (7) The Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of Erbil (Iraq) is an       example of an entity that has not received funding from any       government and has been providing assistance to internally       displaced families of Yezidis, Muslims, and Christians,       including food, resettlement from tents to permanent housing,       and rent for Yezidis, medical care and education for Yezidis       and Muslims through clinics, schools, and a university that       are open to all, and some form of these types of assistance       to all of the estimated 10,500 internally displaced Christian       families, more than 70,000 people, in the greater Erbil       region.        (8) In fiscal year 2015, the United States Government       admitted to the United States through the United States       Refugee Admissions Program persons from Priority 2 groups of       special humanitarian concern, as designated by Congress,       including--        (A) Jews, Evangelical Christians, Ukrainian Catholics, and       Ukrainian Orthodox, from the former Soviet Union;        (B) Iraqis at risk because they were, or are, employed in       Iraq by the United States Government, a media or       nongovernmental organization headquartered in the United       States, or an organization or entity that received funding       from the United States Government, or are related to someone       who is, or was, so employed;        (C) religious minorities in Iran; and        (D) members of other groups designated by the United States       Government, including--        (i) former political prisoners, active members of       persecuted religious minorities, human rights activists, and       forced labor conscripts in Cuba;        (ii) minors in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala;        (iii) ethnic minorities from Burma in Malaysia;        (iv) Bhutanese in Nepal; and        (v) Congolese in Rwanda.        (9) Through the United States Refugee Admissions Program,       the United States Government--        (A) admitted 12,676 Iraqi refugees in fiscal year 2015,       including at least 2,113 Christians and 213 Yezidis;        (B) admitted 9,880 Iraqi refugees in fiscal year 2016,       including at least 1,524 Christians and 393 Yezidis;  [[Page S4602]]         (C) admitted 1,682 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2015,       including at least 30 Christians; and        (D) admitted 12,587 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016,       including at least 64 Christians and 24 Yezidis.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SUBSTANCE USE                     DISORDERS.         It is the Sense of the Senate that:        (1) The Committees of jurisdiction of the Senate should       review issues related to substance use disorders,       particularly related to opioids, including Federal efforts to       prevent the development of, improve access to treatment, and       promote recovery for people with opioid and other substance       use disorders.        (2) Obamacare should be repealed because it increases       health care costs, limits patient choice of health plans and       doctors, forces Americans to buy insurance that they do not       want, cannot afford, or may not be able to access, increases       taxes on middle class families and fails to focus the       Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act       (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) on individuals most in need, such as       the elderly and the disabled, as evidenced by the following:        (A) Premiums for plans offered on the Federal Exchange have       doubled on average over the last 4 years, and these increases       are projected to continue.        (B) 70 percent of counties have only a few options for       Obamacare insurance in 2017, and at least 40 counties are       expected to have zero insurers planning on their Exchange in       2018.        (C) 2,300,000 Americans purchasing plans on the Exchanges       are projected to have only one insurer to choose from in       2018.        (D) The Joint Committee on Taxation has identified       significant and widespread tax increases on individuals       earning less than$200,000.        (E) Medicaid costs have continued to spiral year after year       leading to a detrimental impact on State budgets, which       constrains State choices with respect to health care.        (3) Obamacare should be replaced with patient-centered       legislation that--        (A) provides access to quality, affordable private health       care coverage for Americans and their families by increasing       competition, State flexibility, and individual choice; and        (B) strengthens the Medicaid program by focusing on the       most needy individuals and empowering States through       increased flexibility to best meet the needs of their       population.                                  ______                                     SA 728.

White II, and Pilot       Roger B. Chaffee were killed in an electrical fire that broke       out inside the Apollo I Command Module on Launch Pad 34 at       the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.        (2) Command Pilot Virgil I. ``Gus'' Grissom was selected by       NASA in 1959 as one of the original seven Mercury astronauts.       He piloted the Liberty Bell 7 spacecraft on July 21, 1963, on       the second and final Mercury suborbital test flight, served       as command pilot on the first manned Gemini flight on March       23, 1965, and was named as Command Pilot of the first Apollo       flight. He began his career in the United States Army Air       Corps and was a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air       Force at the time of the accident, and he is buried at       Arlington National Cemetery.        (3) Senior Pilot Edward H. White II was selected by NASA as       a member of the second astronaut team in 1962. He piloted the       Gemini-4 mission, a 4-day mission that took place in June       1965, during which he conducted the first extravehicular       activity in the United States human spaceflight program. He       was named as Command Module Pilot for the first Apollo       flight. He began his career as a cadet at the United States       Military Academy and was a Lieutenant Colonel in the United       States Air Force at the time of the accident, and he is       buried at West Point Cemetery.
