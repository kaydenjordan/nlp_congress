 Mr. Speaker, I apologize for missing this vote. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 44, MTR on H.R.  803.

Mr. Speaker, America is hurting, but regrettably this so-called  COVID-19 stimulus is neither.   Less than a dime of every dollar goes to COVID vaccines and defeating  the virus. Less than a dime. It does next to nothing to help struggling  Main Street businesses survive or to get America's jobless back to  work.   In fact, the independent Congressional Budget Office reports the  bill's controversial job-killing mandates will kill as many as 2  million jobs. Maybe that is why the White House refuses to tell the  American people just how many jobs it will create.   We need truth in advertising: This is a payoff to political friends.   We did better when we worked together. Through December, over five  COVID aid bills, Republicans and Democrats, we worked tirelessly to  deliver over $3.5 trillion, the largest amount of relief in American  history. A whopping $1 trillion remains unspent today by States, local  governments, and schools.   Economists, including President Obama's own economic adviser, Larry  Summers, worry this will actually make things worse.   The Washington Post called this ``sausage-making'' that ``strays from  the most urgent COVID-related needs.''   The Wall Street Journal said this is a ``non-COVID spending  blowout.''   Even Democratic colleagues, like New York's Adriano Espaillat,  admitted this bill will have embarrassing provisions.   House Democrats rejected every commonsense Republican improvement.   Help millions of unemployed, but make sure no one gets paid more to  stay at home than go to work? Rejected.   Send child poverty funding equally to all poor children in America,  rather than a chosen few in Democrat States? Rejected.   In fact, Democrats said that miserly States didn't deserve this  funding. Miserly States like West Virginia. I hope you heard that,  Senator Manchin.   Require that crucial school funding goes to schools that are open?  Rejected.   Protecting frontline healthcare workers from frivolous lawsuits?  Rejected.   Stop rampant unemployment fraud simply by verifying the identity and  wages of those applying? Rejected.   Giving a second stimulus check to the millions of Joe Jobless, the  victims of President Biden's war on energy and his minimum wage  mandate? Rejected.   How about helping parents use education and savings towards kids'  schooling, and especially therapies for special-needs kids? Rejected.   What about aiding families by making permanent the 2017 tax reform's  doubled child tax credits? Nope.   Make sure precious healthcare dollars aren't used for abortions or  diverted to undocumented immigrants? Uh-uh.   Republicans proposed requiring Governors report accurate data on  their nursing home deaths, but Democrats unanimously chose to protect  New York Governor Cuomo's deadly policies and cover-up. Hours later  after the vote, Cuomo's aides admitted they had reported false data.   Speaker Pelosi's favorite pet projects and other wasteful spending  could go to more vaccine distribution for needy Americans. But no,  rejected.   President Biden promised unity. Now he threatens to punish  Republicans who oppose this massive payoff to Democrats' political  friends.   But President Biden and the Democrats are not punishing us by  rejecting bipartisanship, they are punishing the American people.   If you don't know how many jobs this will create, then don't repeat  the failed Obama-Biden stimulus that led to the worst economic recovery  in our lifetime.   Stop this political payoff. Let's find common ground, as we have  before, on what is truly urgent: crushing the virus, rebuilding this  economy, saving Main Street businesses, and getting Americans back to  work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from West  Virginia (Mrs. Miller), who is a new member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), who is the lead Republican of the House  Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), the lead Republican on the Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Palmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Americans struggling with COVID, businesses fighting to survive,  seniors waiting for vaccines, millions of Americans now jobless due to  lockdowns, they all deserve better than this partisan, rushed, special  interest payoff to political friends.   Less than a dime of every dollar of this bill goes to COVID vaccines  and defeating the virus. There is next to nothing to save Main Street  businesses or get Americans unemployed back to work. And after spending  nearly $2 trillion, the White House can't, or won't, tell us how many  jobs this will create.   History will describe this moment as a time when more than 500,000  Americans have lost their lives, millions are jobless, small businesses  are struggling, and seniors are praying for the vaccine, and House  Democrats said: Let's build our Speaker a tunnel.   Come on, man. We can do better. We can work in a bipartisan way to  crush this virus and rebuild America's economy, just as we did five  times this past year to deliver the largest relief in American history.  Vote ``no'' to payoffs to political friends.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0050
