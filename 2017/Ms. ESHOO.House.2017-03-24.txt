 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are very smart. They listen up. They  kind of knit their eyebrows together. They listen to the debate. They  want the facts, and then they make up their mind. What our colleagues  on the other side of the aisle have brought forward today is a disaster  for the American people, and the American people know it.   You have 17 percent of the American people that are for your plan,  and the reason why? They know there are going to be higher costs.  Families are going to have to pay more and get less--pay more for their  premiums, more for their deductibles, and more in their out-of-pocket  costs.   You are taking health care away from 24 million Americans. That is  more than the entire population of Australia. Who comes to Congress to  hurt people?   The promise of the Affordable Care Act was no one--no one ever  again--will be able to take away your insurance the way the insurance  companies did 7-plus years ago. Now it is only the Republican Party  that can take away Americans' insurance.   There isn't one developed country in the world that has your plan. It  is a combination of all kinds of things to get votes.   What free markets? What are you talking about? There is hypocrisy  here because you all have the Affordable Care Act insurance. Every  single Member of Congress does. So I guess it is good enough for you  but it is not good enough for your constituents.   This is a matter of life and death. You are playing with people's  lives. It is a profound issue. This doesn't deserve one vote in the  House of Representatives. Vote it down.
