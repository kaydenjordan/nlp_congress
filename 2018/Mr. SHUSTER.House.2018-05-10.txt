 Mr. Speaker, today we say farewell to a colleague and  good friend, Charlie Dent, a dedicated public servant who served in the  Pennsylvania House for 8 years, the Pennsylvania Senate for 6, and 14  years in the United States Congress.   Again, a dedicated public servant. He is smart. He is tough. He is  hardworking. He has a great sense of humor. But, most importantly, he  has been a voice of reason here in the House of Representatives. He has  worked extremely hard to represent the people of the 15th District over  those past 14 years and done it with great honor and integrity.   As Charlie leaves the House today, I say to my good friend: Chuck, we  are going to miss you. Godspeed.                            ____________________
