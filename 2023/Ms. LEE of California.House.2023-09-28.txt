 I claim time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR: The gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose H.R. 4665.   This bill would impose devastating cuts on programs meant to keep  both America and the world safe. With all due respect to my friend and  colleague and the chair of this committee, I am not an adversary of the  United States. Democrats are patriotic, and we want our country to lead  in global security and peace. This bill does just the opposite.   This Republican bill would slash the allocation for international  programs by nearly one-third, a level not seen since 2009. Do my  Republican colleagues really think that our international challenges  have shrunk? I don't know what world they are living in. The bill  undermines the fight against climate change, and it would destroy our  influence at the United Nations during a time when China and Russia are  working to expand their voice and their role.   Most outrageously, the bill would gut programs intended to help the  most vulnerable people in the world, undermining American global  leadership and making a mockery of our human values and leaving a huge  void for adversaries to fill.   I have spent much of my time in Congress talking about the three d's  of our  [[Page H4721]]  national security: diplomacy, development, and defense. Each of these  has a role to play in keeping our country safe and secure, and creating  a world where kids and our grandkids can prosper.   The SFOPS bill is supposed to fund two of those d's, diplomacy and  development. Instead, this Republican bill throws the three d's  completely out of whack.   If House Republicans get their way, the Pentagon would receive 20  times more--let me repeat that, 20 times more--what this bill invests  in diplomacy and development combined. Even our military leaders have  spoken out against cuts to diplomacy and development because they know  gutting these programs makes their jobs harder. Former Defense  Secretary Mattis has famously said: If you don't fully fund the State  Department, then I have to buy more ammunition.   Mr. Chair, the PRC now has more embassies and diplomats around the  world than any other nation, including more than the United States, but  Republicans would cut funding for our embassies and diplomats by $1.2  billion.   We have watched as the PRC challenges us at the United Nations and  other multilateral institutions, working to insert their values of  authoritarianism and disrespect for human rights, but Republicans are  proposing to cut funding to the United Nations, leaving our adversaries  waiting to fill the void that we leave behind.   The Republican bill asks our diplomats and development professionals  to do more monitoring, reporting, and oversight, but then it  shortchanges them on the funding that they need for operations and  staffing. This is quite sinister.   The bill invites the culture wars into foreign policy by making  diversity, drag queens, and critical race theory bogeymen and  bogeywomen, distracting us from the real life-or-death challenges  facing our world. It doesn't make any sense.   The bill also takes a really dishonest approach to the threat posed  by climate change. Right now, people all around the world are  confronting the impacts of human-caused climate change, life- threatening temperatures, crop failures, floods, and severe weather.  They need help confronting the problem we largely created. Yet, the  majority pretends that our climate finance investments are about  controlling the planet's temperature, like some sort of global  thermostat. That is not how it works. We have countries that might  literally not exist in a generation because of the changes that are  already happening.   We are spending billions each and every year, both here at home and  overseas, dealing with humanitarian emergencies and responding to ever- stronger storms, raging fires, and devastating droughts. Failing to  invest and adapt to the new reality means continued and escalating  conflict and crisis, which puts Americans and people everywhere at  risk.   Around the world, 218 million women still do not have access to the  tools needed to decide when and how to have a baby. While hundreds of  thousands of them die in childbirth, we are going to make it harder for  women to access care through both policies and reduced funding in this  bill.   I am very upset about how this bill attacks efforts to strengthen  diversity in our foreign policy workforce. The rich diversity of the  United States is one of our greatest strengths. People around the  world--religious and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities,  LGBTQ+ people--look first to the United States for support and  inspiration as they seek to claim their human rights. It is  unimaginable to me that my Republican colleagues--well, no, it is not  really, given what is taking place in our own country. Once again, you  all see a threat in our efforts to make sure that our diplomats and  development experts reflect and respect that same diversity.   The world is watching us. The world is full of threats that don't  respect borders, from climate change to pandemics to assertive  dictators. Most countries would prefer to partner with the United  States to confront these challenges. By bringing this bill to the floor  with these cuts, to the House floor, mind you, the Republican majority  broadcasts a clear message to the world to take a hike. Trust me, the  PRC is ready to take advantage of our absence, and I think everyone has  seen this around the world.   Mr. Chair, it is September 28. The government may shut down,  unfortunately, even though we are fighting as Democrats to prevent this  from happening, but today, we are considering a bill that has no chance  of becoming law. We should be working today to make sure that we keep  our government open.   House Democrats will not support a bill if it means turning our backs  on the world's most vulnerable women or the looming threat of climate  change.   In the end, final appropriations bills will need bicameral and  bipartisan support, and today, we will likely get further away from  that goal, not closer. This really is wasting everyone's time.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this destructive bill. We  are not adversaries. We are patriotic, and we want our country to  succeed in its mission and its role as a global leader leading peace  and security efforts throughout the planet.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng), a member of the State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), a member of the State,  Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of  the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First, let me take a minute on the many partisan riders included in  the bill being considered today and raise a couple of points.   The number of prohibitions seems to be really enormous. They have  proliferated, often with little concern for what the actual  ramifications might be.   It appears to be the approach of: If an organization has ever done  something that you have not liked or a wild theory has circulated about  it, we will just prohibit it. We will pick up our ball and take it  home.                                time  1000    This is not just ineffective; it is really immature.   The bill prohibits funds for the Chinese Communist Party. This sounds  tough. I was the previous chairwoman of the subcommittee, and this bill  has not provided funding to the Chinese Communist Party. It is a red  herring.   It prohibits scientific cooperation with countries we do not like,  not stopping to consider that while there may or may not be active  collaboration currently, there may come a time when it is in the United  States' best interest to partner, not with the government, but with the  people, with scientists, to pursue common goals.   Indeed, we carried on scientific cooperation with the Soviet Union  during the Cold War, not because we agree with their government, but it  was in our own interest.   The bill prohibits gain-of-function research. That sounds good but  consider that this same prohibited research is producing new therapies  for cancer and cystic fibrosis. This research also helps us produce  insulin for people with diabetes.   Has the majority considered what the cost will be of cutting this  off?   The bill prohibits funding for the World Health Organization because  they won't admit Taiwan. It is the member countries of the WHO that are  making this decision, not the organization. With this bill, the PRC  will continue to work against Taiwan's inclusion, but the United States  won't be there to help.   We are told that this bill is strong against our adversaries. I would  argue just the opposite. This bill takes the easy route and leaves the  field open for those who would challenge us. It makes dialogue and  engagement harder and leaves our potential partners and allies who are  deciding who they can turn to for help high and dry and, of course,  that won't be the United States.   A couple points on the United Nations. The U.N. is the forum for  every country in the world. The United States, to my knowledge, does  not get to pick who gets to be a sovereign country. Leadership of the  United Nations committees, the general assembly, they all rotate among  members, which the chairman knows. This makes it even more important  that the United States fully participates. This bill endangers that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the chairman and I respect each  other. We have different points of view, and I consider us friends  also.   I know, and I think the chairman knows, that many of our Republican  colleagues do support robust investments in the SFOPS bill because I  have seen the thousands of requests that Members have submitted this  year and in prior years.   There is a long legacy of enlightened Republican support for foreign  assistance. Congressional Republicans worked with Harry Truman to  create the Marshall Plan which rebuilt Europe after a devastating war.   I worked with President Bush to create PEPFAR, which has saved 25  million lives from HIV and AIDS.   Yet, the majority has chosen to force this bill to the floor because  they cynically believe that their Members will be happy to sacrifice  the world's poorest people to make a political point.   To my Republican colleagues--I see you here on the floor today, and I  am asking you to stand up and, yes, oppose this terrible bill. Please  vote ``no,'' and let's get back together and write a bill that helps  build the better and safer world that we want for our children and our  grandchildren.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this en  bloc. There is a list of bipartisan amendments in this to address  various Members' priorities. I appreciate the collaborative way in  which we have agreed on this package.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chair, it is really hard to believe that  you all want to eliminate funding for the Institute of Peace, P-E-A-C- E. The Institute of Peace is one of the best tools the United States  has to bring people together to prevent wars--government officials,  civil society practitioners, and defense experts--to really to  creatively solve our world's thorniest issues.   Congress created the United States Institute of Peace for this  purpose in 1984. USIP applies practical solutions in conflict zones,  and provides analysis, education, and resources to those working for  peace. Peace is patriotic, my Republican friends.   USIP has specialized teams of mediators, trainers, and others in some  of the world's most dangerous places and works to equip communities  with the skills necessary to prevent or resolve their own violent  conflicts before they threaten the United States.   Mr. Chair, I hope they understand that peace is the only option that  we have to war. USIP works on the ground with local partners on the  root causes of conflict that all too frequently result in America's  military gains or diplomatic and development investments going to  waste.   In a world that becomes more dangerous and complex every day, we need  the services and the creative thinking of the United States Institute  of Peace.   It is hard to believe the Republicans oppose peace. I guess that says  that war is the option for settling conflicts, and I think the American  people are war weary and support our efforts for peace. It is really a  shame and a disgrace that you are uncovering this issue in terms of  your opposition to peace.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the OSCE is the world's largest  regional security organization and has been critical in addressing the  violent aggression of Russia.   The OSCE is actively engaged in conflict prevention, conventional  arms control, peacekeeping, promoting good governance and human rights,  rule-of-law programming, also border security measures,  counternarcotics work, efforts to combat organized crime,  anticorruption and anti-money laundering activities, and election  support.   The OSCE is currently leading a Special Monitoring Mission in  Ukraine. This mission is an unarmed civilian mission tasked to observe  and to report on the situation resulting from ongoing Russian  aggression to facilitate dialogue among all parties to restore peace,  p-e-a-c-e, and to monitor and support the implementation of the cease- fire and other tenets of the Minsk peace agreements.   It is the only nonpartisan international body that maintains a  continuous presence at the line of contact between the Ukrainian Armed  Forces and Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine. Peace in Ukraine,  that is p-e-a-c-e, will be through organizations like the OSCE.   I am completely perplexed by my colleagues and can't figure out why  they would not find this a good investment  [[Page H4760]]  of taxpayer dollars. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the United States Agency for  International Development's global operations are essential to  defending United States national security, asserting United States  leadership and foreign policy influence, and advancing stability,  security, and prosperity worldwide.   This account supports a direct-hire workforce focused on advancing  the most critical and effective foreign assistance programs and  ensuring strong relationships and stewardship and accountability of  U.S. taxpayer dollars. A 50 percent reduction to the operating expenses  account would devastate USAID operations, including its workforce, and  its ability to implement critical foreign assistance and humanitarian  assistance programs.   At this level, the Agency would be forced to reduce permanent U.S.  direct-hire levels by about 1,845 positions. USAID would cut  approximately 965 Foreign Service and 880 civil service positions. This  50 percent workforce reduction would require a reduction in force since  eliminating the backfilling of positions lost through attrition would  achieve only about an 8 percent cut.   USAID would significantly reduce its presence overseas, including  closing some missions, once again leaving this void for our  adversaries. This would leave these missions without American personnel  to deliver aid from the American people and ensure our national  security through development and humanitarian assistance.   This drastic staff cut would leave programs extremely vulnerable to  waste, fraud, and abuse, and impair the Agency's ability to respond to  ongoing and future natural and human crises, pandemics, and development  challenges. It also will result in the termination of programs  overseas, once again creating a void for our adversaries to fill.  [[Page H4761]]    This amendment is really counterproductive. We can't short fund staff  charged with managing our foreign assistance programs and expect them  to be effective. If we reduce our development efforts, we are not  countering Russia and the PRC's influence. We are, instead, opening the  door for their expanded global influence. I urge my colleagues to  oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the United States Agency for  International Development's capital investment fund supports facility  construction, information technology, and real property maintenance.   These include efforts to accelerate the construction of new, secure,  safe, and functional office facilities for USAID personnel overseas.  Without this funding, these diplomats would be vulnerable and at  greater risk for harm on less secured compounds.   This fund also supports information technology security, including  efforts critical to cybersecurity and real property maintenance and  repairs.   I don't hear the gentleman talking about the fact that the policy of  countering Chinese influence costs a little bit of money, also. I think  this provides us a bigger bang for our buck.   Without this funding, the Agency would be unable to upgrade and  secure the IT environment against external and internal threats that  could damage our national security and expose personally identifiable  information of not only Americans but the participants we assist in  times of crisis.   Mr. Chair, this amendment is shortsighted, and I urge my colleagues  to oppose it. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, while this amendment does not have  a budgetary effect, I thank my colleague for raising such an important  issue for millions of women around the world.   For more than 200 women, female genital mutilation can mean health  problems that haunt them for the rest of their lives.   The quest for gender equality will not be complete until women are no  longer subjected to these practices, and I thank my colleague for  raising this important issue.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Salinas).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chair, once again, I have no idea what my  colleagues are trying to achieve.   All this amendment would do is double down on the harm Russia's  aggression has already wreaked on the poorest countries of the world  through higher food, fertilizer, and fuel costs.   This amendment would cut $750 million each from global health  programs and the International Disaster Assistance accounts. These cuts  would impose tremendous harm and suffering to the most vulnerable,  including:   4 million children with malaria will go untreated;   350,000 deaths attributable to tuberculosis;  [[Page H4764]]    13 million fewer children vaccinated resulting in a possible 115,000  additional deaths; and   A reduction by over 45 percent of humanitarian assistance to Sudan  compared to FY 2023 levels.   This doesn't sound much like pro-life to me, Mr. Chairman.   It would also eliminate the entire Official Development Assistance  accounts, affecting agriculture and food security programs, education,  and clean water for millions of the most vulnerable people in the  world.   Development assistance is also used for Countering PRC Influence  programs, which represents one of our most effective tools to counter  and compete with the PRC globally.   It is really ridiculous, it is cruel, and it is not pro-life. These  are not funds that would be targeted to Ukraine in any significant way.  It has no impact on the Ukraine debate and would inflict harm on  millions of people.   Mr. Chair, I would be happy to discuss with my colleagues about how  we support Ukraine's pursuit of freedom, but this amendment would only  alienate the rest of the world and forsake many of our allies' reliant  on assistance from the United States.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me just suggest this: It  really is an unrealistic position for the United States to allow 4  million children with malaria to go untreated, to allow 350,000 deaths  attributable to tuberculosis, to allow 13 million fewer children  vaccinated, resulting in a possible 115,000 additional deaths, and a  reduction of over 45 percent of humanitarian assistance to Sudan  compared to 2023 levels.   Very unrealistic, cruel, and unusual.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    USAID's International Disaster Assistance  Account, or IDA, is a critical tool which supports our country's  foreign policy objectives and serves as a lifeline for millions of  people.   The IDA account provides lifesaving support including food, water,  shelter, emergency healthcare, sanitation and hygiene, and critical  nutrition services to the world's most vulnerable and hardest to reach  people.   This assistance is needed now more than ever. After 20 years of  decline, there are more people facing hunger now than in 2019, almost  30 percent of the global population.   Regardless of whether you have faith or not, I think that our values  compel us to really address those in most need, not only in our own  country, but, yes, throughout the world.   It is important to provide this humanitarian assistance because it is  morally the right thing to do. Once again, those who are people of  faith, or not, do this because it really does solidify our commitment  to humankind, and, also, yes, our leadership and influence throughout  the world.   It is unthinkable that the United States would stop providing this  support to those who have lost everything through a natural disaster or  conflict.   I am really ashamed that the Republicans want to do this. It is  really a disgrace.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is shortsighted.  It would potentially cut programs to strengthen democracy and human  rights, protect religious freedom, and support economic reforms, among  others.   Many of these programs counter malign influences and provide an  alternative to the PRC's influence, financing, and activities.   These programs also offer and demonstrate another narrative from the  authoritarianism promoted by the government of the PRC. The Economic  Support Fund also advances critical security programs, such as  countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment and improving  governance and accountability. These are bigger challenges than they  were just 5 years ago.   The fiscal year level that is sought by this amendment is totally  unrealistic to accomplish our goals.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this budget, first of all, is less  than one half of 1 percent of the United States' GDP.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim).  [[Page H4766]]         Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the migration and refugee  assistance account supports protection and assistance to ease the  suffering of those who had to leave everything behind and become  refugees. The funding also contributes to broader USG and international  efforts to resolve conflicts that cause displacement.   This humanitarian aid saves lives and upholds the dignity of tens of  millions of forcibly displaced and crisis-affected people, including  refugees, victims of conflict, stateless persons, and vulnerable  migrants.   There were more than 108 million forcibly displaced people globally  at the end of 2022. This is the largest ever annual increase and  represents the largest number of forcibly displaced in history.   Without assistance, nations will not accept the growing refugee  populations in their countries, potentially destabilizing regions and  threatening global peace, security, and stability. We should be doing  more, not less, to support these individuals.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the Peace Corps is one of the best  investments in public diplomacy that we make. There is no way that  Democrats have prioritized Peace Corps over veterans. We support our  veterans. We support the Peace Corps.   What better ambassadors do we have than young American people willing  to spend 2 years overseas and build goodwill with people around the  world?   I know many of us have met these young people when traveling overseas  or have discussed with our own constituents after they have  participated in this life-changing experience.   The Peace Corps account in this bill is already $20 million below its  current level, endangering the return of volunteers in the field after  COVID and the reopening of new sites, particularly in the Pacific  Islands, where strong American diplomacy is sorely needed.   Cuts are already threatening the ability to support the 5,000  volunteers across 51 countries that the Peace Corps has responsibility  for.   Once again, Democrats support the Peace Corps. Democrats support and  thank our veterans for their service.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am not so sure that our veterans  would appreciate being used as a pawn in this game to try to defund and  cut funding for young people. I have talked to many veterans who  appreciate the Peace Corps and appreciate the work that they are doing  to help ensure that Americans have the best ambassadors in the world.  Our veterans would not want to hear of this pawn game being played in  opposition to the Peace Corps.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would reduce the  contribution of the United States to the Global Environmental Facility  by $10 million. The Global Environmental Facility is a multilateral  trust fund that provides grant-based funding to developing countries to  address the real global environmental challenges.   Last month was the hottest August, according to the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration's 174-year record. In that one month,  Hawaii had a devastating wildfire, the Southeast suffered from Category  3 Hurricane Idalia, and southern California had its first-ever tropical  storm watch, with many areas receiving more rain in 48 hours than they  typically get all year. These disasters come with huge costs in the  communities they directly affect and impact our entire planet.   The Global Environmental Facility fund benefits the United States  economy and environment by addressing problems that affect our domestic  health, safety, and prosperity, such as by protecting tropical forests,  reducing global levels of transboundary pollutants, and combating  illegal wildlife  [[Page H4768]]  trafficking, which I know is of concern to many on both sides of the  aisle.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, first, the executive branch has the  ability to determine how the United States engages and manages our  relationship with Taiwan. It had that ability during the last  administration. That is because Congress left it to the executive  branch to conduct diplomacy and the recognition or nonrecognition of  foreign states and governments in this case.   If you wish to legislate how the executive branch should engage with  Taiwan, then markup a separate bill in the Foreign Affairs Committee  that just deals with that. In the absence of that, the executive branch  needs to determine how to handle diplomatic engagements abroad. Again,  the last administration did just that.   It is their job to weigh multiple equities and balance delicate  factors that are simply not considered by this amendment today.   The gentleman knows that Taiwan is a sensitive geopolitical subject  with respect to our relations with the People's Republic of China. That  is why we have a Select Committee in the House on it. I think this is  something that they could examine, but there is too much at stake to  have this amendment decide what the guidelines for engagement will be.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this is really despicable to  target dedicated public servants and threaten their livelihoods--public  servants doing their jobs and carrying out the policy of the  administration--regardless of which administration it is--they serve.  They should be commended and not demonized.   Our government is dependent on being able to attract the best talent  to bring their skills to public service, especially when in most cases  they could earn much more in the private sector.   Who is going to be willing to do that if their names can be dragged  through the political mud?   Secretary Blinken is a dedicated public servant who has proudly  represented the United States while serving in multiple high-level  positions.   This is not how we solve policy differences. We should not make it  personal and about people doing their jobs.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this, quite frankly, is  unconstitutional, first of all. It doesn't make any sense, second. It  really sends the worst signal in the world for those young people who  want to go into public service serving our country. I am really  shocked.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is a clear attempt  to return to the punitive and shortsighted policies of the previous  administration with regard to the Palestinians.   Let's get one thing straight. American diplomacy and engagement are  not rewards to our friends and things to hold over the heads of those  we are trying to pressure to bring about change. Diplomacy and  engagement serve our own interests.   United States policy is to support a two-state solution in the Middle  East--that is the United States policy, and the only path to peace--and  to avoid any steps by any party that makes that goal harder to reach.   By keeping a channel of communications open, the Palestinian Affairs  Unit is an important part of that strategy.   I have and will continue to urge the Biden administration to reset  U.S. relations with the Palestinian people, and to resume the United  States' role as a credible and constructive leader in the region.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, just to clarify and to tell the  truth. This is a unit; it is not a mission. It is a unit, mind you,  within the embassy.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, Russia's brutal and unprovoked  attack on Ukraine is not just a threat to Ukraine and its neighbors but  to the world. If Russia succeeds in its aggression, other unprovoked  attacks are inevitable.   As my colleague, Representative Hoyer, said last week on the House  floor: ``We are locked in a struggle between freedom and fascism,  democracy and despotism, might and right. The war in Ukraine is that  struggle manifest.''   Ukraine's democracy is being undermined every single day. Entire  cities have been demolished. Women and girls are being sexually abused  by Russian soldiers. Hospitals and schools, which should be safe  havens, are being intentionally attacked. Thousands of innocent  children and their families have been brutally murdered. Millions of  Ukrainians have been forced to flee their country.   Colleagues, we must continue to ensure that Ukraine has the funding  and support it needs to defend itself and that vulnerable people  continue to receive lifesaving assistance.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time  to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1215     Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, Russia's brutal and unprovoked  attack on Ukraine is not just a threat to Ukraine, as I said earlier,  and its neighbors but also to the world.   If Russia succeeds in its aggression, other provoked attacks are  inevitable.  [[Page H4774]]  Drawdown of existing equipment has proven to be the fastest and most  efficient way to get defensive weapons--mind you, defensive weapons--to  Ukraine.   We must continue to ensure Ukraine has the military equipment and  materiel it needs to defend itself. This materiel is determined by the  Department of Defense not to be needed domestically, and supplying it  to Ukraine will not endanger U.S. readiness.   The stakes could not be higher. Russia will not stop with Ukraine if  the resolve of the world is not clear.   Remember, this is the most efficient way to get defensive weapons to  Ukraine.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, there is no doubt that Lebanon is  in full-blown crisis. It has lacked an elected leader for almost a  year. Its economy is crippled and the presence of Hezbollah, as both an  armed actor and a political party, remains a challenge to national  unity. At the same time, it hosts 1.5 million refugees from Syria.   However, the Lebanese Armed Forces are considered by many to be the  only functioning institution in Lebanon, transcending sectarian  divides. This is largely thanks to the successful United States program  to train and equip it.   The Lebanese Armed Forces are broadly respected and traditionally  played an important role in promoting national unity with neutrality  and moderation. They have also been instrumental in maintaining  domestic security and in counterterrorism by tackling threats posed by  groups like ISIS or al-Qaida.   The United States needs to pursue a democratic, pluralistic, and  sovereign Lebanon and the Armed Forces are a key part of that.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Issa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, there is no mistake with regard  to the error the United States made in going to war with Iraq in 2003,  a decision which I proudly opposed. It was based on lies that there  were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and we knew there were none.   While two decades have passed since then, there is little doubt about  the trauma experienced by the country that is still felt to this day.   Iraqis fell prey to conflict and instability, experienced an  uncountable number of deaths and displacements, and saw an erosion of  their basic services, including health and education. An entire  generation of children grew up in a chaos-filled environment with war  and the subsequent emergence of terrorist groups and militias.   That is as a result of the United States' invasion of Iraq, which I  believe, as I remember it, very few, if any, Republicans, opposed.  There were about 133 Democrats opposing this.   We cannot walk away from our responsibility to help Iraq, now a key  partner in the Middle East. As Secretary Blinken has said, America's  greatest strategic asset lies within the alliances and partnerships we  have with other nations. In partnership with Iraq, we have worked to  ensure a stable, prosperous, and democratic country, which, quite  frankly, we in many ways destroyed.   Our assistance to Iraq mitigates extremism through programming that  promotes mutual respect, tolerance, and understanding, provides support  to the recovery of religious and ethnic minorities liberated from ISIS,  including Christians and the Yezidis, and supports private-sector  development and increased work opportunities, especially for women and  youth.   Additionally, USG-supported stabilization programs have enabled the  return of nearly 5 million internally displaced persons to return to  their communities of origin. But nearly 1.2 million people remain  displaced, including 200,000 Yezidis who survived genocide at the hands  of ISIS. USAID assistance is critical to restoring essential services  and increasing stability among these vulnerable populations.   Furthermore, our continued assistance in Iraq is vital to ensure the  defeat of ISIS by supporting the reintegration of Iraqis repatriated  from northeast Syria which meets the national security priority of the  U.S. Government's Al-Hol Action Plan.   It is in the security interests of the United States to continue  supporting Iraq, as well as our moral responsibility not to abandon our  partnership, especially with the unnecessary invasion and war in Iraq,  which many of us opposed.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Issa).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1245     Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, it is very clear from the science  that the most existential crisis this the world faces is from the  growing climate crisis. Without intervention, our warming planet will  have irreversible negative impacts on the United States and throughout  the world.   Climate change has resulted in lives upended in Texas and Florida and  has led to extreme flooding in California and Vermont and throughout  the country.   Climate is not an issue that can be addressed by countries on their  own. Air, water, pollution--they do not respect boundaries or  sovereignty. The Paris Agreement in recognition of this brought all  countries together around joint goals achieved by individual country  plans.   As proposed, this amendment would significantly damage the efforts of  the United States to support developing countries as they pursue  efforts to implement their commitments under the Paris Agreement.   In addition, a wide range of U.S. climate and development programs  would be impacted by this amendment, and it would seriously impede our  ability to implement our obligations under the Paris Agreement. It  would also prohibit the Department of State from participating in  critical international climate negotiations.   The climate crisis poses threats to the stability of countries,  heightens social and political tensions, and adversely affects food  prices and availability. This is according to our own military.   The need for foreign assistance will only increase if we do not  address the significant driver of crisis around the world.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, many of our developing country  allies have made it very clear that strengthening their ability to  address climate change and the threat that it poses is an overriding  national priority, and they are looking to the United States for  support. I was in COP27 in Egypt a couple of years ago, and this is  exactly the message that was sent.   The FY24 House State and Foreign Ops bill willfully ignores the  changing climate and its implications for so many other global  challenges this bill is intended to address, including promoting food  and water security, global health, the protection of tropical forests  and other vital natural resources, and social and political stability  in strategically important regions.   According to the World Bank, climate change could put 132 million  people into extreme poverty by 2030 and could drive the internal  migration of an additional 216 million people by 2050.   Every one of our districts has been challenged by severe drought,  rainfall storms, and heat. We are continuing to spend more and more on  humanitarian needs caused by these disasters both domestically and  abroad.   We need to get ahead of these crises. Helping communities cope,  especially those with the least means to do so, is both moral and  smart. Why are we demonizing these programs and cutting ourselves off  from valuable tools?   These are not problems anyone can solve alone. We must work with  others which make cooperation and our multilateral tools work. That is  what we need, such as the Clean Technology Fund, the Green Climate  Fund, the Global Environmental Facility--all of these and more are so  important.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, just one point I would like to  mention with regard to the climate emergency, which it is.   Our young people deserve a future. They deserve a planet that is here  for them, and I think we need to understand that the work we do in this  House--or that we are not doing--really affects their future and their  lives and their livelihoods.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, as I said earlier, it is quite  despicable to target dedicated public servants and threaten their  livelihoods--public servants doing their jobs and carrying out the  policies of this administration or any administration. They deserve to  be commended, not demonized.   Our government is dependent on being able to attract the best talent  to bring their skills to public service, especially when in most cases  they could earn much more in the private sector. Who is going to be  willing to do that if their names can be dragged through the political  mud?   Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield retired as one of our most distinguished  foreign service officers after 35 years of service to this country.                                time  1300    She returned from retirement in order to take on her current role as  United Nations Ambassador, and she represents the United States  admirably each and every single day.   This is how we solve our policy differences? We should not make it  personal and about people doing their jobs.   I have worked with and have known Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield. All  the unbelievable bashing of who she is, her credentials, and what she  has provided for this country is unacceptable and disgusting.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I hope that the gentlewoman and others really understand  that public service is public service. This is not a private  corporation. This is our Federal Government. This is who we are as a  country, bringing forth our efforts to achieve global peace and  security in the world. To continue to try to demonize our public  servants is something that hopefully our young people are totally  ignoring because we want them to come on board as Foreign Service  ambassadors on behalf of this country.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, let me just say, these amendments  really are disgusting. They are a mockery of our serious foreign policy  debates. They are harassing in many ways our public servants, and they  become about vengeance.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, these are not rogue bureaucrats.  These are public servants who are implementing the foreign policies of  the United States of America.   If, in fact, one does not agree with our foreign policies, then it is  up to Members of Congress to change those foreign policies, not  denigrate and demean our public servants.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would reduce the  salary of a career public servant to $1. Why? Because this individual  is the acting chief of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.   The mission of the office is to build and support a workforce at the  State Department that reflects the people of our Nation. The State  Department is an essential component of our national security.   The gentlewoman said that no clear set of problems exist. Do you know  what? The clear set of problems is systemic racism, discrimination, the  lack of equal opportunity within our Foreign Service. That is all.   Conducting diplomacy that serves the interests and honors the values  of the American people requires a Department of State that reflects the  rich diversity of our Nation. Otherwise, if it doesn't, then that is a  very unfortunate and backward perspective, given the fact that  discrimination is still alive in America. It is alive and well.   Our diversity, once again, is our national strength. It is a  comparative advantage that we have for our engagement and leadership in  a diverse world.   This individual has over 30 years of State Department experience. She  should not be personally demonized and targeted for her work on behalf  of our Nation. What she is doing is trying to ensure that we honor our  pledge to live up to liberty and justice for all. It is going to take  some intentional work of the State Department to correct hundreds of  years of racism.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Once again, the target of this amendment has  been a career member of the Foreign Service for 26 years and served all  around the world.   Now, the majority already passed an amendment to defund the  Palestinian Affairs Unit at the United States Embassy. It is very clear  to me that what the majority is attempting to do is to decimate our  Foreign Service and its public servants, and I hope the country  understands what this means in terms of the lack of a presence  throughout the world in our efforts to achieve global peace and  security.   Once again, it is a shame and disgrace, but the pattern is here. We  understand the motives, and the motives are to decimate the State  Department.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, just let me make a couple of  points.   First of all, 2023 marked the 76th anniversary of our partnership  with Pakistan, the fifth largest country in the world by population.   Strengthening Pakistan's economy, education system, delivering  humanitarian assistance, such as the support we provided for the  devastating floods that they faced in 2023--I remember the gentlewoman  from Texas, we were in Africa, and she left Africa and went over to  Pakistan to help with the response to the devastating humanitarian  tragedy that occurred in Pakistan. I wasn't able to go with her. I  thank her for her leadership in representing the United States.   We must maintain the stability of the country and the region and help  prevent the spread of extremism that we see surfacing.   It is up to us to provide U.S. aid and assistance to Pakistan for  programs that promote peace and security. This is important, just based  on our humanitarian concern for people who have been impacted and have  to live through such devastation.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the Global Compact for Safe,  Orderly, and Regular Migration supports humane migration around the  world. It is the first intergovernmental agreement to cover all  dimensions of international migration at a time when we are facing a  migration crisis, as my colleagues like to remind us.   The Global Compact's guiding principles and objectives encompass a  range of humanitarian, development, and other migration management  activities, most of which the United States Government supported long  before the Global Compact on Migration existed.   These activities include the provision of lifesaving humanitarian  assistance, countering trafficking in persons, border management,  access to consular services, and also dignified return and  reintegration.   In 2022, we saw a 21 percent increase in displaced people around the  world. The largest ever single-year increase, and the largest number of  people forcibly displaced in written history. It is only common sense  to work with others on this challenge.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the Department of State through  the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration funds the  transportation of refugees admitted into the United States Refugee  Admissions Program for resettlement to the United States through IOM.   Refugees admitted into the program and ready for travel to the United  States receive interest-free loans from IOM to pay for their  transportation from their overseas location to their domestic  resettlement site.   Upon accepting the travel loan, refugees sign a promissory note to  repay the loan over time.   The transportation is provided in the form of a loan, not a grant  because the core belief of the program is that refugees' financial  participation in making repayments against their debt will strengthen  their determination to make a success of their migration.   In a melting pot like the United States, which some have probably  forgotten, I shouldn't have to remind anyone of the valuable  contributions of refugees to our Nation. Maybe I do need to remind the  other side of this.   Refugees from Afghanistan, Burma, or Yemen are seeking a new, more  stable home, and they deserve our support.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I guess I need to  either clarify or tell the truth about the loan repayment percentage.  My colleague indicated that less than 1 percent of these loans are paid  back, but I have to tell you, approximately 81 percent of all IOM  travel loan amounts are repaid within 10 years. As of the end of fiscal  year 2022, 84 percent of IOM travel amounts were repaid within 15  years. That is the truth.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me just state  a fact. President Biden and Vice President Harris saved many, many,  many lives.   Secondly, this amendment would prohibit the use of funds to enforce  or implement a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for individuals traveling  outside of the United States. Guess what? Let me just point out that  there is not and has not been a COVID vaccine requirement for travelers  outside of the United States. I don't know why we would mandate people  leaving the United States be vaccinated. The gentlewoman knows that.  Those are requirements usually, and most of the time for countries that  have those requirements, they are set by those countries for people  entering their borders.   Once again, this is disingenuous, and I am determined to tell the  truth about what the majority is trying to do and what message they are  trying to send.   Setting health requirements for travelers coming into the United  States may be an important health response, but that would not be a  decision by the State Department. I am not sure what this amendment  really is trying to achieve.   As the COVID pandemic continues to remind us--and, yes, COVID is  still alive and well--infectious diseases do not abide by national  boundaries. While some would like to act like COVID is over, it is not.  In the United States, more than 500 people die from COVID each  week. That is a fact. That is a fact. It is clear to those families  that COVID is not over.    New variants are an expected part of the evolution of viruses and can  be more aggressive, transmittable, or cause more severe disease than  the original strain. That is a fact. Our Nation's public health  officials need to have options available to them to protect our  communities as we continue to live with COVID, as well as other  infectious diseases. That is a fact.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment has nothing to do  with securing our southern border or fentanyl or anything else. What  this amendment actually does is misrepresent the actual reality of our  policy. There is not and has not been a COVID vaccine requirement for  travelers outside of the United States. This amendment would prohibit  the use of funds to enforce or implement a COVID vaccine mandate for  individuals traveling outside of the United States, which does not  exist. This amendment has nothing to do with the southern border or  fentanyl.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, U.S. relations with Mexico are  strong and vital. Our two countries share a 2,000-mile border with 55  active ports of entry, and our bilateral relations with Mexico have a  direct impact on the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans.   I was born and raised in the border town of El Paso, Texas, and I  know the importance of the exchanges and support between Mexico and the  United States. Our significant cooperation on issues, including trade  and economic reform, entrepreneurship and innovation, and energy, are  as critical today as they have ever been.   Cutting ESF assistance to Mexico would have severe detrimental  impacts, crippling the work we do to reduce violence, build a better  business environment, and address the root causes of migration.   Without our continued support, our assistance to keep youth released  from prison from recommitting criminal offenses and being recruited by  cartels and other organizations would not be able to continue.   The work we do to level the playing field for investors, which  includes bringing greater transparency to corrupt business practices  and promoting growth in key sectors central to the United States'  businesses, such as semiconductors, for example, would be negatively  impacted.   Cutting ESF would undermine our work to create economic opportunities  in high out-migration areas in Mexico's least developed areas and  states.   A prosperous and safe Mexico should not only and will not only  benefit the Mexican people but us, as well.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I recently returned from  representing the United States at the United Nations General Assembly,  and I would be happy to talk to any of my colleagues about the value of  our partnership with the United Nations system.   It is not perfect--no large bureaucracy is--but our ability to  improve its operations, make sure its stances reflect our values, and  have the United Nations serve its mission for peace hinges on the  United States being an active, participating member of the  organization.   Organizations like UNICEF deliver last-mile education and health  services in over 120 countries. If you have ever seen kids in South  Sudan--and I have many times--walking with their blue UNICEF backpacks  to school or visited with 1 of the 365 million kids under the age of 5  who received malnutrition services last year, you would know that their  presence is real and felt by millions of kids and their families around  the world.   This amendment would cut off contributions to UNICEF. What will these  young people think about the United States, quite frankly, when they  grow up?   I don't think they would be very happy to know that we actually cut  off humanitarian assistance, especially what UNICEF delivers on behalf  of the United States.   The United Nations Development Program worked with 26 countries in  2021 to implement national action plans to tackle radicalization and  registered 38 million new voters. Eighty percent of these 38 million  were women. They helped 82 countries adopt digital platforms for  commerce and governance, cutting down on corruption. This amendment  would cut off contributions to UNDP and many others.   I fully support the authorization of these entities, but we all know  that will not happen overnight. While we work toward that goal, we  can't cut off participation and support.   Once again, we are retreating from our responsibilities as a global  leader throughout the world.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I guess I am totally confused,  then, because I don't know why we would want to cut off the funds for  children through UNICEF, UNDP, and other agencies when, in fact, the  gentlewoman should take this to the Foreign Affairs Committee. That is  where her initiative belongs.   In terms of the authorizing process, that belongs in the Foreign  Affairs Committee. It doesn't belong here on an appropriations bill to  defund programs that are providing badly needed malnutrition services  for children.   We can't just cut this off. These are appropriated funds the  authorizing committee authorizes, and that is where this belongs.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, it is clear from the science  that the most existential crisis the world faces is from the growing  climate crisis. It is an emergency.   Without intervention, our warming planet will have negative impacts  on the United States and throughout the world.   This bill already ignores the changing climate and its implications  for so many other global challenges, including promoting food and water  security, global health, the protection of tropical forests and other  vital natural resources, and social and political stability in  strategically important regions.   According to the World Bank, changes in the environment could put 132  million people back into extreme poverty by 2030, only a few more  years. It also could drive the internal migration of an additional 216  million people by 2050.                                time  1415    The State Department through the office that this amendment is  defunding must be able to work with other countries and use every tool  available to us to prevent the worst of increasingly ferocious natural  disasters, failing crops, loss of biodiversity, and the rise of new  diseases.   The climate crisis poses threats to the stability of countries,  heightens social and political tensions, and adversely affects food  prices and availability. This again, as I said earlier, is according to  our own military.   The need for foreign assistance will only increase if we do not  address this significant driver of crises around the world. At COP27,  this is what we heard over and over and over again, so it is critical  that we continue to fund the work of this office.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentlewoman says that this  office is going to destroy the prosperity of America, but I would  suggest that this amendment will continue to destroy our planet. Our  young people deserve better.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.  [[Page H4788]]     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I understand the underlying wish  for all of us to get back to the way things were prior to the onset of  the COVID pandemic. However, a total ban seems a bit excessive.   The government as a whole is in competition with the private sector  for workers. The priority of where they live has changed for some  workers, and without being offered this flexibility, the State  Department may find it more difficult to recruit or retrain exceptional  employees, which seems to be the goal of some on the other side.   Technology now exists that was never contemplated only a few years  ago and opens new possibilities for how to be effective, productive  participants in any office, whether physically present or not.   We need to ensure that our national security and effective diplomacy  is conducted by the most capable employees. Options should be available  to the Department.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, boy, is this the level we have  gotten to, to tell the State Department what meetings they cannot  attend?   Will we start saying what meetings they have to attend?   The Clinton Global Initiative is a platform for government  philanthropy, business, media, and academia to discuss identified  problems and brainstorm solutions. We should be encouraging such  collaboration.   The problems facing the world are daunting, and solutions will not  come from one place. Let's take good ideas from wherever we can and not  micromanage who goes to what meetings.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand what this amendment  does, and I don't accept the fact that it is a corrupt organization. I  do know the importance of these meetings and conferences in terms of us  coming together for solutions to lead us to global peace and security.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Chair, finally, I will just say what this  does: It is another attempt to chip away at our diplomacy.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   The Acing CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, this science and technology  agreement, or STA, with the PRC was extended for 6 months this past  August and does not commit us to a longer-term extension. The extension  will allow the administration time to amend and strengthen the terms of  the STA. Without the STA, the United States would lose valuable insight  into China's technical advances.   Additionally, many STA outcomes have been deeply beneficial to the  United States and the rest of the world. This includes determining the  importance of folic acid supplementation in preventing birth defects  and  [[Page H4790]]  decreasing China's air pollution which blows across the Pacific  contributing to our West Coast air pollution.   Opponents of this agreement cite concerns that the PRC would exploit  civilian research partnerships for military purposes; however, all  legitimate concerns about information sharing can be addressed through  modifications to the STA, rather than eliminating it entirely.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would not allow only  renegotiation. That is why I oppose it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, once again, the subject of this  amendment has been a public servant.   This public servant has worked at USAGM for nearly 25 years speaking  truth to Iranians and promoting democratic values of American society.   Once again, if we have policy issues, let's discuss it, but, please,  we have to stop demeaning our public servants.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    The subject of this amendment, again, has  served in the government for 15 years, including time in two inspectors  general offices.   Once again, the other side continues to try to really destroy our  dedicated public servants. I don't quite understand it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, bad behavior is not being rewarded.  Public servants are doing their jobs, and they are carrying out the  policies of the United States of America.   This is a personnel decision. All of these would be personnel  decisions. Unfortunately, they are being politicized, and it is really  a shame and disgrace that our public servants, who represent us so  well, are the subject of these despicable attacks.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I just have to say  how despicable it is to target dedicated public servants and to  threaten their livelihoods.   The names are going to be dragged, as you know, through the political  mud, and that is not fair. These people are public servants. This  public servant has had 40 years in the public media.   She facilitated getting staff out of Afghanistan and has overseen the  expansion of USAGM's audience to 410 million people.   Once again, if you have an issue with the policy, let's discuss that.  Why in the world do you want to continue penalizing public servants who  are representing the administrations that they serve and our country,  of course, and their dedication to the United States and their careers?   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will conclude by asking the  question again with regard to who is willing to go into public service  if their names can be dragged through the political mud, like the other  side, the majority, is doing today.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would eliminate  funding for the Art in Embassies program.   This program, established by President Kennedy 60 years ago,  recognizes that art is a powerful tool of diplomacy. It offers  ambassadors the opportunity to engage other nations in a different type  of dialogue and connection. Many of the artists featured in this  program are homegrown American artists.   The bill already includes restrictions and reporting on the Art in  Embassies program to maintain oversight and accountability. This  program is a public-private partnership, and eliminating its funding is  just ridiculous.   Let me just mention the shutdown because we are waiting. Democrats  aren't causing this shutdown. To use waiting for a shutdown or about to  have a shutdown as an excuse for eliminating funding for the Art in  Embassies program is just downright disingenuous.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree), the distinguished ranking member  of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, climate change has resulted in  lives upended in Texas and Florida and has led to extreme flooding in  California, Vermont, and throughout the country.   These amendments today really give me a lot of angst. It seems like  we have so many climate deniers putting forth amendments which really  don't believe there is a climate crisis.   This crisis poses threats to the stability of countries, heightens  social and political tensions. It adversely affects food prices and  availability, and this is according to our own military. I will say it  again, our own military has said this. The need for foreign assistance  will only increase if we do not address this significant driver of  crises around the world.   No country can solve the climate crisis alone. This requires a  multilateral effort. Secretary Kerry is lending his energy, talents,  and experience as he collaborates with other countries to address these  concerns. His relationships with foreign leaders are a benefit to the  United States and our efforts.   Again, we should be thanking people who are serving the American  people, not demonizing them for it. Funding the Special Presidential  Envoy and its office is a requirement if we are to protect national  security, strengthen the economy, and leave behind a safer planet for  our children and our grandchildren.   Again, if I were a child today, I would be terrified about the future  and what it holds for me in terms of whether we will actually have a  planet for them to inherit.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me just say a couple things  with respect to Secretary Kerry. He could be doing other things with  his life, quite frankly, yet here he is trying to address this climate  emergency, which is real, and he is trying to address this on behalf of  our country and for future generations.   I really feel very ashamed of what is taking place here on this  floor, especially as it relates to our public servants who are really  trying to lead, trying to lead not only our country, but lead on a  global scale to make sure that we have a planet for our children.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, once again, let me repeat this.  It is really despicable to target dedicated public servants and  threaten their livelihoods.   In this particular case, the amendment is targeted at someone on  leave from the Department. None of us have the information to judge the  situation.   As the State Department has said, it is a personnel matter, and it  needs to take its course. It is not a matter for Congress.   Again, if my colleagues have an issue with the policy being pursued,  then let's discuss that. We should not penalize public servants who are  representing the administration that they serve and who have dedicated  their careers to the United States.   Let me just remind you that the Iran nuclear deal did stop the  enrichment of uranium in Iran, and the world, quite frankly, is less  safe because of the previous President who pulled the United States out  of the JCPOA.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit  funds to move the United States Embassy in Israel out of Jerusalem.   The previous administration made the decision for the United States  Embassy to be located in Jerusalem, and that decision is in effect.   Let's not change our focus on keeping the government open on October  1 by taking time to debate matters that really are not issues. These  matters are not open.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, this is a total  waste of time. We are trying to keep the government open so that  people's lives won't be disrupted.   I don't know why we are doing this, but I urge my colleagues to  oppose this amendment and to focus on keeping this government open, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, President Biden's executive  orders on climate change were issued to ensure the United States' focus  on the climate crisis remains front and center. This is a climate  emergency.   It is clear from the science that the most existential crisis the  world faces is from the growing climate crisis. Without intervention,  our warming planet will continue to have negative impacts on our  country and throughout the world.   Climate-related foreign assistance can help developing countries  adapt to the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels,  droughts, and floods, and build an energy grid that is constructed for  the next century, not the last one.   This is not something we can wait to worry about. This is an  emergency, Mr. Chairman. Rising coastlines and hazardous temperatures  mean that there are countries that might literally not exist in a  generation because of the changes that are already happening.   Once again, I was in Egypt at the COP27 conference. This is all we  heard about. This is an emergency.   Let me just say: The need for foreign assistance will only increase,  and my colleagues know this, if we don't address the changes that we  are seeing in the climate now.   Yes, to my friend and colleague, every now and then there are  glimmers of hope on bipartisanship. I enjoy working with you and hope  that we can get the repeal of these AUMFs to the floor, but let me just  say we have to find where we can find common ground, and we are working  to do that here in this body.   When it comes to shutting down the government, the President is not  trying to shut down the government. I mean, every single hour there is  a change in the goalpost from your side, not from our side. We just  want to keep the government open so that people's lives won't be  impacted.   We are trying to figure it out, but we have to have a partner in  trying to figure it out. Hopefully, we will be able to pass a  continuing resolution until we can get this resolved, hopefully, in a  bipartisan manner.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, finally, let me just say our  young people are watching. Our young people are relying on us to  address this emergency in a way that is going to make sure that they  have a planet to live on when they grow up.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1930     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, Ambassador Nuland has proudly  represented the United States for 33 years and has been confirmed by  the Senate several times.   Mr. Chair, if I were about to make a decision about my career, what I  am hearing today would be really upsetting. I definitely would not make  a decision to go into the Foreign Service, because my whole life could  be destroyed if I made that decision.   It is really despicable that we are targeting public servants,  threatening their livelihoods, and really making these amendments a  disincentive for people of great talent to serve our country abroad. It  is really a shame and disgrace.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman the United States once again  became a proud member of UNESCO this past July. This decision was a  huge achievement. It involved several years of negotiation, and it  absolutely is in the United States' interest, something only the United  States should be able to decide.                                time  1945    It is wrong to let another party make that decision for us.   Debates currently at UNESCO range from protection of world heritage  sites to the evolution of artificial intelligence to the responsibility  of nations to respect media freedoms to the equitable access to  education, and importantly, the toll of the Holocaust.   The United States should be part of these discussions, making sure  that our values are reflected.   We are fighting for our values. Already since we rejoined in July, we  have been able to successfully advocate for the direct participation of  Israel in a recent meeting in Saudi Arabia--a diplomatic achievement in  everyone's interest.  [[Page H4833]]    Participation in international institutions like UNESCO are in the  best interest of the United States of America.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, putting America first actually  means our relationships throughout the world in terms of what we invest  in and how we raise our concerns and our values and what we do to bring  the world together in peace and security.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, stripping Palestinians of food,  housing, healthcare, education, and opportunities to strengthen their  livelihoods only threatens to ignite further unrest, instability, and  distress. Such a cutoff would not only affect the West Bank in Gaza,  but Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, as well.   Now, along with our Ranking Member DeLauro, I have visited UNRWA  schools, and I can tell you that these young people are grateful to  America for our support. Yes, our absence, of course, invites other  countries.   I want these young people to remember who supports them and who is  looking out for them.   This bill already puts oversight and accountability requirements on  UNRWA before funding can be made available. A total suspension of aid  would make it much harder for UNRWA to make sure that these controls  are in place and to do proper monitoring, while at the same time  cutting off essential services to the Palestinian people that currently  are only provided by UNRWA.   This is morally wrong.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    A couple of facts. One, UNRWA reviews all host  country textbooks used in its schools to ensure consistency with the  United Nations' positions, educational appropriateness, and UNESCO  standards.   Secondly, UNRWA has a zero tolerance policy with regard to staff  neutrality violations and takes all such violations seriously,  including those raised by organizations.   Investigations are launched with involved staff members placed on  administrative leave pending investigation. Where allegations are found  to be true and, thus, contrary to UNRWA's regulations and rules,  appropriate disciplinary measures are imposed up to and including  dismissal. Like any other organization which we provide resources to,  UNRWA has accountability mechanisms in place and, in fact, follows up  with regard to any charges that the gentleman has raised.   The damage that is going to be done through this amendment is a  damage that is really damaging, first of all, to the children who  benefit from UNRWA investments from this country, but it is also  damaging to our leadership as it relates to being a real leader in  terms of our efforts to seek global peace and  [[Page H4834]]  security. That is what this bill really should be about.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my colleague's  amendment, and I thank Representatives Massie and McGovern for offering  it.   Cluster bombs are some of the most inhumane weapons on Earth. The  United States should not use or stockpile these weapons, and we  certainly should not be transferring them to any other nation.   Cluster bombs undermine our efforts to promote human rights and  dignity everywhere. At a time when we are trying to mobilize the world  in defense of human dignity in Ukraine, our cause is undermined by the  continued existence of these weapons in the United States' arsenal.   Cluster munitions leave bomblets spread over an indiscriminate area,  often lying undetonated for generations. Unexploded cluster munitions  have maimed or killed countless civilians over the last few decades,  including an outrageous number of children.   We are still spending millions of dollars to clean up cluster  munitions used in Southeast Asia decades ago. We cannot be complicit in  their further spread.   Nearly 125 countries have banned their use by signing onto the United  Nations Convention on Cluster Munitions. For years, this bill, the  SFOPS bill, has carried language severely limiting their transfer to  other countries.    Mr. Chair, let me reiterate that nearly 125  countries have banned their use by signing onto the United States  Convention on Cluster Munitions.   For years, the SFOPS bill, our bill, has carried language severely  limiting their transfer to other countries, but this has not proven to  be enough. A complete ban is overdue, and I am proud to support this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I can't even imagine the dire  straits that would lead me to send my child on their own on a perilous  journey to face an uncertain situation at the United States border. No  one does that willingly or without exhausting every other alternative.   I have been to the border many times. I was born and raised in El  Paso, Texas, a border town. I talk to everyone I meet and ask them  about the circumstances and why they left their homes. Ninety-nine  percent said they did not want to leave where they lived. No one wants  to leave their homes.   For this amendment to suggest that countries are intentionally  sending their youth away or that somehow this desperation would be  improved by taking away the education, anticorruption, or nutrition  programming that this assistance pays for is ignorant at best and  cynical at worst.   The gentleman's amendment cut three times the assistance we provide  to Guatemala. That is three times for the last full programming year.  It cuts double the assistance for Honduras and Guatemala. It is un- implementable, and it is really very cynical and dangerous.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2015
