 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 159, the Chance to Compete  Act.   The bipartisan Chance to Compete Act was introduced by Representative  Foxx, who I see is here with us, and Representative Connolly. I thank  them both for their hard work on it.   The bill aims to make evaluations more useful in assessing the skills  of candidates for Federal positions and to alleviate inefficiencies  that have long hampered the hiring process.   The bill turns away from current reliance on self-assessment and  attainment of educational degrees to determine candidate qualifications  in the hiring process. Instead, subject matter experts and agencies  would design assessments that test specific knowledge for a position  for which the agency is hiring.   This overhaul would better match qualified applicants with positions  and expand opportunities to candidates with more diverse professional  and educational backgrounds.   The Chance to Compete Act aligns with the Office of Personnel  Management's guidance of last May to facilitate an executive order to  modernize the process of hiring Federal job candidates.   Establishing hiring methods that are more skills-based will improve  agency managers' ability to hire people who possess the knowledge and  experience to do the job and to hire from a wider array of qualified  applicants.   The bill also directs OPM to create an online platform for sharing  candidate assessments between agencies and maintain a portal for hiring  managers to find candidates who have already demonstrated their  qualifications for certain positions but were not yet hired.   Under this legislation, agencies may assemble talent teams to support  this assessment of candidates in the hiring process. The OPM Director  would be required to submit annual progress reports to Congress on use  of the new assessments. After 5 years, the GAO would conduct a study of  the implementation of the Federal job assessment reforms and their  impacts on the hiring process.   This bill streamlines the hiring process for agencies and will  shorten the time it takes to bring new, well-qualified employees on  board.   I thank Dr. Foxx for her leadership in introducing it. The bill is  the result of constructive collaboration by several members of our  committee from both sides of the aisle, including Mr. Connolly.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  this bipartisan measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support passage of this bipartisan  legislation. It is an auspicious way for us to begin on the Oversight  Committee. I salute the chairman for his wisdom in bringing this  forward, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do indeed support this significant, commonsense, and  bipartisan legislation. I thank the chairman again, and I thank  Representatives Palmer and Connolly for their hard work on it.   The Settlement Agreement Information Database Act will create a  database of settlement agreements entered into by Federal agencies  relating to alleged violations of Federal civil or criminal law. The  OMB will manage the database and set deadlines for submission.   The heads of executive agencies will be required to submit details  about the  [[Page H264]]  types of settlement agreements they have entered into, the parties who  are actually involved in them, the specific violations, and the dates  upon which such settlement agreements were made. All information about  the settlement agreements would remain public until 5 years after they  terminate.   The information in the agreements would remain subject to the Freedom  of Information Act, but if the head of the agency decided to keep an  entire agreement confidential, he or she would be required to provide a  specific explanation of that action.                                time  1745    This legislation will substantially improve the transparency  surrounding so many settlement agreements, which in the past have been  very difficult for the public to access or even to find. Transparency  is, of course, central to the rule of law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I would say, in closing, that I was moved by  what Mr. Palmer had to say, that democracy is based on consent, and  consent is based on access, but there is no access if you don't have  transparency.   I think about something that James Madison said: ``And a people who  mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that  knowledge gives.'' So people need to have knowledge of everything that  our government is doing. We don't want government entities entering  into secret, sweetheart settlements with different litigants. It has  got to be open to the whole public.   Mr. Speaker, I thank him and I thank the chairman for bringing this  forward, and I yield back the balance of my time.
