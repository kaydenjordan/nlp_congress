 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2430, the  FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017.   We all have loved ones, friends, and neighbors who are suffering from  life-threatening diseases and illnesses and who want hope that that  next generation treatment or therapy will still be available to them.   It is our shared responsibility to support the FDA as well as  countless researchers and patient advocates across the country who are  working to bring new cures to market. This critical, bipartisan  legislation helps us achieve that important goal by reauthorizing user  fee programs at FDA for 5 years.   I want to thank Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Chairman  Burgess, and Ranking Member Green for continuing the longstanding  tradition on the Energy and Commerce Committee of advancing this  legislation in a bipartisan manner. Our work together on this bill  should be a model for how we can cooperate on other issues in the  future, and it is good that we are passing this bill on the House floor  well in advance of the September 30 deadline.   I also want to thank the committee for including provisions that I  worked on with Mr. Lance, Dr. Burgess, and Mr. Green to enhance  penalties for counterfeit and diverted drugs, and for including Mr.  Kennedy's over-the-counter hearing aid bill, which will go a long way  to providing real relief to the 30 million Americans who suffer from  hearing loss.   Hearing loss is a quality-of-life issue, plain and simple, and  passage of today's legislation will help many receive the treatment  that they need in a quick manner, while also ensuring safety.   It is a good bill that deserves our support.
