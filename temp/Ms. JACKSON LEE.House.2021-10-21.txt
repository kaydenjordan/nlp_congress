 Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  support of the rule governing debate for H. Res. 730, ``Resolution  Recommending that the House of Representatives Find Stephen K. Bannon  in Contempt of Congress for Refusal to Comply with a Subpoena Duly  Issued by the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on  the United States Capitol.''   On January 6th the domestic terrorists who beat law enforcement  officers and breached the Citadel of democracy of the United States  wore insignias of White Supremacist groups, waved confederate flags,  hung a noose on the lawn, and they were shouting racial epithets.   According to published reports and his own public statements, Mr.  Bannon had specific knowledge about the events planned for January 6th  before they occurred: just before the day of the attack, Mr. Bannon  told his listeners:         All hell is going to break loose tomorrow . . . It's not       going to happen like you think it's going to happen. OK, it's       going to be quite extraordinarily different. All I can say       is, strap in . . . You made this happen and tomorrow it's       game day. So strap in. Let's get ready. So many people said,       `Man, if I was in a revolution, I would be in Washington.'       Well this is your time in history.    At 12:15 p.m. on January 6th he said to the assembled multitude on  the Ellipse: ``You will never take back our country with weakness.''   Less than an hour later, at 1:10 p.m., he admonished the crowd: ``We  fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell you will not have a  country anymore.''   Madam Speaker, the assault on the U.S. Capitol by domestic terrorists  and insurrectionists rightly takes its place as one of the darkest  moments in our nation's history since the Civil War.   Madam Speaker, the January 6 insurrection caused tragic loss of life  and many injuries, while leaving behind widespread physical damage to  the Capitol Complex and emotional trauma for Members, Congressional  employees, and the Capitol Police.   It bears repeating often that the Congress and the nation owe undying  gratitude to the men and women who answered the call of constitutional  duty and heroically won the day on that bloody and deadly afternoon.   Madam Speaker, the domestic terrorists and seditionists who attacked  the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 were not, as some of their  ardent defenders and apologists across the aisle have stated falsely,  on a ``normal tour visit''; nor was their effort to lay siege to the  Capitol and disrupt the processes of government an act of persons who  love their country.   And it is absurd to suggest that it was a celebration of the United  States and what it stands for when the leading edge of terrorists  desecrated the Capitol by offensively parading the treasonous  Confederate flag through the building and when, because of their  insurrection, several members of law enforcement made the supreme  sacrifice and scores more were seriously injured.   Madam Speaker, we owe it not just to those who lost their lives  during that day, but to all Americans to figure out exactly what  happened and how that day came to be.   We must understand that day in order to prevent the intended purpose  of the January 6 insurrection--to disrupt the Joint Meeting of Congress  to tally the votes of presidential electors and announce the results to  the nation and the world--from every occurring again, because it was  the greatest threat to the American Experiment since the Civil War when  the pro-slavery forces decided to make war rather than let the nation  survive. and the pro-freedom forces would accept war rather than let  the nation perish.   The Select Committee has diligently continued in their duty to  determine the causes and events that transpired during the  insurrectionist attack.   Specifically, the Select Committee's purposes include:   To investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes  ``relating to the January 6, 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the  United States Capitol Complex;''  [[Page H5768]]    To investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes  ``relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power;''  and   To investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes  relating to ``the influencing factors that fomented such an attack on  American representative democracy while engaged in a constitutional  process.''   In line with these purposes, the Select Committee requested  information from Mr. Bannon central to its legislative purpose:   On September 23, 2021, Chairman Thompson signed and transmitted a  subpoena to Mr. Bannon, ordering the production of both documents and  testimony relevant to the January 6th attack on the Capitol.   The subpoena required Mr. Bannon to produce the documents on October  7 and required his presence for deposition testimony on October 14.   Mr. Bannon simply defied the subpoena--failing to produce the  documents on October 7 and failing to show up for the deposition on  October 14.   In a letter to Mr. Bannon's counsel on October 15, Chairman Thompson  noted that Mr. Bannon had not even attempted to provide the Select  Committee any explanation for refusing to comply with the Select  Committee's demand for documents and testimony on a range of subjects  that do not involve communications with the former President.   An individual who fails or refuses to comply with a House subpoena  may be cited for contempt of Congress, and in his October 8th letter to  Mr. Bannon's counsel, Chairman Thompson warned Mr. Bannon that his  continued non-compliance would put him in jeopardy of a vote to refer  him to the House to consider a criminal contempt referral.   Mr. Bannon's failure to appear for deposition or produce responsive  documents in the face of this clear advisement and warning by the  Chairman constitutes willful failure to comply with the subpoena.   The purpose behind seeking this information is because Mr. Bannon  played a central role in organizing January 6th attack on the Capitol,  and understanding this role is essential to understanding the context  in which the January 6th attack occurred.   Mr. Bannon constructed and participated in the ``stop the steal''  public relations effort that motivated the January 6th attack.   Mr. Bannon planned political and other activities in advance of  January 6th.   Mr. Bannon participated in a ``war room'' of promoters and prominent  supporters of the ``stop the steal'' movement that met on January 5th.   Mr. Bannon communicated with President Trump several times in advance  of the January 6th attack, urging him to take measures to interfere  with the count of electoral votes and to make January 6th a day of  reckoning.   In fact, according to published reports and his own public  statements, Mr. Bannon had specific knowledge about the events planned  for January 6th before they occurred: just before the day of the  attack, Mr. Bannon urged his listeners:         All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. . . . It's not       going to happen like you think it's going to happen. OK, it's       going to be quite extraordinarily different. All I can say       is, strap in. You made this happen and tomorrow it's game       day. So strap in. Let's get ready. So many people said, `Man,       if I was in a revolution, I would be in Washington.' Well       this is your time in history.    In sum, Mr. Bannon appears to have played a multi-faceted role in the  events of the January 6th attack and the American people are entitled  to hear his first-hand testimony regarding his actions.   As recognized by the Supreme Court, ``The power of the Congress to  conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process,'' and  that the subpoena power is a ``public duty, which every person within  the jurisdiction of the Government is bound to perform when properly  summoned.''   Rather than comply with Congress' inherent powers, and help heal the  trauma this nation witnessed on January 6th, Mr. Bannon has simply  refused to comply with the Select Committee's subpoena.   Madam Speaker, this should not be a partisan issue; it is the very  power of Congress to investigate matters of issue that is at stake.   For this reason, I rise in support of the rule governing debate for  H. Res. 370, ``Resolution Recommending that the House of  Representatives Find Stephen K. Bannon in Contempt of Congress for  Refusal to Comply with a Subpoena Duly Issued by the Select Committee  to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol,''  and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to be able to further  defend and add to my statement regarding H. Res. 730 recommending that  the House of Representatives find Stephen K. Bannon in contempt of  Congress.   It is well known that even from his own words and published reports,  these are the words that Mr. Bannon told his listeners:   ``All hell is going to break loose tomorrow.''   ``It is not going to happen like you think it is going to happen.  Okay. It is going to be quite extraordinarily different. All I can say  is, strap in. . . . You have made this happen, and tomorrow, it is game  day. So strap in. Let's get ready.''   ``So many people through my life said, man, if I was in the  Revolution, I would be with Washington at Trenton. Well, this is your  time in history.''   There is no constitutional provision that would deny the January 6th  Select Committee the right to receive information from Mr. Bannon after  he has been subpoenaed for information regarding the insurrection, the  riot, the attack on January 6.   The idea of executive privilege is exerted by the existing President,  limited on a President of the United States no longer in office. In  fact, Mr. Bannon has been gone from the White House since 2017. He has  no legitimate basis.   Based on three equal branches of government, we cannot allow an  individual to undermine democracy. This is a democratic republic, and I  expect that the referral to the United States Department of Justice  will be handled.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from New  Mexico for her leadership. I am very glad that she has emphasized the  unanimity and the unity of Democrats as relates to all of our  constituents, all Americans, whether we are in New Mexico, Texas, or  whether, we are in New York, whether in Mississippi, Illinois,  California, whether we are up in the New England States or down the  coast in the Carolinas and down to Florida and all in between, it is  important, again, to emphasize to the American people that this is  about you.   Breaking news. Each of these elements that we are fighting for--and  we take no discomfort in you saying at the bus stop, while taking your  child to school, what are they talking about?   It is our responsibility to let you know what we are talking about  and to let you know that the Congressional Progressive Caucus has been  talking and working and talking and working. We now are at a point  where we will say to you: We will not negotiate against ourselves.   But we are the engine to get it done working with the Quad Caucus,  the Tri Caucus, and the Democratic Caucus.   So, Mr. Speaker, you have heard that there are numbers that may be  different from $3.5 trillion of which I still stand on. But we are  working to see how we can respond to the American people, and that is  you have indicated that there is a framework that will change my life.  I want to see it sooner than later.   So here is where we are. There is the INVEST Act, though, we are  talking tonight about Build Back Better. I want you to know that, Mr.  Speaker, as some would say, it is on the table. It is on the table for  broadband. It is on the table for high-speed rail. It is on the table  for electric cars. It is on the table for the trials and tribulations  of your commute where there is a pothole here or a freeway that is out  of commission or a bridge or a dam, it is there. So go home and be sure  that we will have that framework.   But then Build Back Better is what I want to conclude my remarks on  today. We will provide you with the kind of quality of life that gives  you more time with your children, that gives you better wages, that  gives you climate change response, and gives your child a universal  pre-K and kindergarten to ensure that they are competitive around the  world; and, yes, Medicaid for those who never lived in States where  they opted into the public option or expanded Medicaid. So if you are  working every day, we want you to have health insurance, and on  Medicare we want that hearing, we want those eyes, and we want dental  to be part of your life.   This is what is the bowl of fruit that is there for you. The next  step as we work out for how these plans will be implemented is to get  it done. My view is what I heard from a Member--I will give him  credit--from Arizona. Put them together and let's move once we organize  and analyze the pieces of it. And I will just leave, Madam Manager, my  comment on the table.   Let us be meticulous and careful about what plans or what items can  accept reduction because you don't want something that does not work  because you have reduced it in time or dollars. Let's be meticulous,  and that is what we are doing. And let's make sure that we are  meticulous in ensuring that the final bill is an impactful bill on  lives in terms of years of how long the program lasts and in terms of  dollars of how much impact it will have.   We as the Congressional Progressive Caucus have been in the center  and in the mix, and we will do the Nation's bidding. We will do it  right because we stand for the people of this Nation, and particularly  those who cannot speak for themselves. That gives me pride. I am  delighted to be here on the floor with the gentlewoman to ensure that  those voices can be heard.   I know working with the President we will get it done. Put it  together, and let's move.
