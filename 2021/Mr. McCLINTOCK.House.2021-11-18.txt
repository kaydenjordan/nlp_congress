 Madam Speaker, the latest estimate for the Democrats'  build back broke bill is $4.9 trillion. That averages about $40,000 per  family over the next decade.   They say it is paid for. Well, by whom?   By you, of course, through direct taxes, tax-driven price increases,  and worst of all, inflation.   And what do you get?   Well, amnesty for 7 million illegal aliens. That is the entire  population of Alaska, Wyoming, Vermont, Rhode Island, Delaware, North  Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana combined.   Now, explain to me how working Americans are helped by flooding the  market with low-wage foreign labor.   The trillions of dollars of excess spending by the Democrats has  already driven the inflation rate to 6.2 percent and rising. Madam  Speaker, that means if you earn $50,000 a year, the Democrats just took  $3,100 of that. If you have managed to put $100,000 towards your  retirement, the Democrats just took $6,200 of that.   Policy matters. When Republicans reduced the tax and regulatory  burdens, we delivered the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, the  lowest poverty rate in 60 years, and the fastest wage growth in 40  years. The Democrats have reversed these policies and reproduced the  misery that we are suffering today.   The American people know that we are on the wrong track and that this  bill sends us deeper into that cold and bleak winter.   Build back better?   How about put things back the way they were before you broke them,  Madam Speaker.
