 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address H.R.  5305, the continuing resolution for short-term government funding that  passed the House last night, which I voted against.   Earlier this year, House Democrats passed their $3.5 trillion  partisan budget package, which significantly increased funding for  their own spending priorities. However, this bill did not include  funding for our military, the Department of Homeland Security, or  grants for law enforcement.   Now, House Democrats have introduced their continuing resolution to  fund the government and raise the debt ceiling through December 2022 to  allow even more taxpayer dollars to go toward their spending spree.   Mr. Speaker, funding the government should be a bipartisan issue.  Yet, rather than working together, Democrats expect Republicans to give  them a blank check for their unprecedented spending. Democrats are  responsible for expenditures; they need to take responsibility for the  borrowing, too.                            ____________________
