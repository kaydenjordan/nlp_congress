 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Virginia for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, while I do, in fact, support his amendment, I would  also like to speak for just a minute on the previous amendment offered  to H.R. 7666, the BIG Act.   We have seen over the past couple of years a significant rise in  mental health issues with our students, whether it is in high school,  whether it is in middle school, or whether it is in college. We have  seen the effects of the pandemic, but there are a lot of other things  that have created this mental health crisis for our children around  America.   What our children need are resources, and they need resources at a  very early age. So what the BIG Act does is it accumulates best  practices from different schools around the country, and it makes sure  that we intervene with students early. We want to get these young  people the resources that they need.                                time  1600    There are a couple of things about this that we think are very  important:   Number one, early intervention has been proven to show that we can  prevent a catastrophic event. We want students to be healthy and happy  and functioning. What we would also like to do is limit the interaction  with law enforcement. We want to make sure that the students are  getting these resources across the board.   So this body passed the BIG Act last year, and they did it with wide  bipartisan support; however, the Senate did not take this bill up. So I  say, let's do it again. Let's pass it as part of this important  package.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and our ranking members for  making such an effort to get this important piece of legislation across  the finish line.    Madam Speaker, by direction of the Republican  Conference, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1197         Resolved, That the following named Members be, and are       hereby, elected to the following standing committees of the       House of Representatives:        Committee on Natural Resources: Ms. Conway.        Committee on Veterans' Affairs: Ms. Conway.        Committee on Agriculture: Mrs. Flores.        Committee on Homeland Security: Mrs. Flores.        Committee on the Budget: Mr. Moore of Utah, to rank       immediately after Mr. Smith of Missouri.    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
