 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a  Savannah, Georgia, native, a Pooler Packer alum, a Savannah Christian  School graduate, a UGA Bulldog, a current First District constituent,  and an extraordinary golfer on his first major championship win at the  151st British Open Golf Championship in England, Brian Harman.   This win is an incredible honor for the entire First District and was  a long time coming for Brian, decades in the making.   Mr. Speaker, you see my sons in this picture. They played youth  basketball with Brian, and, in fact, my talented wife, Amy, was the  coach of that team. We are so very proud of Brian.   I remember seeing firsthand the talent that Brian possessed, and it  wasn't any surprise when Brian went on to play competitively for the  University of Georgia's golf team or to finish runner-up at the 2017 US  Open.   This past week, after four rounds of golf, Brian's final score at the  2023 Open was 271, 13 strokes under par and six strokes ahead of all  other golfers in the tournament.   Brian's win was decisive and hard-earned, and I, on behalf of the  entire Savannah community and the First District of Georgia,  congratulate him immensely for his victory.   Brian has made Savannah, the First District of Georgia, the State of  Georgia, the Pooler Packers, the Savannah Christian School, and the  Bulldog Nation proud this past weekend.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing more great work and many more  championships from Brian in the future.                    Congratulating Southern Soul Barbecue     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  local St. Simons barbecue restaurant, Southern Soul Barbecue, for being  named the Best Barbecue Restaurant in Georgia.   This year, Yelp searched around the entire country to find the best  barbecue restaurants in the Nation, and Southern Soul was an easy  selection.   After serving charities in 2007, Griffin Bufkin and Harrison Sapp  launched their barbecue business in a subleased kitchen before moving  into an antique converted gas station.   They caught their big break in 2010 when Southern Soul was featured  on Food Network's ``Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.''   The St. Simon's community continued to support their favorite  barbecue business even after a horrible fire erupted in the  establishment in 2010.   Southern Soul didn't let this tragic fire stop them, and in the year  2023, they are still winning awards and serving the best barbecue in  Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Southern Soul on their sustained success,  and I thank them for all they do for our community.                   Celebrating the Life of Mr. Ralph Dixon     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Mr. Ralph Dixon, a loving husband, a humble veteran, and a  proud grandparent.   Ralph was born in Blackshear, Georgia, in the First Congressional  District  [[Page H3960]]  in 1929 and graduated from Blackshear High School with the class of  1949. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United  States Army, spending 21 years in uniformed service.   His official service may have ended in uniform, but his service to  the Nation did not stop there. After returning, he began a new 20-year  career as a civil servant at Fort Stewart.   On top of his work serving our country, Ralph was very active in the  First Baptist Church in Hinesville, becoming a deacon and singing in  the choir for over 50 years.   He is preceded by his loving wife of 66 years, Jacqueline Waters  Dixon.   Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers go out to his entire family,  including 4 children, 12 grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren, and 1  great-great-grandchild.                      Congratulating Leopold's Ice Cream     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  local Savannah ice cream parlor, Leopold's Ice Cream, for being named  in Yelp's Top 100 ice cream shops for 2023.   While it is the many positive Yelp reviews that landed Leopold's on  this list, the parlor's superb reputation has been built on over a  century of hard work and success.   Leopold's was founded in 1919 by three brothers from Greece on the  corner of Gwinnett and Habersham Streets in Savannah.   Streetcar riders would reportedly jump off the streetcar to get their  super premium ice cream, which is handcrafted and uses original, secret  recipes and techniques handed down in the Leopold family.   Over the years, Leopold's Ice Cream has received rave endorsements by  many famous historical figures and celebrities alike.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Stratton Leopold and Leopold's Ice Cream  on their tremendous achievement and thank them for being a joy and an  inspiration to the great city of Savannah, Georgia, and the First  Congressional District of Georgia.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  recent Camden County High School graduate Evalynn Sanford for winning a  national championship in architectural drafting at the SkillsUSA  National Leadership and Skills Conference in Atlanta.   Sanford, who is 18 years young, captured the gold medal on Saturday,  June 24, 2023. She faced nearly 50 other competitors from across the  U.S. in the architectural drafting competition.   In August, she will graduate with an associate's degree in drafting  technology from Coastal Pines Technical College.   Sanford has an impressive resume, already working as an intern at  Charles W. Day Design, which is an architectural firm in Brunswick.   In addition to her award, Sanford earned $2,000 in scholarships,  which she will put toward her next educational endeavor, a degree in  architecture from the Savannah College of Art and Design.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Ms. Sanford on her championship and wish  her the best of luck in all her future endeavors.                            ____________________
