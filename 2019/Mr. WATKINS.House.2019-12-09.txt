 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of democracy and  freedom for the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the importance of  protecting religious minorities in the region.   In August, the Indian Government rescinded article 370 of their  Constitution, repealing autonomy of the region; and, since then, it has  been cut off through widespread communications blackouts. There have  been curfews, and some 4,000 people have been detained, which includes  children as young as 9 years old. There have been reported human rights  abuses and deaths resulting from inaccessibility to healthcare.   Madam Speaker, this situation cannot stand, and I ask my colleagues  to join me in supporting H. Res. 745, which urges the Indian Government  to uphold the democratic values upon which it was founded.                            ____________________
