 Mr. Chairman, it is exciting to play a role in crafting  legislation as impactful as reauthorizing the FAA, especially as a  freshman legislator. I came to Congress to deliver for the people of  west Michigan, and this robust bipartisan bill will do just that.   Two specific provisions in this bill will be especially beneficial  for my district. Michigan's Third District includes the Gerald R. Ford  International Airport, the second busiest airport in the State and one  of the busiest airports in the entire country.   The airport's aging air traffic control tower is preventing needed  expansion. It is the oldest tower among any of the top 75 largest  airports and does not meet the security requirements or operational  necessities found in more modern towers.   This bill includes provisions which direct FAA to specifically  consider old towers at airports like GRR when selecting projects for  replacement and increasing transparency around the process the FAA uses  when deciding which towers need to be upgraded. These policies will  help GRR forge a path forward to ensure the airport can meet the needs  of the region.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for working  with me to include these critical priorities for my district and other  similarly situated airports around the country, and I urge the passage  of this bill.
