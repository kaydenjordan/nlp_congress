 Madam Speaker, the Department of Defense published  a report revealing the dire impacts of the President's unlawful  emergency declaration. It threatens to steal nearly $150 million of  urgently needed Arizona military construction funds critical to the  security of our Nation and the well-being of our men and women in  uniform and military families.   Both military bases within my district, Fort Huachuca and Davis- Monthan Air Force Base, are on the list that could be directly affected  by these cuts, and I am here today to say, no way.   I represent a border district in southern Arizona, and we don't want  the expensive, ineffective wall. We want our military bases funded.   Madam Speaker, 59 percent of Americans reject this emergency  declaration. I will continue to take action to block this brutal  decision and fight to protect Arizonans from the drastic consequences  of this dangerous, unlawful declaration.                            ____________________
