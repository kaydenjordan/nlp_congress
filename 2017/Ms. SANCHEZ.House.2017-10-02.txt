 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great sorrow and anger.  Last night, more than 58 people were tragically murdered and over 500  wounded in a senseless act of violence in Las Vegas, Nevada.   The murderer was found to have 20 guns, including at least one  automatic rifle. No person should be allowed to possess a weapon that  makes indiscriminately killing human beings easier.   It just baffles me that some of my colleagues don't agree with that  basic premise. Not only do they not agree with sensible gun control  measures like background checks and no fly, no buy, they won't even  allow public research dollars to be used to research gun control and  gun violence.   Until Congress acts to make it harder for dangerous people to acquire  these types of weapons, tragedies like this will continue to happen.   How many more people have to die?   How much more blood must be shed before Congress decides to act?   Moments of silence and sympathy and prayers from Members of this body  are not enough anymore. The time has come to act. We must act now.                            ____________________
