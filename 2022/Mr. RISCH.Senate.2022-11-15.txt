 Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Black Sheep Sporting Goods as the Idaho  Small Business of the Month for October 2022.   David Knoll has owned and operated Black Sheep Sporting Goods since  1975. Now managed by his son, Brian, generations of Idahoans have  visited the various locations where Black Sheep has operated to buy  hunting equipment, outdoor gear, firearms, and toys.   In early 2021, the Knolls purchased Coeur d'Alene's Silver Lake Mall  and relocated the retail store there. Like many malls, the Silver Lake  Mall was long past its glory years. The Knolls spent significant  resources to revitalize the mall, culminating in a well-attended grand  reopening earlier this year. Even more notably, they did this in the  midst of a nationwide pandemic. The Knolls are longtime Idahoans who  have brought the brick-and-mortar stores in the mall back to life.   The Knolls opened several concept stores under Black Sheep each with  a specific product focus including Knives and Optics, Hydration  Station, and American Heritage. After nearly five decades in business,  Black Sheep is still the region's go-to spot for outdoor and sporting  goods enthusiasts.   Congratulations to the Knolls and all the employees at Black Sheep  Sporting Goods for being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the  Month for October 2022. Thank you for serving Idaho as small business  owners and entrepreneurs. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________     Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Dragon Fly Tarps as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for November 2022.   Matt and Stephanie Nelson started Dragon Fly Tarps from the comfort  of their basement in 2003 when Matt was unable to find an affordable  tarp that fit his needs. As a former river guide and avid outdoorsman,  Matt's personal experience played an important role in the design of  bigger, lighter, and quality tarps.   Dragon Fly Tarps' first customers were friends and family, and  requests began to increase as happy customers made word-of-mouth  referrals. As the business began to grow, the Nelsons moved their  operation to a small space within Arco's Business Incubation Center in  Butte, ID. Production needs quickly outgrew this space, so in 2018, the  Nelsons moved operations to their current location on Arco's Grand  Avenue, where they have been able to expand their product line to  include tarps for Jeeps, campers, vans, and custom projects.   Dragon Fly Tarps no longer relies on word-of-mouth referrals as it  has become well-known throughout the outdoor recreation community. The  Nelsons and their staff of eight continue to work diligently to keep up  with the demand for custom tarp orders from across the country and  internationally.   Congratulations to the Nelsons and all the employees at Dragon Fly  Tarps for being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for  November 2022. Thank you for serving Idaho as small business owners and  entrepreneurs. You make our great State proud, and I look forward to  your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
