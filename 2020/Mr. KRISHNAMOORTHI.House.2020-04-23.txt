 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  legislation. As a small business person, I am glad that it helps small  businesses. As the husband of a physician who is treating COVID  patients today, I am glad that it helps hospitals. But as an American,  I am glad that we are coming together to help those whose lives are  falling apart. We must do more, but let's come back together again and  resolve to do this in a bipartisan fashion once again.
