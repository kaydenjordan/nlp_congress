 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Ethics, I  offer a privileged resolution (H. Res. 1074) in the matter of  Representative   David Schweikert, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:  [[Page H4195]]                                     H. Res. 1074         Resolved, (1) That the House adopt the Report of the       Committee on Ethics dated July 30, 2020, In the Matter of       Allegations Relating to Representative David Schweikert.    Madam Speaker, I yield an equal amount of time to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Marchant), the ranking member of the  Committee on Ethics, for purposes of debate only, and I ask unanimous  consent that he be permitted to control that time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, as chairman of the Committee on Ethics, I rise in  support of a resolution for Representative David Schweikert of Arizona  to be reprimanded by the House of Representatives.   One of our most basic obligations as Members of Congress is to adhere  to the principle that public office is a public trust. To uphold that  trust and to maintain civic confidence in the integrity of this body,  we, as Members, have bound ourselves by certain standards of official  conduct.   Our Constitution vests the House with the responsibility for self- discipline and self-accountability to those ethical standards. The  Committee on Ethics, whose membership is evenly divided between  Republicans and Democrats and whose work is supported by nonpartisan  staff, is charged with: enforcing the laws and rules governing our  official conduct; investigating allegations that those laws and rules  have been violated; and, where appropriate, making recommendations to  the House for the disposition of such investigations. We are here today  to fulfill that charge.   Our committee began reviewing allegations involving Representative  Schweikert after public reports detailed potential misconduct by him  and his former chief of staff, who is no longer employed by the House.   In 2018, the Office of Congressional Ethics sent two separate  referrals regarding Representative Schweikert to the Ethics Committee  for further review. Those referrals included: troubling allegations of  systemic campaign finance violations and reporting errors by  Representative Schweikert's authorized campaign committees; allegations  of misuse of his Members' Representational Allowance, or MRA, for  unofficial purposes; and evidence that he pressured his official staff  to perform campaign work.   During the 115th Congress, the committee impaneled an investigative  subcommittee to lead a bipartisan review of these allegations. At the  start of the 116th Congress, the committee reestablished that evenly  divided bipartisan panel and appointed Representative Dean Phillips of  Minnesota as its chair, along with Representative Bill Flores of Texas,  Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, and Representative John Katko  of New York.   The subcommittee, which was capably supported by the committee's  professional, nonpartisan investigative staff, took testimony from 18  witnesses and reviewed several hundred thousand pages of documents. The  investigative subcommittee also heard from Representative Schweikert  himself and considered his views and interpretation of the evidence  without prejudgment.   Upon completing its exhaustive investigation, the subcommittee  unanimously concluded that there was substantial reason to believe that  Representative Schweikert's conduct violated various House rules, the  Code of Ethics for Government service, Federal laws, and other  applicable standards.   On June 30, 2020, the investigative subcommittee unanimously adopted  a Statement of Alleged Violations, or SAV, detailing 11 separate  violations and the facts giving rise to those violations.   As set forth in counts 1 through 6 of the SAV, between 2010 and 2017,  Representative Schweikert's campaign committees erroneously disclosed  or failed to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans that  were made or obtained for the benefit of his congressional campaigns,  including a fictional $100,000 loan that purported to be sourced from  personal funds. His campaign committees also failed to report or  falsely reported hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign  disbursements and contributions.   For those cumulative and sustained acts, Representative Schweikert  violated: Federal Election Commission Act reporting requirements;  clause 1 of the Code of Official Conduct of House rule XXIII, which  requires Members of this House to behave at all times in a manner that  reflects creditably on this House; and the Code of Ethics for  Government Service.   Count 7 addresses conduct by Representative Schweikert's former chief  of staff, who made hundreds of thousands of dollars in impermissible  outlays on behalf of Representative Schweikert's campaign committees  over a 7-year period. Even though these outlays were eventually  reimbursed by the campaign, they amounted to impermissible campaign  contributions under Federal law.   For knowing of this practice as it was ongoing but failing to prevent  it, Representative Schweikert violated clause 1 of House rule XXIII and  the Code of Ethics for Government Service.   As detailed in count 8, between 2011 and 2018, Representative  Schweikert converted campaign funds for personal purposes, primarily by  accepting personal items from several staff members that were later  reimbursed using campaign funds.   This conduct violated: Federal election law and regulations; clause 6  of House rule XXIII, which states campaign funds must be kept separate  and cannot be converted to personal use; and the Code of Ethics for  Government Service.   Count 9 addresses Representative Schweikert's misuse of official  resources--including official funds, staff time, and congressional  office space--for unofficial and campaign purposes between 2011 and  2017.   By misusing his MRA and failing to provide necessary oversight over  its use, Representative Schweikert violated 31 U.S. Code, section 1301,  clause 1 of House rule XXIII, and the Code of Ethics for Government  Service.   As set forth in count 10, Representative Schweikert violated clause 1  of House rule XXIII by pressuring his former chief of staff to  fundraise for his campaigns and fostering an office environment in  which congressional staff felt pressured to perform campaign work.   Finally, as detailed in count 11, Representative Schweikert violated  clause 1 of House rule XXIII by failing to exercise the proper candor  and due diligence necessary in responding to these allegations,  including a finding by this investigative subcommittee that certain  aspects of his testimony lacked credibility.   Under House and committee rules, a Member confronted with a Statement  of Alleged Violations may either challenge the allegations with a  public hearing of an adjudicatory subcommittee or, instead, reach a  negotiated resolution with the investigative subcommittee.   In this instance, Representative Schweikert, with the assistance of  his counsel, negotiated a resolution in which he admitted to all 11  counts in a Statement of Alleged Violations. He also agreed to waive  his rights to any additional process, including his right to an  adjudicatory hearing.   For his misconduct, Representative Schweikert agreed to accept a  sanction of reprimand by the House as well as a $50,000 fine to be paid  to the United States Treasury.   The investigative subcommittee carefully considered whether censure,  rather than a reprimand, befitted Representative Schweikert's egregious  conduct. Ultimately, the bipartisan subcommittee agreed to this  negotiated sanction of a monetary fine and public reprimand by his  colleagues, in large part because of Representative Schweikert's  willingness to accept responsibility for his own misconduct.   On July 29, our bipartisan Ethics Committee unanimously voted to  adopt the subcommittee's recommendations and transmit to the House the  resolution currently under consideration. Yesterday morning, Ranking  Member Marchant and I filed our committee's report, together with  [[Page H4196]]  the report of the investigative subcommittee, accompanying exhibits,  Representative Schweikert's responsive views, and the materials  provided to the committee by the Office of Congressional Ethics in its  referrals. I urge all of my colleagues, if they have not done so  already, to carefully read those materials.   As with every investigative report our committee issues, the report  in this matter explains when and why certain conduct may implicate  laws, House rules, or other ethical standards. Some of Representative  Schweikert's gravest violations arose from direct misconduct by him.  Because of Representative Schweikert's own delays and posture toward  this investigation, many of the most serious campaign finance  violations are also now beyond the statute of limitations for civil  enforcement, leaving the House as the only body to bring accountability  to bear on his conduct.   The bipartisan subcommittee unanimously recommended, and our full  committee unanimously agreed, that such conduct with respect to our  investigation should itself be sanctioned.   Other violations arose from Representative Schweikert's inattention  to, or poor supervision of, staff under his supervision. For example,  when asked by the investigative subcommittee about one particular loan  to his campaign and whether he received any guidance on how to report  it, Representative Schweikert said this: ``And this may be my sin, I  didn't ask. I just--I assumed. I didn't even assume. I didn't think  about it.''   If Members take just one lesson from this case, let it be this: It is  unacceptable for us, as public officeholders, not to think about our  ethical obligations. As Members of Congress, we all have an affirmative  duty to ensure that we, and all who work under our supervision, comply  with the laws, regulations, and ethical rules governing our official  and campaign activities.   The investigative subcommittee's report included several advisory  recommendations that the committee will seek to implement to provide  the House with more specific and emphatic guidance on some of the  issues in this matter. So I expect that this case will serve to better  educate all Members on their ethical responsibilities.   Above all, the proposed sanction, which was unanimously approved by  both the investigate subcommittee and the full Committee on Ethics,  will affirm this body's unified commitment to maintaining the highest  level of integrity.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time so that the  distinguished ranking member of the Ethics Committee, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Marchant), may make any comments that he may have.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips) for any comments he may have.  The gentleman ably served as the chairman of the investigative  subcommittee, and I appreciate his leadership.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, I again thank each of the members who served on the  investigative subcommittees that were impaneled in this matter during  the 115th and 116th Congresses.   The Committee on Ethics continually strives to enhance the reputation  of this body and ensure that Members, as required by House rules and  the Code of Official Conduct, always act in a manner that reflects  creditably on the House.   Representatives Phillips, Flores, Raskin, and Katko, your work on  this case has been instrumental to that broader effort, and we are most  grateful for your service.   Madam Speaker, I am also appreciative and grateful for the ranking  member, Mr. Marchant, and his dedication to upholding the integrity of  this House and the principles that he brings to bear as he serves in a  leadership position on the House Committee on Ethics. I am grateful to  all of the other Ethics Committee members, my colleagues, for their  work on this matter, and all of the others that we have handled in this  Congress.   I thank my personal staff, Josh Rogin and David Arrojo; and Mr.  Marchant's staff, Scott Cunningham and Chris Donesa, for their  commitment to ensuring that this work be done fairly. I also recognize  the board and staff of the Office of Congressional Ethics for their  contributions to this investigation.   Lastly, as Mr. Phillips referenced, enormous thanks are due to our  nonpartisan professional committee staff for their tireless work on  this investigation and their dedicated service every day to this House.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I note that while the committee's  investigative work may garner more public attention, the committee's  nonpartisan, advisory staff is always available to answer any ethics- related questions, to hold special training sessions for Members and  employees, in addition to the mandated annual ethics trainings, and to  issue advisory opinions upon request.   I encourage all Members of this House, all candidates and  Congressional staff, to avail themselves of our committee's resources  to help them satisfy their ethical obligations and to avoid the  mistakes like those by Representative Schweikert that bring us to the  floor of the House today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' as well, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials as well on the matter just under  consideration.
