Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 1237, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1237, the COAST Research Act of 2019. Our  Nation is facing an invisible but growing threat: ocean acidification.  For the last 200 years, the oceans have soaked up about one-third of  the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil  fuels causing the oceans to become more acidic.   The science is clear. As spelled out in the Fourth National Climate  Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special  Report, ocean acidification is causing the chemistry of the oceans to  change at an unprecedented rate.   Ocean acidification makes it more difficult for shelled organisms  like oysters, mussels, clams, and corals to build their shells and  skeletons and has potentially devastating effects on marine ecosystems.   The effects of ocean acidification are already being seen and felt  today in our coastal communities around the Nation.   Congress acted and passed the Federal Ocean Acidification Research  and Monitoring Act in 2009, which catalyzed research and monitoring  efforts  [[Page H4321]]  to better understand ocean acidification and its impacts. While this  bill has successfully increased our understanding of ocean  acidification, the Federal investment in research has been relatively  small compared to the size of the problem.                                time  0915    H.R. 1237 updates and reauthorizes our Federal ocean acidification  response and expands the scope of the Federal efforts on this important  issue.   H.R. 1237 also designates the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration as the lead Federal agency, which formalizes the  leadership role it has played in conducting ocean acidification  research and monitoring over the last decade.   Ocean acidification threatens the vitality of our coastal economies.  We need to get ahead of the problem of ocean acidification before it  causes even greater economic harm to our coast. We need to have a much  better understanding of ocean acidification in order to mitigate and  adapt to its effects.   H.R. 1237, along with the three other ocean acidification bills being  considered today, offers a path toward solutions. If we don't act now,  we risk going down an irreversible path.   June is World Oceans Month, and I see no better time for the U.S.  House of Representatives to pass legislation to support the health of  the oceans than now.   I want to take a brief moment to recognize the efforts of the sponsor  of the bill, the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici). She has been a  champion of this issue during her time here in the House and has been  relentless in her efforts to authorize this program.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from Earthjustice, Ocean  Conservancy, the Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing  Systems, the Integrated Ocean Observing System Association, and the  Pacific Coast Shellfish Growers Association in support of this bill.                                                   Earthjustice,                                                       June 4, 2019.      Re Earthjustice supports H.R. 1237, the Coastal and Ocean           Acidification Stressors and Threats Research Act of 2019.       Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Bonamici: On behalf of our supporters       and staff nationwide, we are writing to voice our strong       support for the Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors and       Threats (COAST) Act of 2019 (H.R. 1237). Ocean acidification       is a serious global threat, as our oceans calibrate our       atmosphere and maintain the conditions that have supported       human life for millennia. This vital legislation leads us       towards solutions that secure our ecosystems, our economies,       and our health.        Ocean acidification has devastated coastal communities by       eroding the sources of their livelihood and protection       against ocean events. Acidic waters imperil everything from       cod larvae and lobsters, to plankton and coral reefs. The       process acidification sets into motion will cause       increasingly expensive damage on scales larger than we've       already seen in our Pacific Northwest shellfish farms.       Americans will take the hit, either in the grocery store,       or--for coastal regions--in their jobs and their homes.       However, immediate action can halt plunging pH levels and       promote resilience in changing temperatures.        The COAST Research Act jumpstarts ocean recovery and helps       communities cope with ocean acidification by updating the       Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act       (FOARAM) to face current threats. Funding FOARAM through 2023       ensures we don't backslide in protecting ourselves against       ocean acidification, just as the danger is increasing.       Incorporating the best available data on the full effects of       ocean acidification, including socioeconomic and regional       variations, ensures our national response to the problem       works for the whole nation. Establishing an advisory board       that represents and coordinates the diverse stakeholders       impacted by ocean acidification ensures interests at all       level--including industry, recreation, and conservation--are       accounted for in federal action.        Bipartisan support for the COAST Research Act speaks to the       seriousness of the problem and the efficiency of this       proposed solution. Neither Democrats nor Republicans are       willing to watch our blue economy dissolve in increasingly       acidic waters. Both parties support urgent action to       stabilize our oceans and fortify them against future changes.       This bill provides the funding and strategy to do just that.        Without action, our ocean ecosystems and dependent       economies may be barren by the end of this century. Congress       has the opportunity to reverse this trend and keep our coasts       and oceans vibrant and bountiful. We greatly appreciate your       leadership in crafting the bill that can make such reversal       possible.            Sincerely,                                               Marjorie Mulhall,                                     Legislative Director for Lands,      Wildlife, and Oceans, Earthjustice.                                   ____                                                Ocean Conservancy,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2019.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Bonamici: On behalf of Ocean       Conservancy, please accept this letter of support for H.R.       1237, the Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors and       Threats (COAST) Research Act of 2019. Americans depend on a       healthy ocean, and ocean acidification threatens millions of       jobs and livelihoods, cultures, and ways of life, from the       Pacific Northwest's shellfish industry to Florida's coral       reef tourism. We believe the COAST Research Act strengthens       our nation's investments in ocean and coastal acidification,       and we are proud to offer our support for this legislation.        From coast to coast, ocean acidification is having a broad       range of impacts on the health of our ocean and coastal       communities. Coastal industries are continuing to face the       reality of an increasingly acidic ocean. In 2017, researchers       at Oregon State University recorded some of the highest       levels of ocean acidification in the world off the coast of       the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, 63% of test sites on the       west coast experienced levels of acidification known to cause       commercial oyster production failures. From the Atlantic to       the Pacific, ocean and coastal acidification has had       extensive biological and socioeconomic impacts.        In 2009, Congress recognized the urgent need for federal       investments in ocean acidification research and monitoring,       and subsequently passed the Federal Ocean Acidification       Research and Monitoring (FOARAM) Act of 2009. FOARAM       established the federal government's work on ocean       acidification by creating the NOAA Ocean Acidification       Program and an interagency working group on ocean       acidification. Much of our knowledge and understanding of       ocean acidification that has emerged in the last decade can       be credited to the federal funding authorized by FOARAM. The       law's authorization, however, expired in 2012, and there are       changes that can be made to further improve our ability to       understand acidification in the open ocean as well as in the       coastal zone.        We believe the COAST Research Act will help our nation and       coastal communities better prepare for the effects from ocean       and coastal acidification. Thank you for your leadership on       this issue, and we look forward to working with you to craft       solutions for our changing ocean environment.            Sincerely,                                            Sarah Cooley, Ph.D.,                                       Director, Ocean Acidification      Program, Ocean Conservancy.                                   ____                                            Northwest Association of                              Networked Ocean Observing Systems,                                        Washington, DC, March 7, 2019.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington DC.        Dear Congresswoman Bonamici: As the Director of the       Northwest Association of Ocean Observing Systems (NANOOS), I       write in support of the Coastal and Ocean Acidification       Stressors and Threats (COAST) Research Act.        NANOOS provides access to near-real time observations,       forecasts, and other tools that can be used to observe water       properties in the Salish Sea and the coastal waters off       Washington and Oregon. NANOOS can only serve our stakeholders       via NOAA's Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), which       links together Federal agencies with our collective of local       universities, government agencies, tribes, nonprofits, and       industry organizations who collect quality oceanographic and       meteorological data from moorings, buoys, and satellites from       across the Pacific Northwest region. But our resources are       limited and this COAST Research Act would help to highlight       the payoff investments can make.        In the Pacific Northwest, we know that ocean acidification       is an issue already, as witnessed by the difference that       monitoring water chemistry has made to shellfish growers. We       know that impacts from ocean acidification may affect       shellfish harvesters, fishermen, resource managers, and       tribal and other coastal communities. NANOOS' work with IOOS       and NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program have been instrumental       in aiding adaptation.        The COAST Research Act will enhance these and other efforts       to understand, monitor, and manage the nation's ability to       respond and adapt to ocean acidification. NANOOS will be       better able to meet the needs of our stakeholders if this Act       is passed.        My thanks for your leadership and insights.            Sincerely,                                                        Jan Newton,      NANOOS Executive Director.                                   ____                                                 IOOS Association,                                                      March 5, 2019.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Bonamici: On behalf of the Integrated       Ocean Observing System  [[Page H4322]]       (IOOS) Association and its national network of eleven coastal       observing systems, I write to support the Coastal and Ocean       Acidification Stressors and Threats (COAST) Research Act.        NOAA's Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) links       together Federal agencies and eleven Regional Associations       (RAs) to design and to operate regional observing systems to       provide timely and reliable data and information on our       oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes. Coastal acidification is       becoming an even more pressing concern for many of our       stakeholders and users, such as shellfish growers, shellfish       harvesters, fishermen, resource managers, and coastal       communities.        The impacts of coastal acidification vary, and each system       must be tailored to the unique situation of the region. The       IOOS RAs work closely with NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program       to understand the regional context, to deploy and operate       sensors, support the data that can detect and monitor       acidification to support and improve warnings and alerts and       to provide for the sharing and integration of data.        The COAST Research Act will enhance these and other efforts       to understand, monitoring and manage the nation's ability to       respond and adapt to ocean acidification. The Act does this       be expanding the Advisory Board to include representatives of       the variety of industries and stakeholder impacted by ocean       acidification, expanding the strategic plan for research and       monitoring, and expanding the role of the Federal agencies       for addressing ocean acidification.            Sincerely,                                            Ella (Josie) Quintrell,      Director.                                   ____                                             Pacific Coast Shellfish                                             Growers Association,                                                      March 9, 2019.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Bonamici: On behalf of the members of       Pacific Coast Shellfish Growers Association (PCSGA), I am       submitting this letter of support for H.B. 1237, the Coastal       and Ocean Acidification Stressors and Threats (COAST)       Research Act of 2019. Shellfish growers were the first       community to call attention to the problems associated with       ocean acidification when, in 2007, they experienced sever       oyster larvae mortality in two out of three major west coast       shellfish hatcheries. Since then, PCSGA has engaged in       several local, state, and federal efforts and initiatives to       ensure a future for this historic industry.        Shellfish farming on the west coast began in the late       1800's, fueled the California Gold Rush and was the reason       for the development of many coastal towns. Today, PCSGA       proudly represents 120 shellfish farms in Alaska, Washington,       Oregon, California and Hawaii which farm mussels, clams,       oysters and geoduck. Our members not only produce       sustainable, healthy, food, but also provide significant       ecosystem services such as aquatic habitat and water       filtration, and support thousands of family-wage jobs within       rural coastal communities.        For nearly a decade, the shellfish industry has benefited       from NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program and the Integrated       Ocean Observing System (IOOS), both of which relate to the       Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring (FOARAM)       Act of 2009. These programs and the directives within FOARAM       have influenced the way shellfish growers operate their farms       among the uncertainty of changing ocean conditions.       Historically, growers only consulting their tide charts. Now,       growers rely upon a variety of real-time data and tools to       understand the ocean changes and adapt methods and practices       which allow them to continue farming in a productive and       profitable manner. There much work ahead of us and much yet       to learn. COAST Research Act provides an essential pathway       forward.        We are excited by the intent of COAST Research Act and the       opportunities it provides. Not only is it a reasonable follow       up to FOARAM but it also allows us to continue asking       questions and seek innovative approaches to mitigate the       impacts related to ocean acidification.        Thank you very much for your leadership on this and for       your commitment to ensuring the long-term health of our       coastal and marine areas upon which shellfish growers depend.            Respectfully,                                                Margaret A. Pilaro,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bipartisan  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I would simply urge the passage of  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1716) to direct the Secretary of Commerce, acting  through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, to conduct coastal community vulnerability assessments  related to ocean acidification, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1716         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(d) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 12409(a) of       the Federal Ocean Acidification Research And Monitoring Act       of 2009 (33 U.S.C. 3708(a)) is amended to read as follows:        ``(a) NOAA.--There are authorized to be appropriated to the       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to carry out       the purposes of this subtitle $2,700,000 for each of fiscal       years 2020 through 2024.''.        (e) Report on Support for State and Local Vulnerability       Assessments and Strategic Research Planning.--Not later than       180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration shall submit to Congress a report on the       efforts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration to support State, local, and tribal community       vulnerability assessments, strategic research and planning,       and monitoring needs, pursuant to section 12406(c) of the       Federal Ocean Acidification Research And Monitoring Act of       2009 (as added by subsection (a) of this section).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 1716, the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1716, the Coastal Communities  Ocean Acidification Act of 2019, which is sponsored by the gentlewoman  from Maine (Ms. Pingree).   The bill directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  or NOAA, to conduct vulnerability assessments to study socioeconomic  impacts of ocean acidification on coastal communities across the  country.   As more coastal regions across the U.S. are negatively impacted by  ocean acidification, it is critical that we work to understand these  impacts and to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies. These  strategies can help these communities adequately prepare and respond to  a more acidic coastal environment.   In order to be successful, these assessments must involve all coastal  communities in the U.S., which this bill does by including indigenous  groups and Tribal governments.   The bill also includes language that ensures that all U.S.  territories, which are highly reliant on coastal and marine resources,  can also take advantage of NOAA's coastal vulnerability assessments.  This will allow these island communities to protect their vibrant  coastal economies in the face of an acidifying ocean.   The vulnerability assessments in this bill also include the economic  impacts on commercial fisheries and outdoor recreation. These  industries are significant contributors to many coastal economies, and  it is important that they are part of the discussion when developing  strategies to deal with ocean acidification.   I am glad that this bill passed out of the Committee on Science,  Space, and Technology in a bipartisan fashion, and I urge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation to better  prepare our coastal communities and economies against the growing  threat of ocean acidification.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the distinguished gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1921) to authorize Federal agencies to establish  prize competitions for innovation or adaptation management development  relating to ocean acidification, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1921         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ocean Acidification       Innovation Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. PRIZE COMPETITIONS.         Section 12404 of the Federal Ocean Acidification Research       And Monitoring Act of 2009 (33 U.S.C. 3703) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(d) Prize Competitions.--        ``(1) In general.--Any Federal agency with a representative       serving on the interagency working group established under       this section may, either individually or in cooperation with       one or more agencies, carry out a program to award prizes       competitively under section 24 of the Stevenson-Wydler       Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3719). An agency       seeking to carry out such a program shall carry out such       program in coordination with the chair of such interagency       working group.        ``(2) Purposes.--Any prize competition carried out under       this subsection shall be for the purpose of stimulating       innovation to advance our Nation's ability to understand,       research, or monitor ocean acidification or its impacts, or       to develop management or adaptation options for responding to       ocean acidification.        ``(3) Priority programs.--Priority shall be given to       establishing programs under this section that address       communities, environments, or industries that are in distress       due to the impacts of ocean acidification, including--        ``(A) the development of monitoring or management options       for communities or industries that are experiencing       significant financial hardship;        ``(B) the development of adaptation options to alleviate       economic harm and job loss caused by ocean acidification;        ``(C) the development of measures to help vulnerable       communities or industries, with an emphasis on rural       communities and businesses; and        ``(D) the development of adaptation and management options       for impacted shellfish industries.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 1921, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1921, the Ocean Acidification  Innovation Act of 2019, and I thank Mr. Kilmer for introducing this  important legislation and working with our committee.   Additionally, I thank the Science, Space, and Technology Committee  members on both sides of the aisle for their work to advance this bill.  [[Page H4328]]    Ms. Bonamici; Ms. Herrera Beutler; Mr. Crist; the Environment  Subcommittee chair, Mrs. Fletcher; the Environment Subcommittee ranking  member, Mr. Marshall; and my friend, Ranking Member Lucas.   Ocean acidification, as we have discussed today, is a serious  problem. This bill would create Federal prize competitions to spur  innovation in understanding ocean acidification and developing  management strategies for responding to ocean acidification.   Federal prize competitions, while not a replacement for federally  funded research, allow the government to transfer risk to prize  participants and stimulate private-sector investment. This could  enhance and augment our understanding of this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1921, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer), the sponsor of  the bill.                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time. I would simply urge the support of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 988) to provide for a study by the Ocean Studies  Board of the National Academies of Science examining the impact of  ocean acidification and other stressors in estuarine environments, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 988         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Estuaries and       Acidification Research Act of 2019'' or the ``NEAR Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Ocean acidification impacts human health, natural       resources, and the environmental, economic, and recreational       uses of the coastline.        (2) The current understanding of ocean acidification       impacts on estuarine ecosystems is inadequate to fully       prepare and manage for changing environmental conditions in       nearshore locations.        (3) While pH can be measured with high precision and       accuracy in open ocean environments, more understanding of       the carbonate system in estuarine ecosystems is needed for       precise and accurate measurements and observations.        (4) The interaction of multiple stressors, including       salinity, pH, temperature, sea level rise, and nutrient       input, within estuarine ecosystems is inadequately understood       for managing the health, economic, recreational, and       environmental impacts driven by these interactions.        (5) A better understanding is needed of how anthropogenic       influences in coastal environments affect estuarine       ecosystems.        (6) More integration and coordination is needed among       regional, national, and global environmental observations in       estuarine environments, supporting prior investments in       related topics such as nutrient loading, hypoxia, ocean       acidification, and harmful algae bloom research and       observational systems.       SEC. 3. STUDY EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND                     OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS ON ESTUARINE                     ENVIRONMENTS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 60 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall make       appropriate arrangements with the National Academies of       Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (referred to in this Act       as the ``National Academies'') under which the National       Academies shall conduct a study that--        (1) examines the existing science of ocean acidification in       estuarine environments;        (2) examines the challenges to studying ocean acidification       and ocean acidification's interactions with other environment       stressors in estuarine environments;        (3) provides recommendations for improving future research       with respect to ocean acidification in estuarine       environments; and  [[Page H4330]]         (4) identifies pathways for applying science in management       and mitigation decisions relating to ocean acidification in       estuarine environments.        (b) Contents of Study.--The study described under       subsection (a) shall include--        (1) the behavior of the carbonate system within estuarine       environments;        (2) the interactions of the carbonate system with other       biotic and abiotic characteristics of estuarine ecosystems;        (3) how environmental and anthropogenic changes or       disturbances could affect abiotic and biotic processes within       estuaries;        (4) how estuarine biotic and abiotic processes will be       affected under predicted environmental changes;        (5) the current state of data collection, interpretation,       storage, and retrieval and observational infrastructure of       abiotic and biotic parameters in estuarine ecosystems;        (6) the gaps that exist in understanding the socio-economic       and health impacts of ocean acidification in estuaries;        (7) future directions for scientific research; and        (8) pathways for applying science in management and       mitigation decisions.        (c) Report.--In entering into an arrangement under       subsection (a), the Secretary shall request that the National       Academies transmit to Congress a report on the results of the       study not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of       this Act.        (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized       to be appropriated to carry out this section $1,000,000.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous materials on H.R. 988, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 988, the National Estuaries  and Acidification Research Act of 2019, or the NEAR Act.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to thank the sponsor of  the legislation, Mr. Posey, for his work on this bill and his general  support and understanding in addressing the serious problem of ocean  acidification.   Mr. Posey's bill takes a focused look at a unique part of our coastal  environment estuaries. Our estuaries are valuable and part of our  marine community, both from an economic, as well as an ecological  perspective. These environments are complex and the effects of ocean  acidification on them is well understood.   H.R. 988 would address the gaps in our knowledge by commissioning a  review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine  on the impacts of ocean acidification on estuaries.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this good, bipartisan bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
