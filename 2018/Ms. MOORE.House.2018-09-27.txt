 Mr. Speaker, hallelujah. Let the Republican majority tell  it. The American people are just going to be so thrilled with tax scam  2.0 where we permanently lock in obscene tax advantages for  corporations and the wealthy, where we lock in inequality, where we  directly threaten Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   Now, Mr. Speaker, the American people are just going to be bereft of  this economic security and retirement security, but they are going to  spontaneously break out in a Depression-era George Gershwin opera, like  I did on the stage of North Division High School:       I got plenty o' nuttin',      And nuttin's plenty for me.      I got no car, got no misery.    Meanwhile, the folks with plenty of plenty are getting 80 percent of  this tax cut, increasing the debt by another $3 trillion in just 3  years' time.   Mr. Speaker, no singing, no dancing, no tax scam. My constituents  want our country's wealth back.
