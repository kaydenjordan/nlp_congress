 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding to me.   On October 1 of this year, less than one week ago, my brother of the  thin blue line, Corporal Michael Paul Middlebrook, a nine-year veteran  of the Lafayette Police Department, was killed in the line of duty  while responding to a ``shots fired'' call at a local convenience  store.   Corporal Middlebrook is survived by his wife, three daughters, and  his parents. During his tenure at the Lafayette Police Department,  Corporal Middlebrook accumulated seven letters of commendation for acts  of bravery and outstanding police work.   Michael understood that his job as a cop began with an oath. And that  oath was not to a chief or a sheriff or a marshal. It was an oath of  allegiance to the constitutional principles that his badge represents.  Corporal Michael Middlebrook recognized unwaveringly the civil  constitutional rights of the citizens he had sworn to protect and  defend and serve.   In March of this year, Michael was awarded the highly prestigious  Heart of Law Enforcement Award by the national nonprofit group Beyond  the Badge. During the ceremony, Corporal Middlebrook was recognized by  Louisiana's Governor and was presented a commemorative State flag. This  award was given to recognize Corporal Middlebrook's ongoing  contributions to the low-income community that he patrolled.   Michael regularly took donated food items from local convenience  stores and distributed the food to the homeless and less fortunate.  Michael also collected clothing on his off time and delivered the  clothing to poor souls he encountered during his shift deep in the  night while the world slept.   In the last 6 months alone, Corporal Michael Middlebrook was  recognized for having saved a person's life by placing himself between  the victim and the knife-wielding suspect, and for single-handedly  apprehending an armed robbery suspect seconds after the 911 call was  placed.   Corporal Middlebrook's chief, my friend and brother, Chief Toby  Aguillard, provided this quote: ``For many in our community, Corporal  Middlebrook was a spearhead that brought them to justice. For many  others, Corporal Middlebrook was a cradle of compassion. He was an  officer's officer, loved and respected by his peers. The void he leaves  in our department, in our community, in our hearts will be felt for  generations. He will never be forgotten.''   That quote was from Michael's chief.   Brother Michael, you have earned your rest. Your watch has ended. We  have got it from here. The thin blue line will never forget your  service. We shall always honor your memory, and we shall watch over  your family.   May our Saviour bless your ascension, and may He hold your loved ones  close to His own heart.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding to me.                             How Did We Get Here?
