 Mr. Speaker, I rise, once again, in defense of the  LGBTQ2SIA+ community.   This year, we have seen a barrage of hateful legislative attacks on  the LGBTQ+ individuals as Republicans in statehouses, courtrooms,  classrooms, and, yes, sadly, even Congress attempt to roll back the  clock.   What they are doing is harmful, it is unconscionable, and, let's be  clear, it could prove to be fatal for those who are so deeply hurt by  these laws that they take their own life.   The stakes this Pride Month couldn't be higher, and that is why I am  proud to stand with my colleagues in defense of freedom and equality  for everyone.   Pride isn't merely about rainbows. It is resilience, and it is a  reminder that real allyship requires work: courageously and  unapologetically standing up to bigotry, not just this month, but every  month.   We will not back down, and we will not be silenced.                            ____________________
