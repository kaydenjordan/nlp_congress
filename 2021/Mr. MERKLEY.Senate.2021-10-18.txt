 Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Mr. Wicker, I  rise today to recognize and celebrate the 51st anniversary of the  Emergency Nurses Association. Made up of 51,000 members from all across  the globe, the Emergency Nurses Association, or ENA, is the only  professional organization dedicated to advancing excellence in  emergency nursing and is the world's premier organization for emergency  nurses.   Founded in 1970, ENA has worked successfully to raise awareness and  improve outcomes for the Nation's trauma patients. Traumatic injuries,  including car crashes, falls, head injuries, burns, and firearm  injuries, are currently the leading cause of death for Americans aged  44 or younger. Working to improve outcomes for those who have suffered  a traumatic injury, ENA offers courses for emergency nurses that  provide them with the knowledge, skills, and hands-on training needed  to deliver high-quality trauma care. Since 1986, ENA's trauma nursing  core course has been taken by more than 2 million emergency nurses and  is now considered the gold standard for the education of nurses in  lifesaving trauma care techniques. Alongside their outstanding  educational courses, ENA has been a fearless advocate at all levels of  government for safer work environments in medical facilities and has  pushed for stronger criminal laws that hold those accountable for  violence against medical employees.   Especially in times of crisis, ENA has been on the frontlines of our  medical profession. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when emergency rooms  have been turned into battle zones against this virus, ENA has worked  time and time again to ensure that nurses across this country were  prepared and equipped to deal with this unprecedented crisis. Their  tireless dedication to protecting and saving lives, while risking their  own, should be recognized and commended by this body.   On the occasion of the Emergency Nurses Association's 51st  anniversary, we ask our colleagues to join us in extending our deepest  gratitude to the ENA and all its members for their commitment to  improving the quality of emergency care that has continued to save the  lives of millions of Americans across our country.
