 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the  rule providing for consideration of H.R. 382--Pandemic is Over Act,  H.R. 497--Freedom for Health Care Workers Act, H.R. 139--SHOW UP Act of  2023, and H.J. Res. 7--Relating to a national emergency declared by the  Presidenton March 13, 2020.   House Republicans have professed a commitment to transparency and  fairness that allows all voices to be heard in the legislative process.   Yet, by House Republicans choosing a closed rule, have denied this  body the right to weigh in on the rules or these bills.   Republicans are attempting to push through statements of principle  that represent the entirety of the House without any reasonable  consideration.   These bills have not been adequately considered in committee hearing  by the committee of jurisdiction.   Amendments to these bills have not been raised or debated.   Now, with this closed Rule, members are unable to offer any  amendments to each of these bills.   The business of the House is of the utmost importance to the American  people.   Democrats remain committed to putting people over politics.   During 2020 within my District, the COVID-19 pandemic was surging and  I worked desperately to bring COVID-19 testing and then vaccines to  communities in need throughout my district.   At the time many Republican leaders refused to even acknowledge the  reality of the pandemic.   Now the Republicans are furthering their narrative and lack of action  on COVID-19 by attempting to normalize and even deny the horrors of the  pandemic.   We should never forget the lives lost and all that we have learned  for the pandemic.   In Harris County, over 11 thousand people have died of COVID-19 since  2020. Every one of those lives was important and we must work together  to save every life possible.   Vaccines have saved lives and continue to save lives.   The issue of the pandemics' ongoing nature is a complex one that will  need to consider potential seasonal surges and the need for annual  vaccines.   The Republicans today barely secured a majority in the House and only  chose a Speaker from their party after 14 votes. They cannot claim to  have any mandate from the public.   We must continue to keep COVID-19 front of mind and create a plan of  shifting to living with COVID-19 rather than these brash political  statements.   I, for one, care about the safety of healthcare works, the safety of  my constituents, and the safety of workers.   The fact is that we must continue to identify the best way out of the  COVID-19 pandemic with careful consideration of the science, and  strategic plans that consider the uniqueness of each of the communities  that we represent.   The rule before us makes bold unsubstantiated claims that threaten  the safety of our healthcare workers, teleworkers, and the constituents  in each of our districts.   There is a better way forward.   We must have more discussion and debate.   I cannot in good conscious support this rule.   The material previously referred to by McGovern is as follows:                      Amendment to House Resolution 75         Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the       following:        That upon adoption of this resolution, it shall be in order       to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.

Sec. 4. Upon adoption of this resolution, it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 497) to       eliminate the COVID-19 vaccine mandate on health care       providers furnishing items and services under certain Federal       health care programs. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The amendment printed       in section 5 of this resolution shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce or their       respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 5. The amendment referred to in each of the other       sections of this resolution is as follows:        ``At the end, add the following:        ``This Act shall not be effective unless and until the date       on which the Director of the Congressional Budget Office       certifies that this Act will not result in a decrease to       Social Security benefits.''.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to try and speak something  called commonsense speak, and that is for my colleagues to understand  that Americans reject confusion and chaos.   According to The New York Times, ``An abrupt end to the emergency  declarations would create wide-ranging chaos and uncertainty throughout  the healthcare system--for States, for hospitals and doctors' offices,  and, most importantly, for the tens of millions of Americans,'' as  evidenced.   This is on the data from the White House, which by the way, under  President Joe Biden, crafted a White House COVID task force that began  to calm the uncalm waters that we suffered in the last administration.   Does anyone remember, ``maybe we should drink disinfectant'' in the  midst of COVID-19?   Well, let me tell you, in Houston, Texas, we remember it. We also  know that 6,812,798 persons died around the world from COVID; 1.1  million died in the United States.   It was only after an overwhelming effort by the Biden administration  that we began to see the clock move on individuals willing to get their  first, second, and third shots; their booster shots. That is why we are  living, because we were vaccinated, because we overcame the stigma and  the wrongheaded information that was scaring people about vaccines.   We didn't lose 1 million people on vaccines. We lost 1 million people  due to not having that vaccination timely. I am struck by this  legislation. The pandemic is not over.   Mr. Speaker, 500 people a day die, right now as I am standing here,  from COVID. That is a reasonable amount. I know there are other  infectious diseases, but doesn't it make sense that if we can have a  vaccine and a protocol that allows people, our children, and those with  preexisting conditions to live that we want them to do so?   The Biden administration has announced that they intend to reduce  this national emergency declaration in May. It will allow our health  facilities to get themselves organized for the possible onslaught. It  will also deprive impoverished persons from the ability to get free  vaccinations, including possibly flu shots, like we are doing in  Houston, Texas.   I remember over 70 testing sites that I put in my district with  healthcare providers week after week after week so that people could be  tested and so we could bring down COVID in Houston, Texas.   I remember vaccination sites where people stood in line, a thousand  at a time, to get vaccinated for free. Are we jumping for joy to  condemn and now undermine the emergency pandemic that was utilized?    All I can say is that health professionals by and  large in hospitals, clinics, doctors' offices will say no. They need  their patients healthy. As many people that can get vaccinated with  information should get vaccinated and, of course, guided by your  healthcare provider.   I don't think it makes any good sense to be able to talk about how  you never got tested, how you never got vaccinated. That is all well  and good. I applaud an individual who is able to survive not getting  tested, not getting vaccinated, but I know of so many of my close  friends who died because there was not a vaccination, there was not  good healthcare. They came to the end stages of COVID and COVID killed  them.   So I don't make a mockery of the hard work of President Biden. I  truly believe that his time frame--I might think it is a little too  quick, but I adhere to the President's time frame of May 2023. Let us  organize so that we can save lives.    Mr. Speaker, at any moment we can have a surge of  COVID-19. We saw that at the beginning of the convergence of the flu,  which was high this year, and COVID.   So I don't celebrate this legislation. I don't take angst or anger  with the individual who thinks this is the right way, but I know that I  am on the right side. I am on the dominant side of truth that 6  million-plus died, 1.1 million died here in the United States and 500  are dying every day.   This is not a time to precipitously end the emergency declaration. We  should also make sure that we are not creating chaos and confusion.   Mr. Speaker, I again emphasize that we need not have chaos and  confusion. Unfortunately, I see no purpose in this bill and will vote  against it.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 382--the Pandemic is  Over Act, which would terminate the COVID-19 public health emergency  that was declared on January 31, 2020, on the date of the bill's  enactment.   Yesterday President Biden announced that the Public Health Emergency  would officially end on May 11, 2023.   The purpose of doing this would be to allow hospitals, health care  workers, and health officials the ability to manage changes that will  come with ending the public health emergency declaration.   According to the Department of Health and Human Services, a Public  Health Emergency declaration occurs when the Secretary of HHS  determines that a disease or disorder presents a public health  emergency (PHE) or that a public health emergency exists.   Secretary Becerra and the Biden administration have repeatedly said  that the decision to terminate the public health emergency would be  based on the best available data and science.   Through mass testing and vaccination campaigns, the public health  emergency declaration has helped the American public contain the COVID  virus, while also keeping the cost low for those seeking treatment.   The public health emergency has required that group health plans and  insurers provide patients with COVID vaccines, testing, and treatment;  expanded telehealth services, and extended health coverage for Medicaid  beneficiaries.   Abruptly ending these pandemic declarations without a transition  period would be extremely irresponsible because it would create  uncertainty in health care systems; it would end Medicaid programs that  have operated under special rules, telehealth would be impacted, and  group health insurance plans could potentially change frequency of  testing, vaccination, and treatment for patients.   These programs have been incredibly helpful at slowing the spread of  COVID, so we must be thoughtful and practical about how we dissolve the  public health emergency, which is why we need a transition period as  proposed by the President just yesterday.   We must provide stakeholders with time to adjust to the changes that  will come from ending the public health emergency.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to legislation that  would end the pandemic far too early and would upend some of the  flexibilities that we all have benefited from since the start of the  pandemic.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a New York  Times article, ``U.S. Plans to End Public Health Emergency for COVID in  May.''                  [From the New York Times, Jan. 30, 2023]         U.S. Plans To End Public Health Emergency for Covid in May         The end of the emergency, planned for May 11, will bring       about a complex set of policy changes and signals a new       chapter in the government's pandemic response.  [[Page H535]]         Washington--The Biden administration plans to let the       coronavirus public health emergency expire in May, the White       House said on Monday, a sign that federal officials believe       the pandemic has moved into a new, less dire phase.        The move carries both symbolic weight and real-world       consequences. Millions of Americans have received free Covid       tests, treatments and vaccines during the pandemic, and not       all of that will continue to be free once the emergency is       over. The White House wants to keep the emergency in place       for several more months so hospitals, health care providers       and health officials can prepare for a host of changes when       it ends, officials said.        An average of more than 500 people in the United States are       still dying from Covid-19 each day, about twice the number of       deaths per day during a bad flu season. But at the three-year       mark, the coronavirus is no longer upending everyday life to       the extent it once did, partly because much of the population       has at least some protection against the virus from       vaccinations and prior infections.        Still, the White House said on Monday that the nation       needed an orderly transition out of the public health       emergency. The administration said it also intended to allow       a separate declaration of a national emergency to expire on       the same day, May 11.        ``An abrupt end to the emergency declarations would create       wide-ranging chaos and uncertainty throughout the health care       system--for states, for hospitals and doctors' offices, and,       most importantly, for tens of millions of Americans,'' the       White House said in a statement.        The announcement came on the eve of a scheduled vote in the       House on a bill that would immediately end the public health       emergency. The bill, called the Pandemic Is Over Act, is one       of several pandemic-related measures that the Republican-      controlled chamber is scheduled to consider this week. The       White House issued its statement as the administration's       response to that bill and another measure that would end the       national emergency.        The back and forth signaled what is likely to be a       protracted political battle between House Republicans and the       White House over its handling of the pandemic. Republican       lawmakers hope to put the Biden administration on the       defensive, claiming it spent extravagantly in the name of       battling the coronavirus.        ``Rather than waiting until May 11, the Biden       administration should Join us now in immediately ending this       declaration,'' Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of       Louisiana and the majority leader, said in a statement. ``The       days of the Biden administration being able to hide behind       Covid to waste billions of taxpayer dollars on their       unrelated, radical agenda are over.''        The White House argues that it is only because of federal       Covid policies mandating free tests, treatments and vaccines       that the pandemic is now under better control. Covid was the       third-leading cause of death from 2020 through mid-2022; now       it is no longer among the top five killers, federal officials       said.        The public health emergency was first declared by the Trump       administration in January 2020, and it has been renewed every       90 days since then. The Biden administration had pledged to       alert states 60 days before ending it. The emergency was last       renewed earlier in January, and many state health officials       expected it would be allowed to expire in mid-April.        Ending the emergency will prompt complex changes in the       cost of Covid tests and treatments that Americans are       accustomed to getting for free. Any charges they face will       vary depending on whether they have private insurance,       Medicare coverage, Medicaid coverage or no health insurance.       What state they live in could also be a factor.        Still, the consequences may not be quite as dramatic as       public health experts once feared. Medicaid enrollment       expanded greatly during the pandemic because low-income       Americans were kept in the program for as long as the public       health emergency was active.        But a congressional spending package enacted in December       effectively broke that link, instead setting an April       deadline when states will begin losing additional funding for       Medicaid coverage. State officials are likely to gradually       remove Americans from Medicaid rolls this year beginning       then. That transition avoids a more sudden removal of       millions of poor Americans from their health coverage.        By reconfiguring that expensive policy, Congress was able       to use the projected savings to pay for expanded Medicaid       benefits for children, postpartum mothers and residents of       U.S. territories.        The December legislation also extended coverage for       telehealth visits for Medicare recipients through 2024.       Telemedicine proved a lifeline for many during the pandemic,       and that coverage would have ended when the emergency was       lifted.        Still, other services might prove more costly to Americans,       particularly those with no insurance. People with private       health insurance or Medicare coverage have been eligible for       eight free coronavirus tests each month. Insurers were       required to cover tests, even if they were administered by       providers that were not part of their networks. Once the       emergency ends, some Americans will end up paying out of       pocket for those tests.        And while vaccines will continue to be covered for people       with private insurance or Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the       end of the emergency will mean that some Americans may have       to pay out of pocket for Covid treatments, such as Paxlovid,       an antiviral pill. Hospitals will also no longer receive       higher Medicare payment rates for treating Covid patients.        Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser       Family Foundation, said the emergency declaration had       provided an important reprieve from the American health care       system's typically fractured way of covering the costs of       care, giving more people access to services that might       otherwise not have been covered by insurance.        The White House's decision, she added, could send the wrong       message about how relaxed Americans should be about the       virus.        ``To the extent that it might let people let their guard       down from one day to the next, that could raise some       challenges,'' she said.     Mr. Speaker, this is another moment that I am on the  floor of the House, and I thank the ranking member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce who has been so dutiful throughout the years that  we suffered, somewhat lonely and somewhat confused, about COVID-19.   We never experienced this trauma. It certainly brings me to a deep  sense of loss to hear a Member speak about the loss of his mother.  These are personal matters for many of us, some having lost dear  friends, but nothing can equate to losing a beloved loved one.   So when we stand on the floor, we speak with a sense of compassion  and concern. I think it is certainly fine for there to be individual--I  turn the card. I flip the coin--individual examples of individuals  seeking not to be vaccinated. They can find medical facilities that  would allow them to work there.   It is no doubt that the actions of the Biden administration saved  lives. There is no doubt that, on our side of this issue, 50 healthcare  organizations, professional societies, and others, believe that  vaccinations helped healthcare workers save their own lives and save  the lives of others.   It is well-known that prior to the widespread availability of the  COVID-19 vaccine, healthcare workers in the United States were more  than three times more likely to die. I have seen it myself. In my  community, the Texas Medical Center, all of the beds in every medical  facility within the reach of my district and others had people in  hallways, in emergency rooms, individuals who couldn't see their loved  ones take their last breaths; individuals who flew in from other  jurisdictions, other States, desperate to get the care they thought was  here in Houston, Texas because, yes, we did have the ability to save  lives with the medical technology that we were using.   Many States have requirements that healthcare workers be vaccinated  against many things: hepatitis, flu, measles, mumps, or rubella. Why  are we trying to stand against COVID-19 in this long litany of  infectious diseases? COVID-19 vaccines have resulted in 120 million  fewer cases and 18.5 million less hospitalizations and saved $1.15  trillion.   So if we just talked about the numbers, that in and of itself would  say that this legislation is wrongheaded, but it is also important to  recognize that the Mental Health America, 76 percent of the respondents  were worried about bringing COVID home to their children.   These are healthcare professionals. We know of some of them who died,  unfortunately, because they got COVID, and they didn't even see their  families because of this whole issue of separating people who had  COVID. Half of the respondents worried about bringing COVID to their  partners or an older family member.   Many U.S. physicians found that the portion of the day spent treating  COVID-19 patients was associated with higher PTSD scores, depression,  and anxiety. This was not a fun time, but it was the commitment of  medical professionals and those who wanted to be saved to use the  vaccines and use all precautions.    Mr. Speaker, these medical professionals in the  early stages were suffering from higher PTSD scores, depression, and  anxiety. Many healthcare workers at the beginning of the pandemic saw  workers get sick and die from COVID almost right in front of them, and  this contributed to their increased stress and anxiety.   We did push them to the limit when we didn't have massive testing or  massive vaccines, I hate to say it, in the past administration.  According to the University of Chicago, it was found that an increase  in staff vaccination rates resulted in fewer COVID cases among staff  and patients.    My final words, Mr. Speaker, is, yeah, this is a free country.  Laissez-faire, do as you will, but this mandate for medical workers  saved their lives, saved patients' lives, and saved families' lives. I  don't understand why we are going down this route where soon it will  happen in good time, but since I remember 6 million dead around the  world as the number that is gleaming and 1.11 million in the United  States, this legislation is not going in the right direction. I ask for  opposition to the underlying legislation.
