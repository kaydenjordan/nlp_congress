 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from California for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the rule before us provides for consideration of three  pieces of legislation that are, once again, missed opportunities to  provide real relief to the American people.   Rather than working with Republicans to address the serious issues  facing our Nation, Democrats again prioritize the interests of far-left  special interest groups and their radical progressive base over the  needs of American workers and American families.   Look no further than H.R. 2543, a compilation of 13 Committee on  Financial Services' bills that prioritize woke policies and unnecessary  reporting over actually fixing Biden's economic crisis.   As my friends across the aisle will remember, under President Trump,  U.S. employment reached a 50-year low of 3.5 percent. Additionally,  under President Trump, minority unemployment dropped to the lowest  levels on record.   Compare that with the economy under the Democrats' one-party rule.  Inflation is now at a 40-year high. Gas prices are now over $5 a  gallon. Americans can expect to pay an extra $5,200 this year compared  to last year for the same goods and services.   Once again, rather than just working with Republicans to provide real  economic relief, the Democrats continue to double down on reckless  spending, far-left policies, and have prioritized their Big Government  socialism over free market principles. What has this led to?   It has led to economic instability. It threatens the stability of our  Federal Reserve. It piles regulatory costs on small businesses. It  emboldens unelected and unaccountable career bureaucrats.   Ultimately, H.R. 2543 will make it more difficult for low-income and  minority borrowers to start a business, to buy a home, and to build  credit. It actually does the opposite of the intended effect.   This will also provide for consideration of H.R. 7606, a bill that  claims to lower food costs by appointing a ``special investigator,''  and this special investigator will investigate American meat packers  and live poultry dealers.   Let's be clear, this legislation is a weak attempt to lay the blame  for President Biden's economic crisis on American job creators. In  reality, this is just another unfunded mandate that empowers Washington  bureaucrats and places new burdens on American food producers.   Alarmingly, these compliance costs may actually raise the price of  food even higher, making life in Joe Biden's America even harder on  average American families.   Finally, this bill provides for consideration of H.R. 2773, the  Recovering America's Wildlife Act of 2022. While I support conservation  efforts, I am incredibly disappointed once again by the majority  walking away from talks with Republicans to find offsets and to try to  resolve spending concerns for the $1.34 billion in new annual mandatory  spending authorized by this bill.   In fact, according to the CBO, this legislation spends $12.7 billion  just in the first 10 years alone.   Madam Speaker, 80 percent of Americans say inflation is the most  important issue facing this country. You wouldn't know it by looking at  the bills Democrats are prioritizing for floor action this week.                                time  1315    Perhaps it is time that my Big Government, Democratic colleagues  actually listen to the American people and work with Republicans on  real economic solutions rather than doubling down on the out-of-control  spending and reckless far-left policies that created Biden's economic  crisis in the first place.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' to oppose  this rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I hear about this being a global  issue. It is a global issue, but the reason it is a global issue--quick  economics lesson--we are still the reserve currency. We also are the  largest GDP. We are exporting the inflation to other countries.   Let's be clear. The inflation is caused by Joe Biden's reckless, Big  Government, socialist agenda and, unfortunately, the American people as  well as the world have to deal with this recklessness.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota  (Mrs. Fischbach), who is my good friend on the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, Americans are now paying an average of over $5 for a  gallon of gas. This is the first time in history this has happened. Let  me repeat that: over $5 for a gallon of gas.   The pain at the pump is a direct result of President Biden's and  congressional Democrats' radical Green New Deal agenda and a war on  American energy producers.   Let's just be blunt about something: the base of the Democratic  Party--the bunch of woke yuppies sitting at home on Zooms all day-- don't care about gas prices. But if you are someone who has to swing a  hammer for a living and drive to a jobsite, if you are a waitress at a  diner and you have to drive to your shift, that affects you.    Republicans care about working families and working men and women.  That is why we believe Americans deserve affordable, American-made  energy. That is why if we defeat the previous question, I will  personally offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R.  6858, the American Energy Independence from Russia Act.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, here to explain this amendment is  my good friend and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee,  Congressman Jeff Duncan from South Carolina.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Duncan).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from South  Carolina an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, Democrats and their allies on the left can blame Putin  all they want, and it is partially true that Putin's war in Ukraine is  partially to blame. But gas prices have risen every month of this  administration. Every month they were up a dollar a gallon before Putin  even invaded Ukraine.   The real issue here is supply.   Why do we have the supply issue?   It is because Joe Biden on day number one canceled the Keystone XL  pipeline. That dried up all capital investment into hydrocarbon  infrastructure. Maybe it is a problem because we cannot get the oil and  gas to refineries to make sure that we have a supply.   So what does Joe Biden do instead?   He blames everybody else. He goes to Venezuela and elsewhere, and  begs them to produce more oil when just one administration before under  President Trump, we were actually a net exporter of energy. Biden and  House Democrats have created this mess, and the American people know  that.   Are you ready for this fact, Madam Speaker?   The American people will also spend $5,000 this year on gas--$5,000  for the average American. That is a 78 percent increase from a year  ago. In other words, Americans are spending over $2,000 extra a year on  gas under Joe Biden.   Blame who you want, Madam Speaker, but every time an American looks  up and sees $100-plus on that gas tank that he or she just filled up,  they know who to blame--Joe Biden and Democrats.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great  State of Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Madam Speaker, just some quick facts. As Mr.  Duncan stated, House Democrats have blocked consideration of  legislation to unleash America's energy independence six times. Six  times we have been down this road, and House Democrats have blocked it.   Gas prices have gone up 49 cents since the last time Republicans  asked Democrats to bring this bill to the floor. Here we are again.   To talk more about this issue, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), my friend and a former police officer.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  my good friend to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I still find it somewhat amusing that my friends across the  aisle continue to blame all this on foreign nations and their actions.   Let me give a quick history lesson on how President Joe Biden and  Democrats actually caused this crisis.   Number one, day number one, Joe Biden canceled the Keystone XL  pipeline.   Number two, he emboldened Putin with Nord Stream 2. I would actually  argue he emboldened Putin to invade Ukraine when he recklessly pulled  us out of Afghanistan, which served zero military purpose. But I  digress.   Additionally, Joe Biden suspended oil and gas leasing on Federal  lands. He delayed permits for energy and infrastructure pipelines. He  drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He revoked permits for  critical mineral projects. He canceled oil leases in Alaska and the  Gulf of Mexico.   What has this done to gas prices? Well, in California, gas prices are  now $9 a gallon.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers at this  time, and I am prepared to close.   I yield myself the balance of my time and remind everybody that, in  Joe Biden's America, gas prices are averaging more than $5 a gallon;  inflation is at a 40-year high; and real wages have decreased 10 out of  the last 12 months.   Yet, with today's rule, House Democrats are doubling down on far- left, radical policies, really failed policies, that created Joe  Biden's economic crisis in the first place.   It is well past time that the Biden administration and congressional  Democrats admit that they are to blame for the economic pain families  are facing and workers are facing, and work with Republicans on  solutions to immediately help the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
