 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a couple of items  of importance. I rise today to speak about wealth in Black homes and  businesses.  [[Page H7057]]    According to the Brookings Institution, the net worth of a typical  White family is nearly 10 times that of a Black family.   According to the Atlanta Wealth Building Initiative, the numbers in  my home city of Atlanta and the other eight cities in the district,  College Park, East Point, Decatur, Hapeville, Lake City, Forest Park,  Morrow, and Brookhaven, are slightly better, but no less concerning.   The median household income of a White family is $83,722, compared to  $28,105 for a Black family.   Sixty-nine percent of the Black families are liquid asset poor,  compared to 22 percent of White families.   The average African-American-owned business is valued at $58,085,  while the average value of a White business is $658,264.   There are many reasons for these disparities, starting foremost with  America's original sin: slavery. And descendants of African slaves in  District Five expect restorative financial justice in the form of  reparations.   We also know that a reason the problem persists well into the 21st  century is the availability of capital to Black-owned businesses and  the success of Black banks. The higher the circulation of dollars in  the community, the greater the economic stability and opportunities for  economic growth.   According to the University of Georgia's Selig Center for Economic  Growth, money circulates one time within the African-American  community, compared to more than six times in the Latinx community,  nine times in the Asian community, and an unlimited amount of times  within the White community.   A Black Star Project study on the racial wealth gap calculates that a  dollar circulates 6 hours in the Black community, 20 days in the Jewish  community, and 30 days in the Asian community. Black people have an  estimated $1.3 trillion gross national income, but only 2 percent is  recirculated in the Black community.   Keeping Black dollars in the Black community is harder than it  sounds. In her TEDx Talk about the impact of Black dollars being spent  outside of the Black community, author and activist Maggie Anderson  shares a story about an empowerment experiment during which her family  attempted to purchase Black-made products from Black-owned businesses  for 1 year.   Anderson uncovered a discouraging picture of a vast economic divide.  She discusses how L'Oreal owns one of the largest Black beauty brands  in the world, SoftSheen-Carson, demonstrating a White-owned business  profiting from a market of exclusively Black buyers.                                time  1115    She estimates that up to 80 percent of the revenue of White-owned  Hennessy cognac comes from Black consumers, but the company has no  Black distributors or suppliers and does not advertise in Black-owned  media.   The Empowerment Experiment resulted in a landmark study conducted by  Steven Rogers at the Northwestern University Kellogg School of  Management, which proved how supporting Black-owned businesses can  benefit the Black community, as well as the American economy as a  whole.   In Anderson's book, ``Our Black Year: One Family's Quest to Buy Black  in America's Racially Divided Economy,'' she notes that if Black  spending with Black businesses rose from the current 3 percent to 10  percent it could create a million new jobs and provide economic  security to countless Black households.   Lack of access to financial services is not just a symptom of  America's racial wealth gap; it is also a cause. Without the ability to  efficiently save, invest, and ensure against risks, many Black families  struggle to translate the income they earn to genuine generational  wealth.   Based on data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finance,  the typical Black family has only 10 cents for every dollar held by the  typical White family.   This wealth gap dates back to the decades after emancipation and has  remained stubbornly persistent. Redlining, a practice that designates  Black communities as unfavorable for home loans and business  investment, reduces property values and increases interest rates in  many neighborhoods, trends that have impacted African Americans for a  century.   Largely excluded from the generous financial incentives of the New  Deal, the Black community was boxed out of the country's post World War  II boom that vastly expanded the American middle class.   Despite laws prohibiting loan discrimination on the basis of race,  the Congressional Black Caucus still calls on regulatory agencies to  improve enforcement at a national level. Black and Latinx home buyers  are significantly more likely than Whites to be turned down for a  conventional mortgage loan.   A recent analysis from Zillow shows that in 2016, nearly 21 percent  of Black applicants were denied a conventional loan, while 15.5 of  Latinx were. And in 2016, Asian applicants were denied a conventional  loan in 10.4 percent of cases--slightly more than the national  average--and Whites in only 8.1 percent of cases.   According to a New America report, many banks also hinder Black  wealth creation with discriminatory practices in service offerings.   In communities of color, banks charge more for opening and  maintaining basic, entry-level checking accounts.   The minimum opening deposit is higher in majority Black  neighborhoods, $80.60, and in neighborhoods without a racial majority,  $97, than in White neighborhoods, $68.50.   The solution is that there is a need to help support MDIs and CDFIs  but not only with deposits.   Mr. Speaker, this is an urgent issue. I urge my colleagues in this  Chamber to consider the dictates of this statement and act to help all  Americans realize their American Dream.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the importance of  historically Black colleges and universities.   For over 150 years, HBCUs have played an important role in the  education, cultivation, and upward mobility of African Americans. But  as the Nation's economy changes and shifts firmly towards the  information age, our Nation's HBCUs must be steadfast in following this  trend.   Software and technology startups are the largest creators of new jobs  and wealth creation in this country in decades; however, there is an  imbalance for minorities to have access to this opportunity. For  example, less than 1 percent of all venture capital dollars go to Black  founders.   Software and technology startups are the chance to build something  from nothing. Indeed, to do so is the American Dream.   We need to make that dream, the tech startup dream, available to all  minorities and overlooked communities. This program, Startup the HBCUs,  can significantly increase the number of minorities that work in the  high-tech field and increase the number of minorities that are founders  of tech companies.    If we follow these steps, we will be able to ensure that the American  Dream in the information age is available to all, including our  students at our Nation's historically Black colleges and universities.                            ____________________
