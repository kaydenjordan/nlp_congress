 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Major General Bill Bland of Georgia's First  Congressional District, who passed away peacefully at his home  surrounded by family at 84 years old.   General Bland is the former Adjutant General for the State of Georgia  and a beloved husband, father, and a good friend.   He enlisted in the Georgia Air National Guard in 1958 and received  his pilot's wings in 1962 at Moody Air Force Base.   General Bland served faithfully in a variety of assignments which  took him all over the world. He was a command pilot with more than  8,000 hours, flying in nine different types of aircraft. He also served  in the position of Adjutant General until his retirement in 1999, after  more than 40 years of service in the U.S. Air Force and Air National  Guard.   I had the honor and privilege of attending church with General Bland  and his lovely wife, Harriet, at Wesley Monumental United Methodist  Church. It was evident Jesus Christ was the Lord and savior of Bill's  life, and he used all the gifts God gave him to serve others and bring  glory to God. He was an active and faithful member of the church, where  he served on the board of trustees for 17 years.   General Bland will surely be missed by his friends, family, our  church community, and all who knew and loved him. His legacy of  selfless devotion to our country and those in need will remain for  countless years to come.       Celebrating the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center's 50th                                Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  Federal Law Enforcement Training Center's, or FLETC's, 50th  anniversary.   Since the Consolidated Law Enforcement Training Center was created in  1970 before becoming the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, they  have continued the mission of safeguarding our homeland and serving as  America's enterprise resource for Federal law enforcement training.   In its first year, FLETC graduated 2,200 students. Last year, FLETC  welcomed more than 67,000 students. They have grown to manage more than  850 training programs across the training sites, including one in  Brunswick, Georgia.   For the past 50 years, FLETC has been a critical program to ensure  our officers of tomorrow receive the proper training to protect the  communities in which they serve.   FLETC has done a great job at adapting throughout their existence  from hurricanes, government shutdowns, to a worldwide pandemic.  Whatever they have faced, FLETC has done a remarkable job at getting  invaluable Federal law enforcement personnel to the front lines.   Now, more than ever, is an important time to honor their five decades  as the Nation's producer, resource, and steward of Federal law  enforcement training.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all who work tirelessly at FLETC, especially  those at Glynco in Georgia's First Congressional District.                       Remembering Kyle Steven Hugunin     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Mr. Kyle Steven Hugunin.   Friends, family, and members of Kyle's community recently recognized  the 1-year anniversary of his passing at the youthful age of 30. He was  from Savannah, in Georgia's First Congressional District, and was an  outstanding, kind, and loving individual, who was a friend to all.    Kyle was employed by Industrial Conveyor Belt Services for 10 years  and worked hard in all he did.   While reminiscing on Kyle's abundance of joy that he brought to all  family, friends, and others, they recalled that ``he had one of the  best smiles ever.'' He represented what it looks like to truly live  life to the fullest and not take any day for granted.   Kyle was a 2007 graduate of Benedictine Military School and loved the  outdoors, hunting, fishing, golf, and baseball.   My thoughts and prayers go out to all who knew and loved him during  this difficult time.          Congratulating Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Brunswick-Godlen Isles Chamber of Commerce for the U.S. certification  at the highest five-star level.   Accreditation with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the only program  of its kind. It defines excellence in chamber planning and recognizes  chambers for outstanding contributions toward positive change in their  communities. There are currently only 204 chambers across the country  that have earned the accreditation designation, and only 128 are five- star.   The Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce has been the voice of  the business community and a leader among community programs.   I applaud all members of the chamber for their hard work throughout  the years to excel above other chambers throughout the Nation and their  efforts to lead by example.   In part due to the chamber's hard work and dedication, our community  is an exceptional place to live, work, and visit. I look forward to  seeing the positive future of the chamber and the communities they help  serve and grow.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in our lives there are people and places we remember. I  will always remember John Lewis.   There are some people that you feel especially honored to have met.  You feel like you are one of the lucky ones who had the opportunity to  hear their stories, to learn their convictions, and to feel their  triumphs. I believe just about anyone who had the opportunity to meet  John Lewis would agree that he is one of those people.   He was born the son of sharecroppers. He grew up on his family farm,  and he attended segregated public schools in Alabama. He told the story  often, and I remember him telling us this story, about how he used to  preach to the chickens.   He went on from that humble beginning to be called one of the most  courageous persons the civil rights movement ever produced, a title he  rightfully deserved.   John Lewis dedicated his entire life to securing equality and justice  for all people, while remaining a devoted advocate for nonviolence. It  must have been an incredible blessing for him to see how his fight  changed our Nation and the entire world with his own eyes.   For me, it was a blessing to know him. His office was over in the  Cannon Building for many years, and my office was in the Cannon  Building. And oftentimes, as we were walking over here, I would get to  walk with him. I hung on every moment, on every word, just to have the  opportunity to spend time with someone like John Lewis. I will always  be grateful for those walks.   Many of my colleagues in the Georgia Delegation have mentioned the  time that he invited us to dinner at his home here in Washington. What  great stories he told that night; truly, one of the greatest  experiences I have had while I have been up here in Washington, D.C.   John Lewis was a giant among men. He will be deeply missed, but his  legacy will live on forever.                                time  2000
