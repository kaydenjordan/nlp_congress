 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Presiding  Officer on being in the Senate and presiding over the Senate.   I come to the floor to remind us how we got here. President Trump  told us over and over and over again during his campaign that Mexico  would pay for the wall. He said it at the beginning of the campaign. He  said it in the middle of the campaign. He said it at the end of the  campaign.   He made that promise over and over again. The U.S. Congress didn't  make that promise. There is no way for Congress to force Mexico to pay  for the wall. We cannot force Mexico to pay for the wall. It is not  Congress's fault. It is the President's fault, and it is his promise he  has broken.   Instead of going to Mexico to get them to pay for the wall, as he  said he would do over and over again, he has now asked Congress to pay  for it. He has now asked the American taxpayer to fulfill his broken  promise.   By the way, that is after 2 years of having a Republican majority in  the Senate and a Republican majority in the House who said: We don't  want to build your wall. We are not going to help you keep your  promise. In fact, you promised Mexico would pay for the wall. Go get  Mexico to pay for the wall is what the Republican Senate and the  Republican House said.   So he was frustrated. He said how frustrated he was. He went out to  the American people during the 2018 election, and the people rewarded  him by electing Democrats to be the majority in the House of  Representatives.   Then, last December, those Democrats offered the President $1.3  billion for border security. It wasn't for his medieval wall. It is for  what he now calls steel slats.   Instead of accepting that fact--the fact that nobody here wants to  fund the wall he said Mexico would pay for--he shut down the government  for 35 days. Then, after all the misery he inflicted, after the  billions of dollars he cost our economy, to say nothing of what he did  to the Federal workers, he basically got exactly the same deal as he  got before he shut down the government, making the shutdown pointless,  making the billions of dollars of lost wages and economic activity in  America pointless, all a casualty of his inability to keep his promise  that Mexico would pay for the wall and his inability to get Republican  majorities in the House and the Senate to build his wall.   So having failed to get Mexico to pay for the wall, having failed to  get a Republican Congress to pay for the wall, he now says he is going  to declare a national emergency to pay for the wall.   We should ask ourselves--we must ask ourselves--whether this is an  appropriate use of emergency power. By the way, if it was an  appropriate use of emergency power, why didn't he just declare an  emergency before he shut the government down for 35 days? Why cost the  economy billions and billions of dollars if you can just do this by  declaring an emergency? The easy answer for that is that it is not an  emergency.   He is only doing this now because he lost the negotiation. He lost  his leverage. He embarrassed himself by having the longest shutdown in  American history.   This is not a national emergency. This is just plan B. The President  has admitted as much as he was signing the declaration itself--the  declaration of emergency. He said:         I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.       . . . I just want to get it done faster, that's all.    It is not an emergency. He just wants to get it done faster, which is  astonishing coming from a guy who has not spent the money that Congress  has already appropriated for the wall. He  [[Page S1866]]  hasn't even spent that money, and now he is saying he wants to go  faster, and he has to declare a national emergency to do it.   By the way, America, you may have noticed that the President is also  now saying that ``much of the wall has already been fully renovated or  built.'' ``Much of the wall has already been fully renovated or  built.'' That is what your President is saying to you at the exact same  time he is saying that he needs a national emergency to build the wall.  It is preposterous. It is a joke.   On top of everything else, he is not telling the truth about that. He  has not built a mile of this wall since he has been President of the  United States, even though Congress has appropriated more than $1  billion--I think about $1.7 billion--to do it.   When he signed the emergency declaration, he said that national  emergencies have ``been signed many times before. It's been signed by  other presidents from 1977 or so; it gave the presidents the power.''   ``There's rarely been a problem'' the President said. ``They sign it.  Nobody cares.'' That is what he said.   Nobody cared because those were real emergencies, not fake  emergencies. They weren't emergencies being declared by Presidents who  had promised that Mexico would do something, and then it didn't happen,  and now they had to declare an emergency. They certainly were not cases  where the President came to the Congress, including a Congress of their  own party, and said, I want to do something, and they said no. Then,  they said: Well, we are going to declare an emergency.   That has never happened before in American history.   By the way, if we go down this road, this will not be the last time  this happens. This will happen time and again, which is why every  Member of the Senate should vote for this measure of disapproval.   Since 1976, when Congress passed the National Emergencies Act,  Presidents have declared national emergencies 58 times. Fifty-three of  those times have been to do things like block the sale of weapons to  foreign countries or to sanction governments, like Iran and North  Korea. The four remaining cases were after two U.S. planes were shot  down by Cuba, after we invaded Iraq and desperately needed to protect  critical infrastructure, after the outbreak of swine flu, and after 9/ 11.   Failing to fulfill his promise that Mexico would pay for the wall is  not a national emergency, and if he thinks it is, he should sanction  himself for failing to keep his promise.   As I said earlier--and this should bother everybody who believes in  our system of checks and balances and who believes in the  Constitution--never has a President sought to enact a national  emergency like this after Congress has said no. In our Constitution,  Congress has the power of the purse. Every single Senator should be  voting to protect that.   Over the months and now stretching into years, I have been shocked at  how the people around here who declare that they are constitutional  conservatives have put up with a President who obviously doesn't care  about the rule of law, doesn't care about the separation of powers--as  you see here--isn't concerned about having an independent judiciary,  and wants to threaten the leading journalists of this country, calling  them fake news.   I would think this step would be one step too far, even for anybody  in this Chamber who supported this craziness up until this point.   Let's add it all up. What has it gotten us? The President couldn't  get Mexico to pay for the wall. He couldn't get a Republican House and  a Republican Senate to pay for the wall. So now he is violating the  Constitution to steal money that has been appropriated by this branch-- by Congress. He is stealing that money from the Department of Defense,  from our warfighters, and from the U.S. military to expropriate private  land held by American farmers and ranchers--many of whom I assume are  Republicans--through eminent domain.   As I have said on this floor before, if any President tried to do  that in Colorado, there is not a person in our delegation who would  support that--stealing our farms and ranches.   It must be said that, for a politician, he has a very unusual view  about eminent domain. Here are some quotes of his: ``I think eminent  domain is wonderful.''   For those of you who don't know what eminent domain is, it is when a  government decides it wants a project, and your house is in the middle  of where that project is going to go. Then, the government can use this  thing called eminent domain to take your house and pay you for it. That  is what it is. It is rarely used because most people don't want the  government deciding whether they can live in their house or on their  farm or on their ranch, which--in the case of people on the border of  the United States--has been in their family for generations. That is  why the local Congressman down there doesn't want this wall built. I  think he is a Republican.   But the President said: ``I think eminent domain is wonderful''--not  sometimes essential, not a tool that is useful from time to time. He  said it is ``wonderful.''   He said: ``Eminent domain is something that has to be used, usually  you would say for anything that's long, like a road, like a pipeline,  or like a wall, or a fence.''   He didn't say steel slats, but I am sure the same thing applies.   Here is another quote. This is fascinating. I have not met a single  person in Colorado who would agree with this--not one--and I bet you  there is not a person in Mississippi or Texas or Alabama who would  agree with this sentiment either. This is what the President of the  United States said:         Most of the time, they just want money. It's very rarely       they say, ``I love my house, I love my house, it's the       greatest thing ever.''    Here is another quote--and just for everybody who is watching this  because people are going to come out on this floor and say: Oh, no, the  money will not be used for it in this case--not for a wall, not for  eminent domain.   Donald Trump says:         We are going to need a little eminent domain to get that       wall built, just so you understand. . . . You need eminent       domain, you have to take certain areas, okay?    That is the kind of language you would expect out of some autocrat  someplace, not in a democracy.   I say to my Republican friends here who are going to vote with the  President on this bill, that is what you are supporting when you are  voting with him on this bill.   I don't know how anybody goes home and defends that. For anyone who  wants to go home and defend misappropriating money that has been  dedicated to the Department of Defense and to our military and to take  that money extra-constitutionally and use it to take the property of  law-abiding citizens, I don't understand how you defend it.   I am not making any of this up. These are his words. By the way, it  is no wonder he can't get it through the people's Representatives in  Congress because there is not a single person here who would ever admit  to doing what he is about to do and what he says he wants to do. What a  betrayal of conservative principles this is.   As I said, this whole exercise itself is an admission that he has  broken his promise to the American people.   We didn't break it, Republicans in the Senate. We didn't break it,  and we should not help him keep it if it is going to break the  Constitution. In fact, we can't help him keep it unless somebody around  here has a way of persuading Mexico to build the wall or pay for the  wall, which I don't think there is a single person here who has that  kind of influence, as influential as all of us think we are.   I don't understand it, but it is amazing to me why people would cash  in their conservative principles so cheaply--$3.6 billion.   The idea that you would be willing to give up your principles in such  a tawdry exchange should be infuriating to the real conservatives who I  know are in this country. Many of them live in my State of Colorado,  which is a third Republican, a third Independent, and a third  Democratic. Don't come to our State and tell us you are taking away our  houses because we don't care about them--that we will just take the  money instead for a broken promise that you didn't keep. That would not  sell in Colorado. I don't know why it sells in Texas. I can't imagine  that it does. I don't know how anybody could support that.   By the way, that is not even the most important point. The most  important  [[Page S1867]]  point is that we have ground ourselves up for a 35-day government  shutdown, for 3 months of media cycles on this fight by the President  on a wall that he now says is almost fully built, while he is declaring  an emergency to build a wall that hasn't been built.   While we are screwing around here to keep a broken promise that  Mexico is going to pay for the wall, this is what was going on in  China. By the way, I know somebody is going to say: Hey, they have a  wall. They do have a wall. They built it 500 years ago. That is not  what they are working on today. They took care of that medieval wall  500 years ago.   Today, what they are doing is they are spending $125 billion on high- speed rail this year alone. That is $125 billion on high-speed rail.  You get on one of those trains and you could hear a pin drop. If you go  on Amtrak, which I take all the time--I feel grateful that we have it-- it is less than half the speed, and you can't put your Coca-Cola on the  table in front of you without it falling over or falling on your  neighbor.   China has spent $300 billion on new roads, bridges, and ports across  the globe through their Belt and Road Initiative. They have bought  stakes in 16 different ports across Europe and the Mediterranean, some  of which have fallen into their hands because--and this is part of the  plan--the debt that the countries have put on to build the ports is so  onerous that China gets to own the ports. They have built the longest  sea bridge in the world. They have laid over 3,700 miles of fiber optic  cable to connect Africa to Latin America and, ultimately, to China. On  that Belt and Road Initiative, they have laid their technology over  that with fiber optic cables so they could extend the surveillance  society that they are building inside of China right now, while we  screw around with this wall.   By the way, on the $3.6 billion for the wall, here is an interesting  chart. Here is how much cement China used over a 3-year period, from  2011 to 2013. This is what they used in 3 years, 2011 to 2013. I was in  the Congress then. We were in the depths of the great recession during  that period of time. It was 6.6 gigatons of concrete. Here is how much  we have built in concrete in 100 years: 4.5 gigatons.   They used 4.5 gigatons in 3 years. They have used dramatically more  than we have used in 100 years, and we can't even get an infrastructure  bill off this floor. The White House can't even write an infrastructure  bill.   All night, every night, on the cable, all we hear is $3.6 billion for  the wall, the wall, the wall--the wall that the President says has  already been mostly built, that he is now declaring a national  emergency to build.   The world is racing ahead of us, as I have said on this floor over  and over again, while we are getting run around by one inane  distraction after another. It has been said that the President is  somebody who is mostly concerned with winning the politics of any given  day. That is what he tries to do, and he is often very effective at it.  We spend a lot of time talking about him and his priorities, unlike  figuring out a plan to counteract what China is doing or others are  doing.   I bet they have a great strategy in China and Iran. Russia is not so  obviously good at that strategy. Actually, come to think of it, they  are pretty good, too. If you can stay off FOX News, the President will  not pay any attention to what you are doing, so go do whatever it is  you want to do while we fritter away one day after another of the  American people's time over a broken promise that he never could keep.   Unless we are prepared to be the first generation of Americans to  leave less opportunity, not more, to the people coming after us, we  need to do a lot better than what we are doing, and part of that is to  ensure that we preserve the institutions that built this country, like  the one we are standing in right now.   I know that among some people there is an effort to divide the  government from the American people and that there are people here who  think they have been sent here for one purpose, which is to discredit  the Federal Government.   I have a lot of problems with the Federal Government--lots of them. I  was a school superintendent before I came here. I have a lot of  problems with what is happening to poor children who are going to  schools in our public system of education across the country, so I am  not here to defend government or the way it works right now. In fact, I  don't think Democrats should be the party defending bad government. We  should fix it where it needs to be fixed.   We are talking here about our institutions. We are talking here about  the rule of law. We are talking here about the Constitution that  generation after generation after generation of Americans has  preserved--not always perfectly, often very imperfectly.   Every generation of Americans has seen it as their obligation, their  responsibility, to at least try to live up to the pages in our founding  documents, and where we failed, we got up and we tried again. This  whole country is founded on the idea that we will have disagreements  because we live in a Republic, and in a Republic, you have  disagreements. There is no King or tyrant to tell you what to think.  That is the reason we live in a democratic Republic.   This place here and the Chamber down the hall are part of the  mechanisms that were drafted into our founding documents for us to  resolve our disagreements. The Founders believed something. They had no  good example in the past, but here is what they believed. They believed  that out of that vigorous disagreement, we would create more  imaginative and durable solutions than any tyrant could ever come up  with on their own. That is why they designed the institutions the way  they did, and that is why they created the checks and balances that  they did. There is a reason no President has ever done what this  President is trying to do.   They exercise self-restraint because of what is in the Constitution  and because nobody on this floor would have supported him. There are  many ways this generation of politicians--and I accept my share of the  blame. There are many ways in which we have degraded these institutions  in our time. We have destroyed the Senate's responsibility to advise  and consent on judicial nominations and Supreme Court nominations. That  has been turned into a purely partisan exercise by this generation of  American politicians. I am ashamed of that. I am ashamed to have been  here when we did that, and I take my share of the responsibility.   What I say to my colleagues is that we cannot continue to degrade  these institutions and expect that the next generation of Americans is  going to look back on us with anything except contempt. Generation  after generation after generation of Americans has preserved these  institutions so the next generation could have the opportunity to  resolve their disagreements in these Chambers. We will regret it. We  will regret it if we go down this road.   As the majority leader said in another time: Things have a way of  changing around here sooner than you think, and someday the shoe will  be on the other foot. If this Republican sets this precedent and some  Democratic President follows it, that is one more step away from living  in the Republic that we all claim we cherish, from the democracy we all  claim we cherish, to put power in the hands of a tyrant who may or may  not represent the will of the American people.   We may never get another vote like this around here. This is going to  be the time that each of us is going to decide whether we are going to  act to preserve these institutions for the next generation or whether  we are going to continue to degrade them in our mindless partisanship  and, in this case, to somehow fulfill a promise the President never  could keep. That would be a shameful day in the U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor.
