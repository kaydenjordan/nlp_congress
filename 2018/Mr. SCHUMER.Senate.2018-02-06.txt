 Mr. President, here is just a brief note on taxes in  answer to what my friend the Republican leader has said. The reason  that 48 Democrats voted against the bill and the reason that at this  point, despite huge amounts of ads paid for by the wealthiest of  Americans, the bill is still unpopular with the American people is very  simple: The vast majority of the breaks go to the very wealthy and to  big, powerful corporations and their lobbyists. That is who wins on  this bill more than anybody else.   If a bill focused on the middle class gave 80 percent of the breaks  to the middle class, there would be loads of Democrats voting for it.  We are happy that there are a lot of wealthy people in America. God  bless them. They don't need the huge tax break--the disproportionate  tax break that our Republican friends gave them. That is why the bill  is unpopular.   Again, people like the Koch brothers and the thousand very, very  wealthy--many of them so greedy--billionaires who don't want to pay any  taxes put all of these ads on TV and have a whole propaganda machine.  They still can't convince the American people.   Our Republican colleagues are afraid to talk about what they really  mean in the tax bill--trickle-down economics. When they talk among  themselves, they say: Give the wealthy a lot of money, give the big  corporations a lot of money, and everyone will do fine. They don't have  an honest debate on this because they are afraid to say it. So they act  like they aim most of this at the middle class.   The only way this is aimed at the middle class is trickle down: Give  the money disproportionately to the wealthy and the big corporations,  and the middle class will benefit. We don't believe that. We would  rather give the money directly to the middle class and be sure they are  getting the benefit.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as we continue discussions about another  extension of government funding, Senate negotiators are working on a  deal to lift the spending caps for both defense and urgent domestic  priorities.   From the very beginning of the budget debate, Democrats have made our  position in these negotiations very clear. We support an increase in  funding for our military and our middle class. The two are not mutually  exclusive. We don't want to do just one and leave the other behind. The  sequester caps have arbitrarily imposed austerity on both sides of the  ledger, defense and the nondefense programs that benefit middle-class  people, such as education, infrastructure, and medical research. The  caps have hamstrung the Pentagon's ability to make reliable  investments, no doubt, but they have also cut support harshly and  unintelligently from middle-class programs.   We ought to get out from sequestration entirely because our men and  women in uniform deserve the resources they need to keep our country  safe--as do our veterans waiting for better healthcare; as do young men  and women, many of them veterans, seeking treatment for opioid  addiction; as do rural families waiting for high-speed internet to  connect themselves and their kids to the world; as do hard-working  pensioners who forewent salary increases and bonuses to secure a  pension that is now evaporating before their very eyes.   That is why Democrats have pushed consistently to increase funding to  fight the scourge of opioids, to improve veterans healthcare, to build  rural infrastructure, to shore up pensions, and to deal with childcare.  These are the kinds of things we are pushing for in addition to, not to  the exclusion of, increasing defense.   Some of our Republican colleagues, particularly in the House, think  that only defense should get the help it needs, not the middle class.  We Democrats have stood against that for years and will continue to  stand against it.   House Republicans continue marching down a very partisan road,  proposing a CRomnibus that will raise defense spending but leave  everything else behind. As I have said many times before, a CRomnibus  will not pass the Senate.   Speaker Ryan and House Republicans keep running into the same brick  wall. When will House Republicans learn that they must chart a  bipartisan course to get a bill through the Senate? I don't think a  single Democrat--that I am aware of, at least--has been consulted on  the Republican bill. It is done because Speaker Ryan is in a  [[Page S619]]  pickle. How is he going to pass a bill with just Republican votes? It  is not easy. So they come up with this distorted, unfair proposal-- unfair to so many people in the middle class who depend on our help.   Hopefully, House Republicans will change their tune, because even  though a deal has eluded us for months, negotiators are now making  significant progress. The Republican leader and I have been working  together quite productively. Of course, there are still some  outstanding issues to be resolved, but we are closer to an agreement  than we have ever been.   I would like to express my appreciation to the Republican leader, in  addition, for his invitation to address the McConnell Center next week  in Louisville, which I have accepted.   As leaders, the two of us can work together to get things done around  here, and the best opportunity to work together is the budget. It is an  opportunity not just for us but for our country, not only to escape the  terrible damage of sequestration but to condemn it to the past, and we  should seize that opportunity.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now for a word on the Russia  investigation, last night the House Intelligence Committee voted to  release the contents of the Schiff memo. Now that the House  Intelligence Committee has acted, President Trump should move--in  conjunction with the DOJ and the FBI--and release the Schiff memo to  the public. The American people deserve the chance to make their own  judgment on the facts of this small piece of the broader case of  Russia's interference in our election.   The President decided the public deserved to see the Nunes memo  before he had even read it. So he ought to be just as eager for the  American people to see this memo, which refutes--effectively,  devastatingly--so much in the Nunes memo.   Given that the Schiff memo is based on the same underlying documents  as the Republicans' partisan memo, there should be no question as to  whether or not the President should approve its release. If he decides  to keep the Democratic memo under wraps, the American people are going  to be forced to wonder: What is the President trying to hide? What is  he afraid of?   President Trump should release the Schiff memo--and quickly. It will  illustrate what a sham the Nunes memo is. Then, we can all move on and,  as some of my good Republican colleagues have had the courage to say-- not enough, but some: Let Mueller do his investigation unimpeded, and  let's see where the results end up.   We need to move on. The Nunes memo is only the latest in a long line  of distractions manufactured by the most extreme elements of the  Republican Party and the conservative media to distract from the  special counsel's investigation. It started with conspiracies about  ``deep state'' leaks and unmasking requests, phone taps at Trump Tower,  and Uranium One, and now it is this memo. They don't quit with all  these conspiracy theories, with all these ridiculous fomentations. They  don't quit, perhaps because they are afraid of what a real  investigation, which Mueller is doing and will continue to do, will  reveal.    What the American people want to know are three simple things: One,  what did the Russians do to interfere in our elections; two, were there  Americans involved in helping the Russians; and three, what are we  doing to prevent the Russians from interfering in 2018 and beyond? To  that point, Americans should be much more concerned about this  administration's tepid response to Putin's interference in our election  than about a memo of Republican talking points.   Any other administration, any other President, I believe, would have  made punishing Putin and protecting our democracy a primary issue in  the first term, but this President began his first year in office by  downplaying Putin's involvement in the 2016 election, and then he  repeatedly accepted Putin's words of denial over the consensus of the  American intelligence community.   When the administration tried to wiggle out of existing sanctions  against Russia, Congress overwhelmingly and almost unanimously passed  legislation strengthening the existing sanctions and adding new ones to  address the interference. We are still waiting for President Trump to  implement the new round of sanctions. What is he waiting for? Why does  he refuse to get tough with Putin? We look to the President of the  United States to stand up for our democracy against all threats, but  unfortunately and sadly--bad for America--President Trump has abdicated  this responsibility when it comes to Putin.   I yield the floor.   I know my good friend from Illinois will have his usual thoughtful  and articulate remarks to give.
