 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his tremendous  leadership on this bill and so many other issues. It is because of  democratic leadership that this bill rejected all of the harmful  changes to nutrition, so I thank him for that.   I rise today in support of the Farm Bill conference report (H.R. 2).  This bill reauthorizes SNAP--our nation's first line of defense against  hunger. This bill also rejects the dangerous and immoral work  requirements, which would have pushed 2 million people further into  hunger and poverty.   Mr. Speaker, nutrition assistance helps 40 million people put food on  the table. And the vast majority of families who receive food stamps  are working.   In fact, more than 80 percent of SNAP households work the year before  or after receiving aid. This program helps the working poor, children,  the disabled and seniors. It's a necessary lifeline to our fellow  Americans who otherwise would go hungry.   And I know how important this program is, Mr. Speaker, when I was a  young, single mom raising two little boys, I relied on food stamps to  help my family during a very difficult time in my life. It was a bridge  over troubled waters. And quite frankly I would not be where I am today  without that assistance.   All families should have this bridge over troubled waters when they  need it.   And Mr. Speaker, while this bill is a step in the right direction for  our anti-poverty work, we must do more to ensure that all families have  nutritious and regular meals every day. No one in the richest nation on  earth should go hungry but unfortunately 40 million do. 40 million.   So, I urge my colleagues support this bill and to redouble our  efforts to end poverty and hunger in our nation.
