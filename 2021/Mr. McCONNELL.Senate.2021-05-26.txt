 Mr. President, I was saddened to learn this morning  that our friend and former colleague, Senator John Warner, passed away  last night.   By the time I arrived in the Senate, John was already churning a long  wake as one of this body's foremost voices on national defense. As a  wartime veteran of the Navy and Marine Corps, he was deeply devoted to  the men and women who serve in uniform.   As a proud Virginian, John took seriously his Commonwealth's role as  host to massive portions of America's military might, including the  largest naval base in the world.   As a former Secretary of the Navy, he brought Pentagon clout and  technical chops that would help the Senate play a hugely consequential  role in defense policy.   John's career was capped, of course, by years as chairman and ranking  member of the Armed Services Committee. But John made an even wider  impact. My predecessor as chairman of the Rules Committee was a  principled patriot across the board.   He was also a truly old-school Virginia gentleman. John knew a thing  or two about horseracing, for example, and that is high praise coming  from a Kentuckian to a non-Kentuckian.   Members on both sides of the aisle looked to John as a trusted mentor  and friend. Our thoughts today are especially with our current  colleagues from Virginia. So many Senators, past and present, knew John  very well.   Most of all, we are thinking today of his wife Jeanne; his children,  Virginia, John, and Mary; and the entire Warner family. The Senate will  keep them all in our prayers in the days ahead.                            ____________________     On a completely different matter, today two Senate  committees will consider and vote on two very different pieces of  legislation.   Over in the Russell Building, the Environment and Public Works  Committee just approved a bipartisan bill, led by Chairman Carper and  Ranking Member Capito, to invest in better roads and bridges for the  American people.   This would be the first major action on surface transportation since  the FAST Act 6 years ago. It would raise the baseline funding for roads  and bridges to an alltime high. And, as expected, our colleagues just  reported this bill out unanimously, 20 to 0. That is legislating done  right. Our colleagues are modeling the approach that would let Congress  build a successful, big-picture infrastructure bill later this year.   Meanwhile, in the Hart Building, the Finance Committee will spend its  afternoon marking up a leftwing, partisan bill written fully within the  spirit of the Green New Deal: maximum pain for working American  families in exchange for minimal--minimal--environmental gain.   Under the guise of Clean Energy for America, Chairman Wyden is  leading the charge against the most reliable and affordable ways to  power our country.   The legislation he has drafted is full of the sort of policies that  would increase the price of gas at the pump, hike the tax burden on  independent American producers, of course, killing jobs, discourage the  industry-led innovations that have already been reducing emissions  without hurting workers, and dragging the United States away from  energy independence back toward reliance on imports from places like  Russia, Venezuela, and the Middle East.   In exchange, the bill would have ordinary Americans subsidize the  lifestyle preferences of wealthy people in places like New York and San  Francisco.   So one committee unanimously approved a smart, targeted, bipartisan  approach to key infrastructure projects that America needs, and another  will consider a partisan descendent of the Green New Deal that would  raise taxes, probably raise gas prices, and leave us with a less and  less reliable electricity grid.   Really, this contrast is a fork in the road that the Biden  administration is facing writ large. Which route to take; a lonely road  leading to the far left versus a mainstream, bipartisan road leading  straight ahead toward practical policies that make American lives  actually better?   The Senate knows how to walk that road. This last highway bill passed  the Senate with 83 votes. Just last month, we passed a water  infrastructure bill with 89 votes.   If President Biden wants to secure lasting solutions, build a lasting  legacy, and improve the lives of Americans in practical ways, he has  the map in hand. For the sake of the country, let's hope he and his  party decide to follow it.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a related matter, the  Democrats' far-left turn thus far has affected the entire U.S. economy,  and it is hitting working families right where it hurts.   In January, President Biden inherited safe and effective vaccines. He  inherited a reopening economy and a country that was sitting on more  pent-up savings than anything economists had seen in living memory.  That was the condition of the country when the President took office.   The Democrats have already dreamt up a massive, record-shattering  Washington spending spree. Like one House Democrat admitted way back at  the start of the pandemic, liberals saw the crisis as ``a tremendous  opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.''  [[Page S3470]]    The Democrats had already decided to run up the American people's  credit cards no matter what. Their first purchase was a $1.9 trillion  excuse for a COVID bill that the Democrats rammed through on a party- line vote. Even liberal economists and even former advisers to  Presidents Clinton and Obama cautioned that the Democrats' bill was way  larger than the remaining hole in our economy, badly tailored, and  might well cause inflation.   So everyone, from Republicans to liberal economists, warned that the  Democrats' bad bill could easily cause inflation that would hurt  ordinary American families. Well, look where we are today. Where are we  today? We just got the most dramatic monthly inflation report in over a  decade. Ask any working family about gas prices, food prices, home  prices, lumber prices, used car prices. One survey just found that more  than 80 percent of American families are literally tightening their  household budgets because of the threat of inflation.   Yet the problem with the Democrats' product wasn't just how much  credit and borrowed money it flooded into the economy; the problem was  also how little of substance American families got for the money. Larry  Summers, former President Clinton's Treasury Secretary, put it this  way--and this is the Larry Summers who also had a role in the Obama  administration.   Here is what he said:         What's striking about [that bill, the COVID bill] is that       all of the trillions of dollars--all of it--does not include       a penny directed at ``building back better.''    He continued:         It transfers to state and local governments that don't have       any new budget problem. . . . It's paying people who have       been unemployed more in unemployment insurance than they       earned when they were working. It's giving checks to families       in the 90th percentile of income distribution.    That is from Larry Summers. He is a Democrat. He is a friend of the  administration's.   The Democrats' hard-left turn has already hurt our economy, but they  still seem to think that this massive bill should only actually just be  the appetizer. The administration has proposed a total of about $7  trillion of spending in its first few months in office. That absurdly  overpriced COVID package would actually be the cheapest of the three  massive bills the Democrats actually want to pass.   For some perspective, about $7 trillion is considerably more money in  inflation-adjusted terms than America spent in fighting and winning  World War II. The Biden administration wants to tax, borrow, and print  more money than America spent on World War II to finance a grab bag of  miscellaneous liberal programs that would further jack up prices on the  things families actually need to buy. It took less money to win a  global war than these Democrats want to spend on a hodgepodge of  stuff--stuff like electric cars and welfare programs. This is $7  trillion of mediocre socialism and liberal social engineering. No  serious expert thinks this is what our economy actually needs. No  wonder Larry Summers says he is concerned that these proposals are  ``substantially excessive . . . way overdoing the requisite response.''   The sooner this administration can get the memo, the more bipartisan  progress we will be able to make, and the better off working families  will be.                            ____________________
