 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to congratulate The  Victory Center for Autism and Related Disabilities on the upcoming  completion of its state-of-the-art education facility in south Florida.   Since its founding in 2000, The Victory Center has excelled at  providing children with autism and related disabilities comprehensive  individualized treatment and education. For 18 years, the teachers at  The Victory Center have achieved amazing success working out of only a  handful of rooms on the campus of the Michael-Ann Russell Jewish  Community Center in North Miami Beach.   This outstanding institution is proud to offer five programs covering  a range of services, and it is recognized as one of the top schools for  children with autism in the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, by opening this brand-new facility, The Victory Center  will continue to grow and offer a positive and nurturing educational  environment.  [[Page H1752]]    Once again, I would like to congratulate everyone at The Victory  Center for all that they have accomplished. I thank their staff for  helping so many children in our south Florida community achieve their  full potential and leave their own beautiful mark on our world.                            ____________________
