 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chair of the  committee for her leadership throughout our appropriations process. We  now have a funding bill on the floor  [[Page H4461]]  this week that makes critical investments and advances American values.   I want to touch on the part of the State and Foreign Operations bill  that deals with support for the Venezuelan people. I am thrilled with  the support in the bill for Venezuela, for her people, because the  Venezuelan people are enduring an unimaginable onslaught of hunger,  danger, and escalating economic pain, and America cannot stand idly by.   As a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Representative  with the largest Venezuelan population in the United States, I am  thrilled that the bill has language that allocates aid to Colombia to  assist communities that are impacted by refugee and migrant populations  fleeing the despotic Maduro regime.   Congresswoman Shalala and I visited Colombia and met with starving  and impoverished Venezuelans and saw, firsthand, the need for this  funding. We saw the blocked bridges and met with Venezuelans shot by  their own military to prevent them from delivering humanitarian aid to  their own people.   The bill also includes funding for democracy promotion, human rights,  and civil society programs in Venezuela, and I was proud to work with  the chairwoman to include this vital funding.   Perhaps most important is what this bill does not do, what it does  not contain, which is the traditional prohibition on funds being  provided to the central Government of Venezuela, with the clear hope  that we might have a cooperating regime to work with in the near  future.   The U.S. rightfully recognizes Juan Guaido as the legitimate interim  President of Venezuela.   Viva Venezuela. We must continue to work to make sure that she can  transition to a democracy and the vibrant nation that she once was.
