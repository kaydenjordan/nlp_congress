 Madam President, I rise today in support of the nomination  of Steve Grasz to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. One  of the most important things this Senate has done this year and will do  for the remainder of the year--and, in fact, well into 2018--is to  consider nominees to the Federal courts.   When I talk to Nebraskans, I constantly hear from women and men who  tell me that the No. 1 issue they care about when they vote for  President is the judiciary. Nebraskans want judges who understand that  judges are not lawmakers. Nebraskans want judges who understand that a  lifetime appointment isn't designed to do politics. Nebraskans want  judges who understand that the courts are to uphold the laws fairly and  impartially.   My colleagues and I on the Judiciary Committee agree with those  Nebraskans from townhalls and coffee shops and Rotary clubs. In the  Judiciary Committee, we have worked to advance a record number of  judges who know exactly that. We are looking for thoughtful men and  women of integrity. That is why it is a pleasure today, it is an honor  today, to come to the floor in support of Steve Grasz.   Steve is a Nebraskan through and through. He is a fifth-generation  Nebraskan who grew up on a family farm--walking beans, raising sheep  and pigs, branding cattle. When he was a young man, life in the  Nebraska Panhandle taught him hard work. He then moved east to Lincoln,  where the University of Nebraska taught him the law.   Steve graduated at the top of his class and then put his law degree  to work serving his fellow Nebraskans. He served as the chief deputy  attorney general for our State for nearly a dozen years. Steve's job  was to represent the people of Nebraska in court. That means he was  bound by the law and by his professional duty to defend our laws,  including our State's ban on the gruesome procedure known as partial- birth abortion.   In his role in the Nebraska AG's office, he litigated multiple cases  in  [[Page S7940]]  front of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the  U.S. Eighth Circuit, to which he has now been nominated by President  Trump. Every time he represented us in court, Steve did so with  integrity, with humility, and with decency. That is just what  Nebraskans do.    Steve bleeds Husker red, but he is now ready to put on a judge's  black robe. He knows that judges in America don't wear red or blue  partisan jerseys. He knows that policy preferences, whether his or  anyone else's, have no role in how a judge applies the law. He knows  that, in his courtroom, two things matter and only two things--the  facts and the law.   Anybody who wants to ensure that Steve will approach his job as a  judge without partisan or ideological bias should listen to the words  of hundreds of Nebraskans who have spoken out in support of Steve's  nomination.   Democrat Ben Nelson, Nebraska's U.S. Senator from 2001 through 2013  and, before that, our Governor for 8 years, offered this testament to  Steve's fitness for office:         I first got to know Steve when I served as Nebraska's       Governor and he served as our state's Chief Deputy Attorney       General. . . . With me as a Democrat and him as a Republican,       we sometimes found ourselves disagreeing on policy;       nevertheless, I quickly learned that Steve was the kind of       consummate professional who is capable of putting whatever       personal views he may have aside when appropriate in his       capacity as a public servant. . . . If Steve is confirmed, I       fully expect him to follow the law and the facts in each case       because I know his loyalty is first to the rule of law,       rather than to any personal views he holds on matters of       policy. He possesses first-rate legal skills and a       respectful, even-keeled temperament, key ingredients in the       making of a good judge. As a Nebraskan, I hope our state has       the opportunity to benefit yet again from Steve's public       service in this new role.    Then there is Deborah Gilg, who was President Obama's choice to be  U.S. attorney for the District of Nebraska, who served in that office  from 2009 through 2016. She wrote glowingly to our committee of Steve:         Steve has always enjoyed a reputation for honesty,       impeccable integrity and dedication to the rule of law. He       possesses an even temperament well-suited for the bench and       always acts with respect to all that interact with him. . . .       Without a doubt, he would be a tremendous asset to the bench       as he demonstrates excellence in all that he does.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   October 31, 2017.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Chairman, U.S. Senate,      Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, U.S. Senate,      Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: I       write to you today to express my strong support for the       nomination of L. Steven Grasz to the United States Court of       Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. I have no doubt that Steve       possesses the skills, character, and temperament necessary to       make him an excellent member of that court.        I first got to know Steve when I served as Nebraska's       Governor and he served as our state's Chief Deputy Attorney       General. During his nearly twelve-year tenure in that senior       position, Steve won my respect by putting his considerable       skills to work as an effective legal advocate for our state.       With me as a Democrat and him as a Republican, we sometimes       found ourselves disagreeing on policy; nevertheless, I       quickly learned that Steve was the kind of consummate       professional who is capable of putting whatever personal       views he may have aside when appropriate in his capacity as a       public servant. He was an asset to our state, and Nebraskans       benefitted from having such a capable and thoughtful       professional in public service. Today, he is unquestionably       one of the foremost appellate lawyers in the state, making       him an obvious choice for this seat on our federal appeals       court.        If Steve is confirmed, I fully expect him to follow the law       and the facts in each case because I know his loyalty is       first to the rule of law, rather than to any personal views       he holds on matters of policy. He possesses first-rate legal       skills and a respectful, even-keeled temperament, key       ingredients in the making of a good judge. As a Nebraskan, I       hope our state has the opportunity to benefit yet again from       Steve's public service in this new role.            Sincerely,                                                        Ben Nelson,      United States Senator for Nebraska, 2001-2013.                                   ____                                                      Time Health,                                      Omaha, NE, September 19, 2017.      Re L. Steven Grasz.       Chairman Chuck Grassley,      Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein,      Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.        I am writing to enthusiastically recommend Steve Grasz for       the vacancy on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. I have known       Steve since 1991 when he became Chief Deputy Attorney General       for the State of Nebraska. At that time, I was the elected       County Attorney and/or appointed County Attorney for several       Western Nebraska rural counties. I relocated to Omaha in 2002       and in 2009 I became the U.S. Attorney for Nebraska until       March 10, 2017. At present, I am the Vice-President, Chief       Operating Officer and General Counsel for Time Health, a       healthcare management corporation. I should also mention that       I am a Democrat and it is with great confidence that I       recommend Steve.        Steve has always enjoyed a reputation for honesty,       impeccable integrity and dedication to the rule of law, He       possesses an even temperament well-suited for the bench and       always acts with respect to all that interact with him. I am       confident that he is well-versed in legal principles, has       keen legal analytical skills and outstanding oral and written       skills. Without doubt, he would be a tremendous asset to the       bench as he demonstrates excellence in all that he does.        Finally, I think it is important to have a jurist that has       an agricultural background and understands that not all       things legal revolve around urban areas. He still owns land       in Western Nebraska and quite clearly is a product of and       proud of his agricultural roots.        I look forward to your support of his nomination.            Sincerely,                                                   Deborah R. Gilg,                                Vice-President and General Counsel.
