 Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution to ensure that Congress is working toward commonsense,  effective family leave solutions. It is well past time we made paid  parental leave a reality in this country. Affording all moms and dads  the flexibility to spend time with their new baby is something  Americans want to see happen.   While I appreciate the resolution by my colleague from the State of  Hawaii, putting Washington insiders and Federal employees first doesn't  add up as the right first step. I believe we need to think more broadly  about this issue and how it impacts hard-working families in Iowa and  across the country.   We all recognize there are significant barriers for new, working  parents to spend time with their baby during those critical and  precious first few months. That is why I am working with Senator Mike  Lee on a proposal to offer paid parental leave to all new parents in a  way that is both budget neutral and flexible. In fact, a number of  Republicans and Democrats are working on potential pathways forward.   At the heart of all of it, we simply cannot lose sight of the fact  that we need solutions that work for all American families, not just  those fortunate enough to have a government job. If we are serious  about enacting paid family leave policies, instead of scoring political  wins, we will support the resolution before us.  [[Page S5695]]    Families are the bedrock of our society. Let's look for solutions  that all Americans can embrace.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
