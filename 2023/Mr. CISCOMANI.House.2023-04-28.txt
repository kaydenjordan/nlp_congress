 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Park  Week to highlight my bill, the Chiricahua National Park Act.   From the Grand Canyon to the Petrified Forest and the Saguaro  National Park, Arizona is lucky to have some of the most stunning parks  in the world.   In our own district, Chiricahua National Monument has drawn visitors  from around the country and across the globe for almost 100 years.   The Wonderland of Rocks showcases the unique beauty of our region  through 12,000 acres of towering geological structures, 25 campsites,  and over 17 miles of hiking trails.   Local communities and leaders from both sides of the aisle have  advocated for years to give this beloved landmark the national park  designation it deserves. It is my honor to renew this long-awaited  effort.  [[Page H2093]]    Establishing Chiricahua National Park would create a profound impact  on Cochise County by enhancing tourism, boosting the local economy, and  fueling opportunity at no additional cost. It is time to make this  dream a reality and upgrade Chiricahua.                            ____________________
