 Madam Speaker, temperatures this week in  Buffalo and western New York are in single digits.   My community has some of the oldest housing stock in the country.  Keeping these homes safe and warm is expensive. Failing to do so can be  life threatening.   This year, Congress approved $876 million in additional Home Energy  Assistance Program funding for seniors and families in New York to  afford energy. The infrastructure bill goes further, providing a  historic $3.5 billion nationwide for weatherization. This funding means  that old houses will better withstand extreme weather as well as  supporting green energy jobs.   But we can't stop there. We must do more. This Congress must enact  the renewable energy provisions in Build Back Better so entire  neighborhoods in my community can be retrofitted for long-term  resilience. I urge the Senate to enact these provisions now.                            ____________________
