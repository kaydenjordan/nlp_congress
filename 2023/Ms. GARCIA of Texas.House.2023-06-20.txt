 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  Federal Railroad Administration's recent funding to reduce train  blockages in the Houston area.   Madam Speaker, $36 million will go to overpasses where trains block  roads, intersections, and crossings in the Houston area. Schoolchildren  have been crawling under train cars just to get to school. Ambulances  and fire trucks are losing precious minutes to detour around trains  that are blocking high-traffic areas.   Houston residents have filed more complaints of train obstructions  than any other city in the United States.   Our fire chief tells us that, on average, there are 90 instances a  month where emergency responders are delayed by trains, losing time,  when lives are at stake.   Enough is enough. We must put people over politics. We must put  people over trains.   The funding that we just received, Madam Speaker, is but the first  step. There is still a lot more to go to ensure that our roads are  safe, our children are safe, and our community is safer.                            ____________________
