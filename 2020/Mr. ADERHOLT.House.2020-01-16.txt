 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as pro-life, pro- family, and pro-child. No matter what your faith is, everyone  understands that life is very precious and that life is a gift.   I believe that as Members of Congress and, really, as all citizens,  we are called to protect the vulnerable, and this is one of my core  beliefs. Being pro-life means not just pro-birth but being interested  in the welfare of the child during his or her entire formative years.   That is why I am not only a longtime member of the Pro-Life Caucus  but also the co-chair of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank this  administration for the work they have done to defend the unborn,  including changing the rules for title 10 and expanding the Mexico City  policy. I look forward to continuing to work with the administration on  these issues as we come to the time of January when we remember the  ruling on Roe v. Wade.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the day when there are no more  abortions because there are no more unwanted children.                            ____________________
