 Madam Speaker, the War Powers Resolution simply requires  the President to consult with the Congress and with the American public  before going to war with Iran.   Our constituents held their breath on Tuesday. Thankfully, no lives  were lost in Iran's retaliatory attack, but serious concerns remain  about the rationale and the ramifications.   We do not mourn the loss of Qasem Soleimani. He was responsible for  actions that harmed and killed American personnel and allies, and I  condemn that. But any U.S. military action, especially one that could  spark catastrophic consequences, needs to be carefully considered,  fully justified within the law.   President Trump failed to consult the Congress, failed to secure  specific authorization, failed to cite with specificity the imminent  threat. In a classified briefing for Members of Congress, the  administration would not, could not provide any specifics about what  constituted an imminent threat. They couldn't tell us what the targets  were, nor would they divulge any of the timelines for the attack.   It is unprecedented the level at which this administration is seeking  to obscure the facts from the Congress and the American people. The  rationale is in doubt, the ramifications as well: The U.S. announced it  will suspend our fight against ISIS; Iraq's Prime Minister and the  legislature moved to expel our troops; the Iranian leaders announced  they would no longer abide by the 2015 nuclear deal.   President Trump's actions have dramatically increased the possibility  of war with Iran and Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Today, America  and our allies are less safe as a result of the administration's  actions.    Let us reassert the Congress' role to ensure that the  President--any President--is complying with the law and is not  conducting lengthy military actions without congressional approval.   Let us prevent another unnecessary war. Let us vote for this rule and  this resolution.
