 Fighting.         Every day I am in the United States Senate, I       will fight.         Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.    I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Send it to the desk.   The Senator from Georgia, Senator Warnock, has a question for the  House Managers.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Is it true or false that in the months leading up to       January 6th, dozens of courts, including State and Federal       courts in Georgia, rejected President Trump's campaign's       efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House manager is recognized for 5  minutes.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, Senators, that is true. That is  true.   I want to be clear, though, that we have absolutely no problem with  President Trump having pursued his belief that the election was being  stolen or that there was fraud or corruption or unconstitutionality. We  have no problem at all with him going to court to do it and he did and  he lost in 61 straight cases. In Federal court and State court, in the  lowest courts in the land, in the U.S. Supreme Court, he lost it.   He lost in courts in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan,  Minnesota, Nevada, and Wisconsin. All of them said the same thing; they  couldn't find any corruption; they couldn't find any fraud, certainly  nothing rising to a material level that would alter the outcome of any  of the elections; and there was no unconstitutionality. That is the  American system.   So, I mean, it is hard to imagine him having gotten more due process  than that in pursuing what has come to be known popularly as the big  lie, the idea that somehow the election was being stolen from him. We  have no problem with the fact that he went to court to do all those  things.   But notice, No. 1, the big lie was refuted, devastated, and  demolished in Federal and State courts across the land, including by  eight judges appointed by President Donald Trump himself.   We quoted earlier in the case what happened in Pennsylvania, where  U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Brann said: In the United States,  this can--that         This Court has been presented with strained legal arguments       without merit and speculative accusations . . .        In the [United States of America], this cannot justify the       disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the       voters of its sixth most populated state. Our people, laws,       and institutions demand more.    Then it went up to Judge Stephanos Bibas, who is a Trump appointee,  who is part of the appeals court panel. He said:         The Campaign's claims have no merit. The number of ballots       it specifically challenges is far smaller than the [roughly]       81,000-vote margin of victory. And it never claims fraud or       that any votes were cast by illegal voters. Plus, tossing out       millions of mail-in ballots would be drastic and       unprecedented, disenfranchising a huge swath of the       electorate and upsetting all down-ballot races too.    Which, incidentally, they weren't being challenged, even though it  was the exact same ballot that had been brought.   So the problem was when the President went from his traditional  combat, which was fine, to intimidating and bullying State election  officials and State legislators, and then finally, as Representative  Cheney said, summoning a mob, assembling a mob, and then lighting the  match for an insurrection against the Union.   When he crossed over from nonviolent means, no matter how ridiculous  or absurd--that is fine. He is exercising his rights--to inciting  violence, that is what this trial is about   We heard very little of that from the presentation of the President's  lawyers. They really didn't address the facts of the case at all. There  were a couple of propaganda reels about Democratic politicians that  would be excluded in any court in the land. They talked about the Rules  of Evidence. All of that was totally irrelevant to the case before us.  Whatever you think about it, it is irrelevant, and we will be happy, of  course, to address the First Amendment argument too.
