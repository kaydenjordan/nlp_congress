 I ask for yeas and nays.    Madam President, article II, section 2, clause 2 of the  Constitution provides that the President ``shall nominate, and by and  with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . judges  of the Supreme Court.''   One of the most important constitutional responsibilities I have as a  Senator is to provide advice and consent on a President's Supreme Court  nominee. A new Justice is someone who could serve for a generation or  more and have a profound impact on the lives of all Americans for  decades to come.   Recently, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer announced that he  would step down once the Senate confirms his successor. In his remarks,  while reflecting on what he learned during his nearly three decades on  the High Court, he said:         This is a complicated country. There are more than 330       million people, and my mother used to say it's every race,       it's every religion--and she would emphasize this--and it's       every point of view possible.    Justice Breyer has built a reputation and cemented a legacy as a  champion of civil rights and fought to protect American consumers and  our very democratic system of government from the attempts to undermine  our campaign finance system and weaken the sacred franchise of the  right to vote. His thoughtful scholarship on the importance of  safeguarding human rights and respecting international law will  continue to influence democratic governments around the world for years  to come.   When I think about a successor to Justice Breyer, I want to see  someone who can serve as a strong and thoughtful presence on a Court  that is tasked with some of the most complicated legal problems and  questions in our Nation. Each new Justice is someone who could serve  for a generation or more and have a profound impact on the lives of all  Americans for decades to come.   The Supreme Court will make decisions on a broad range of issues,  such as voting rights, healthcare, women's reproductive freedoms, equal  rights for women, climate change policy, gun safety, campaign finance,  civil rights issues, and so much more. A nominee should represent the  values of our Constitution in such a way that allows us to expand, not  restrict, the civil rights of all Americans and keep powerful special  interests and corporations in check.   The U.S. Constitution is not a perfect document, but its authors  designed a system of government around the rule of law and protection  from abuses of power. Abuses could come from special interests or the  government itself. Our Constitution created the Supreme Court of the  United States as the protector of our constitutional rights.   A Justice should have a healthy respect for the separation of powers  and checks and balances in our constitutional system. A nominee should  strive to safeguard the independence of the judiciary and protect the  prerogatives of each branch of government, including Congress and its  duly-enacted laws. A strong nominee must be respectful of the diversity  of the American experience and live up to his or her constitutional  oath to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States, as well  as their judicial oath to ``administer justice without respect to  persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''    Thus far, 115 Justices have served in our Nation's history, including  Baltimore's own Thurgood Marshall, who was the first Black Supreme  Court Justice. It is long past time to improve diversity on our  Nation's Court, which promises ``equal justice under the law'' to all  those who enter its hollowed chambers. The Supreme Court and its  Justices should look more like the America it serves in both its  demographic and professional diversity.   Madam President, I know you are aware that of the 115 Justices who  have served throughout the history of the United States on the Supreme  Court, 108 of those 115 are White males. We need greater diversity in  our courts, and we need greater diversity on the Supreme Court of the  United States.   In Maryland, for years, I have worked diligently when vacancies arise  to recommend highly qualified lawyers to the President who will better  diversify our Federal bench. Our Federal district court in Maryland  consists of 10 active district court judges who sit in Baltimore and  Greenbelt. I am proud that our court reflects the breadth and depth of  the demographic and professional diversity in Maryland, including the  first Black woman to serve as a Federal judge in Maryland and the first  Asian-American Federal judge in Maryland.   Half of the active district judges in our State are now women. I  chuckle when I recall the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader  Ginsburg's comment on how many women should be on the Supreme Court, as  she was only the second female Justice in the Court's history. This is  her quote:         When I'm sometimes asked `When will there be enough [women       on the Supreme Court]?' and I say `When there are nine,'       people are shocked. But there'd been nine men, and nobody's       [even] raised a question about that.    Our Federal judges in Maryland come from a wide variety of legal  backgrounds, including having served as prosecutors, public defenders,  private law firm attorneys, and judges in other courts. Maryland now  has its first Black U.S. attorney in our State's history, whom I was  pleased, along with Senator Van Hollen, to recommend to President Biden  and who was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.   I believe that a more diverse court and justice system inspires the  confidence of Marylanders who seek their day in court and want to be  treated fairly, with dignity and respect.   I am confident that the Senate, under the leadership of Majority  Leader Schumer and Judiciary Chair Durbin, will conduct a fair hearing,  vetting, and confirmation process for President Biden's eventual pick  to replace Justice Breyer.   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate over the  coming months to give full and fair consideration to President Biden's  nominee to replace Justice Breyer in order to fill the upcoming vacancy  on the Supreme Court. I am hopeful the American people will be proud of  the process that unfolds in the Senate as they watch and learn more  about the Constitution and the three branches of government that  interact in this unique process to select the next Justice who will  dispense justice on the highest Court in our land.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
