 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate our immigrants'  heritage. Over one-third of north Texans in the Dallas-Fort Worth area  were born outside of the United States. They live and work in my  district: Hondurans in South Irving, Somalians in Stop Six, Mexican  nationals in Oak Cliff.   Whether they are from Jalisco to Tijuana, El Salvador to Nigeria,  they are our fellow Texans.   Across the metroplex, they fulfill their own version of the American  Dream as teachers in classrooms, engineers who design defense  equipment, doctors who care for our families, and soldiers who protect  our Nation. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, they are fulfilling a lot of  jobs in agriculture and construction and other areas that are simply  hard to fill and cannot be filled at home by native-born Americans.   This administration is attempting to abolish their patriotism and  demoralize their American spirit, but we can't let them win.   We need to heal the distrust and fear that comes from talks of border  walls, and instead, build community ties that can withstand. Let's  start with the protection of our Active Duty servicemembers and  veterans. Let's celebrate our immigrants' heritage this month by  honoring our country's legacy as a Nation of immigrants.   Let's pass a clean Dream Act now.                            ____________________
