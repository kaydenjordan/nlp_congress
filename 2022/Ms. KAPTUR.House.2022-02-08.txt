 Mr. Speaker, energy security for the free world is an  imperative. I rise today to strongly endorse President Biden's vow  yesterday that if Russia further invades Ukraine, there will, ``no  longer be a Nord Stream 2 pipeline across Europe. We will put an end to  it.''   During the Trump administration, this Russian energy pipeline was  allowed to creep ever closer into the heart of Europe to make our  closest NATO allies dependent on Russian gas. What a strategic failure.   Reliance on a tyrannical regime is dangerous. To our dear allies in  Europe, if Putin were to succeed in clawing Ukraine back under Russia's  command, he would not stop there.   The free world must place stronger sanctions on Nord Stream 2. It  must ratchet up diplomat engagement to this strongest test of the rule  of law since World War II. As Russian troops amass at Ukraine's border,  the free world must deploy the defensive shield to protect her liberty  and assure her territorial sovereignty through a coalition of the  willing.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  bipartisan United States Postal Service and Postal Service Reform bill.   By eliminating the unnecessary and harmful mandate to prefund retiree  benefits, and preserving 6-day delivery, we are investing in our  hardworking postal workers and safeguarding this vital American  service.   For more than 200 years, the United States Postal Service has  delivered to households and businesses in every community on every  block in every State of our great Nation. What an American enterprise.   Through rain, sleet, and snow, hundreds of thousands of postal  workers serve America every single day, making sure we all remain  connected.   I was a carrier; I know, too.   The United States Postal Service is foundational to our American way  of life. It is incumbent upon Congress to support this cherished and  essential institution for all the generations to come.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the Postal Service Reform  bill and vote for the United States Postal Service.   I thank all those who labored for so many years to bring this to the  floor. Congratulations to you and to America.    Madam Speaker, I express sincere appreciation to our  extremely able chair, Rosa DeLauro, for working so hard, along with our  able ranking member, Kay Granger, on the bipartisan effort, the latest  short-term continuing resolution before us.   Congress holds a bipartisan responsibility to pass a full-year  appropriations package, and I guarantee you if the people on this floor  were the ones totally in charge, we would have done it.   These appropriations bills deliver the services the American people  need and deserve, everything from the defense of our Nation to funding  vital health services and tending to our national parks.   As chair of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, our  fiscal year 2022 bill will continue the progress of the bipartisan jobs  and infrastructure bill.   The bill will invest in clean energy technology. It will bolster the  Army Corps of Engineers' ability to protect our majestic rivers, lakes,  and coastlines, and improve our dams and shipping lanes.   What America makes, builds, and grows makes, builds, and grows  America. These energy and water investments will create good-paying  jobs for hardworking men and women across our land.   Too many of these projects are languishing on the sidelines, waiting  for these two bodies to do their job. We cannot meet America's  objectives if we don't pass these appropriations bills.   As we make progress on passing these bills, we have before us now a  continuing resolution that will allow our Federal Government to  continue operating until a final agreement is achieved. This is a must- pass bill.   I respectfully ask all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this  necessary legislation and let us continue the work to build our country  forward by investing in the American people who sent us here to do  their work.
