 Mr. Speaker, today I rise for my constituent, Allie,  because we should not be playing politics in Congress with women's  health choices and with the family decisionmaking rights of all  Americans.   Last spring, Allie and her husband were thrilled to learn that she  was pregnant with their second child. A few months later, they found  themselves heartbroken in a doctor's office in order to terminate a  pregnancy that they had so badly wanted.   Everything had gone smoothly until about 12 weeks, when a routine  test returned with extremely abnormal results. Allie and her husband  hoped for the best and waited several more weeks until they could  perform an amnio.   Sadly, the results of the amnio were unbearable. They found that the  fetus had grown from a compromised cell line. There were multiple  genetic anomalies that would result if the pregnancy continued to term  in a child with extraordinarily grave and untreatable physical,  cognitive, and developmental problems.   The news was crushing and the decision was agonizing, but Allie knew  the path forward for her family was clear. She would become part of the  tiny group of women having abortions after 20 weeks, less than 2  percent of all abortions.   But Allie's story doesn't end with the decision that she and her  husband made. Because she is a Federal employee, the Hyde amendment  prevented her insurance from covering her abortion services.  Fortunately, Maryland is a State where we respect women's choices, and  Allie was able to go to a clinic and she paid $900 out of pocket.   Allie recovered quickly from the procedure and she was able to get  pregnant shortly thereafter. This summer, Allie and her husband were  thrilled to welcome a beloved second child into their family.   Mr. Speaker, Allie has one thing to say to lawmakers here today: We  made the choices that are best for our family, and I trust all women to  do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
