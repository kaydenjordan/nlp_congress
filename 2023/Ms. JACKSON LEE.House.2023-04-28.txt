 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition of H.J. Res. 39-- Disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Commerce relating  to ``Procedures Covering Suspension of Liquidation, Duties and  Estimated Duties in Accord with Presidential Proclamation 10414''.   This joint resolution nullifies a final rule submitted by the  Department of Commerce and was published on September 16, 2022.   H.J. Res. 39 permitted the suspension of tariffs on specific solar  panels, also known as crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and  modules.   The regulation specifically applied to solar panels made in Cambodia,  Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam using parts and components made in China  that are not previously covered by an antidumping or countervailing  duty order.   Orders for antidumping and countervailing duties are put in place to  combat unfair trade practices, such as when a foreign government gives  domestic companies subsidies to give them an economic advantage over  competitors from abroad.   The restriction that was repealed served to relieve businesses who  import solar panels from these nations and make use of Chinese-made  parts and components that are exempt from such orders.   By placing large and potentially retroactive duties on some imported  solar panels, H.J. Res. 39 would obstruct the supply of solar products  to the United States.   President Biden declared an energy emergency on June 6, 2022, to  guarantee consistent and inexpensive access to renewable energy.   Following that, the Department of Commerce published a rule to  establish a temporary, 24-month freeze on the collection of specific  tariffs on solar cells or modules.   The U.S. solar industry was given the opportunity and time to realign  supply chains away from China due to this rule and the new domestic  manufacturing incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.   Without a temporary bridge, the price of solar installations will  rise dramatically, and less solar project development will be planned.   The shift to clean energy will lead to an increase in employment,  manufacturing, and wages here in the United States.   The Inflation Reduction Act represents the single biggest investment  in clean energy in American history.   The IRA is starting the nation on the road to sustainable,  responsible energy independence.   Additionally, approximately 100,000 jobs for American mechanics,  electricians, construction workers, technicians, support personnel, and  other professionals have been created as a result of the green tax  credits in the IRA.   Ninety new sustainable energy projects have been announced in 31  states in the first half of the year of the law.   Manufacturing facilities for batteries, electric vehicles, and wind  and solar energy systems are among these initiatives.   The move by President Biden is a one-time fix to realign American  supply lines.   Initiating high, retroactive tariffs right away, harming solar  growth, raising energy prices, and reducing supply at a time when we  need to ramp up would be the results of ending the President's interim  suspension.   By 2030, carbon emissions are expected to be reduced by 40 percent  thanks to the clean energy credits provided by the Inflation Reduction  Act, providing us a real chance to achieve the Paris Climate  Agreement's objectives.  [[Page H2102]]    The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which will make  unprecedented investments in American workers, communities, and  businesses, was signed into law by President Biden last August.   The CHIPS Act will improve American semiconductor development,  research, and manufacturing, among other things.   The CHIPS Act forbids recipients of funds from increasing chip  manufacture in China and other nations that are legally deemed to pose  a threat to American national security.   These historic policies, along with the CHIPS Act and the Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law, have encouraged businesses to invest more than $200  billion in American manufacturing.   According to Uyghur Human Rights Project (UGRP), a rise in solar  imports from Chinese solar manufacturers--regardless of whether such  imports come from China or Chinese-controlled facilities in Southeast  Asia--directly encourages the Chinese solar industry's use of Uyghur  forced labor.   According to UHRP, imports of solar cells and modules from Cambodia,  Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam have increased by 69 percent during  2019.   In addition, UHRP argues that it is intolerable to think that the  United States should rely on goods produced by filthy ``coal plants and  China's genocidal forced-labor inputs'' to sustain the transition to  renewable energy.   Priorities for the environment and a commitment to uphold human  rights must go hand in hand.   As a member of the House renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency  Caucus, I strongly oppose H.J. Res. 39 because it will harm solar  growth and raise energy prices.   I strongly urge all my colleagues to come in stand in the opposition  of H.J. Res. 39, because it is the Republicans' effort to roll back the  Inflation Act. We should stop these attempts to undermine our hard- earned win.    Mr. Speaker, as we approach the month of May, I  remind everyone that we honor our mothers of this Nation--mothers who  have nourished, calmed, encouraged, celebrated, cheered; those who have  made their way in life; mothers who have had difficult times,  challenges, yet continue to be there. I honor mothers who are taking  care of children who are not their own.   In this month of May, I will select mothers from my congressional  district and some from around the Nation to honor and thank them for  what they do.   That is why, as well, I voted against the draconian Republican budget  that wanted to cut SNAP, supplemental nutrition, to help our children;  wanted to cut veteran benefits for women veterans who are in desperate  need; and wanted to again squash women's rights and reproductive  rights.   Mothers are, in fact, the anchor of this Nation. I celebrate them and  will celebrate them this coming month with cheer, applause,  recognition, and honor.                            ____________________
