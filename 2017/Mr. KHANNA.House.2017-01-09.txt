 Mr. Speaker, I am the son of immigrants, born in  Philadelphia as the Nation celebrated our bicentennial. I ran for  Congress because we have lost sight of our founding ideals. In  Federalist 10, James Madison warned that factions, with their own  special interests, may undermine the public good.   Today, Congress is crippled by these factions: powerful PACs and  lobbyists. This must change. I am proud to be one of six Members who  refuse all contributions from PACs, and we need a bipartisan caucus to  eradicate their influence.   We also cannot let congressional seats become feudal estates. The  turnover rate here in the people's House is less than European  monarchies. Congress desperately needs a 12-year term limit like there  is in the California legislature.   Mr. Speaker, banning PAC money and instituting term limits are  necessary steps to restore our democracy.                            ____________________
