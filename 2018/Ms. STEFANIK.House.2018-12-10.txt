 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Roe for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, my legislation included in this package gives all  military spouses, regardless of which State they married in, the choice  to establish the same State of residency as the servicemember for both  voting and tax purposes.   As the proud representative of Fort Drum and the Navy nuclear site at  Kesselring, I understand the challenges military families face and the  sacrifices these families make to help protect our Nation and safeguard  our freedoms.   Military families are constantly relocating to meet the needs of the  military. They sacrifice so much during these relocations, uprooting  their lives and disrupting their families. This is often a very  difficult and trying time, with the heaviest burden falling upon  [[Page H9802]]  military spouses, who serve as a critical support system for their  loved ones   Current law allows Active Duty servicemembers to maintain one State  of legal residence for tax and voting purposes even when those  servicemembers receive military orders requiring them to relocate, but  this does not apply evenly to spouses. Spouses are forced to establish  residency every time the servicemember receives a new assignment,  adding additional stress to families as they manage these relocations  and seek new employment.   My legislation, the Military Residency Choice Act, fixes this  inconsistency to better ease these trying transitions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Roe for his leadership, Ranking Member Walz,  as well as Chairman-elect Takano.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill on a  bipartisan basis.
