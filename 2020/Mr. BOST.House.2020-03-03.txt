 Mr. Speaker, every parent's worst nightmare is to learn  that their children's school may be one of the sites of mass violence.  Schools should not be a place where our kids have to fear, it should be  where they learn, and grow, and follow their dreams.   No child should have to be more concerned about their safety than  they are about their science project, band concert, or basketball game.   That is why last year, I and many others introduced the Securing Our  Schools Act in the last Congress, passed it on to the President, and it  was signed into law.   I was proud that our bipartisan bill passed the House and Senate and  was signed into law by the President. The new law creates a Federal  grant program for local communities to improve security in their  schools.   School districts and law enforcement can use these critical funds to  purchase life-saving technology, panic alert systems, communications  equipment, cameras, door locks, or to better train authorities when  incidents of violence might occur.   Last year, $33 million in grants were allocated to 103 school  districts nationwide, making four million students safer. The  application process is now open for grants for the 2021 fiscal year.   Please urge local officials, those in your district to visit  cops.doj.gov for more information on how to apply for up to $500,000 in  grants through the School Violence Prevention Program. Once again, that  is cops.doj.gov.  [[Page H1442]]    The application deadline for this fiscal year is April 8. Please  reach out to your community, community leaders, law enforcement, and  local school districts.   We have advanced safety technology in banks, office buildings, and  retail locations. There is no reason we shouldn't have this technology  at all of our schools to protect all of our children.                            ____________________
