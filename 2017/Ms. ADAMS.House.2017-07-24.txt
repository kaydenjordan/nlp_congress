 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, small businesses are the backbone of our economy. This  is particularly true in my home State of North Carolina. According to a  recent report, North Carolina is the number one State in the country  for starting a small business. As such, I will support programs that  allow them to flourish.   Today, as vice ranking member of the Small Business Committee, I rise  to express my full support for H.R. 2364, the Investing in Main Street  Act.   The number one concern raised by small businesses is the lack of  access to capital; and because of this access problem, small businesses  tend to rely more on personal credit cards, often with higher interest  rates, than on more affordable small business loans.   The Investing in Main Street Act helps free up affordable capital,  and this bill increases access to capital for small businesses by  raising the percentage capital banks and savings associations may  invest in small businesses up to 15 percent. With increased  opportunity, entrepreneurs will be able to grow and expand their  businesses as well as hire more employees, allowing them to reach their  full potential.   The Investing in Main Street Act is good for business, it is good for  small business, and it is good for our economy.   I want to thank Chairman Chabot and Ranking Member Velazquez and all  of my colleagues for supporting this bill, and I urge my colleagues to  support this bill as we may continue to give small businesses  opportunities to thrive and employ American workers.
