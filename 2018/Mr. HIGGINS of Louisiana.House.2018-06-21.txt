 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act of 2018. I am a cosponsor  of this legislation. I remind all of my colleagues that a sovereign  nation cannot stand without sovereign borders.   I remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we are  Representatives of citizens of the 50 sovereign  [[Page H5430]]  States of America. We have not been elected by citizens of Mexico or  Nicaragua or El Salvador.   We represent American interests. This is an America-first bill that  secures America's southern border.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to embrace their oath and to  recognize their service to these citizens that depend upon sound,  decisive measures from this body.
