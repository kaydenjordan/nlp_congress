 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the United  Way of Central Massachusetts as they celebrate their 100th birthday  this month and to thank the incredible staff, interns, fellows,  volunteers, and community partners who allow this amazing institution  to make a difference for so many people.   When I think of organizations that change lives, organizations that  mobilize and unite our community to inspire change and create a better  world, organizations that look out for the least among us by giving  families the tools and stability they need to break the cycle of  poverty and get back on their feet, I think of the United Way of  Central Massachusetts.   I am so proud and grateful for the work they do every day and the  positive impact they have on the folks I am privileged to represent.   On behalf of my constituents and with thanks from the entire United  States Congress, congratulations to the United Way of Central  Massachusetts for a century of awe-inspiring work, and here is to many  more.                            ____________________
