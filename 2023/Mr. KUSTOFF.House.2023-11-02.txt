 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her leadership  and bringing this crucial security package that provides much-needed  aid and support for Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East.   Israel has every right to defend herself from terrorists who have  brutally murdered over 1,400 men, women, and children. As I stand here  today, I quote Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu: ``If the Arabs lay  down their arms there will be no more war, but if Israel lays down its  weapons there would be no more Israel.''   It is essential that we demonstrate our unwavering support for the  State of Israel.   I urge my colleagues strongly to support this package that is so  crucial for our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel.
