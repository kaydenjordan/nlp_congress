 Mr. Speaker, this is  opioids week, yet we are not considering any bill that would rein in  the pharmaceutical companies, whose greed caused and perpetuated the  epidemic.   Many of these companies have used unethical and illegal practices to  generate record-setting profits. They have bribed doctors, lied to  patients about the effects of opioids, and ignored millions of  illegally trafficked pills. Meanwhile, the costs of the epidemic fall  on States, cities, counties, hospitals, courts, and local communities  that do not have the resources to keep up.   I have introduced legislation that would make pharmaceutical  companies part of the solution by imposing a small 1-cent fee on opioid  production. The estimated $2 billion in revenue raised could be used to  fund a variety of prevention, treatment, and research programs that  would save countless lives.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to finally hold these companies accountable  for their role in the opioid epidemic and make them give back to the  communities and families that have been destroyed.                            ____________________
