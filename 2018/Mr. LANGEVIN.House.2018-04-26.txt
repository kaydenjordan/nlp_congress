 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the en bloc package, which  includes my amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act relating to air  passengers with disabilities. I also want to thank the chairman and  ranking member for including an air passengers with disabilities bill  of rights in the manager's amendment.   The Air Carrier Access Act was enacted in 1986 to prohibit  discrimination based on disability in air travel. Despite progress,  travelers with disabilities still encounter significant barriers. My  amendment requires the Secretary of Transportation to review and, if  necessary, revise regulations issued under the act. In particular, it  focuses on providing timelier and more effective assistance to people  with disabilities, including by improving hands-on training for airline  personnel.   Inadequate assistance for people with disabilities can lead to  unacceptable delays, missed flights, and even passenger injuries. We  can and must do better. Mr. Chairman, I have traveled all over the  world, and I have dealt with those airlines who do things the right way  and treat people with disabilities with respect and have good processes  in place and other airlines that need more improvement and need to work  harder at this.   These amendments and this bill will help us to get there. I thank the  chairman and the ranking member for their hard work.
