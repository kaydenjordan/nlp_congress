 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago this week we left Congress early  because of COVID-19. Since then our entire way of life has been upended  with the worst pandemic in a century, where at times we weren't taming  this COVID tiger, we were just riding it.   Yet, despite that rough ride, we did our job in Congress with five  massive relief bills that kept the economy afloat, the poverty rate  flat, and put us in the position where right now we are neck and neck  in this race between injections and infections.   Yet my colleagues on the other side want to slow us down by voting  ``no,'' claiming process or price or pork or politics.   Well, I support the American Rescue Plan, not just because we need to  speed up our response but because this bill is about people; their  health, their vaccines, their jobs, their businesses, their local  governments, and getting our kids back to school safely.   So let's do our job. Let's defeat this disease. Let's win this race  by voting ``yes'' on the American Rescue Plan.
