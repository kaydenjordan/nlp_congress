 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the shipyard  workers and park rangers and VA nurses, Forest Service land managers,  and all of our Federal workers. These are men and women who work every  day to protect our Nation's security and offer vital services and grow  our economy.   These men and women dedicate their working lives to the betterment of  our Nation, and, sadly, just a few days ago, the President froze the  pay and locality adjustments for these Federal workers.   The President has boasted that the economy is great. These workers  have certainly seen their costs rise. Their housing costs are rising,  and other expenses are rising.   But do you know what won't rise? Their pay. And now the President is  threatening a shutdown of the government again, raising the specter of  furloughing these workers again.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to reject the notion that the problem  with government is the people who work in government, and I urge my  colleagues to work together to fund the government, including the pay  for these hardworking men and women who are our neighbors.                            ____________________
