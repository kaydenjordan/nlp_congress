 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  supplemental funding bill. This funding bill is critical to the  panhandle of Florida as they recover, Mr. Speaker, from Hurricane  Michael.   Under T-HUD's jurisdiction, this bill allocates $2.4 billion for  CDBG-DR and $1.7 billion for highways. CDBG-DR is crucial to  communities to help with unmet housing, business, and infrastructure  needs.   More broadly, Mr. Speaker, this bill also addresses agricultural  needs, including for the timber industry that got hit so hard in north  Florida. It will also help rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base.   I am so proud of the work that we have done, and I want to also thank  my counterpart, the chairman of the subcommittee, Chairman Price, for  his hard work; also, Representative Neal Dunn of Florida, who has been  an advocate; as well as the appropriators from Florida on the  Appropriations Committee.   Mr. Speaker, lastly, I thank the chairwoman, Mrs. Lowey, and the  ranking member, Ms. Granger, for their continued leadership and help,  and I urge a ``yes'' vote.
