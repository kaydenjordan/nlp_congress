 Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to stand up to  one of the most dangerous nominees in President Trump's Cabinet of Big  Oil, big banks and big billionaires who are going to be populating the  Cabinet of the United States.   The Secretary of Education is responsible for a budget that includes  $36 billion for elementary and secondary education, $150 billion for  higher education each year. On top of that, the Secretary of Education  is responsible for more than $1.2 trillion in outstanding Federal  loans.   This nominee, Betsy DeVos, would shape the policies and programs that  affect more than 50 million students across our country. Young people  may be 16 percent of our population, but young people represent 100  percent of the future of the United States.   We need a Secretary of Education who believes that all children  deserve access to a quality public education, regardless of income,  race, ethnicity, neighborhood, or disability status. Betsy DeVos does  not share this commitment to equal opportunity, and she is unqualified  to serve as Secretary of Education.   Betsy DeVos has a long and well-documented record of opposing public  school systems. She has implemented school choice voucher programs. She  has simultaneously expanded and deregulated charter schools. In  Massachusetts, we recognize that education is a passport to the job  opportunities of the 21st century. Massachusetts students at the 4th,  8th, and 10th grades are No. 1 in America in math, verbal, and science.  We are No. 1 in math, verbal, and science, 4th, 8th, and 10th grades.  If Massachusetts were a country, we would be second behind Singapore in  reading for the whole planet. That is Massachusetts.   We have a very high percentage of our students who are minorities in  our home State. I live in Malden. Malden is a city of 60,000 people.  Malden High School, 2016 graduation class, 28 percent White, 25 percent  Asian, 24 percent Latino, 23 percent Black, 1 percent Pacific Islander.  What is our goal? Our goal in Malden--our goal in Massachusetts--is to  be No. 1. No. 1, not just in the United States but No. 1 in the world.  We know you can do it if you make a commitment to these kids.   It is not just our traditional public schools. It is our public  charter schools, our private schools, our preparatory schools that are  enormously successful. Many of them are world famous, these high  schools. People send their children from around the country to go to a  school in Massachusetts.   The success of our public charter schools is largely due to very  strong accountability measures brought about through State regulations  and rigorous oversight. That is the key to our charter school system.  It is accountability. It is oversight. It should not be draining money  out of the charter school system for profits for private corporations.  It has to be invested in the kids, but Betsy DeVos wants charter  schools to have less accountability and has fought to keep charter  schools unregulated across Michigan.   When the Michigan State Legislature introduced a bipartisan bill that  would have expanded oversight of charter schools, Betsy DeVos stepped  in. She and her family donated $1.45 million to State legislators in  order to strip the helpful oversight accountability language out of the  bill. That works out to $25,000 a day over the 7-week period the bill  was being debated. Betsy DeVos and her unlimited funding ultimately  succeeded in blocking the commonsense accountability legislation. The  students and families of Detroit were denied the key protections in  oversight that their schools needed.   Betsy DeVos's school choice priorities go beyond expanding and  deregulating charter schools. She has pushed for voucher programs that  would use taxpayer money, your money, to pay for a child's private  school tuition. Under a national voucher system, the funding that would  normally go to local school districts would instead be diverted away  from public schools toward for-profit, private institutions. In  addition to the private schools that benefit from a voucher system, 80  percent of the charter schools in Michigan are run by for-profit  companies, a much higher percentage than any other State. These  companies are focused first and foremost on making money. We don't  allow this to happen in Massachusetts. We have only one goal, and that  is to be No. 1.   That money must stay in the school system, especially if you are  trying to educate a minority population, which is the future workforce  of our country. That is key. They don't come from the traditional  backgrounds in many circumstances. The Secretary of Education must  fight for all children and families, not promote companies seeking to  profit off the backs of our students. Not even Michigan--the State  where DeVos and her family money have tried to exert the most influence  over education policy--has implemented a statewide voucher system.  Despite spending $5.6 million on a campaign to promote school vouchers,  the DeVos family failed to amend the Michigan State constitution. If  Betsy DeVos is allowed to expand her school choice policies across the  United States, it would be devastating for our students and for the  future of our country. Her ideas are too extreme. They will not work  for our students or for school districts in our Nation.   I also share serious doubts that Betsy DeVos will support all  students in America. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is  the primary Federal law that ensures that all students in every State  have access to a free and appropriate public education, regardless of  physical or mental handicaps, learning or attention disorders. This law  covers students who are blind, deaf, vocally or mobility impaired, and  those with autism or ADHD. Congress passed the original form of IDEA in  1975. It is a bedrock law in our country. Yet when Betsy DeVos was  asked about it during her nomination hearing before the HELP Committee,  she stated that States should be responsible for determining how, and  even if, to enforce IDEA.   Remember, IDEA goes right to the heart of what we are going to do for  those kids with disabilities. That is a bedrock law in our Nation.  States must abide by it. We need a Secretary of Education who  understands longstanding Federal education law and will commit to  protecting every student in America because every student deserves the  guarantee that they can and they will receive a free and appropriate  public education that is promised and protected by law.   If this laundry list of efforts to undermine public education wasn't  enough to cause skepticism about Betsy DeVos's qualifications to be  Secretary of Education, in her confirmation hearing, Betsy DeVos would  not commit to keeping guns out of our schools. Her response when asked  about the issue was: ``I think that is best left to locals and States  to decide.'' Guns do not belong anywhere near our schools or our  students and teachers, not in public or private schools, not in  elementary schools, and  [[Page S714]]  not in our high schools. I am proud to have stood with Senators Chris  Murphy and Richard Blumenthal on the floor of the Senate for 15 hours  calling for congressional action on commonsense gun safety legislation.  As a Senator, the safety and security of Massachusetts' schools,  neighborhoods, and communities are my top priority.   Our Secretary of Education has the safety of every student in every  State in his or her hands, and I do not believe Betsy DeVos is up to  that job. I do not stand alone in this conclusion that Betsy DeVos is  unfit to be Secretary of Education. I received tens of thousands of  letters and phone calls from constituents all across Massachusetts  urging me to reject her nomination. These come from teachers and  administrators, the people who work on these issues every day. I have a  letter here from Todd Simendinger, the principal of Rockport Elementary  School in Rockport, MA.   He wrote to me last week and said:         Senator Markey, as a strong supporter of public education,       I ask that you oppose the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as       Secretary of Education. We must have a secretary who can       commit to supporting every student in all public schools and       provide leadership that will help our neighborhood schools       succeed. Betsy DeVos's record in education and her       performance at the recent confirmation hearing prove that she       is the wrong candidate for the job. As a principal, I have       spoken with teachers, parents, students, and community       members who agree that America's future depends on a strong       investment in our Nation's public schools.    The offices of so many of my colleagues who have spoken on the floor  already have, like me, received these kinds of letters and messages  literally on a minute-by-minute basis from our constituents. Their  passion is born of a deep commitment to ensuring that the very best  education for all of the children of the Commonwealth can only be  provided if the standard for that education is high. I commend them,  and I agree with their concerns. All children deserve that standard.   So, from my perspective, you cannot have a more fundamental issue  before us, this privatization of the public school system in America,  the voucherization of our public school system in America. There is a  model. It is Massachusetts. We do it right now. We are No. 1 in the  country. We look over our shoulders at those who are behind us. But it  is a standard that basically says: We are going to invest in the public  schools and the charter schools. We are going to make sure they have  the highest possible standards.   That is a recipe for ensuring that every child, regardless of their  national nationality or their income, gets the education they need for  a portable passport to a global economy for the rest of their lives.  That has to be our goal. What is happening using the philosophy of  Betsy DeVos is a failure. It is a proven failure. We already see the  results. What is happening in Massachusetts, what happens in  implementing the standards of the laws that we already have on the  books across our country--it points us in the correct direction.   So with that, I urge a ``no'' vote on Betsy DeVos and her nomination  as Secretary of the Education Department.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, American history was made last night. The  New England Patriots won the Super Bowl. This triumvirate of Robert  Kraft, Bill Belichick, and Tom Brady continues this historic journey to  being recognized as the greatest single football team in the history of  the United States. Even as the Falcons were ahead by 25 points, even as  the rest of the country thought the game was over, we in Massachusetts,  we in New England, we have our own motto: In Belichick we trust. In  Brady we trust.   We knew it was not over. We knew there was still hope. We knew there  was a plan that could be implemented that would ensure that the  Patriots once again would prevail.   I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me this opportunity to be  recognized on this most important of all subjects. This incredible  Patriots victory has brought joy to people all across New England. It  has brought dismay to people in other parts of the country. They still  continue to be mystified by this incredible team and the incredible  leadership those three great leaders provide. But for us, we realize we  are in the presence of greatness. We know how spoiled we are to have  such a great team.   I just wanted to rise and congratulate the New England Patriots,  their leadership of Bob Kraft, Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, but all of  this team, because their motto is a very simple motto. It says: Do your  job. That is what every Patriot did last night. Because they stuck it  out through every single play, at the end of the day, they were able to  enjoy that historic victory.   For my part, I can't be more proud of any group of New Englanders. It  was just a fantastic victory. As a season ticket holder, when I was 19  years old, when it was seven games at $6 apiece--$42 as a season ticket  holder at Fenway Park. You can imagine how almost impossible it is to  believe that we have reached such a stage where even those who have  been critics of the Patriots now are forced to recognize that Bill  Belichick is the greatest coach of all time; Tom Brady is the greatest  quarterback of all time; and the Patriots, led by Robert Kraft, is the  greatest franchise of all time. We are very proud that victory last  night cemented that place in history.   Once again, I just want to congratulate each and every one of them  and especially the Patriots fans who, through thick and thin, have been  with that team every step of the way.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have heard from literally thousands of  my constituents who have contacted my office in unprecedented numbers  with  [[Page S937]]  fears about a Justice Department headed by Senator Jeff Sessions as  Attorney General of the United States.   My constituents and Americans all across the country are concerned  about the independence and integrity of the Justice Department under  President Donald Trump.   We are only 3 weeks into the Trump administration, and what we have  seen so far has been alarming. We have 3 years and 49 weeks left to go  in President Trump's term of office, and we have already seen in 3  weeks President Trump issue an illegal and immoral ban on Muslim  refugees. We then saw President Trump fire Acting Attorney General  Sally Yates from her job overseeing the Department of Justice--an  action reminiscent of Watergate's infamous ``Saturday Night  Massacre''--because she refused to defend in court his unconstitutional  and un-American Executive order.   Sally Yates's job and the job of the entire Justice Department is to  uphold the rule of law. The Attorney General of the United States is  the lawyer for the people of the United States--not Donald Trump's  personal lawyer. It is called the rule of law, not the rule of Trump,  but it is the rule of law that is at stake when the nomination of  Senator Sessions is in question to run the Department of Justice.   I have told my constituents that Senator Sessions must be judged  based on the totality of his record: as a U.S. attorney, as Alabama's  attorney general, and as U.S. Senator.   A review of that record, including 2 days of hearings before the  Senate Judiciary Committee, demonstrates anything but the commitment to  the equal and impartial administration of justice and an independence  from the President that we must demand from the Nation's top law  enforcement officer.   Senator Sessions' record spanning decades in public office reflects  hostility to important constitutional rights, hostility to laws  intended to protect people of color, hostility to laws intended to  protect women, hostility to laws intended to protect the LGBTQ  community, and hostility to laws intended to protect immigrants against  discrimination and violence.   Senator Sessions has fought against civil rights efforts. He has  fought against protecting voting rights, and as a U.S. attorney,  Sessions tried to prosecute three civil rights workers who were helping  elderly and disabled African-American voters to cast absentee ballots.   During his 1986 judicial nomination hearing, he called the Voting  Rights Act ``an intrusive piece of legislation.'' And in his testimony  to the Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions would not commit to  continue the Justice Department's efforts to challenge restrictive  State voter ID laws. Senator Sessions has fought against comprehensive  immigration reform, against criminal justice reform, and against  commonsense gun control measures.   As for a woman's right to choose, Senator Sessions has said: ``I  firmly believe that Roe v. Wade and its descendants represent one of  the worst, colossally erroneous Supreme Court decisions of all time.''  At his confirmation hearing, Senator Feinstein pressed him on his  statement, asking him whether it was still his view. ``It is,'' Senator  Sessions replied.   It is simply unimaginable that we would have an Attorney General of  the United States holding such a view of Roe v. Wade and the rights of  women to control their own reproductive health. Roe v. Wade is the law  of the land, and it should remain that way forever.   Mr. President, I would also like to address the actions last night by  the Senate majority leader to silence the remarks of my colleague from  Massachusetts, Senator Elizabeth Warren.   Coretta Scott King was attending the New England Conservatory of  Music in Boston when she met a divinity doctoral student at Boston  University in 1952, in Boston. One year later, Coretta Scott married  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as they took their degrees from Boston to  begin a cause found in the South that became a national and  international movement.   The two shared their life, a cause that would change the world. The  voices and legacy of Coretta Scott King and Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr., are as much a part of Massachusetts history as the American  Revolution, John Adams, and President John Kennedy.   What Senator Warren was doing last night was standing up for equal  justice the way Massachusetts has always stood up for equal justice,  the way Senator Ted Kennedy stood up for equal justice. We have a deep  and proud history in Massachusetts of fighting for what is right. The  abolitionist movement was born in Massachusetts.   In past generations, when young women wanted the right to vote, a  group of committed activists in Massachusetts formed the Suffragette  movement, and they changed the U.S. Constitution so women can vote.   When young people in Massachusetts were upset with the voting rights  laws for minorities in America's southern States, they became the  Freedom Riders, and they changed the laws of the United States.   I make these remarks from the desk once held by Massachusetts Senator  Edward Brooke. Senator Brooke was the first African American elected to  the Senate. He was a Republican. He was also a civil rights activist,  and he also received his law degree at Boston University, in  Massachusetts.   From the Founding Fathers to the movement for universal health care,  to the first same-sex wedding in the United States, and to the Senate  floor last night, Massachusetts has always been at the heart of  America's quest for equal justice.   Leader McConnell used an arcane Senate rule to silence Senator  Warren, but the people of Massachusetts and all people of good  conscience will never be silenced when confronted with our moral  responsibility to speak out.   Senator Warren deserves an apology for being silenced when she  attempted to share this very relevant, very powerful part of our  national history last night. The American people deserve to hear the  important words of Coretta Scott King. So here they are:         Dear Senator Thurmond:        I write to express my sincere opposition to the       confirmation of Jefferson B. Sessions as a federal district       court judge for the Southern District of Alabama. My       professional and personal roots in Alabama are deep and       lasting. Anyone who has used the power of his office as       United States Attorney to intimidate and chill the free       exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to       our courts. Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his       office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly       black voters. For this reprehensible conduct, he should not       be rewarded with a federal judgeship.        I regret that a long-standing commitment prevents me from       appearing in person to testify against this nominee. However,       I have attached a copy of my statement opposing Mr. Sessions'       confirmation and I request that my statement as well as this       letter be made a part of the hearing record.        I do sincerely urge you to oppose the confirmation of Mr.       Sessions.        Sincerely, Coretta Scott King    Coretta Scott King was right in the 1960s. Coretta Scott King was  right in 1986. Coretta Scott King is right today.   Based on the totality of Senator Sessions' record, I have no  confidence that he shares a commitment to justice for all Americans. I  do not believe he will fight to defend the most vulnerable in our  society. I do not believe he will stand up to President Trump when the  time comes, as it surely will come.   The great Robert F. Kennedy, a U.S. Attorney General himself, once  said ``that every community gets the kind of law enforcement it insists  on.''   We must insist that our top law enforcement officer upholds the law  for all Americans. I do not have assurance that Senator Sessions will  meet that challenge.   I will be voting no on Senator Sessions' nomination this evening, and  I urge all of my colleagues to do likewise.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
