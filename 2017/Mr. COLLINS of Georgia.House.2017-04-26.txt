 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of  World Intellectual Property Day.   Strong intellectual property protections are grounded in the  Constitution and have never been more critical to our economic success  and culture of innovation than they are today.   IP industries contribute more than $6 trillion to our economy  annually and support more than 45 million American jobs.   In my home State of Georgia, there are an estimated 1.9 million IP- related jobs that contribute $30 billion per year in manufacturing  exports.   IP protections undergird our economy by promoting competitiveness,  ensuring good-paying jobs, and rewarding ideas that have value.   In Georgia, which is now the third largest State for film production  in the Nation, as well as the home to software companies, ``payment  processor alley,'' musicians, and video game designers, strong  intellectual property rights mean that our State can continue to grow  and thrive.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to join me in recognizing  World IP Day and the importance of intellectual property protections at  home and abroad.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 275 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 275         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1695) to amend title 17, United States Code,       to provide additional responsibilities for the Register of       Copyrights, and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary now       printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an       original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-      minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-13. That       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered       as read. All points of order against that amendment in the       nature of a substitute are waived. No amendment to that       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order       except those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution. Each such amendment may be       offered only in the order printed in the report, may be       offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified       in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall       not be subject to a demand for division of the question in       the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of       order against such amendments are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a       separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the       Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amendment in the       nature of a substitute made in order as original text. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.        Sec. 2.  House Resolution 254 is laid on the table.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on House Resolution 275, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to bring  forward this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides  for consideration of H.R. 1695, the Register of Copyrights Selection  and Accountability Act of 2017.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the  chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The rule also  provides for a motion to recommit and makes in order amendments by  Representatives Deutch and Chu.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Ranking Member John  Conyers. Their testimony reflected the strong bipartisan support for  this legislation and the work both Members have invested in moving it  forward.   I personally thank Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, and  the Judiciary Committee staff on both the majority and minority side  for their work on this legislation.   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I had the opportunity to  participate in the committee markup where we debated numerous  amendments and enjoyed a thorough discussion of this bill. The  Judiciary Committee ultimately adopted an amendment by my colleague  from Texas, Congresswoman Jackson Lee, to strengthen the bill. H.R.  1695 passed the Judiciary Committee in a show of overwhelming  bipartisan support by a vote of 27-1.   The Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act is  supported by numerous outside groups, including the American  Conservative Union, SAG-AFTRA, the AFL-CIO, the Council for Citizens  Against Government Waste, CreativeFuture, the Motion Picture  Association of America, the Gospel Music Association, the American  Chemical Society, the Church Music Publishers Association, Oracle, and  many, many others. These groups represent only a sampling of the broad  support behind this bill.   Mr. Speaker, as you can tell, H.R. 1695 has brought together many  groups of people who don't traditionally have similar interests. From  creators to labor organizations to conservative groups, the diversity  of support behind this legislation speaks to its significance in the  copyright industry and to our economy as a whole.   H.R. 1695 also enjoys the public support of our two former Registers  of Copyright, individuals who filled the very position this bill seeks  to address. Former Registers Marybeth Peters and Ralph Oman have both  made clear their belief in the importance of an ``independent copyright  advice straight and true from the expert agency'' to Congress.   These former Registers correctly point out that this bill addresses a  ``structural, not personal or political'' issue between the Library of  Congress and the Copyright Office. Despite what some may say, this is  what the bill simply does.   H.R. 1695 is a necessary first step toward any larger efforts toward  modernizing the Copyright Office. It helps ensure that the Register can  implement policy and advise Congress effectively, and this legislation  will ultimately help strengthen our copyright system. This is  particularly relevant today, as today is World Intellectual Property  Day.   As I discussed earlier today in this Chamber, the importance of  strong IP protections, including a strong copyright system, is clearer  than ever. In fact, the copyright system in our country is so critical  that our Nation's Founders sought to recognize it in the Constitution.  Article I, section 8, clause 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the  power ``to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing  for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their  respective writings and discoveries.''   While robust intellectual property protections have always been a  foundational principle of our Nation, today such protections are also a  major economic driver creating and fueling the American Dream. In fact,  core copyright industries in the United States are now responsible for  $1.2 trillion in GDP, representing nearly 7 percent of our economy and  employing more than 5.5 million people. In my home State of Georgia  alone, more than 19,000 copyrights are registered annually to State  residents.   Yet the head of the Copyright Office, which oversees such a massive  sector of our economy, is unilaterally selected by the Librarian of  Congress. This is the case, despite the fact that the Copyright Office  is statutorily designed as Congress' adviser and the massive role that  copyright plays in our economy and our society.   I want to be clear. I think the role of the Library is a critical  one, and the Librarian performs many important duties. Historically,  however, the Librarian has not been an expert in copyright and isn't  expected to be, Mr. Speaker.   Does it make sense, then, to make the Librarian--any Librarian--to be  solely responsible for the selection of the person responsible for  overseeing the Nation's copyright policy? I don't think it does. In  fact, the current selection is more an accident of history than an  example of carefully conceived policy.   By way of historical background, in 1870, the Library of Congress  believed it would make sense for copyrighted works to be placed in the  Library as a means to grow the collection. While this made sense at  that point in history and while the collections are still an important  function of the Library, this provision neither requires nor justifies  the role of the Register of Copyrights to be subordinate to the  Librarian.    Today, with the major role that the Copyright Office plays in our  culture and our economy, we can no longer justify the head of the  Copyright Office--and Congress' designated expert adviser--being hired  under the umbrella of the Library of Congress. Currently, the Register  is hired according to the same unilateral process as much more junior  positions are filled. Under today's system, the Register can serve for  an unlimited duration without review or removal, despite the importance  of this position.   And finally, the Register is not Presidentially appointed, and there  have been questions in the courts regarding the authority of the  Copyright Office to conduct rulemaking.   We need a copyright system for the 21st century. We need a system  that will take us into the future by protecting and promoting  innovation. Copyright is the foundation of innovation, and innovation  is the force that drives our economy. A strong copyright system allows  the millions of kids and young adults throughout our 50 States to make  their dreams a reality, to build a career out of what they produce in  their minds and imaginations. Today's rule provides for an underlying  bill that will help ensure that our copyright system is equipped to  rise to the challenges of the future and to support Americans as they  strive to make their hopes, dreams, and ambitions into reality.   The underlying bill promotes American innovation by recognizing the  importance of the Register of Copyrights position. This bill would  create a selection committee composed by bipartisan, bicameral  congressional leadership and the Librarian of Congress to recommend  candidates to the President for nomination. The bill would establish a  Senate confirmation process for the position and establish a 10-year  term for the Register of Copyrights position.   This legislation represents the product of more than 4 years of  bipartisan collaboration. It reflects the consensus view that the  Copyright Office is better positioned to serve the public if the  Register is no longer treated like a subordinate official within the  Library, but as the seat of expertise and property protection that it  is, regardless of  [[Page H2862]]  who the Librarian or who the President may be.   To reiterate, this issue has been under discussion since before  anyone knew the former Librarian would be leaving or a new Librarian  would be taking over.                                time  1245    When these discussions began, there was a Democrat in the White  House, and it was clear that our next President would be, possibly, a  Democrat as well. Yet both Republicans and Democrats have supported the  reality that undergirds this bill, and we have supported what is good  for American innovation and our creators and our dreamers, rather than  worry about what specific President may make the next appointment to  this Office.   The legislation is the first step in the Judiciary Committee's work  to modernize the Copyright Office, which is now needed more than ever.  As the vice-chair of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee, I will  continue to push that effort forward, to look at ways to promote better  infrastructure and technology at the Copyright Office, and to work to  update our music licensing laws.   H.R. 1695 is the beginning, rather than the end, and our commitment  to copyright modernization and the support of these ideas underpinning  it continue to receive broad support.   The rule provides for a bill that is, simply put, good policy. The  opportunity before us is not about one individual but establishing the  right process for selecting the Copyright Register and future  Registers. The bill would increase accountability within the Copyright  Office and take the first steps toward making sure our Copyright Office  works for this century.   Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate that I thank the chairman of the  full Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte, and the ranking member, John  Conyers, for their hard work on this; and also a special commendation  to Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who sponsored an amendment that  actually strengthened this bill and provided a process moving forward  that will help and, I think, bring all parties some semblance of  structure and form as we move forward in this process, a beginning, as  I said, the first step in a modernization of our Copyright Office.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will have more time to discuss  especially the IG report and what it may say here in just a moment. I  yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn),  another strong advocate in our protections of copyright and others in  this intellectual property debate.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, this is about policy. This is about moving  forward in the modernization process. I believe that Ms. Hayden is  fully qualified to be Librarian of Congress. I think the issue comes in  the Copyright Register's Office, not the Librarian herself.   There are some issues also. It has been interesting because I have  been involved in this now my whole time in Congress, and this issue of  copyright protection and intellectual property, I have to say  Electronic Frontier Foundation are good folks, but we disagree, many of  us in the content community and also the intellectual property, with  the views of a more open or less inhibited copyright protection, which  we believe is the very heartbeat of the innovative system. It is  protecting the copyright as we go forward.   So just simply to have somebody saying that they are looking out for  the big guy, I am looking out for the single songwriter. I'm looking  out for the person right now in their home pecking out their first  novel, working on their first articles. These are the kinds of things  that need protecting. This is the little guy we are talking about. This  is making this modernization happen, and we are going to continue to  move forward.   We have differences of opinion. That is fine. But I think in looking  at this  [[Page H2864]]  big picture, we are talking about a Register's Office that has so much  work in our economy as a whole, we are just simply looking toward the  first step of modernization.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, thank goodness, hopefully, we  will get this rule passed and we will get to this bill so the gentleman  can be in support of it, that is as we move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Again, regardless of the last discussion, there are things about this  bill that I have talked about when we first started, and doing this  actually brings us into a position of modernizing the Copyright Office,  which has been discussed a long time.   I do want to address, just briefly, that there has been some  discussion about an IG report. There has been discussion about,  especially, the former Register of Copyrights.   As I made clear in the conference, this has nothing to do with that  being brought up. Implying things that were out of this IG report was  basically attempting a character assassination of the former Register  of Copyrights.   I think in doing so, it has to be understood that, even in that IG  report that is discussed, one of the Library's own responses back to  the concerns of the IG report was that, in 2015, the inspector general  found that the Copyright Office was compliant with all library  methodology. With respect to its primary software applications, the  Electronic Copyright Office and Copyright Imaging System, which support  registration and recordation functions and are managed by the CTO, were  all in compliance. I think that is really interesting as we look at  this.   But also what this IG report actually did say was that there were a  lot of other problems. In fact, the GAO report in 2015 said the Library  does not have the leadership to address IT management. That is why the  Copyright Office was having to look at this because, also, in August  2015, of the Library's poor response and modernization, which are  things that we are looking toward and how much this affects our  economy. Because of the Library's problems, the electronic licensing  system went down; and for 10 days, no one could register a copyright.    In fairness, you may not like this bill, you may not like the current  structure, and that is fine; but when we discuss the Library, there are  a lot of issues that I am sure will be addressed in the relevant  committees in their oversight on this IG report. That is what they are  designed to do.   What we are designed to do here is also not take and pick and choose  and cherry-pick what parts of the report we want to talk about because  we are trying to justify the current Librarian's decision last fall.  When we understand this, we will begin to move forward on the Copyright  Modernization Act.   Let's get back to the real functionality of what this is, not who we  appoint or how they are appointed, but the fact that this matters to  millions of people and also accounts for trillions of dollars in our  industries across the world.   The Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act is an  important and bipartisan step. I repeat again, it came out with a vote  of 27-1 in the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Speaker, I serve on that  committee. That is not a usual vote on legislation that is making a  positive, large, lasting impact that we are seeing on this. It is the  first step rather than the last step in modernization.   As we look forward to this, I will simply say this is a good bill. It  has been perfected by both Republicans and Democrats. As I have said  before, Sheila Jackson Lee, the Congresswoman from Texas, was very  helpful putting this package together, along with the chairman and  ranking member on both sides of the aisle, as we come forward with  this.   It is sort of a shame that, when we come to this bill, we diverge  into rabbit trails away from the real issue. The real issue is let's  help those folks who depend on the Copyright Office. Let's make  modernize it. Let's make it the tool it is supposed to be, and that is  the adviser of the expert in these issues for Congress. When we do so,  at that point in time our economy continues to flourish, we get aside  from the theatrics, and we get back to the real importance of the bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 275 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require       the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and       certain candidates for the office of the President, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and       Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 305.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend  [[Page H2867]]       the rule because the majority Member controlling the time       will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the       same result may be achieved by voting down the previous       question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous       question is defeated, control of the time passes to the       Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous       question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may       offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of       amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
