 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce that  a familiar figure within North Carolina's history will soon be featured  here in the United States Capitol.   On July 22, I came to the floor and spoke about how the first  Republican majority in the North Carolina legislature in over 40 years  voted in 2015 to replace the current statue of Charles Aycock in the  Capitol with a statue of Billy Graham. A week later, on July 29, a  committee within the North Carolina's General Assembly unanimously  approved a model of Reverend Graham's statue and commissioned a  sculptor to create a life-sized model.  [[Page H4432]]    The level of expediency in this process is a true testament to how  Reverend Graham was revered not only in North Carolina, but also across  the world. Recently, President Trump has expressed his support for a  statue of Reverend Graham to be commissioned, and he even suggested  that Reverend Graham would be memorialized in a new statuary park known  as the ``National Garden of American Heroes.''   Reverend Graham came from humble beginnings in Charlotte, North  Carolina, where he was raised on a dairy farm in the early 1920s.   During his lifetime, he counseled foreign dignitaries, numerous  Presidents, members of the Royal family, and many other significant  public figures.   However, his work was not solely consigned to the upper echelons of  government or politics. His life's work was dedicated to the millions  of people around the world who sought Jesus Christ as their one true  Lord and savior.   He once described being a Christian as, ``more than just an  instantaneous conversion. It is a daily process whereby you grow to be  more and more like Christ.''   In 2018, Reverend Graham passed away at the age of 99, and to say  that he left an indelible mark on society would be an understatement.  For years, I have advocated for Reverend Graham to have a place within  the hallowed Halls of the Capitol, and I am so pleased that the  millions of people who visit the Capitol every year will soon be able  to view his statue.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2574, the Equity  and Inclusion Enforcement Act.   My Republican and Democrat colleagues agree that separate is not and  never was equal; racism is wrong; segregation is wrong. I am going to  repeat that. My Republican and Democrat colleagues agree that  separation is not and never was equal; racism is wrong; segregation is  wrong. Although this body has taken measures to ensure racism and  segregation are not to be tolerated, its lingering effects still  persist.   We continue to strive toward a future where all students, regardless  of race or color, have the chance to succeed. While there is more work  to be done, the bill before us takes the wrong approach. This bill  seeks to create a private right of action for disparate impact claims  under section 602 of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI  protects federally funded programs and entities from discriminating on  the basis of race, color, or national origin.   While the Democrats will falsely characterize this bill as restoring  a right--and, indeed, my colleague has just done that--in reality this  bill radically alters civil rights law without giving any consideration  to its potential ramifications.   The leftist Center for American Progress called title VI and  disparate income impact claims the ``sleeping giant of civil rights  laws'' that are a ``potentially powerful tool'' to advance liberal  goals through activist litigation.   While title VI is most used in the context of education, the law  itself is not confined to that issue. Title VI applies to any program  or entity that receives Federal funding, which would include education,  policing, employment, and healthcare, the list goes on and on.   This is more than an education bill. Despite its far-reaching  implications, Democrats deprived the committee of primary jurisdiction  any opportunity to debate or consider this bill. That is a really  important point to consider, Madam Speaker.   As the Republican leader of the Education and Labor Committee, the  consequences of this legislation within the education community are  very clear. The creation of a private right of action would lead to  additional burdens on already taxed State and local agencies,  especially school systems who would have to defend themselves against  tenuous allegations advanced by parents and activists. Through such  lawsuits, these activists could require State and local governments to  adopt a myriad of policies that Congress and State and local lawmakers  never authorized or intended and cost those entities a lot of money  paid to trial lawyers.   H.R. 2574 also creates a new special assistant for equity and  inclusion at the Department of Education. Rather than create multiple  siloed positions competing for resources and attention, committee  Republicans believe an integrated approach to the Education  Department's equity and inclusion efforts would lead to better results.   Republicans and Democrats largely agree on the importance of equality  and integrated schools. Unfortunately, instead of working toward a  bipartisan solution, H.R. 2574 is the result of Democrats' choosing a  partisan path.   The question is whether in the long run these ideas will have helped  or hurt the ongoing effort to achieve greater equality for children.  H.R. 2574 fails on this front. Committee Republicans believe no effort  to erase the evil legacy of segregation and discrimination can be  complete without eliminating the State's ability to trap students in  low-performing schools.   Instead of debating this bill, we should look at bipartisan solutions  that help expand educational freedom for all families. We know that  school choice gives parents and families the opportunity to break the  cycle of poverty and enroll their child in an institution that  challenges them, develops their skills and intellect, and encourages  them to reach higher.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, our colleagues say that this administration is doing  nothing to help minority students. One of the biggest things that we  could do to help minority students is to give them a choice about where  to go to school. We talked about this yesterday, and we are talking  about it again today. Minority students thrive in charter schools.  Recent test scores show these students doing much better.   Our colleagues are saying that choice creates segregation. I don't  believe that, Madam Speaker. Choice creates the opportunity for  success, and we know that. The research shows that over and over again.  We can look at New York City and the results that Success Academy is  getting for the students there. They are primarily minority students-- but it is because minority parents are choosing to send their children  there--and they are succeeding. They are graduating at a very high  rate; they are going to college at a very high rate. So giving choice  to children of all races and all economic groups results in better  achievement. That cannot be denied.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I have before me some very, very excellent results in  terms of freedom of choice programs, and I would like to share those  with the body.   The largest private school choice program in America got more solid  evidence of its effectiveness Monday. The lower-income, mostly minority  students using the Florida tax credit scholarship to attend private  schools are up to 43 percent more likely to enroll in 4-year colleges  than White students in public schools and up to 20 percent more likely  to earn bachelor's degrees according to a new study released Monday by  the Urban Institute.   I don't think the Urban Institute is a conservative group.   The outcomes are even stronger for students who use the scholarship 4  or more years. Those students are up to 99 percent more likely to  attend a 4-year college than their public-school peers and up to 45  percent more likely to earn bachelor's degrees. The new findings build  on a 2017 study that was the first of its kind, but also more limited.   The previous study found scholarship students were more likely to  enroll in college and earn associate's degrees, but not significantly  more likely to earn 4-year degrees. However, the 2017 study included  only data from public colleges in Florida, and the researchers  cautioned that as a result our results may understate the true impact  of FTC participation on college enrollment and degree attainment.   Madam Speaker, this is solid evidence that having programs like the  Florida Student Scholarship Program is working for minority and low- income students. And I find it incredible that our colleagues  continually come out on the side of teacher unions, trial lawyers, and  others who want to see gains for themselves but no gains for the  children they should be serving.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1045     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume. I stated in my opening comments, Republicans do not  believe in segregation. Segregation was not good for this country. But  segregation was settled, we believe, despite what has been said by our  colleagues, by Brown v. Board of Education.   I find it very interesting that this bill is about a private right of  action and, yet, it has become the discussion about segregation and  about, again, Secretary DeVos and what she has or has not done. My  knowledge of the Secretary is that she has worked all her life to  expand opportunities for low-income and minority students. That is what  giving choice to those students and those parents is all about-- expanding opportunities for them to choose where to go to school. And  we even know that when we expand opportunities and we have school  choice, that even the public schools get better.   I just read statistics about what is happening in Florida, the  largest place for school choice and for scholarships for low income and  minority students to choose where they want to go to school. It shows  what a great gift that has been to them, and how poorly, unfortunately,  the students in the public schools are doing.   Consigning students to public schools and not giving them a choice is  not a good thing. It is totally unfair. But this bill is about a  private right of action, which the Supreme Court has said does not  exist in this legislation--the legislation that already exists.   What it is is a gift to trial lawyers. And the implication is, from  what we are hearing, is to go back to unequal opportunity. That is not  what we want for low-income and minority children, or any children in  this country.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, Democrats have made a habit of letting bipartisan  solutions fall by the wayside in lieu of partisan politics in an  attempt to help those who help them. The Equity and Inclusion  Enforcement Act is no exception. Republicans and Democrats agree on the  importance of equality and integrated schools. I am going to repeat  that again. Republicans and Democrats agree on the importance of  equality and integrated schools. Unfortunately, instead of working  toward a bipartisan solution, H.R. 2574 is the result of Democrats  choosing a partisan path.   The creation of a private right of action could lead to additional  burdens on school systems who would have to defend themselves against  tenuous allegations advanced by activist lawyers and does nothing to  eliminate the State's ability to track students in low-performing  schools.   This bill is designed to score political points rather than build on  a history of bipartisan and bicameral solutions to racial inequality  and discrimination.   For these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 2574, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    I am in its present form.    Madam Speaker, as you have heard  throughout this debate, Republicans agree that discrimination and  segregation are repugnant and immoral.   Unfortunately, this bill does nothing to address these problems.  Instead, Democrats are trying to sneak in a radical partisan rewrite of  civil rights law under the guise of an education bill. However, before  the House takes action on this legislation, we have one final  opportunity to address one particular flaw in this bill.   On September 11, 2019, President Trump issued an executive order  establishing the policy of the executive branch to consider  discrimination against Jews to be illegal discrimination under title VI  when such discrimination is based on an individual's race, color, or  national origin.  [[Page H4444]]    If this House is going to radically rewrite title VI, as this bill  does, we should use this opportunity to show commitment to combating  anti-Semitism.   With anti-Semitism on the rise around the world, the need for this  amendment is clear. In fact, here in the United States, we have seen  horrific acts of violence against our Jewish friends over the last few  years.   In October 2018, 11 congregants lost their lives at a synagogue in  Pittsburgh, the worst killing of Jews in American history. In December  of last year, a gunman targeted a Jewish kosher deli, leaving six dead.   This motion does one simple thing. The underlying bill requires  recipients of funding from the Department of Education to designate  title VI compliance coordinators. My motion inserts language into this  provision directing such compliance coordinators to consider anti- Semitism to be illegal discrimination on the basis of race, color, or  national origin under title VI.   Madam Speaker, we have an opportunity with this amendment to achieve  an important goal. We can ensure that recipients of Federal education  funding are doing all they can to protect members of our communities  from horrific anti-Semitism.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
