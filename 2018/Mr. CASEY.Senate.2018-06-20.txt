 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, I rise to address the issue that I know  folks in both parties of both Houses, and, of course, across the  country, are concerned about; that is, the issue of child separation at  the border.   This is, unfortunately, an issue that because there is so much  outrage, there is, in fact, substantial unity against the policy that  is in place right now. I am, like a lot of Americans, vehemently  opposed to the policy of what, in essence, amounts to ripping children  away from their parents. I, like a lot of Americans, have demanded that  the President and his administration end this cruel policy immediately.   We are hearing some reports that there may be an action taken. I  don't know what that action will be, but I hope it is an action that  will end the policy. Until we know that, we have to continue to urge  the President to do the right thing.   Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security released data  showing that between May 5 and June 9--just a little more than a  month--2,342 children were taken from their parents at the border. That  is about 70 children per day taken from their parents.   I have received thousands of emails, letters, and phone calls from  concerned Pennsylvanians who are demanding an immediate end to the  policy. I never imagined that I would have to stand here today, nor  should anyone, to talk about a scenario where the U.S. Government is  separating children from their parents at the border. That seems  incomprehensible that would ever happen, but it has.   I am reading part of a statement that reads as follows:         Our government is forcibly separating children--including       toddlers--from their parents and sending them to detention       facilities as a means of sending a message and influencing       Congress.    That was a statement not made by a Democratic Senator or a Democratic  House Member or a Republican or any politician; that was part of a  larger statement made by Thomas Donahue, the president and CEO of the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce--not someone who is very often lined up on the  same side as Democratic Senators. I think that is an understatement.   To say this policy is cruel, inhumane, and an insult to the values of  our Nation is to utter an understatement. This is a policy that is  straight from the pit of hell, and there is probably worse that we  could say about it. It is hard to comprehend that any administration at  any time would propose, let alone implement, a policy that would result  in children being separated from their parents.   Unlike what the administration has tried to argue, this is not about  following the law or securing the border. Neither of those statements  is relevant here. This is a conscious decision by this administration,  which is contrary to the decisions by the last two administrations--one  a Republican administration, the other a Democratic administration-- that decided not to separate children from their parents.  Unfortunately, this administration decided to do just that.   Many people have heard the statements attributed to the American  Academy of Pediatrics. There were several different folks who were  quoted on this, depending on which medical organizations they belonged  to.   One of the most compelling statements was by Dr. Colleen Kraft, the  president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. She is obviously an  expert about children and is from an expert organization. Dr. Kraft  visited a children's immigration detention facility in Texas earlier  this month. She called what she saw there, in the systemic separation  of children from their parents, ``a form of child abuse.'' According to  Dr. Kraft, once young children are separated from their caregivers or  parents, they are likely to develop toxic stress in their brains. The  toxic stress disrupts children's brain development and increases levels  of flight-or-fight hormones in their bodies. This kind of emotional  trauma could eventually lead to children having health problems, such  as heart disease and substance abuse disorders.  [[Page S4261]]    There is well-documented scientific evidence of the long-lasting harm  that policies like this have on children. In the Washington Post  yesterday, in an article entitled ``What Separation from Parents Does  to Children,'' a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, Dr.  Charles Nelson, said:         The effect is catastrophic. There's so much research on       this that if people paid attention at all to the science,       they would never do this.    It goes on and on and on. I could quote more detail for a long time  about what he has said and about what other experts have said, but we  don't have time today. Suffice it to say the research that shows the  damage that is done to children when they are forcibly separated from  their parents explains why more than 9,000 mental health professionals  and 172 organizations signed a petition to urge the President to end  the policy of separating families. In this petition, the mental health  professionals wrote:         From decades of research and direct clinical experience, we       know that the impact of disrupted attachment manifests not       only in overwhelming fear and panic at the time of       separation, but that there is a strong likelihood that these       children's behavioral, psychological, interpersonal, and       cognitive trajectories will also be affected. The National       Child Traumatic Stress Network notes that children may       develop post traumatic responses following separation from       their parents and specifically lists immigration and parental       deportation as situations of potentially traumatic       separation. To pretend that separated children do not grow up       with the shrapnel of this traumatic experience embedded in       their minds is to disregard everything we know about child       development, the brain, and trauma.    That is from the petition that was signed by mental health  professionals across the country--9,000 of them. Those professionals  and the professionals at the American Academy of Pediatrics, the  American College of Physicians, and the American Psychiatric  Association have also issued statements against the policy. Together,  these organizations represent more than 250,000 doctors across the  country. To support this policy, you would have to assert that a  quarter of a million doctors in the United States of America are  somehow wrong and that you know better.   If we were to ask the administration, ``Before you put this policy in  place, did you talk to the American Academy of Pediatrics? Did you talk  to child psychologists? Did you talk to the American College of  Physicians or other professionals who know something about children and  trauma and long-term damage to their brains and to their development?''  I am afraid the answer to that question would be no. Yet I await the  answer from the administration. I hope the answer will be yes.   I have more here, but I know we have to go, so I will not use all of  it. Over the next couple of hours and days, we have to keep insisting  that the administration take action to end this policy today, which it  could--which the President could, which the Attorney General could. I  realize that sometimes here in Washington, people say: Do something  right now. Take action today. Take action this week or this month. Yet,  in this case, today matters; hours matter; days matter in the lives of  those children--more than 2,300 or more, and the projections are just  going through the roof about what will happen over the next couple of  weeks and month.   Ending the policy today and reuniting child and parent matters a lot  because every day that goes by makes it worse for that child.  Unfortunately, for some children, it might be too late. That traumatic  event and the aftereffects--the hours and the days and even weeks now  that they have been separated--might result in permanent damage. I hope  I am wrong about this, but days matter here, and even hours matter.   We are hoping that the administration will reverse course on a  policy--I will say again and keep saying--that is straight from the pit  of hell. It should end today.   I yield the floor.
