 Madam Speaker, the House of Representatives, the  people's House, is vested by the Constitution with the power of  impeachment to balance the power of the Presidency. Without this  essential duty, the President could exploit his sacred office without  any regard for the law.   On January 3, 2019, every Member of the House swore an oath to defend  the Constitution, and this week, we are being asked to do just that.   When allegations arose that the President tried to coerce a foreign  government to help undermine the 2020 election, the House carried out  its duty to investigate a potential abuse of power; but the President  refused to cooperate and forbade his administration from doing so,  obstructing Congress from carrying out our sworn responsibility.   If these actions bear no consequence, future Presidents may act  without constraint and American democracy will be at an end. Therefore,  compelled by my sworn duty to defend the Constitution, I will vote to  impeach this President.
