 Mr. Speaker, 988. These three digits  represent an important first step toward a transformed crisis care  system in America.   Congress passed the legislation to formally authorize 988 as the new  number for suicide and mental health crises. This 24/7 hotline and text  line is available to people with mental health-related distress,  including thoughts of suicide, mental health crisis, or substance use  crisis.   Additionally, family and friends can use this service to support  loved ones who are struggling.   By calling or texting 988, people will immediately be connected with  trained crisis counselors who will do everything they can to help.   Mental health care is healthcare, and the enactment of 988 is a long  overdue example of government finally prioritizing mental health and  putting crisis care in reach for more Americans. But there is much more  to do.   I will continue to work in Congress and in the community to help  fight the stigma and increase mental health support for all.                            ____________________
