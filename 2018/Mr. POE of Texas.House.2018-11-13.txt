 Mr. Speaker, World War I ended 100 years ago.  During the brutal, bloody war, thousands were killed in an area of  France and Belgium called Flanders.   ``In Flanders Fields,'' by John McCrae.       In Flanders fields the poppies blow      Between the crosses, row on row,      That mark our place; and in the sky      The larks, still bravely singing, fly      Scarce heard amid the guns below.      We are the Dead. Short days ago      We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,      Loved and were loved, and now we lie,      In Flanders fields.      Take up our quarrel with the foe:      To you from failing hands we throw      The torch; be yours to hold it high.      If ye break faith with us who die      We shall not sleep, though poppies grow      In Flanders fields.    Mr. Speaker, 116,000 Americans were killed in World War I. Now, after  100 years, there will finally be a memorial erected in D.C. for all the  veterans of the great war. It is about time, don't you think? For the  worst casualty of war is to be forgotten.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
