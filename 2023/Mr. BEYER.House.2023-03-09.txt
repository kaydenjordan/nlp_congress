 Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting  ``no'' on this effort to undo the EPA's waters of the U.S. rule.    EPA's rulemaking will simply restore the basics of what was protected  by law for nearly 50 years before Trump's rule went into effect. It is  an important protection to restore smart clean water protections.   We need to step forward for clean water because over half of our  rivers and lakes in our country are too polluted for swimming, fishing,  or drinking. I grew up near the Potomac River, where it was dangerous  to get into something that was so incredibly dirty.   Americans are speaking up, and they say they want to swim and fish in  their streams.   This EPA rule is also a step forward to protect wetlands. Last month,  Stanford scientists showed that our country is responsible for more  wetland loss and degradation than any other country.   We need to protect the wetlands that we still have left. Wetlands  sequester carbon, which helps us in our climate change goals. Wetlands  are a habitat that will help us stop the biodiversity crisis.   There is also a lot of talk about stakeholders wanting certainty in  what waters are covered. I am on board with that certainty, and the new  rulemaking provides just that, certainty for the Americans who want  swimmable, fishable, drinkable waters and who want a safe climate and  thriving biodiversity.   I had the honor of serving on the Science Committee for 8 years, and  we heard again and again that virtually all scientists believe that  water is the absolutely most essential requirement for life. Yet, we  want to gut the most important rule to protect our water.   Undoing the waters of the U.S. rule is a step backward. For all  Americans who want the certainty of a safe climate and clean water for  the future, I have to vote ``no.''
