 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair.         We shall pay any price, we shall bear any burden, we shall       support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival       and the success of liberty.    President Kennedy's inaugural address.   And here we stand in the most powerful country, in the most powerful  legislative body, voting on an issue of freedom, of liberty, the basic  foundation of this country. I am proud that this is a bipartisan effort  to support the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian leadership because  they have paid the ultimate sacrifice. They are bearing the ultimate  burden.   So it is appropriate for us, as this monster, Vladimir Putin, invades  a free country, blackmails the neighbors around energy issues, scares  all of Eastern Europe and all of Europe, in conjunction with the  support of China who looked the other way and said, Well, just wait  until after the Olympics. There is a lot at stake here.   This is about much more than just Ukraine. This is about freedom  around the world.   I agree with what the chairman and so many other speakers said. We  cannot let Vladimir Putin gain one inch of soil in Ukraine. Not one  inch. You can't reward bad behavior. You can't reward violence. And  that is what we will be doing.   So I rise in support of this bill. I support the $33 billion that the  President has proposed this morning.    Madam Speaker, we need to continue this process; not one  inch of soil.   Like Mr. Pascrell said, there are States like New Jersey or Ohio,  where we have people from Ukraine and from Poland and from Lithuania,  and those ties run deep. Their family members, friends that they have  lost, that have gotten killed, slaughtered by a monster.   So we need to keep going.   Planes: The $33 billion that the President wants, this process  expedites all that.   We should look at what we need to do to China if they continue to  support Russia in this effort.   I think, in a bipartisan way, we need to come together around a  whole-of-government approach.   We need to get natural gas from eastern Ohio to Eastern Europe, from  western Pennsylvania to Eastern Europe, from West Virginia and New York  to Eastern Europe, and knock the legs out from under Vladimir Putin.   Whole-of-government approach. Be aggressive. Not one inch of  territory. And make sure we ensure the survival and the success of  liberty.
