 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding the time.   Speaking out against the Vietnam War in 1967, Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr. implored: ``We must move past indecision to action. We must find  new ways to speak for peace. If we do not act, we shall surely be  dragged down the long, dark, and shameful corridors of time reserved  for those who possess power without compassion, might without morality,  and strength without sight.''   Dr. King's words are just as apropos today. President Trump, in  ordering a significant military strike, without seeking authorization,  or even consultation with Congress, has brought us to the brink of war.   The Constitution of this great country gives the solemn power to  declare war to the people's representatives in Congress, not one person  in the White House, whoever that might be.   With this resolution, Congress is acting to uphold our constitutional  responsibility. If the President believes military action against Iran  is warranted, this resolution, and the Constitution, require him to  make the case to Congress and receive authorization.   Mr. Speaker, I truly regret that we find ourselves in the position we  are today. The Trump administration's policy toward Iran, abandoning  the nuclear deal rather than building on it, while escalating tensions  instead, is an unwise application of American power, might, and  strength.   The strike against General Soleimani, a bad man who no American  mourns, drags us closer to another long, dark, and shameful corridor to  an unnecessary war.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the resolution.
