 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the weekend, details emerged about  President Trump's conduct with Ukrainian President Zelensky.  Specifically, the President's phone calls with the Ukrainian leader  were subject of an official whistleblower complaint by a member of the  intelligence community. The intelligence community's inspector general,  a Trump appointee, has determined that this whistleblower's complaint  is credible and a matter of urgent concern, whose subject matter ``not  only falls within the DNI's jurisdiction, but relates to one of the  most significant and important of the DNI's responsibilities to the  American people.''   By law, a whistleblower complaint labeled in this way must be  transmitted to Congress--not shall be transmitted to Congress, must be.  The Trump administration has not allowed that to happen. So far, in the  face of this dire warning and the Trump administration's effort to  cover it up, the Republican-led Senate has remained silent and  submissive, shying away from this institution's constitutional duty to  conduct oversight.   That is an obligation we have. It is not a yes or no. That is our  job. The Republicans are in the majority in the Senate. With that  majority comes the power to call hearings, issue subpoenas, and decide  what legislation  [[Page S5618]]  comes to the floor. The majority in the Senate, therefore, has an  obligation to consider and act on the Senate's behalf, particularly  when it comes to matters of oversight and matters of separation of  powers. Yet, so far, we have no indication that Senate Republicans are  planning to act. Most have yet to speak out.   The Republican Senate's ``see no evil, hear no evil'' attitude is  unacceptable and must change. Again, this is an issue of solemn  obligation. There is no wiggle room here--none. The obligation of the  inspector general is to turn over the whistleblower information now  that he has found it credible and urgent. And here, typically, our  Senate Republicans and the Senate leader sit supinely in obeisance to  Donald Trump's reckless lawbreaking.    This is a democracy, and we have heard nothing from our Republican  colleagues about what the President has done, as abhorrent as that is,  and the stonewalling of information. What is the President afraid of in  this whistleblower report? We don't know; we can only speculate. But we  do know there is an obligation for it to come to Congress.   So today I sent the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, a  letter calling on him and the Republican chairs of the Senate relevant  committees to fulfill their constitutional duties and immediately take  the following actions:   One, convene hearings to determine exactly what prompted the  whistleblower to file this urgent complaint. At a minimum, these  hearings should include testimony from Acting Director of National  Intelligence Joseph Maguire, Acting Office of Management and Budget  Director Russell Vought, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and President  Trump's private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, among others.   Two, issue a subpoena to compel the delivery of the whistleblower  complaint to Congress as required--required--by law.   Three, request the White House to release the transcript of President  Trump's conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky during which  President Trump reportedly pressured the Government of Ukraine to  investigate Vice President Biden and his family.   Four, identify the administration officials who directed that $341  million of security assistance to Ukraine be delayed, and request that  all records related to this decision be turned over to Congress.   Five, insist that the Department of Justice provide any legal opinion  or other guidance it has given regarding the administration's  obligation to transmit the whistleblower complaint to Congress.   It is the Senate's duty to take this national security matter  seriously and investigate now. Senate Republicans have the sole power  and the overwhelming responsibility to see that it does. How long must  we wait for our Republican colleagues to rise up to their  responsibilities to the Constitution, to separation of powers, and to  rule of law when President Trump brazenly violates that law? When are  we going to hear the voices? It is unbelievable.   As President Trump erodes the very fabric of this democracy, our  Republican colleagues--I believe out of fear--do nothing. That is not a  profile in courage. That is not even what Senator after Senator, for  generation after generation, regardless of party, has done. But we are  obviously in a new era here where, on the Republican side, anything  Donald Trump wants to do, he can get away with, whether or not it  violates the law, violates our principles, violates the grand  traditions of this democratic Republic.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a somewhat related matter, again about  President Trump's overreach and lack of respect for any rule of law,  Senate Republicans will be forced to vote later this week on the  President's emergency declaration, which he is using to steal money  from our military to fund a border wall that he promised Mexico would  pay for. Again, my Republican colleagues face a choice about whether to  have the Senate enforce its role as a check on the executive branch.   By declaring a national emergency, the President has tried to go  around the constraints of his office to spend taxpayer dollars the way  he wants instead of the way the Congress appropriates. Remember,  Congress has explicitly and repeatedly rejected the President's request  for border wall funding. Now he is trying to improperly take it from  funds elsewhere--in this case, the military.   The Constitution dictates that Congress alone has the power of the  purse. Will my Republican colleagues vote to reassert those  constitutional powers, or will they buckle to the pressure of partisan  loyalty to the President?   And I say to some of my very conservative friends, conservatism says:  Let's not have large agglomerations of power. Let the individual have  the most freedom to exercise his or her will.   When the President overreaches, what has happened to the true  conservatives? They are quiet. They almost hide under their desks.  History will not look at it kindly.   Many of my Republican colleagues have military installations,  schools, and major projects in their States that would suffer as a  result of the President's emergency. The Pentagon last week warned of  dire outcomes if this funding is not restored, even warning that lives  might be at risk.   Will Senate Republicans vote to defend our troops, their families,  their children? Will they vote to defend millions of dollars of  important projects in their States, including medical facilities in  North Carolina, a hurricane recovery project in Florida, and a middle  school in Kentucky? Well, these questions will be answered this week.   I have seen reports that the Republicans are searching for other ways  to restore military funding other than by ending the President's  emergency declaration. Make no mistake--Democrats will not assent to  backfilling accounts or other backhanded ways of approving taxpayer  dollars for the President's border wall. The President said Mexico  would pay for it. That is the only thing he said during the campaign.  When people yelled ``build the wall,'' it was Mexico that was going to  pay for it, not American taxpayers and certainly not our military--not  the brave men and women who risk their lives for us and whose families  go through such hardship.   The simplest, quickest, and only way of protecting military funding  is for my Republican friends to join us in terminating the emergency  declaration later this week.   I urge--urge--my Republican colleagues to think about their States  and the important military projects that hang in the balance, to think  about the precedent it would set for this President and for future  Presidents, and above all, to think about the constitutional questions,  to just read the Constitution and defend the Article I powers of  Congress given to us by the Founders.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
