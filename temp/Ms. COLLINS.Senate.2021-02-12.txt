 Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.    Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is from Senator Collins and  Senator Murkowski. It is for the counsel for the former President.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Exactly when did President Trump learn of the breach of the       Capitol, and what specific actions did he take to bring the       rioting to an end, and when did he take them? Please be as       detailed as possible.    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Is it possible to read the question again?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the question again.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Exactly when did President Trump learn of the breach of the       Capitol, and what specific actions did he take to bring the       rioting to an end, and when did he take them? Please be as       detailed as possible.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. van der Veen.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. The House Managers have given us absolutely  no evidence, one way or the other, on that question.   We are able to piece together a timeline, and it goes all the way  back to December 31; January 2, there is a lot of interaction between  the authorities and getting folks to have security beforehand on the  day. We have a tweet at 2:38, so it was certainly sometime before then.   With the rush to bring this impeachment, there has been absolutely no  investigation into that. And that is the problem with this entire  proceeding.   The House Managers did zero investigation, and the American people  deserve a lot better than coming in here with no evidence, hearsay on  top of hearsay on top of reports that are hearsay.   Due process is required here, and that was denied.
