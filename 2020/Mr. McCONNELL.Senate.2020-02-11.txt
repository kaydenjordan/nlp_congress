 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, with the impeachment trial behind us,  the Senate can now get back to the business of the American people.   As the President laid out in his bold speech last Tuesday, the state  of our Union is strong. Over the past 3 years, a combination of major  Republican policy victories and important bipartisan achievements have  helped to create a historic economic moment for working Americans and  middle-class families.   Unemployment remains right around its lowest point in half a century.  The percentage of Americans aged 25 to 54 who have jobs is the highest  it has been in 20 years. The market for American workers is hot, and it  is pulling people off of the sidelines. As the New York Times recently  explained, ``Employers are hiring candidates with disabilities,  criminal records and other barriers to employment, and are offering  perks to attract workers.'' No wonder the percentage of Americans who  say they are financially better off now than they were a year ago just  hit a 44-year high.   We have finally seen a drop in opioid deaths. In my home State of  Kentucky, we recently saw the largest decrease in fatal drug overdoses  in a decade. We are rebuilding and modernizing the world's greatest  military, and we are continuing to renew our Federal judiciary with  thoroughly qualified men and women who understand that a judge's job is  to interpret our laws and our Constitution as they were actually  written.   There is plenty more for the Senate to do to keep up this momentum  for the American people, so we are glad to get back to business.   We will start this week by confirming more of President Trump's well- qualified nominees to lifetime judicial appointments. The first up is  Judge Andrew Brasher, of Alabama, to serve on the Eleventh Circuit.  Judge Brasher currently serves on the U.S. District Court for the  Middle District of Alabama. He is a Harvard Law graduate who previously  clerked on the Eleventh Circuit, excelled in private practice, and  found his way into public service as solicitor general for his home  State. In that role, he was recognized by the National Association of  Attorneys General for his legal writing, and his nomination earned a  unanimous ``well-qualified'' rating from the ABA.  [[Page S972]]    I look forward to confirming Judge Brasher to his next post this  afternoon.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, this week, we  expect the Senate will take up a War Powers Resolution by the junior  Senator from Virginia that would severely limit the U.S. military's  operational flexibility to defend itself against threats posed by Iran.  I will strongly oppose our colleague's effort and urge the Senate to  defeat it.   First, let's discuss what prompted this: the President's successful  decision to remove Soleimani from the battlefield last month. This  limited yet decisive precision strike eliminated the terrorist  mastermind who had been responsible for more American military  casualties than anyone else alive.   This was not some reckless act. It was a calculated and limited  response to a significant, growing threat of attack against U.S.  personnel in Iraq by an emboldened adversary. Years ago, Soleimani had  concluded America was a paper tiger whose people he could kill with  relative impunity. It was a strike designed to stop an escalation cycle  we all knew was underway and to restore deterrence and reduce the risk  of war.   Yet, when Soleimani's record of brutality was brought to an end, some  Washington Democrats immediately suggested President Trump was leading  us into World War III. While the Middle East masses rejoiced at the  death of a principal architect of Iran's campaign of terror, the  Washington elites fretted.   Yet, thus far, it appears the Soleimani strike has, indeed, had the  intended effect. As I observed back in January, ``We appear to have  restored a measure of deterrence in the Middle East. So let's not screw  it up.'' Well, I am afraid that is just what our colleague's resolution  would do. Just as we have successfully sent Iran the strong signal of  our strength and resolve, a blunt and clumsy War Powers Resolution  would tie our own hands.   With China's and Russia's watching, is it really a good idea to  suggest that we are willing to let a meddling power like Iran push us  around? This self-flagellation and self-limitation would be tantamount  to snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.   For 8 years, President Obama and Senate Democrats, like my friend the  Democratic leader himself, frequently said that, when it comes to Iran,  we should never take the military option off the table. Yet, now that  someone else is in the Oval Office, they seem to want to remove all  options from the table. Lest we forget, the fact is that we are not  conducting ongoing hostilities with Iran. This was a one-off operation  to disrupt and deter planned attacks--not a campaign, not a conflict,  not a war.   This discrete and limited exercise of American power pales in  comparison to the ways in which past Presidents of both parties have  routinely used Presidential authorities to utilize our military might  without their having the prior consent of Congress--President Clinton  in Kosovo, President Obama in Libya, and so on.   Do most of my distinguished Democratic colleagues really agree with  several of their party's leading Presidential candidates who have  suggested President Trump made a mistake by taking this sort of  Executive action to eliminate this brutal terrorist?   Do my colleagues really agree with the prominent voices on their side  who have proposed to exit the Middle East altogether rather than to  continue to work to support our local partners and defend our national  security and national interests in this critical region?   I have been trying to have this broader debate for more than a year  now. I have repeatedly sought to give my Democratic colleagues the  opportunity to go on record about their actual, big-picture strategic  vision for the Middle East.   Are they willing to support a continued military presence in Syria?  in Iraq? Do they believe we can magically support our partners, like  the Kurds, without having a military presence; that we can counter  Iranian and Russian influence if we are nowhere to be found in the  region? Do they believe Israel will be safer in a region without  American influence?   Ill-conceived potshots at Presidential authorities--in the wake of a  strike that succeeded--by using the blunt instrument of a War Powers  Resolution is no substitute at all for answering these broader  questions.   I will oppose my colleague's resolution tomorrow, and I encourage our  colleagues to do likewise.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.
