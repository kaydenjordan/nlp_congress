 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to  speak for up to 3 minutes.    Mr. President, I rise today with a warning about S.J.  Res. 34. This measure undermines the privacy of all Montanans and all  Americans. It is a measure I strongly oppose because it takes the refs  off the field, leaving consumers at the whim of internet service  providers. It allows these companies to sell our data--to sell my  data--and to snoop through your search history and to track the sites  we visit. In other words, it allows internet companies to make a profit  by invading your privacy. It gives them the ability to collect and sell  your physical location, information about your children, your health,  finances, Social Security number, and web browsing history. In fact,  this legislation even extends to apps and your social media accounts.   Following the vote that we had here on this floor, a Republican State  senator from Buffalo, MT, proposed an amendment to our State budget to  push back against this irresponsible resolution. In my home State of  Montana, folks on both sides of the aisle are deeply concerned about  their right to privacy. Now folks you don't even know can have access  to the websites you visit, and they can have this access without your  consent.   This is another troubling step that folks in Congress have taken this  year to violate the rights of privacy of law-abiding citizens. We  already have a CIA Director who has advocated for the most intrusive  acts of the PATRIOT Act. We have a Supreme Court nominee before us who  supports the government's ability to reach into the private lives of  law-abiding Americans. Now Congress is rolling out the red carpet for  major corporations to collect and sell our personal online information.   Enough is enough. I am here today to provide a voice for all  Montanans and all Americans who value their right to privacy, who  expect their elected officials to defend civil liberties, to stand up  for constitutional rights, and who do not want private information  collected and shopped around like a used book on Amazon.   When the President decided to sign this resolution last night, he  ushered in the latest significant threat to our right to privacy. Now  it is the responsibility of service providers to protect our personal  information online.   I think folks in Montana and across this country have the right to  question the priorities of those who supported this resolution.  Everyone has a fundamental right to privacy, and the government  shouldn't be in the business of violating those individual rights,  especially when doing the bidding of big companies looking to make more  profits at the expense of people's privacy.   I want it to be known in this body that Montanans don't want anyone  snooping around in their private lives, neither the government nor  corporations. It is fundamental to our Montana values. Protecting  online privacy is critical to the integrity of basic, fundamental  freedom, of fundamental civil liberty. I urge all my colleagues to make  their voices heard on this critical issue.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of Flathead Valley Community College in Kalispell, MT, and  to honor the many contributions that FVCC has made in northwest  Montana.   In 1967, Dr. Larry Blake was hired as the first president of FVCC,  and months later, he opened the doors to 611 students who made up the  very first class.   Fifty years later, over 3,500 students are enrolled in FVCC and  studying more than 100 degree and certificate programs.   The campus today is unrecognizable to those who studied at its  original downtown location, and in recent years, I have seen the new  campus boom with the construction of additional education facilities,  laboratories, and campus housing.   In 2001, Jane Karas was hired as the 11th president of FVCC, and she  has been instrumental in the growth of the region's largest higher  education institution.   Under Jane Karas's leadership, FVCC has expanded the nursing school  and developed a renowned culinary school that has helped meet the  growing demand for jobs in the communities that lay in the shadow of  Glacier National Park.   In addition to serving thousands of students in Kalispell, FVCC  operates a satellite campus an hour away in Libby, MT.   Over the past 50 years, FVCC has made a profound impact in Montana,  and I join all of the Montanans who can't wait to see what they have in  store for the next 50 years.                            ____________________
