 Mr. President, along with my colleague Senator Jim  Risch, we honor Idaho State Senator Patti Anne Lodge for her 22 years  of service in the Idaho State Senate.   Senator Lodge, an educator for 35 years and agribusiness owner, is a  dedicated servant of the community. Her determination and patience are  hallmarks of her attentive problem solving. The list of committees,  councils, task forces and boards she has led and devoted her time and  talents to is extensive and diverse. They include her chairmanship of  three senate committees: State affairs; judiciary and rules; and health  and welfare. She has also cochaired the joint millennium fund committee  and criminal justice reinvestment oversight committee, to name some of  her many other leadership roles.   Her service stretches far beyond the State senate and well into the  communities she represents, as she has served on the Boys & Girls Club  Advisory Committee, Idaho Meth Project Advisory Board, Nampa Chamber of  Commerce, Caldwell Chamber of Commerce, and so much more. She has led  local Republicans with distinction, serving as precinct chairman,  Canyon County GOP chairman, president of the Idaho Federation of  Republican Women, on the board of the National Republican Women, and  more.   It is no surprise she has earned many awards and recognitions for her  committed service. They include her recognition as the Idaho Republican  Senator of the Year in 2010 and Idaho Fraternal Order of Police  Legislator of the Year in 2014, her induction into the Idaho Republican  Hall of Fame and so many more honors.   Throughout, Senator Lodge has worked hard to be a good steward of tax  dollars, promoted jobs and educational opportunities, backed personal  accountability and responsibility, and, overall, she has been a  thoughtful, steadfast advocate for Canyon County residents, including  the small family farmers and ranchers who call this wonderful part of  our State home.   Thank you, Senator Lodge, for you decades of service on behalf of  Idahoans. In addition, thank you to your friends and loved ones,  especially your husband Edward J. Lodge; children Mary-Jeanne, Edward  R. and Anne-Marie; and grandchildren, who have shared your time with  our great State all these years. We congratulate you on your  extraordinary career and wish you well.                            ____________________
