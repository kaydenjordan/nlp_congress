 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of  Georgia's legend in many ways, Zell Miller, who spent the last few  years of his life, as he spent all of his life, in Young Harris in my  district.   Zell Miller helped shape Georgia into one of the strongest States in  the Union. He was a national giant from northeast Georgia, and I looked  up to him as a leader who never blinked in the face of a challenge or  let politics eclipse his principles.   I will always remember the ways he encouraged me and supported me  through many seasons. My family knew and admired and will miss Zell as  a true man of the mountains.   In 1932, Zell Bryan Miller was born to a mother who single-handedly  built her family's first home with rocks from a nearby stream, which he  lived in until his passing.   Zell attended both Young Harris College and Emory University. He put  his education on hold in order to enlist in the United States Marine  Corps in 1953.   One year after he joined the Marines, he married Shirley Carver, and  they had two sons, Murphy and Matthew.   A few years later, Zell enrolled at the University of Georgia, where  he graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees in history. His  education earned him a teaching position back home at Young Harris  College in 1959, and in the same year, the town elected him as their  mayor.   After one mayoral term, residents sent him to the Gold Dome as their  State senator. In the years following, he worked for Georgia's Governor  Maddox, Georgia's Democratic Party, the State Board of Pardons and  Paroles, and, in 1975, he became Georgia's Lieutenant Governor.   In 1990, Zell became the Governor of Georgia, and his positive  influence on our State's education system has characterized his tenure.   His vision for brighter futures came to life when voters ratified the  State lottery on the 1992 ballot, creating a new fund to support the  State's education needs. One year later, the H.O.P.E. Scholarship was  created, making higher education accessible for nearly 2 million  Georgia students.   In 1999, Georgia Senator Paul Coverdell passed away while in office,  and then-Governor Barnes appointed Zell to fill the vacant seat, and  Zell came to Washington.   Georgians will remember Zell Miller as one of the State's strongest  advocates, a leader who never chose ideology over his duty to the  people who elected him, and, in this time of loss, our prayers are  focused on his loved ones and the millions of people whom he served.   Zell Miller was an example of a true man of the mountains who was  willing to take stands, many times not popular, but he was always  willing to take a stand for those that mattered.   Zell Miller will be someone who is missed, whether it be in Atlanta,  whether it be in Washington, D.C., all across this country, or  basically back home in the Ninth District of Georgia. Zell Miller is  someone who we all can look up to and respect. He led in a way that we  can try to lead as well.        Celebrating the 70th Anniversary of the U.S. Air Force Reserve     Mr. Speaker, I today rise to recognize the  70th anniversary of the United States Air Force Reserve, created by  President Truman on April 14, 1948.   As a member of the Air Force Reserve, I have been privileged to  minister and work with airmen since 2002. I can attest to the courage  exhibited by my fellow airmen both here at home and while serving  abroad in Iraq together.   Since our country's founding, citizens have awaited and answered the  call of duty, accomplishing each mission with valor.   Air Force reservists, known as Reserve Citizen Airmen, perform  leading roles in military operations, humanitarian crises, and disaster  relief across  [[Page H3153]]  the globe. The distinguished group of more than 69,000 Citizen Airmen  consists of enlisted military troops, officers, and civil servants  tasked by law to support our Armed Forces in the defense of our  freedom.   The Air Force Reserve traces its roots back to the aeronautical  division of the United States Army's Office of the Chief Signal  Officer, which took charge of military balloons and air machines in  1907. Ten years later, the first two Air Force Reserve units were  deployed to France, as the United States entered World War I, providing  the war effort with around 10,000 trained pilots.   With 1,500 Reserve pilots and 1,300 nonrated officers and 400  enlisted airmen, reservists later played a critical role in World War  II. The legendary Jimmy Doolittle was among the soldiers in this force  and, in response to Pearl Harbor, went on to lead the Doolittle Raid,  the first bombing attack on the Japanese mainland.   In wars and in combat operations that followed, Citizen Airmen have  supported the core function of the United States Air Force, as well as  providing for disaster relief after events like hurricanes and  wildfires.   When terrorists attacked our country on September 11, 2001, Air Force  reservists responded in full force to protect American cities and  assist in the security efforts.   Spanning seven decades, the Air Force Reserve has fulfilled the  promise of the early air pioneers and exceeded their expectations. I  want to join all of my fellow Citizen Airmen, past and present, in  celebrating the 70th anniversary of the United States Air Force  Reserve.   No matter where you go in the world, you will find an Air Force  reservist and the flag flying high and the sound of freedom in the air.                            ____________________
