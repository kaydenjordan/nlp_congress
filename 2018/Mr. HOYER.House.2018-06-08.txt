 Mr. Speaker, it is warm in here.   Mr. Speaker, there is joy in the Washington Capital Region today.   When I get up in the morning every day and I read the front page of  the Washington Post, I say: Oh, my goodness.   Today, I read the front page of the Washington Post. ``At last,  Capitals,'' with Alex Ovechkin holding the Stanley Cup high,  celebrates.   Mr. Speaker, I was in the Maryland State Senate in 1973, and one of  the great citizens of our region, Abe Pollin, said to us, to me, and to  others: We want to build an arena in Prince George's County. It was  called the Capital Center.   And in 1974, Abe Pollin brought hockey to the Washington Metropolitan  area.   Abe Pollin died not too long ago. Before he died, he sold the Caps to  Ted Leonsis. Abe Pollin and Ted Leonsis are ecstatic today.   Forty-four years, and now we are the national champions. Mr. Speaker,  I rise with great joy and excitement to celebrate the tremendous  victory last night by the Washington Capitals in the Stanley Cup  finals.   The Caps had an extraordinary season and brought home a victory for  the national capital region; its first major sports championship since  1992.   When team captain Alex Ovechkin raised the Stanley Cup over his head  last night, he did so on behalf of thousands upon thousands upon  thousands of Caps fans across our region, including, of course, my  district.   That moment came after a 4-3 victory over an extraordinary team, the  Vegas Golden Knights, who, in their first season as an expansion team  in the National Hockey League, became the first team to come to the  finals in that status. They had a magnificent season and their own  exciting path to the finals during their inaugural season.   As the celebrations continue from last night into today and over the  coming days, I want to offer my congratulations to the players,  coaches, managerial staff, and my thanks to all the fans who made the  Caps' victory possible.   I hope my colleagues, dare I say even the ones from Nevada, will join  me in congratulating them as well.   Alex Ovechkin was chosen as the most valuable player, having scored  15 goals in the playoffs.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say one last thing. My father was born in  Denmark. Lars Eller, a member of the Washington Capitals, was born and  lives in Denmark, scored the winning goal.   The colors of the Danish flag, as some of you may know, are red and  white. How appropriate. How wonderful. How grateful we are for the  vision of Abe Pollin and the sponsorship of Ted Leonsis.    Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for the week to come.   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority  leader.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for the information he has  given us, and I certainly thank him for his comments at the close of  his initial statement on the colloquy.   We are all ecstatic, as I am sure the gentleman can understand, that  after 44 years--and I might say I was an initial season ticket holder  to the Washington Capitals, who started their career at the Capital  Center in Prince George's County under the ownership and tutelage of  Abe Pollin, an extraordinary member of our community who died, and then  now under Ted Leonsis' leadership, and, of course, Alex Ovechkin's  extraordinary accomplishments of his own, being named the most valuable  player.   And I might say, as I know the gentleman would join me in saying, the  Las Vegas team had an extraordinary accomplishment themselves, being  the first expansion team ever to make it to the finals in the National  Championship.   So, it was a wonderful night for those of us who live in the  Washington National Capital area, and we thank the gentleman for his  observation.   Let me say as well, that we share the gentleman's happiness that the  economy is doing well. It is doing well. What he did not observe, but  we are happy about, is that President Obama, under his leadership, took  this economy from the worst economy that the gentleman and I have  experienced in our lifetimes to one of the best.   Now, it was not the best, because the best economy was under Bill  Clinton in the late 1990s in terms of almost every indication. But it  is certainly positive information, as the gentleman has pointed out, of  where the economy is now.   So we all welcome that. We are hopeful, of course, that we will build  on that.   The gentleman mentions there are over 6 million jobs available. One  of the challenges, as the gentleman knows, is that we don't have the  skill sets matching the jobs, and that is why they are vacant. That is  why they are unable to fill them. We need to, I think, focus on that.  We need to focus on investing in our infrastructure.   But as was mentioned on the floor yesterday in terms of a couple of  the bills Tim Ryan, in particular, mentioned, there are still 4 in 10  adults who can't pay a $400 bill if it came present. So we have work to  do, and hopefully we can do that together.    But it certainly is good news that unemployment is down and the  economy is moving along, continuing in the path that, from our  perspective, was set by President Obama, and that President Trump,  unlike President Obama, inherited a thriving, robust, growing economy.  So I am pleased that we have gone to that place.   Now, I know the gentleman indicated that a number of opioid-related  bills will be on the floor next week. I talked to the chairman of the  committee yesterday, the gentleman from Oregon, and most of those are  bipartisan bills. I hope all of them will end up, as they come to the  floor, as bipartisan bills.   The addiction crisis, of course, requires that we invest in a  comprehensive, long-term approach to expanding access to substance  abuse treatment. I hope we can tackle this issue in a meaningful and  bipartisan way. But I do want to address a number of other upcoming  items for this work period, starting with the farm bill.   As the gentleman knows, last month, the farm bill failed on the House  floor, and we have until June 22 to reconsider. My question is: Does  the gentleman expect that we will see a farm bill on the floor by June  22?   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his observation.   He talks about work. We are requiring those to work to work in order  to get government benefits. What is controversial about that?   Democrats support work. We want to see people working. We oppose,  however, your SNAP proposal because it is antiwork. You are taking a  work requirement that is working and replacing it with one that won't  work.   This is not about putting people to work. It is about pretending that  you care about work as cover for taking assistance away from struggling  families.   As a result of this bill, there will be fewer working--I know the  majority leader wants to hear this particular piece of information.   As a result of this bill as it is currently written, there will be  fewer working SNAP beneficiaries, not more, and millions more people  going hungry. That is the working poor who are getting nutritional  assistance for themselves and their families. There will be less of  them under your bill.   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is ecstatic about recent  statistics. I think that he has, of course, warrant to be.   Let me read to the gentleman statistics over a 68-year period where  Democrats have had the Presidency and Republicans have had the  Presidency on and off. The gentleman's words are almost exactly the  same words I heard in 2001 and 2003 when we were told and the country  was told, if we adopted those tax bills that the gentleman is so very  proud of--which is plunging our country $1.8 trillion into additional  debt, which he and his party wrung their hands about so repeatedly--and  that the CBO says is a result of what I believe to be the most fiscally  irresponsible Congress in which I have served.   Let me repeat that. I have served in 18 Congresses. I believe this  past Congress to be, this Congress that we are in, the most fiscally  irresponsible Congress in which I have served.   Yes, we have a philosophical difference. You gave 83 percent of your  tax revenues to the richest people in America. CBO says that; I don't  say that. And 17 percent to all the rest; i.e., some 300 million-plus  Americans.   Yes, we have a philosophical difference. We would have suggested that  the mix be a little fairer to those in the middle and the bottom of the  economic growth. But, no, you chose to give your benefits to the  wealthiest in America. Not surprising. It is trickle-down economics one  more time.   In 2001 and 2003, what happened? You did the tax cuts.   And what happened 6 years later? The country was plunged into the  deepest recession you, Mr. Majority Leader, or me have ever experienced  in our life. As a matter of fact, you have to be over 90 years of age  to have experienced a deeper recession than was brought on by the Bush  economic policies in the last decade, a depth of recession which the  Obama policies brought us out of faster than any other nation in the  world.   Those are the statistics. Faster than any other nation. The stock  market--we are all about the stock market. The stock market went up  almost 300 percent under Barack Obama. Now, when you get to 300  percent, we will about how well you have done. We will see what your  trade policies that the President is imposing on the country do to  employers and to employees and to consumers. We will see.   But let me tell you what has happened over the last 68 years under  Democratic Presidents and under Republican Presidents. The gentleman  wants to know about history. Under Republican Presidents over the 36  years that your party enjoyed control of the Presidency, the GDP grew  by an average of 2.5 percent. Under Democrats for 32 years, by 4.1  percent.   Now, what did that 1.6 percent difference mean?   What it meant was, under Republican Presidents over the last 68  years, 35 million jobs were created. The gentleman talks about jobs.  Under Democratic Presidents--4 less years, 32 years--there were 64.960  million jobs created.   Now, I hope, unlike your past performance, that the job growth  continues, that the stock market increase continues, but that has not  been the history. We will see.   So I hope that when you deal with the farm bill, notwithstanding your  statistics, that you bring a bipartisan bill. Very frankly, the farm  bill has historically been a farm bill. But what you did was passed a  tax bill giving the rich 83 percent of its benefits. And in the farm  bill you were taking nutritional assistance away from families and  children. That is why you couldn't pass it, among other reasons. It was  not bipartisan, as it was two Congresses ago when we reauthorized this.  You tried to cut the SNAP program by $40 billion.   The gentleman well knows the Senate is not pursuing your policies  either  [[Page H5003]]  on the Republican side or the Democratic side.   You are missing a lot of good information.   The fact of the matter is, you know your farm bill is not going to  pass the Senate.   Mr. Leader, on the farm bill I would urge you to come together with  us. I don't know that there is a more bipartisan member of this  Congress than Collin Peterson, the ranking Democratic on the  Agriculture Committee. Very frankly, the chairman was not interested in  a bipartisan bill. I don't know whether it was by direction or his own  view.   But let us come to a bipartisan agreement on this farm bill and pass  it over to the Senate so that you can do something, not just talk about  how you are reducing nutritional assistance to people that rely on it  for their food every day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I hear the words of the majority leader. He  and his party, without exception, opposed President Obama's programs.  Without exception.   We became the majority in 2007, and we worked with President Bush on  a number of things, including a very substantiation environmental bill  signed by President Bush, and other bills as well.   He mentions about the rescission package. Mr. Speaker, if you will  recall, when we had this debate some weeks ago, he said everything in  this rescission bill is what we don't need.   Guess what, Mr. Speaker? Ebola money was rescinded in that bill some  weeks ago, but not in this bill. He changed it because, very frankly,  Mr. Speaker, they found out, oops, we need the Ebola money. So they  took it out of this bill.   We think you need the CHIP money. We think we need the CHIP money to  make sure that if there is a happening or an occurrence that occurs,  the CHIP money is needed either directly or indirectly to make sure  that children, in fact, are taken care of.                                time  1215    Who has said that? Mr.  Tom Cole has said that. We have used that  money effectively and appropriately.   So, Mr. Speaker, it is hard to believe that if the Ebola money--which  I was assured was not needed--that cut was restored by our Republican  friends, Mr. Speaker, because they found out, yes, it is needed.   Now, in terms of wasting time, 65 votes over the last Congress to  repeal the Affordable Care Act--65--with a full and unquestioned  knowledge that none of those votes would result in something happening  for our country in the United States Senate. They weren't going to vote  for that. They knew that. So we spent a lot of time on that.   Let me also say: The gentleman says let's get about our business. Let  me ask the gentleman: Does he expect a bill on the DACA protectees, the  Dreamers, to come on the floor next week?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I would only say, I  appreciate his comments. But, Mr. Speaker, I have heard them a long  time, many, many times: We are going to solve this issue.   Mr. Ryan came to the floor and said: We are going to solve this  issue. You vote for this caps bill, and we will get an immigration bill  on the floor that will solve this issue.   That was some 2\1/2\ months ago. It is not solved yet, Mr. Speaker. I  hope the  [[Page H5004]]  leader does, in fact, bring a bill to the floor quickly.   In fact, the suggestion that had been made by many Members of his  party and mine to bring four options to the floor seems absolutely  consistent with the Speaker's pledge to take the tough issues head-on;  and that is, bring the Democratic bill that is cosponsored by one of  the senior Republicans, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, to the floor; bring the  Goodlatte bill, which has been reported out of the Republican Judiciary  Committee, to the floor; bring a bill cosponsored by Mr. Hurd and Mr.  Aguilar to the floor.   Then what we provide, Mr. Leader, is that the Speaker can bring a  bill to the floor of his choosing. What could be fairer than that to  let the people's House speak on this critically important issue? So I  would hope the gentleman would facilitate that coming to the floor.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, let me say that this is the most closed Congress  in history. He talks about coming to his office, and I have. We have  worked constructively and positively together, and I have great respect  for the majority leader. I know he is very close to President Trump,  and he has talked about his working with President Trump to move  forward.   Let us hope that the talks with Korea bear fruit. We have had a lot  of talks with the Koreans. They have made a lot of pledges, and they  haven't followed them. We will see what happens. We are hoping for the  best.   In coming to your office, we have had some discussions. We have had  discussions about DACA. But, very frankly, when we come to this floor,  this is the most closed Congress, Mr. Leader, in recent history, if not  history. We have had 85 closed rules. Zero, not a single open rule have  we considered.   Over 2,000 germane amendments have been blocked by the Rules  Committee. Mr. Speaker, that is amendments that are in order, and they  have been blocked. In fact, 194 Republicans--Republicans--have been  refused the opportunity to move forward on their amendments.   Now, I know that the leader's schedule is such that we can conclude  this debate. I have other things to say. But I am hopeful that,  frankly, whatever we bring to the floor, bring it on a rule that  provides for full consideration, bring it that reflects facing the  tough issues, bring it so the House can work its will on these bills,  including the farm bill, including an immigration bill that protects  the Dreamers, and including other legislation so critical to this  country. Let the House work its will through the amendatory process.   Mr. Speaker, unless the gentleman wants to say something, I yield  back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
