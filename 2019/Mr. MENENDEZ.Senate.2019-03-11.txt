 Mr. President, I rise today having just voted no on the  motion invoking cloture on Paul Matey's nomination to the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Third Circuit.   Now, I know speeches on procedure rarely make headlines, but I cannot  be silent as the majority shreds long-held norms for political gain.  Once again, the Republican majority has ignored the blue-slip process  that allows Senators to either green light or prevent hearings on  judicial nominees from their home States.   Some Americans may wonder, why does this matter? Well, the blue-slip  process gives the people a voice through their elected representatives  on who ultimately renders justice in their State. Neither Senator  Booker nor I have returned blue slips for Mr. Matey. In fact, Mr.  Matey's confirmation hearing took place before Senator Booker--our  State's voice on the Judiciary Committee--was even extended the common  courtesy of meeting with Mr. Matey. It wasn't for lack of trying.  Senator Booker requested time with Mr. Matey, but when he didn't  receive it, the Judiciary Committee proceeded anyway.   To add insult to injury, committee Republicans falsely claimed the  White House had meaningfully consulted with myself and Senator Booker,  the home State Senators, and that is simply not the case. There never  was meaningful consultation between the White House and Senator Booker  or me to identify a highly qualified consensus nominee--rather, we were  informed about the decision to nominate Mr. Matey--nor did I receive  any offer to meet with Mr. Matey, not before his nomination, not after  his nomination, not even to date as we are voting on the Senate floor.   Look, I have come to expect this behavior from the Trump White House,  but in the Senate, Democrats always--always--respected the blue-slip  process during our time in the majority. That is undeniable.   Before President Trump took office, only five judges in the past  century were confirmed with only one blue slip, much less no blue  slips. Never has a Democratic-led Senate ever held a hearing or  confirmed a judicial nominee without a blue slip from a Republican  Senator. It is shameful.   As long as the President keeps packing our courts with corporate- friendly Federalist Society judges, the Republican majority is willing  to destroy a process that Senator Orrin Hatch--former chairman of the  Judiciary Committee--once called ``the last remaining check on the  President's judicial appointment power.''   President Trump's nominees are now being confirmed at record speed,  despite objections from home State Senators.   My Republican friends claim to be the party of conservatism. Yet  there is nothing conservative about sweeping aside century-old norms  for political gain. They have put their party before country and show  no fidelity to the institutions that have made this country great.   Aside from the degradation of Senate norms surrounding Mr. Matey's  nomination, I have real concerns with his record. The people of New  Jersey have no appetite for a judge who served in Gov. Chris Christie's  administration and was once even called a protege of our esteemed  former Governor.   As deputy chief counsel for Governor Christie, Mr. Matey said he  tried to ensure that that administration followed ``the highest  standards of propriety, ethics, and legality.''   Somehow I question that. Consider what the people of New Jersey had  to go through during Governor Christie's tenure: the Bridgegate  scandal, the defunding of a Rutgers institute that was run by a Federal  nominee, the spiteful removal of a security detail from former Governor  Codey, and the rampant mismanagement of Superstorm Sandy relief  contracts, which forced too many families to live in trailers for years  on end. That is quite a list--quite a list.   I struggle to believe that Mr. Matey, the second most senior attorney  in the Christie administration, had no knowledge of this behavior.   During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Matey could not detail any of  the steps he took to ensure ethics rules were followed and declined to  offer any description of his supposed ``rigorous system'' of monitoring  and oversight at his confirmation hearing.   Apparently, Mr. Matey's system wasn't so rigorous, considering that  Bridgegate--for those of my colleagues who may not know, although I  think everybody knows, is when the operatives of the Christie  administration closed access to the George Washington Bridge from the  New Jersey side, which caused massive--massive--tieups on the New  Jersey side, all to politically punish the mayor of the community where  the George Washington Bridge leads from on the New Jersey side.   Bridgegate amounted to one of the most egregious abuses of political  power against everyday New Jersey families in our history. He was  supposedly the guy who was making sure there was a rigorous system of  monitoring and oversight. Well, I don't know how that happened.    I also have concerns about Mr. Matey's career after working for  Governor Christie.   During his time as the senior vice president of University Hospital  in Newark, a nationwide investigation gave the hospital an F--F,  failure--for patient safety standards. Mr. Matey has acknowledged that  while these issues were medical in nature, he did have some personal  responsibility to mitigate risks to patients.   Likewise, some of Mr. Matey's writings suggest a hostility toward  plaintiff attorneys who help everyday Americans take on powerful  corporate interests in class action lawsuits.   In 2005, he authored an article with now-Supreme Court Justice Neil  Gorsuch that lamented how the Supreme Court's ruling in Dura  Pharmaceuticals was a missed opportunity to ``curb frivolous fraud  claims'' and dismissed plaintiff attorneys as seeking ``free rides to  fast riches.'' In other words, Paul Matey saw a very narrow question in  the Dura Pharmaceuticals case as an opening for the Court to make a  sweeping ruling on all securities class actions. Now, that is what you  call an activist judge.   Matey then goes on to decry the ``enormous toll on the economy''  securities fraud litigation takes on corporations but with little  concern for the actual victims of security fraud.   Most troubling to me is how Mr. Matey has done zero--I repeat, zero-- pro bono work throughout his legal career. His Senate Judiciary  questionnaire lacks any record of pro bono representation. When he was  asked about it, Mr. Matey claimed his work on behalf of the State of  New Jersey satisfied the requirement. I couldn't disagree more. That is  not pro bono work. You were paid for it.   Cannon 2 of the American Bar Association's Code of Professional  Responsibility explicitly emphasizes the importance of pro bono work.  For many corporate lawyers, representing the underserved is the only  way to witness firsthand how the scales of justice in this country are  too often tipped in favor of the wealthy and well connected. Pro bono  work helps lawyers cultivate sound judgment and is especially important  to those seeking to become Federal judges.   Mr. Matey has done nothing to serve the disadvantaged, and that does  not bode well for the fair administration of justice, nor does the  Republican majority's disregard for procedures like blue slips bode  well for the Senate's constitutional role to provide advice and consent  or our responsibility to help build a judiciary that is responsive to  the needs of the American people in the courtroom.   For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose confirmation  of Paul Matey to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. We are better than  this.  [[Page S1756]]    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, on International Women's Day, we reflect  on the enormous contributions women make worldwide to their communities  and their countries across every aspect of society including justice,  politics, culture, peacebuilding, the economy, and national security.  On this day, we also recognize and recommit to fighting on behalf of  the many women whose voices governments seek to silence. Around the  world, women take enormous risks to advance the rights of their fellow  citizens and to promote the principles of freedom of expression,  religion, and assembly. They fight for rights to access education and  healthcare, and they fight discrimination, corruption, and violence.  For their words and for their actions, all too often, governments turn  these women into political prisoners.   Today, I want to highlight just a tiny fraction of the countless  number of women and girls held behind bars unjustly. Similarly,  unfortunately, the repressive governments detaining these women are  just a small fraction of the governments around the world that lock up  women for exercising their fundamental freedoms.   Just last week, the government of Saudi Arabia announced that it  would put on trial its country's leading women's rights activists who  have been in prison without charges since May 2018. The crackdown on  these activists began just weeks ahead of the much-anticipated lifting  of the ban on women driving, one of the very causes for which many of  the detained activists had campaigned. While some were quickly  released, others remain imprisoned. They include Loujain al-Hathloul,  Aziza al-Yousef, Eman al-Nafjan, Nouf Abdelaziz, Mayaa al-Zahrani,  Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Saada, Hatoon al-Fassi, Shadan al-Onezi, and  Amal al-Harbi. Credible reports indicate that Saudi interrogators  tortured at least four of the women, including with electric shocks and  whippings and sexual harassment and assault.   In the Philippines, Senator Leila de Lima, a brave champion of human  rights, launched an investigation into extrajudicial executions that  began shortly after President Duterte took office in 2016. As one of  the only leaders bold enough to oppose President Duterte's ``war on  drugs,'' she has faced prolonged arbitrary detention, according to  Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. President Duterte has  sought to silence her courageous voice as she spoke out against  widespread human rights violations, including thousands of  extrajudicial executions of mostly poor and marginalized people.   In Egypt, Hanan Badr el-Din, a human rights defender and cofounder of  the Families of the Forcibly Disappeared Association, was detained on  May 6, 2017, at Qanatar prison while visiting an individual who had  been forcibly disappeared. She started her activism following the  forced disappearance of her husband in 2013. She suffers from a serious  genetic disorder, and her health is rapidly deteriorating.   China is responsible for some of the most grave human rights abuses,  including of women. China has imprisoned hundreds of thousands of  Uighur women in detention camps across its northwest region. These  women are forced to renounce their Muslim religion and Uighur language  and memorize Chinese propaganda. Forced labor, torture, and death are  common. Thousands of children have been separated from their mothers  and fathers and placed in a separate network of orphanages. One husband  of a Uighur woman told Human Rights Watch: ``My wife was about to go  back overseas but they took her passport. And when she went to ask to  get her passport back, they told her she needs to be subjected to  political education for 10 days, and then they would let her go. That  was on July 20, 2017. Since then, she's been in a political education  camp.'' The family of Guligeina Tashimaimaiti, a Uighur PhD student who  was last seen in December 2017 when she returned from studying in  Malaysia, for example, fears she is in detention and at risk of torture  and other ill treatment.   China has also targeted Tibetan Buddhist nuns. The government  expelled hundreds of nuns in 2017 from Larung Gar in Sichuan, the  world's largest Tibetan Buddhist center. Their homes were demolished;  they were barred from entering other monasteries, and faced detention,  harassment, and abuse.   In Eritrea, Aster Fissehatsion has been held incommunicado without  charge or trial since September 2001. Her whereabouts, 17 years later,  are still not known. Aster Fissehatsion was arrested together with 10  other members of a group of political dissidents known as the Group of  15, or G-15, including her former husband, former Vice President and  foreign minister of Eritrea, Mahmoud Ahmed Sheriffo.   Perhaps, most tragically, this is just a snapshot of some of the  brave women who dare to speak up for fundamental rights and values.   So on this International Women's Day, as we reflect on the  achievements of women and reflect on the work that remains to be done,  I call on all of us to redouble our efforts to free women political  prisoners. Governments have the responsibility to promote the safety,  well-being, and fundamental rights of their citizens. I call on  governments who are unjustly detaining, harassing, and torturing women  for exercising their fundamental rights to immediately release these  politically motivated detentions. As they continue to struggle, let us  all take up the mantle of their cause.                            ____________________
