 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following speech be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S2121]]                     Sen. Fischer Willa Cather Unveiling Remarks         When we are here in Statuary Hall, I like to remind people       that we are not alone.        If you look above the door leading into the Rotunda, you'll       see a figure. It is Clio, the muse of history.        For generations, she served as a constant reminder that our       words and actions--the good and the bad--would be judged by       time and leave a lasting mark on the nation.        Today Clio welcomes one of Nebraska's finest literary       artists, Willa Cather.        ``Let your fiction grow out of the land beneath your       feet.''        This quote, attributed to Cather, is an apt summation of       the author's life and work.        Cather's vivid, reflective writing has become synonymous       with the pioneer spirit of Nebraska.        Her fiction--epitomized by the Great Plains novels O       Pioneers!, The Song of the Lark, and My Antonia--truly feels       like it grew from the soil of Nebraska.        Cather herself grew from that land. Her family settled in       Red Cloud while she was still a child, and her imaginative       mind put its roots down there in Webster County.        For decades until her death in 1947, Cather was unable to       shake her creative spirit away from its home in the open       plains of the heartland.        The unveiling of Cather's statue is especially poignant for       me, because Cather's fiction is not the only art to grow out       of the land beneath her feet.        In 2006, my sister-in-law Nadine McHenry's art was selected       as part of the annual Willa Cather Conference organized by       the Cather Foundation.        ``I am a Nebraska painter and my feet stand on the same       prairie grasses that Cather stood on,'' Nadine wrote of her       painting exhibition.        Nadine's impressionistic paintings are a blend. They blend       an imaginative representation of Cather's prose with Nadine's       own personal experience on our family's ranch in the Nebraska       Sandhills.        Four of the paintings--``Longing,'' ``Isolation,''       ``Pioneering the Way,'' and ``Way Ahead''--draw new vigor out       of Cather's century-old works, each created as an expression       of a different quote by the novelist.        Nadine's art illustrates the profound resonance of Cather's       writing for those of us who call Nebraska home.        That resonance--the talent and imagination immortalized in       Cather's indelible novels--is what endows her with the       significance to be placed in the U.S. Capitol as a       representation of Nebraska's best.        I'll end with words from Cather's ``Song of the Lark,''       words that strike a sense of understanding into the heart of       any Nebraskan who has read her work.        ``What was any art but a mold to imprison for a moment the       shining, elusive element which is life itself?''                            ____________________
