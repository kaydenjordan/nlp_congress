 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Rhode Island.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on behalf  of Senators Duckworth and Harris and myself for the House managers and  for the President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senator Reed and the  other Senators is for both parties, beginning with the House managers:         It has been reported that President Trump has not paid Rudy       Giuliani, his personal attorney, for his services. Can you       explain who has paid for Rudy Giuliani's legal fees,       international travel, and other expenses in his capacity as       President Trump's attorney and representative?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. A short answer to the question is, I don't know  who is paying Rudy Giuliani's fees, and if he is not being paid by the  President to conduct this domestic political errand for which he has  devoted so much time, if other clients are paying and subsidizing his  work in that respect, it raises profound questions--questions that we  can't answer at this point.   There are some answers that we do know. As he has acknowledged, he is  not there to inform policy. So when counsel for the President says this  is a policy dispute and you can't impeach a President over policy, what  Rudy Giuliani was engaged in, by his own admission, has nothing to do  with policy--has nothing to do with policy.   And let me mention one other thing about this scheme that Giuliani  was orchestrating and the consequence of the argument that they would  make that quid pro quos are just fine. Let's say Rudy Giuliani does  another errand for the President--this time an errand in China--and he  says to the Chinese: We will give you a favorable deal with respect to  Chinese farmers as opposed to American farmers. We will betray the  American farmer in the trade deal, but here is what we want. The quid  pro quo is we want you to do an investigation of the Bidens. You know  the one, the one the President has been calling for. They would say  that is OK. They would say that is a quid pro quo to help his  reelection. He can betray the American farmer; that is OK. That is  their argument. Where does that argument lead us? That is exactly the  kind of domestic, corrupt, political errand that Rudy Giuliani was  doing gratis, without payment--at least not payment, apparently, from  the President.    So who is paying the freight for it? I don't know who is directly  paying the freight for it, but I can tell you the whole country is  paying the freight for it because there are leaders around the world  who are watching this, and they are saying the American Presidency is  open for business. This President wants our help, and if we help him,  he will be grateful.   He will be grateful. Is that the kind of message we want to send to  the rest of the world? That is the result of normalizing lawlessness of  the kind that Rudy Giuliani was engaged in.   One other thing, if I have--my time is not expired.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. I am sorry; your time is expired. Counsel.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S700, January 30, 2020, third column, the following  appears: The CHIEF JUSTICE. I am sorry; your time is expired.      The online Record has been corrected to read: The CHIEF JUSTICE.  I am sorry; your time is expired. Counsel.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Senate, it  is hard for me to believe the words that just came out of the manager's  mouth: ``open for business.'' I will tell you who was open for  business. You know who was open for business? The Vice President of the  United States was charged by the then-President of the United States  with developing policies to avoid and assist in removing corruption  from Ukraine, and his son was on the board of a company that was under  investigation for Ukraine, and you are concerned about what Rudy  Giuliani, the President's lawyer, was doing when he was over trying to  determine what was going on in Ukraine?   And by the way, it is a little bit interesting to me--and my  colleague, the Deputy White House Counsel referred to this. It is a  little bit ironic to me that you are going to be questioning  conversations with foreign governments about investigations when three  of you--three Members of the Senate--Senator Menendez, Senator Leahy,  and Senator Durbin sent a letter that read something--quickly--like  this. They wrote the letter to the prosecutor general of Ukraine. They  said they are advocates--talking about the Congressmen--they are  ``strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine  [and] we believe that our cooperation . . . extend to such legal  matters, regardless of politics.'' And their concern was ongoing  investigations and whether the Mueller team was getting appropriate-- appropriate--responses from Ukraine regarding investigations of what?  The President of the United States. And you are asking about whether  foreign investigations are appropriate? I think it answers itself.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
