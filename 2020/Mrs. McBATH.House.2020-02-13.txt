 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, women have been fighting tooth and nail for decades to  be recognized as equal under the eyes of the law. While we made  significant gains, it is time for a full constitutional equality.   In 1866, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, a free-born Black woman,  addressed the National Women's Rights Convention in New York City, and  she said: ``Justice is not fulfilled so long as woman is unequal before  the law. We are all bound up together in one great bundle of humanity.  . . . Society cannot afford to neglect the enlightenment of any class  of its members.''   These words still hold true today for our mothers, for our daughters,  and for our future leaders. We must take up the mantle of the women who  came before us and pass this amendment for a more just future.
