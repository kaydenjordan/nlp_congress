 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I will be joined shortly by Senator  Moran, who is the ranking Republican on the Veterans' Committee, and  Senator Blumenthal, who has always been such a strong leader on many  issues related to veterans. We are here to talk about an amendment that  is before the Senate this week on the National Defense Authorization  Act. This is our moment. This is our moment.   I came to the floor last night and spoke on this, and I am here  again. And I am here not just on behalf of all the cosponsors of this  important amendment, which includes Senator Lindsey Graham, who is the  lead Republican on the amendment as well as, of course, the ranking  Republican, the highest Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee;  Senator Coons; Senator Moran; Senator Blumenthal; Senator Murkowski;  Senator Shaheen; Senator Wicker, who I note is the ranking Republican  on the Armed Services Committee; Senator Durbin, the chair of the  Judiciary Committee; Senator Tillis; and Senator Mullin.   Of course, this bill is supported by many, many other Senators--in  fact, the majority of the U.S. Senate, which sounds to me like when you  have the numbers, you should be able to have a vote, and that is what I  am asking for today.   I am pushing this because this is our moment. We have had 2 years to  show the world whether or not we are going to stand with those who  stood with us. For 2 years, we have worked on this bill. Our colleagues  have had plenty of time to look at it. They have had input. It was  introduced last year.   But you know who else is watching? Our military is watching. Every  single one of the Senators in this Chamber have been approached by a  member of our military, whether it is on Veterans Day, whether it is on  Memorial Day, whether it is just walking down the street. Those who  served in Afghanistan have come to us and said: Hey, I wouldn't be here  today if this guy hadn't stood with me on the battlefield or if this  interpreter hadn't helped me out or if this guy had not put his family  on the line to gather intelligence.   And they have all asked us the same thing, and that is to not leave  these courageous Afghans, who stood with our military, in limbo. We did  not leave the Hmong and the Vietnamese who came over to our country.  After that withdrawal and evacuation, we did not leave them in limbo.  They were given a legal status, which allowed them to work, which  allowed them to pursue citizenship at some point. I know because I have  the biggest population of Hmong, next to California, in my State.   What do they do now, generations later? They are police officers.  They are firefighters. They are teachers. They are elected officials.  They are pillars of our communities.   That is what we do. That is what we did when so many Cubans came over  to this country. We didn't just leave them in limbo. We included them  in the fabric of life of our country, and we are the richer for it.   But this, these Afghans--so many of them vouched for by the top  leaders in our military--they took bullets for us, literally, and we  must stand by them.   The decision we make right now of whether we live up to the covenant  we made to our Afghan allies is going to reverberate militarily and  diplomatically for longer than any of us will serve in this body  because the next time we are in a conflict and we ask people to serve  and to put themselves at risk and put their families at risk, do you  think they are not going to hear that 80,000 people are in complete  limbo if we don't do something about this?   This bill strengthens our national security. And I will give you a  long list of generals in a moment, very famous leaders in our military  who support this bill. It does right by our Afghans who worked  alongside our troops. And it shows the world that when the United  States of America makes a promise, when we make a covenant, that we  keep it.   Nearly 80,000 Afghans who sought refuge in our country after that  evacuation are in limbo. They are in our country. Let me repeat this.  They are here now. So we can choose to have some order here and have a  vetting process, which is why so many of my more conservative  colleagues are supporting this bill, are on this bill--because right  now that process isn't in place. So this will allow us to vet people  and then create some order so that  [[Page S3567]]  they have a provisional status in this country and they don't worry  that they are going to be sent back to live under the rule of the  Taliban, which certainly so many of them would be killed. Among them  were brave translators, humanitarian workers, courageous members of the  Afghan military who stood shoulder to shoulder with our troops.    We were right to help these people come to the United States. And now  it falls on us to uphold the covenant we made to them and help provide  them with the stability and the security they need to rebuild their  lives here. We may have disagreements--of course we do; our country  does on Afghanistan--but those need to be put aside right now to talk  about what we are going to do about the covenant that we made to these  people.   The bipartisan Afghan Adjustment Act creates a more thorough system,  as I noted, for our Afghan allies to apply for permanent legal status.  It requires that applicants go through vetting that is just as vigorous  as the vetting they would have gone through if they came to the United  States as a refugee, a standard that eight former Trump and George W.  Bush administration national security officials have called the gold  standard of vetting. Remember, there is no vetting right now. This is  the way you get the vetting. Senator Graham and I worked closely with  Senator Moran and others in this Chamber and the Department of Defense  to make sure that the bill's vetting provisions met that gold standard.   In addition, our legislation updates a Special Immigrant Visa  Program, also known as SIV, to include groups that should never have  been excluded from the program in the first place, including members of  the Female Tactical Team of Afghanistan, who had our troops' backs as  they pursued missions hunting down ISIS combatants on unforgiving  terrain and freeing prisoners from the grips of the Taliban.   The entire purpose of the Special Immigration Visa Program is to  provide permanent residency to those who have supported the United  States abroad. And it is clear to anyone that looks at this that these  brave women should qualify.   The Afghan Adjustment Act is supported by a bipartisan group of  Senators, as I just noted--11 cosponsors with many others that have  pledged their support. Many others. And it has earned the backing of  more than 60 organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars-- that is the VFW--and the American Legion.   This bill is a top priority for these two leading veterans groups.  They have contacted, literally, every Senator about the importance of  passing this bill. And I hope people will listen.   Who else is this supported by? Some of our Nation's most revered  military leaders, including Admirals Mike Mullen, William McRaven,  James Stavridis, and Generals Richard Myers of the Air Force, Joseph  Dunford from the Marine Corps, and Stan McChrystal from the Army.   We can decide that the thoughts of these military leaders aren't  important to us. We can decide they don't know what they are doing. I  think it is kind of the opposite, that maybe we should be listening to  them when they tell us this must happen.   Here are some of the stories:   Mahnaz, a commander of the Afghan National Army's Female Tactical  Platoon, who worked closely with our military to facilitate  conversations between our soldiers and the Afghan women they crossed  paths with in the field.   Ahmad, a pilot whose helicopter was shot down, not once, but twice.  Ahmad is in legal limbo. Speaking of his work with our troops, he said:         In the face of danger, we were united, we were relentless,       we were resilient.    Another pilot who wants his name not known because he is in fear of  what will happen to his family who are still back in Afghanistan, he  spent 10 years helping American soldiers identify Taliban positions in  the mountains of Afghanistan. He said his job was to ``capture the bad  guys like al-Qaida and Taliban.''   Or there is Nangialy, an Afghan interpreter who put his life on the  line to support our troops. Why? To use his words:         Same goal, same target, and same achievement.    A helicopter fighter pilot who also asked that his name not be  revealed, who worked with our troops to combat the Taliban in remote  areas of Afghanistan for 8 years--8 years--all the while thinking there  was a covenant that he was going to be able to come to this country and  people were going to protect him if needed. He survived being shot in  the face by flying bullets.   There is the story of Reggie, another Afghan interpreter. Remember,  being an interpreter in Afghanistan wasn't a desk job. You weren't  sitting in a conference room whispering to your boss what the words  were of someone whose language you don't understand. This meant working  shoulder to shoulder with our troops while they were on foreign soil.  Where the troops went, the interpreter went. If the troops got ambushed  by bullets, the interpreter got ambushed by bullets. If the troops got  bombed, the interpreter got bombed. That is a risk Reggie took every  day.   On August 8, 2012, Reggie was working on patrol with a group of  servicemembers including Army CPT Florent Groberg. Suddenly, a suicide  bomber approached. Groberg acted fast and protected other members of  his unit by shoving the bomber aside. But the vest still detonated,  leaving Groberg and Reggie bloody and fighting for every breath. The  explosion left Reggie with 23 pieces of shrapnel lodged in his own  body. But even still, he used the energy he had to go to Groberg's aid  and help him stop the bleeding.   To this day, as a result of the attack, Reggie has problems with his  left ear and can't control some of his body. That is what he sacrificed  for our troops. That is the depth of his covenant.   Reggie and Captain Groberg survived that attack, but, tragically,  several men did not. One of the men we lost that day was U.S. Air Force  Maj. Walter David Gray. He left behind his kids and his wife Heather.  In August 2021, 9 years after the attack, Heather learned from an NPR  reporter that Reggie was being targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan.  She wrote about that experience in an essay for the Dallas Morning  News. These are her words:         Turmoil is a good way to describe the emotions I felt when       I listened to the radio interview. It was Reggie in       Afghanistan . . . describing his service as a linguist to our       military and the danger his family was in if they didn't get       out.    She went on:         Reggie served with my husband, Maj. Walter David Gray, in       the Air Force and was with him when David and three others       were killed by suicide bombers in the Kunar Province on       August 8, 2012. After listening, I called my friend Captain       Florent Groberg who . . . confirmed that the man we were       hearing on the radio was indeed ``our guy.''        With that confirmation, my family spun into action, working       with others, both stateside and in Afghanistan, to get       Reggie, his wife, and their four young children through the       gauntlet outside [the] airport and onto a military plane.    It would be nearly November before Reggie's family was resettled in  Ft. Worth where the brother lives.   Heather's story continues. She wrote:         My family traveled 4 hours to Ft. Worth to meet them . . .       As we worked alongside each other assembling furniture,       Reggie showed me scars from the battle that killed my       husband. As he recounted stories of the many battles in which       he fought alongside our servicemembers, a car backfired       outside and he instinctively lowered to the floor . . . A few       weeks later, I brought my current husband and kids up to       spend Thanksgiving with Reggie's family. Despite the language       barrier and our different religions and cultures, we       celebrated as one big family, because that is what we are.    Reggie is among the Afghan allies who need Congress to pass the  Afghan Adjustment Act.   She added this:         Every time we see Reggie, he reminds my children that their       father died a hero.    This story of these Afghans has too many heroes to even keep track  of, and it is our job now to stand to their level, to simply pass this  amendment so they are put out of legal limbo--an amendment that is  cosponsored with conservative Republican Senators; an amendment  cosponsored by the lead Republican on the Veterans Committee, on the  Armed Services Committee, and on the Committee on the Judiciary.   I know my colleague Senator Moran is here and is ready to speak soon.  I welcome him here. I also saw Senator Blumenthal. I have more words  when they have completed their remarks, including the important letters  we have  [[Page S3568]]  seen from the leading veterans groups, the leading military generals-- some of whose names I have read--including the support that we have  gotten from those that served in Afghanistan in our own military.   I thank Senator Moran and his leadership on the PACT Act and so many  other bills for being here.    Thank you very much to Senator Coons for his strong  words and for focusing on what matters here, which is the people of our  own country, the military and those who support them, who believe that  this situation is simply untenable, that these Afghans who have stood  with us risk, at any moment, being deported--not right now because of  an order that President Biden has in place.   But that is not the only problem about uncertainty. The problem is  they can't go on with their lives as has happened with past evacuees-- after Cuba, I noted; after Vietnam. They are part of the fabric of life  in the United States of America now.   So let's hear what some of these security experts have to say. I am  going to read a portion of a letter that a group of them sent to  congressional leadership.   They said this. These aren't my words. This is theirs:         The bipartisan Afghan Adjustment Act honors our nation's       commitment to its wartime allies by providing a path to       permanent status for Afghan evacuees. It also ensures that       these evacuees are properly and scrupulously vetted prior to       considering them for such status.        The status quo leaves tens of thousands of evacuees in       legal limbo while failing to put to rest security concerns       raised in the Office of Inspector General reports.    So we can just pretend that report doesn't exist. We can just do  nothing. How can that be the answer?   (Mr. HICKENLOOPER assumed the Chair.)   How can the answer be to just put our heads in the sand while they  put their lives at risk for us in the sands of Afghanistan? That is why  we have to vote on this amendment.   They go on to say--the security experts who worked for a number of  Republican and Democratic Presidents: ``No action is not an option--we  urge you to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act.''   I want to repeat that last point: ``No action is not an option.''   Here is another letter of support from the former Ambassadors to  Afghanistan. Eight former U.S. Ambassadors--think about this: They  actually served in Afghanistan, and a number of us--probably nearly  everyone in this Chamber who was around during that time, which is many  of us, has visited with these Ambassadors during one President or  another. These Ambassadors served under Presidents George W. Bush,  Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. Each has an intimate  understanding of the stakes for getting this right.   They wrote together:         We are a group of retired Ambassadors, all of whom served       as Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan, who       have dedicated our professional lives to furthering America's       interests in the world. We are writing today because we are       convinced that  [[Page S3570]]       the Afghan Adjustment Act furthers those interests. The need       is urgent and time is short. . . . Without the Afghan       Adjustment Act, the task of American diplomacy will be much       more difficult. . . . [I]n the future our allies will be less       likely to support the U.S. missions if they see that our       Afghan partners are abandoned. In diplomacy, our words will       have lost meaning. . . . We urge you to pass the Afghan       Adjustment Act without delay.    I have spoken a lot about the Afghan stories today, as have my  colleagues--Senator Coons, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Moran-- because this is all personal for those of us who meet with our military  and hear the stories of those who saved their lives and who put their  lives on the line. But this is also about U.S. interests abroad and the  bigger story of our national security, about keeping our covenants when  we make promises, about expecting other people in other lands in future  conflicts to be willing to put themselves and their families at risk to  stand with our soldiers. Who is going to want to do that again if they  hear that we made promises over decades, and then, when those brave  people came to our country, we left them in legal limbo?   You heard the sad, tragic story out of Virginia a few weeks ago where  an Afghan who had served as an interpreter, who was working two jobs-- in legal limbo--was murdered as a Lyft driver in the middle of the  night. Those are the stories.   If people see that brinksmanship in Congress outweighs the promises  we made overseas, how can we lead?   Finally, I want to share some words from a group of more than three  dozen of our Nation's most esteemed military leaders, including Gen.  Joseph Dunford, U.S. Marine Corps; Admiral Mike Mullen, U.S. Navy; Gen.  Richard Myers, U.S. Air Force; Admiral Jim Stavridis, U.S. Navy; GEN  Peter Chiarelli, U.S. Army; GEN Stan McChrystal, U.S. Army; GEN David  McKiernan, U.S. Army; Admiral William McRaven, U.S. Navy; GEN Austin  Miller, U.S. Army; GEN John Nicholson, Jr., U.S. Army; GEN M. David  Rodriguez, U.S. Army; GEN Curtis Scaparrotti, U.S. Army; GEN Raymond A.  Thomas III, U.S. Army; GEN Joseph Votel, U.S. Army; and Gen. Mark  Welsh, U.S. Air Force.   I read the complete list last night, and I will do it again because  that gives you a sense of the kind of people I think we should be  listening to. Maybe it is worth my colleagues'--a minute of their time  to sit back and look at the people who are supporting this bill who  lead our military or have led our military. They have been resolute in  their support for the Afghan Adjustment Act, and the letter they sent  to congressional leadership makes that clear.   In their words--these are their words, not mine:         If Congress fails to enact the [Afghan Adjustment Act], the       United States will be less secure.    Let's read that again.         If Congress fails to enact the [Afghan Adjustment Act] the       United States will be less secure.    My colleague Senator Moran outlined why. It is about the fact that  there is no vetting in place, and this puts the vetting in place. Most  importantly, it is about the fact that to keep our Nation's leadership  and to be true to our covenant, we have to be true to our word.   Finally, we have the stories of people who, if allowed to flourish in  this country, will go on to do great things. So it is on us.   This is what else they wrote:         Potential allies will remember what happens now with our       Afghan allies. If we claim to support the troops and want to       enable their success in wartime, we must keep our commitments       today. The [Afghan Adjustment Act] will go a long way.        Additionally, without the fixes--    These are their words--       applied by the Afghan Adjustment Act, our immigration system       will be less capable, not more capable, of properly       processing and vetting applicants. The enhancements that the       Afghan Adjustment Act adds to the security screening process       of those who were evacuated are of critical importance to our       national security.    Mr. President, this is a harrowing warning from our military's top  brass.   Without the Afghan Adjustment Act, our soldiers will face new  obstacles in finding allies on the battlefield, because in the past, we  kept our covenants. We kept them. We kept them no matter if the  Congress was Democratic or Republican or the President was Democrat or  Republican. We kept our commitments.   All I am asking is that we have a vote--along with my colleagues--on  this amendment. And I will repeat: the leading Republicans on  Judiciary, Armed Services, and the Veterans' Committee--Senator Moran,  who is here today--are cosponsors of this amendment and are asking for  a vote. We have Senator Durbin, the chair of the Judiciary Committee,  asking for a vote. We have dozens and dozens of Senators who want to  get this done. We need this vote. We have Republicans, Democrats,  military and veterans groups, national security leaders, retired U.S.  Ambassadors to Afghanistan, and flag officers all on the same page.  They are not debating the nuances of every little word because that  bill has been out there now for 2 years.    We have strengthened it vastly in response to our colleagues. We have  made changes to it, and it is ready to go, just like our Afghan allies  have been ready to go because they have been here for nearly 2 years,  waiting for us to keep our covenants--ones who have taken bullets to  the face, ones who have lost legs. They are in our country waiting for  us to keep our covenant.   Until we get this done, we are essentially asking our allies--those  who took shrapnel across the body, those who took bullets to their  faces--to rebuild their lives on top of a trapdoor that could fall out  from under them at any second. Without the Afghan Adjustment Act, all  of it--their jobs, their homes, their safety, their families--could  disappear.   By including this amendment in the NDAA, we can strengthen the  national security of our country by making our vetting program more  thorough. You heard Senator Moran talk about that. It was a huge issue  with Senator Graham, and we worked together to build the gold standard,  which, as I mentioned, has been supported by leaders under every single  one of the last four Presidents.   So let's put aside the politics and distraction. Let's do what is  right for our national security, for our global reputation, and for  Afghan allies who shed blood alongside our troops on the battlefield.   This Defense bill is about what? No. 1 and foremost, our Nation's  security. So ask yourselves, those in the Gallery who have been  listening for the past hour to our colleagues on both sides of the  aisle who support this bill, does this amendment support our national  security? Of course it does. The top ranks, those who were in charge in  Afghanistan, have told us that it does.   No. 2, this bill that we are voting on this week and all the series  of amendments--it should set a moral example for the world. That is  what the United States did through World War I and through World War  II. We set a moral example for the world. That is what this amendment  does too. It sets a moral example for the world.   No. 3, we must show people everywhere that when America makes a  promise, when America makes a covenant, it must be kept.   The Afghan adjustment amendment advances all those objectives.   I am asking my colleagues simply for a vote. If they want to vote  against it, it is fine. They can vote against the generals and the VFW  and the American Legion. They all have differences. That is fine. But  why would we deny those who took bullets for us even the ability to  have a vote in what should be and has been called the Nation's greatest  deliberative body?   Let's be as great as we are supposed to be, which means standing by  our values and showing the world that our word, that America's  covenant, matters.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I follow the strong remarks from my  colleague from New Hampshire.   I also note that we are joined by the Senator from Massachusetts, who  has called out these delays from the very beginning, called out this  what I will call a blockade. We thank Senator Reed for his leadership  of this committee.   These Senators here before us work every single day to make sure our  military is strong. And what is going on with the Senator from Alabama,  he has placed a reckless hold--a reckless hold--on the nominations of  some of our Nation's finest public servants to more than 275 general  and flag officer positions.   These holds, as you have heard tonight, are preventing the Pentagon  from executing smooth leadership transitions for the most critical  roles in our Nation's security apparatus and leaving entire Agencies  without leaders.   I should note that our colleague from Alabama has not taken issue  with the quality of these 275 candidates. In fact, some of these  candidates were actually nominated for other positions by the previous  President and earned bipartisan support. But our colleague from  Alabama, for the reasons outlined by my friend from New Hampshire, is  now holding the entire military chain of command hostage.   When I was home this past weekend, when I was at festivals, when I  was in parades, everyone knew someone, everyone knew someone at the  Duluth Airshow that was being held up. Everyone had heard about it from  their friends. Certainly, every marine I met, they knew what was going  on. So if people think this is just politics as usual and one Senator  can just hold up the promotions and the positions of these fine public  servants, they are wrong. People have noticed.   For example, we are currently without a confirmed Commandant of the  Marine Corps. Our country has not been in this position since 1911. To  say it in a different way, in 112 years, we have never let this role  sit vacant until today because of one single Senator and his views,  which, by the way, are not consistent with the majority of the American  people's views.   My colleague has also stalled the promotions of three esteemed  military leaders with strong ties to my own State. If you ask me,  careers of honorable service should not be met by the politics of  partisan spite.   My colleague's completely unnecessary interruption of promotions that  support our military's essential work comes at a time when having  steady, complete teams in place couldn't be more important. Whether you  look at Ukraine's existential fight against Russia or the ever-growing  threat of China, it is clear that the world needs America's leadership.   I spoke about this last night at length and today when it comes to  keeping our covenant with those who stood with us on the battlefield,  those who stood with us in Afghanistan. And here we are again tonight,  really talking about the same thing in a different way.   We can talk all we want on this floor about what goes on, but those  who actually serve, they deserve the best. And this is not the time to  let essential roles sit vacant. Our servicemembers and the civilians  who serve our military must be able to look to their leaders for  guidance and stability.   This blockade is creating uncertainty among the people whose job it  is to protect our Nation and forcing less experienced leaders to act in  more senior roles.   I don't want to wait around and see what the worst possible outcome  of delaying these transitions could be. In fact, I don't even want to  think about that. But because of my colleague's blockade, we have no  choice.   To use the words of one retired admiral, ``This is not a game.'' Our  country deserves better. The Senate must do better.   Every day this blockade, caused by one Senator--one Senator-- continues, it hurts our military, and it helps our enemies. We must end  the blockade now.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to honor the 25th anniversary of  the tragic passing of two fallen Capitol Police officers, Officer Jacob  J. Chestnut, Jr., and Detective John M. Gibson, who were killed while  bravely defending the Capitol on July 24, 1998.   In the afternoon of July 24, 1998, a lone gunman forced his way past  a security checkpoint, fatally shot Officer Chestnut, and ran toward  the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay. Detective Gibson, a member of  Representative DeLay's protective team, told others to hide and find  cover while he stood in defense until he was mortally wounded himself.  Office Chestnut and Detective Gibson made the ultimate sacrifice to  protect the lives of others in the Capitol that day.   Officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut, Jr., was a 20-year Air Force veteran,  having served two tours in Vietnam and retired as a master sergeant. He  has the distinction of being the first African-American to lie in honor  at the Capitol.   Detective John Michael Gibson had served with the U.S. Capitol Police  for 18 years. He left behind his wife, a 17-year-old daughter, and two  sons, 14 and 15 years old. He lay in honor with Officer Chestnut in the  Capitol Rotunda.   Both men were buried with full honors in Arlington National Cemetery.  These men gave their lives here on the grounds of the Capitol, in  defense of our democracy. In the days that followed, Representative  DeLay stated that their deaths symbolized ``the sacrifices of thousands  of police officers across the Nation who do their duty to serve and  protect the public, sometimes under great abuse, sometimes under great  disregard, and many times people take them for granted. It all comes  together when an incident like this happens and we realize how much we  owe to police officers all over this country.''   The men and women of the Capitol Police put their lives on the line  every day, and each and every one of us who works here are indebted to  their sacrifice. Today we remember Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective  John Gibson while thanking all of the officers of the U.S. Capitol  Police Department.                            ____________________
