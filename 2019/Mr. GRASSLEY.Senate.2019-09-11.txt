 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 1 minute.    Madam President, the Chaplain opened our Senate in  prayer reminding everybody of what happened 18 years ago today: a  disastrous attack on the United States. So referring to that same 18  years, I say our Nation changed forever following an act of cowardice  from the enemies of freedom. The events of September 11 have left an  indelible mark on American and world history and certainly on the lives  of the victims' families. We pray now, as we did then, that God may  heal the wounds of those injured and the wounds left by those lost that  day, that they may find peace on this solemn day.   Let us recall the sacrifices made that day to preserve our way of  life and honor each day the pledge ``Never forget.''   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
