 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding to me here this afternoon.   I come to the floor here of the United States House of  Representatives with a specific purpose today, and that is to address  an issue that has become a controversy.   I regret that I made a freshman mistake a week ago today when I took  a call from a reporter from the New York Times, and that was a 56- minute interview, without a tape, that resulted in a long article. In  that article were snippets of the 56-minute interview.   Part of that inquiry was about the history of immigration policy in  this country for over the last, say, 18 or so years, of which I have  been a significant part, especially in Iowa, as we have a voice to  shape policy and help these presidential candidates move on to the Oval  Office.   I am grateful that much of the policy that was debated then is in the  Oval Office today, and it is being debated all over this country. But  one phrase in that long article has created an unnecessary controversy.   That was my mistake, Mr. Speaker, so I want to start this out with  some context of that discussion, and that is this: That if you can  control the language, you can control the policy.   Labels have been hurled in this country at people like we have never  seen in this history of America. I made a point of this in a September  12 tweet that I sent out as a component of this broader dialogue, and  here is the tweet, verbatim, Mr. Speaker:   The word ``Nazi'' is injected into leftist talking points because the  worn out and exhausted word ``racist'' is overused and applied to  nearly everyone.                                time  1330    That is the foundation for at least part of that discussion with a  New York Times reporter, Mr. Speaker.   In that also was discussion of other terms that had been used, almost  always unjustly labeling otherwise innocent people the word ``racist,''  the word ``Nazi,'' the word ``fascist,'' the phrase ``white  nationalist,'' the phrase ``white supremacist.''   They even are derogatory toward Western civilization, which is the  foundation for the American civilization, and we are today the  flagship.   At this point, I will read the quote that had brought about this  controversy, Mr. Speaker, and this is from The New York Times article  titled: ``Before Trump, Steve King Set the Agenda for the Wall and  Anti-Immigrant Politics,'' which, by the way, is a bit pejorative,  because I have never been anti-immigrant. I have been anti-illegal  immigrant, and I remain that way.   But here is the quote. It says: `` `White nationalist, white  supremacist' ''--and this is from me, by the way, Mr. Speaker--``  `White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization--how did  that language become offensive?,' Mr. King said. `Why did I sit in  classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our  civilization?' ''   That is off of this article, and that is the substance of this  heartburn that seems to be churning across the media in America today.   So I look at that and I think, well, what was that conversation? It  was about how those words got plugged into our dialogue, not when the  words became offensive, which is what the technical interpretation of  this is. How did that language become offensive?   It is, how did that offensive language get injected into our  political dialogue? Who does that? How does it get done? How do they  get by with laying labels like this on people?   When I asked the question, ``Why did I sit in classes teaching me  about the merits of our history and our civilization?'' that response  was strictly for: Why did I sit in Western civilization classes to hear  about the merits of our history?   I have never sat in a class at any time and heard any merits about  any of those other names, including I have never heard a merit about  ``racist.'' I have never heard a merit about ``Nazi'' or ``Fascist'' or  ``white nationalist'' or ``white supremacist,'' but Western  civilization has merit, and I remain a defender.   So I put together a statement, which is public, and I choose to read  it into the Record now, Mr. Speaker, and it is this:   ``Today, the New York Times is suggesting that I am an advocate for  white nationalism and white supremacy. I want to make one thing  abundantly clear: I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they  define. Further, I condemn anyone that supports this evil and bigoted  ideology, which saw in its ultimate expression the systematic murder of  6 million innocent Jewish lives.   ``It's true that, like the Founding Fathers, I am an advocate for  Western civilization's values and that I profoundly believe that  America is the greatest tangible expression of these ideals the world  has ever seen. Under any fair political definition, I am simply an  American nationalist. America's values are expressed in our founding  documents. They are attainable by everyone, and we take pride that  people of all races, religions, and creeds from around the globe aspire  to achieve them. I am dedicated to keeping America this way.   ``This conviction does not make me a white nationalist or a white  supremacist. Once again, I reject those labels and the ideology that  they define. As I told the New York Times, `It's not about race. It's  never been about race.' One of my most strongly held beliefs is that we  are all created in God's image and that human life is sacred in all its  forms.''   All of my life's work, all of my public record, all of my bills, all  of my votes, all of my activities support that statement that human  life is sacred in all of its forms and that we are created in God's  image.   So, Mr. Speaker, I regret the heartburn that has poured forth upon  this Congress and upon this country, and especially in my State and in  my congressional district. But the people who know me know I wouldn't  have to even make this statement, because they do know me. They know my  life. They know my history. They know that I have lived in the same  place since 1978. There is nothing about my family or my history or my  neighborhood that would suggest that these false allegations could be  supported by any activity whatsoever.   I reject that ideology. I defend American civilization, which is an  essential component of Western civilization.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas again for the  opportunity to address you here on the floor of the United States House  of Representatives.
