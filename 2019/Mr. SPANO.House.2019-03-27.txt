 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Lakeland  Christian School Mock Trial team for winning second place in the  Florida High School Mock Trial Competition.   The team previously won first place in regionals and went on to win  not only second place among all teams in Florida but also the Stephen  Shenkman Professionalism Award and the Best Attorney award, which was  granted to Abby Branham.   In addition to Abby, the team included Ama Fosu, Annie Bolter, Trent  Curtis, Keaton Walding, Jace Gravitt, Faith Nagy, Emily Branham, Lucy  Bolter, Seth Martinez, Tag Hunt, Riley Rhoden, Carter Sawicki, Haley  Caylor, and Aline Peek.   These students dedicated many hours of hard work and preparation to  learn the facts of their case and present them thoughtfully in the  competition. I am confident the knowledge they gained will help them  become active members of our community in college and beyond.   Their success comes not only from their own hard work but also from  the mentors who guided them through the process. The talented students  were coached by Chasity Branham, professor of criminal justice at Polk  State College, and Judge Melissa Gravitt, who recently assumed the  bench for Florida's 10th Judicial Circuit.   These women took many hours out of their busy schedules to impart  their passion for justice to these students. I appreciate all that they  do. Our next generation is made better by their service.                            ____________________
