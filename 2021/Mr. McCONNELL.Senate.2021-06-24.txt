 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, President Biden announced  that his administration would attempt to combat the alarming rise of  violent crime unfolding in cities across our country by making it  harder for law-abiding Americans to exercise their constitutional right  to keep and bear arms. And today our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee voted on the nomination of a person the President intends to  lead the effort. David Chipman was tapped to be Director of the Bureau  of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.   If he is confirmed, this nominee would bring to the job a dangerous  and unprecedented hostility to the Second Amendment. We know it from  his record as an anti-gun extremist, and we know it from the reputation  he earned among ATF veterans as an ``activist'' and ``a rabid  partisan.''   It should go without saying that these are exactly the wrong  motivations to encourage at the helm of the Agency charged with  firearms enforcement. Then again, it should also go without saying that  responsible gun owners don't cause surges in violent crime; they  actually prevent them.   Unfortunately, Democrats' latest bout of cognitive dissonance on  crime didn't begin just this week. Let's consider what has unfolded  over the past year. Last summer, across America, peaceful protests were  overtaken by lawless rioters. For nights on end, violence and looting  left cities in flames, and in too many State capitals and city halls,  local officials froze under pressure from the left and failed to  protect their citizens, their homes, and their businesses.   In fact, at every level of government, elected Democrats instead  rapidly embraced radical calls to ``defund the police.'' To the tune of  hundreds of millions of dollars, they succeeded in gutting local law  enforcement budgets and  [[Page S4759]]  validating the worst instincts of the anti-police agitators.   The president of the Minneapolis City Council called on her  colleagues to ``imagine a future without police.'' And sure enough, in  Los Angeles, police were told to make do after a cut of $150 million.  In Seattle, the police department budget shrank by nearly 20 percent.  Defunding efforts here in Washington were passed by committee  unanimously.   The Biden administration has amplified these efforts by appointing  avowed supporters of defunding the police, like Vanita Gupta and  Kristen Clarke, to high-ranking positions at the Justice Department,  the Agency charged with enforcing Federal criminal law.   Now, we didn't have to imagine the consequences of betraying the  brave officers charged with keeping the peace. Millions of Americans  have been living this dangerous new reality literally for months. Last  year closed with the Nation's sharpest 1-year increase in homicides in  decades. In New York City, the murder rate jumped nearly 45 percent,  and in my hometown of Louisville, it is already on pace this year to  exceed last year's all-time record.   New fears arose in communities across the country, and as Democrats  flirted with their imagined future without police, Americans did  exactly what you would expect of a free people: They looked to their  own defense and exercised their Second Amendment rights in record  numbers. The FBI processed nearly 40 million background checks on gun  purchasers last year, shattering previous records. And, nationwide, 40  percent of the guns sold last year were purchased by--listen to this-- first-time buyers. In particular, members of racial minority groups  joined the ranks of gun owners in record numbers.   So let's review. In city after city, powerful Democrats vocally  refused to uphold their responsibilities to protect public safety.  Violent crime filled the void. Against this backdrop, the American  people chose to defend themselves by exercising a core constitutional  right.   But now, as Democrats at the State and local level play politics with  public safety, Democrats here in Washington want to make gun ownership  in America more burdensome than ever. Prominent voices on the left,  including some of our colleagues, fanned the flames of a dangerously  misguided experiment, and law-abiding Americans are paying the price.   Here in the Senate, Republicans have been focused all along on making  American communities actually safer. It is why we supported Tim Scott's  efforts to pass police reform that empowered law enforcement to do  their jobs very well rather than federalizing and defunding the police.   It is the reason that Chairman Lindsey Graham and 46 other Republican  Senators joined me today to demand publicly that the Department of  Justice cease its efforts to restrict the use of common pistol-brace  devices by lawful gun owners. We are talking about a plan that would  turn millions of law-abiding Americans into criminals with a stroke of  the pen. It would be an outrageous violation, and we expect DOJ to  withdraw this attempted confiscation. Federal law enforcement should  focus on the criminals committing violent crimes in American cities,  not on law-abiding gun owners.   So Republicans will continue to stand for Americans' Second Amendment  rights, as a matter of public safety and of basic freedoms.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, as the Senate headed  into the June work period, the Democratic leader laid out an agenda  that was transparently designed to fail, a string of far-left proposals  that were not intended to become law or to make a difference in the  lives of the American people. They were designed to fail and provide  political theater for liberal activists.   And sure enough, the Senate did reject Democrats' brazen attempt to  rewrite the rules of American elections, permanently, to their own  advantage. We did reject their bid to exploit the cause of paycheck  fairness to fill the pockets of the trial bar. And other radical  proposals, like the one to impose crushing legal penalties on  organizations that failed to conform to leftwing social preferences,  didn't make it to the floor.   But, let's remember, this was never just about policy. If our  colleagues actually believed that the substance of their plans were  viable, they would have submitted more to scrutiny in committee. We  know how things work in this body when a narrow majority actually wants  to make a law. That is not what we have actually seen.   So Senate Democrats weren't out to pass any legislation this month.  Their designed-to-fail agenda was supposed to indicate that the  institution of the Senate itself was somehow broken. And on this count,  our friends across the aisle failed spectacularly.    See, the Framers designed the upper Chamber, our Chamber, to be a  proving ground, a place where good ideas would rise to meet high  standards and bad ones would actually fall flat. So this month our  Senate colleagues proved that the Senate is working quite well.   We turned away an underhanded attempt to open American employers to a  new form of unlimited predatory liability and a hostile takeover of our  election system. And the whole time, productive work continued on  bipartisan proposals that are actually--actually--intended to become  law. From infrastructure to agriculture, many of our colleagues have  been hard at work demonstrating the right way to go about legislating.  In the Commerce and EPW Committees, they approved smart legislation  with wide bipartisan votes. This morning on the floor, we considered  another bill from Senator Braun that more than half of our colleagues  actually cosponsored.   So as we head back to our home States and take time to celebrate our  Nation's founding, let's double down on efforts like these and leave  designed-to-fail partisan antics in June.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on one final matter, earlier today,  a bipartisan group of infrastructure negotiators took the results of  their efforts down to President Biden. It was an encouraging sign of  progress after leading Democrats had gone out of their way to slow the  process.   Remember, at the first sign of an agreement last night and then again  this morning, both the Democratic leader and the Speaker of the House  made it clear they would hold a bipartisan agreement hostage, demanding  trillions of dollars in wasteful spending and job-killing tax increases  in return for even considering it. The top two Democrats literally  pulled the rug out from under their bipartisan negotiators with these  unserious demands before they had even made it down to the White House.   So President Biden's show of support earlier today appeared to be a  major breakthrough for earning Democrats' support, but, alas, that  optimism was short-lived. Less than 2 hours after publicly commending  our colleagues and actually endorsing the bipartisan agreement, the  President took the extraordinary step of threatening to veto it. It was  a tale of two press conferences--endorse the agreement in one breath  and threaten to veto it in the next. Less than 2 hours. It almost makes  your head spin. Less than 2 hours. As I said, it almost makes your head  spin--an expression of bipartisanship and then an ultimatum on behalf  of your leftwing base.   I have no doubt the President is under enormous pressure from some on  the left to deliver on a laundry list of radical climate demands. The  Democratic leader and the Speaker have already made clear they will do  whatever it takes to keep their runaway spending train chugging along  all summer, and more and more Members of their party are having to  contort their positions to keep pace with the expectations of the Green  New Deal fringe. But, really, caving completely in less than 2 hours?  That is not the way to show you are serious about getting a bipartisan  outcome.   So, look, I hope our colleagues can recover and get their good-faith  efforts back on track.
