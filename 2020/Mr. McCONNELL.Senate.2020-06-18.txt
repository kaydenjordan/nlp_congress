 Madam President, the Senate has been confronting  issues of historic importance on the homefront.   Just since March, we sent historic resources to the healthcare fight  against COVID-19 on an overwhelming bipartisan basis. We passed the  largest rescue package in American history on a bipartisan basis. We  just passed a generational bill for our public lands, also on a  bipartisan basis.   Yesterday, the junior Senator from South Carolina introduced a major  proposal to reform policing and promote racial justice. If our  colleagues across the aisle can put politics aside and join us in a  real discussion, then on this issue, too, we should be able to make law  on a bipartisan basis.   The Senate has led and is leading the way toward serious solutions.  At the same time, developments around the world continue to remind us  that the safety and interests of the American people are also  threatened from beyond our shores. Just 2 weeks ago, I explained how  the Chinese Communist Party has used the pandemic they helped worsen as  a smokescreen for ratcheting up their oppression in Hong Kong and  advancing their control and influence throughout the region. It hasn't  stopped.   At sea, they have stepped up their menacing of Japan near the Senkaku  Islands. In the skies, Chinese jets have intruded into Taiwanese  airspace four separate times in a matter of days. On land, for the sake  of grabbing territory, the PLA appears to have instigated the worst  violent clash between China and India since those nations went to war  way back in 1962.   Needless to say, the rest of the world has watched with grave concern  this violent exchange between two nuclear states. We are encouraging  deescalation and hoping for peace. The world could not have received a  clearer reminder that the PRC is dead set on brutalizing people within  their own borders--challenging and remaking the international order  anew in their image, to include literally redrawing world maps. Of  course, this is not exactly breaking news to any of us who have been  paying attention.   Earlier this year, the Senate passed legislation to give the  administration new tools to directly punish the CCP for its egregious-- egregious treatment of the Uighur people and the modern-day gulags it  has constructed there in the Xinjiang Province. The President signed it  into law yesterday.   Going back to the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act, which I wrote  back in 1992, the Senate has maintained a keen interest in the freedom  and autonomy of our friends in that city. Unfortunately, Beijing has  continued to tighten its grip there as well.  [[Page S3074]]  More and more Hongkongers find themselves facing an agonizing decision:  Can they remain in the city they love or must they flee elsewhere if  they want their children to grow up free?   As I have said often, every nation that cares about democracy and  stability has a stake in ensuring that Beijing's actions in Hong Kong  carry consequences. I encourage the administration to use the tools  Congress has given it and to work with like-minded nations to impose  those costs, but punishing the PRC cannot be our only priority. We also  need to actively help the people of Hong Kong.   Led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the United Kingdom says they are  preparing to offer visas to potentially millions of Hongkongers. In  addition to funding democracy programming and supporting legal  assistance, we must also consider ways to welcome Hongkongers and other  Chinese dissidents to America.   Chinese Americans have formed part of the backbone of our Nation for  about two centuries. Against headwinds of racial prejudice, Chinese  immigrants literally helped build modern America as we know it.  Generations of Chinese Americans have enriched our society and fueled  our economic prosperity. Not surprisingly, I am particularly partial to  the Secretary of Transportation, whose parents fled Communist rule. She  has served her country across four Presidential administrations,  including as the first Chinese American to ever serve in a President's  Cabinet.   If some of the same brave Hongkongers who have stood up for liberty  waving our American flag and singing our American national anthem would  like to come here and join us, we should welcome them warmly.   Of course, this Senate is not only acting with respect to China.  Earlier this year, at my urging, the Senate enacted the Caesar Syria  Civilian Protection Act, and this week, the administration is using  these tools to impose painful new sanctions on the brutal regime of  Bashar Assad.   With the help of Russian airpower, Iranian advisers, and manpower  from Hezbollah terrorists, Assad has recaptured military control of  most of the territory he had lost during 9 years of civil war, but he  has effectively destroyed his own country in an effort to save his  regime.   Assad faces renewed protests across the country, infighting within  his regime and family, and a Syrian economy that is in free fall.  Because of this Congress and this administration, the cashflow to these  butchers is going to shrink, and the price that leaders and businessmen  in Tehran, Beirut, Cairo, Moscow, and Beijing will have to pay to do  business with the regime will grow.   These new steps will help us achieve our objective: creating leverage  for diplomats and our partners on the ground to negotiate a political  solution and finally end the war. To maintain this pressure, we should  keep our limited physical presence in Syria. We should work to bring  our NATO ally Turkey back onto the right side, and we should preserve  the deterrence that President Trump has rebuilt against Iran, to keep  checking their influence in Syria and throughout the Middle East                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, later today, the  Senate will confirm Judge Justin Walker of Kentucky to join the DC  Circuit Court of Appeals.   Now, as I have noted in just the last several weeks, Judge Walker has  given the Senate several new reasons to support his nomination to the  second most important Federal bench.   In testimony before our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, he  demonstrated an impressive grasp of legal precedent. At his current  post as district judge for the Western District of Kentucky, he  eloquently applied this understanding to uphold Americans' religious  liberty, and he earned the approval of the American Bar Association  with a rating of ``well-qualified.''   But, of course, Judge Walker's credentials were already sterling.  Long before this nominee began practicing and then applying the law, he  was collecting plaudits for his excellence at studying it.   Judge Walker, as I mentioned before, graduated from Duke University  summa cum laude, and Harvard Law School magna cum laude. Those  credentials can easily lead someone to an elite law firm in a big city,  but instead, it led Judge Walker to clerkships for then-Judge Brett  Kavanaugh and then-Justice Anthony Kennedy.   He then went back home to the University of Louisville Law School. He  quickly became a star faculty member, producing distinguished  scholarship on a wide range of legal issues. Once Judge Walker took his  current seat on the bench for the Western District of Kentucky, he  wasted no time building an equally strong reputation for the fairness  and open-mindedness that Americans deserve from their judges.   In one letter to our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, 100  practicing lawyers from across Kentucky said:         If Judge Walker is confirmed, we could give our clients an       assessment of him for which any judge should strive: he is       sharp, fair, and will follow the law.    In another letter, 16 different State attorneys general told us:         As someone from outside the Beltway with a commitment to       the rule of law, we know that Judge Walker will listen to the       arguments of advocates appearing before him, that he will       weigh the facts against the law as it is written (and not as       he wishes it to be), and that he will fairly decide those       cases based upon controlling precedent.    These glowing assessments are not from elite corporate counsel or  frequent flyers on the DC Circuit. These are from men and women across  Kentucky and across America who have seen this man work and watched his  career.   Republican Presidents have a proud tradition of looking beyond  Washington to freshen up the DC Circuit with diverse perspectives from  across America. President Nixon thought this crucial court could use  the expertise of a Texan and a Minnesotan. President Reagan chose legal  minds from Colorado and North Carolina. President Bush 41 chose a South  Carolinian, and President Bush 43 a Californian.   So when the Senate confirms Judge Walker to this vacancy, we will not  just be promoting a widely admired legal expert and proven judge to a  role for which he is obviously qualified, we will also be adding to a  time-honored tradition of finding men and women from all across the  country to help ensure that this enormously consequential bench here in  our Nation's Capital is refreshed with talent from all parts of  America.   My fellow Kentuckians and I are sorry to part with this son in the  Bluegrass, but mostly we are proud because Judge Walker will be putting  his legal brilliance and his exceptional judicial temperament to work  not just for his home State but for our entire Nation and in even more  consequential ways. I look forward to voting to confirm Judge Justin  Walker, and I urge each of my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due a second reading.
