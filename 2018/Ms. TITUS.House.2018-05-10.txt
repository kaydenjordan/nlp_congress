 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, today we must decide if you are going to double down on  policies that have been an abject failure for the last three decades or  if you will chart a new course that doesn't repeat the same mistakes of  previous Congresses.   The first ``Screw Nevada'' bill was passed in 1982, and since that  time, Nevada's residents, elected officials, business leaders, and  health and environmental groups have steadfastly opposed the Yucca  Mountain repository.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record letters from over 100 groups in  opposition.                                              City of Las Vegas,                                         Las Vegas, NV, May 7, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steve Scalise,      House Majority Whip,      Washington, DC.        Dear Sirs: In 1987 Congress voted for the Department of       Energy (DOE) to build a nuclear waste repository at Yucca       Mountain without the support of Nevada. Now, the House of       Representatives is planning to consider H.R. 3053, The       Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act. I am writing to express       my vehement opposition to this legislation.        Yucca Mountain would cost U. S. taxpayers billions of       dollars and require the dangerous transportation of nuclear       waste across every state in the country before it arrives in       Nevada, which, by the way, produces no nuclear waste These       transports journey through communities in the nation whose       infrastructures are well-known to be rated at the dangerously       low, D+ level by highly renowned associations of engineers       and scientific professionals. Bridges and tunnels have not       been reinforced in decades, railroad tracks are faulty (as we       well know!), and roads are beyond needing repair and       replacement. No matter the transport vehicle used, the cargo       travels on challenged routes which are unknown to the public       and at times undeclared!        In my tenure as Mayor, every year I have warned my fellow       Mayors of the dangers of this transportation, and every year       the Mayors across the nation have passed a resolution at       their annual U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting requiring that       the U.S. Department of Energy instead focus on deactivating       and/or repurposing radioactive waste on site. High-priority       research is needed to identify methods for the safe treatment       and storage of radioactive waste at origination locations in       order to mitigate the health and environmental risks of       transporting low, high and mixed level waste to offsite       treatment facilities. Even Mayors with nuclear waste on their       doorsteps understand the dangers of transporting this waste        As Mayor of Las Vegas, I am fortunate to preside over a       beautiful city that is home to over 600,000 residents in one       of the fastest-growing areas in the nation boasting over 2.4       million residents. Additionally, 42 million visitors choose       the Las Vegas valley as a destination annually. Yucca       Mountain is less than 100 miles away from this gem in the       desert. I believe that DOE's Nuclear Regulatory Commission       should be required to have support from state, local and       tribal governments before constructing a nuclear waste       repository anywhere in the country Therefore, I urge you and       your colleagues to vote down H.R. 3053, which rejects science       and ignores our steadfast opposition            Sincerely,                                                   Carolyn Goodman,      Mayor.                                   ____                                                     Las Vegas Metro                                             Chamber of Commerce,                                         Las Vegas, NV, May 7, 2018.      Re The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018, H.R.           3053.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC 20515        Dear Mr. Speaker, Madam Leader, Chairman Walden, and       Ranking Member Pallone: The Las Vegas Metro Chamber of       Commerce/ (``Metro Chamber'') is Nevada's largest and most       diverse business organization, representing thousands of       employers who employ more than 200,000 Southern Nevadans. As       the Voice of Business in our state, its mission is to help       Nevada businesses succeed and create jobs. This includes       protecting our members from initiatives or legislation at all       levels of government that could hinder our state's economy,       impede job creation, and hamper development of our local       workforce.        As such, the Metro Chamber has been actively engaged with       Members of Congress, federal government agencies, Nevada's       Constitutional officers, state legislators, local government       leaders and entities, trade groups, employers, and residents       of the State of Nevada regarding its strong steadfast       opposition for more than two decades to the proposed Nuclear       Waste Repository Site at Yucca Mountain.        The Metro Chamber's position regarding the proposed Nuclear       Waste Repository Site at Yucca Mountain has not changed with       the introduction of H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy       Amendments Act of 2018. The Las Vegas Metro Chamber continues       to strongly oppose a Nuclear Waste Repository at Yucca       Mountain, as well as the transportation and storage of any       nuclear waste in Nevada, because of the potential negative       effect it could have on the safety and health of the visitors       and residents of Southern Nevada, as well as the chilling       long-term effect it could have on the economy.        The proposed legislation would allow for the storage of       approximately 110,000 metric tons of nuclear waste less than       90 miles from Las Vegas, and is a significant concern to the       business community and residents as it could pose a national       security and health threat. The close proximity of such a       facility to Las Vegas could also damage the tourism-based       economy of Southern Nevada. In 2017, Southern Nevada hosted       approximately 42.2 million visitors, whose direct and       indirect economic impact is $58.8 billion. This translates to       about a total of 391,000 jobs and $16.4 billion in wages for       our region. The reality is that Southern Nevada is the       economic engine of the State, and it is incumbent on all       stakeholders of our region's economy and future prospects for       growth to protect the well-being of all of our residents and       visitors.        The potential terrorist threats, environmental impacts, and       transportation challenges, as well as the safety of storing       nuclear waste material, are too great of a risk on our       region's economy. Residents and visitors must feel safe in       their communities and the storage of nuclear waste at Yucca       Mountain could fundamentally undermine that safety.       Unfortunately, the passage of H.R. 3053 may only elevate Las       Vegas' profile for a potential terrorist attack. We cannot       risk such a scenario, since any incident with the transport       or storage of nuclear waste could have a severe and negative       economic impact on Southern Nevada's economy.        The Metro Chamber is also adamantly opposed to the       temporary storage of any nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain,       which includes reprocessed fuel. The reprocessing of nuclear       waste requires large amount of water, which is a concern to       businesses, local governments, residents and regional water       agencies since the region remains in a severe drought.        In addition, Nevada is ranked by the U.S. Geological Survey       as the fourth most active seismic area in the United States.       The potential for seismic activity in the region raises       serious questions about the logic and prudency of storing       nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. Seismic activity in the       region is another reason why Yucca Mountain is not a feasible       or practical site for the storage of nuclear waste.        The storage of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain should not       only be a concern for Southern Nevadans but also for the       residents of 329 Congressional Districts in 44 states that       nuclear waste shipments must pass through to get to Yucca       Mountain. The transport and safety of these shipments need to       be part of a national conversation and the potential impacts       of any incident during transportation of these casks by rail       and truck should not be underestimated. While the people of       Southern Nevada have been vigilant about the potential       dangers of the transportation of this toxic material, fellow       citizens across the country who live in states through which       this waste would be transported may not be aware and deserve       the opportunity to learn the facts about how this plan would       impact their lives and livelihoods.        Thank you for allowing the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of       Commerce to offer its concerns and strong opposition as       associated with the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository       Site, as proposed by H.R. 3053.            Sincerely,      Mary Beth Sewald,        President & CEO.      Michael Bolognini,        Chairman, Board of Trustees.      Hugh Anderson,        Chairman, Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                        May 7, 2018.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members,       the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose H.R. 3053,       the ``Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017'' (115th       Congress, 1st Session). This bill will put our nation's       nuclear waste storage policy on the wrong track yet again. It       ignores environmental concerns, states' rights and consent to       host the waste in the first instance, and attempts to       truncate public review in order to force a ``solution''--      either Yucca Mountain or a new consolidated interim storage       site--that have both proven to be unworkable. Rather than       blindly charge forward at the cost of public safety and       public resources, we urge Congress to reject this bill and       start the important and necessary work on a comprehensive set       of hearings to commence building a publicly accepted, consent       based repository program.  [[Page H3896]]         The bill you will vote on retains the flaws contained in       its earlier forms. Some of these harms include unwise efforts       to recommence the licensing process for proposed repository       at Nevada's Yucca Mountain. This is a project certain to fail       the NRC's licensing process due to the geology and hydrology       of the site that make it unsuitable for isolating spent       nuclear fuel for the required time. Next, the draft       legislation suggests going forward with a consolidated       storage proposal before working out the details of a       comprehensive legislative path to solve the nuclear waste       problem, entirely severing the link between storage and       disposal, and thus creating, an overwhelming risk that an       interim storage site will determine or function as de facto       final resting place for nuclear waste. The draft provides no       safety, environmental or public acceptance criteria, only       speed of siting and expense. This is precisely the formula       that produced the failure of the Yucca Mountain process and       made it, as the previous administration noted,       ``unworkable.''        Other provisions conflict with the well-established and       necessary requirements of the National Environmental Policy       Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq. Doing so exacerbates the public       interest community's (and that of Nevada) objection of the       last two decades--that the process of developing, licensing,       and setting environmental and oversight standards for the       proposed repository has been, and continues to be, rigged or       weakened to ensure that the site can be licensed, rather than       provide for safety over the length of time that the waste       remains dangerous to public health and the environment.        This bill was largely changed for the worse in committee.       The bill now sets us on path to go forward in the next few       years with a consolidated storage proposal before working out       the details of a comprehensive legislative path to solve the       nuclear waste problem and, frankly, creates an overwhelming       risk that an interim storage site in New Mexico, Utah, or       even Texas (although the Texas site just requested that its       license application be held in abeyance) will be the de facto       final resting place for nuclear waste.        This will not work. It is likely those states will, in some       form or another, resist being selected as the dumping ground       for the nation's nuclear waste without a meaningful consent       based process and regulatory authority that garners both       public acceptance and a scientifically defensible solution.       Further, and also just as damning, it sets up yet another       attempt to ship the waste to Yucca Mountain irrespective of       its certain likelihood of failing the regulatory process, or       seek to revive the licensed Private Fuel Storage site that       has been strongly opposed in Utah or even open up New       Mexico's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) facility for       spent nuclear fuel disposal despite strong opposition and       contrary to 25 years of federal law. The latter site also was       designed and intended for nuclear waste with trace levels of       plutonium, not spent fuel (and we note, a site that has       already seen an accident dispersing plutonium throughout the       underground and into the environment, contaminating 22       workers, and thus the site was functionally inoperable for       years). All of this runs precisely counter to the core       admonition of the previous administration's Blue Ribbon       Commission on America's Nuclear Future (``BRC'') that       ``consent'' come first.        The waste will not be going anywhere for years and it       should be incumbent on Congress to fix problems in a       meaningful fashion, not attempt an expedient solution that is       destined to fail, again.        Our concerns, many of which were detailed above or in       earlier letters, remain. We would be pleased to work with any       representative on a feasible, constructive path forward, but       this legislation would put the nation's nuclear waste storage       policy on the wrong track yet again and we urge you to reject       it.

Dear Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       undersigned organizations and businesses write to express our       vehement opposition to H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy       Amendments Act of 2017, which is scheduled to be considered       by the House of Representatives this week.        By reviving licensing activities for Yucca Mountain as a       nuclear waste repository, this legislation has the potential       to adversely impact citizens and businesses located in       Nevada.        Yucca Mountain is located just 90 miles from the world's       premier tourist, convention and entertainment destination in       Las Vegas, Nevada, which welcomed nearly 43 million visitors       last year. Las Vegas is once again on pace to meet or break       that number with over  [[Page H3897]]       10 million visitors already accounted for in 2018. The       Greater Las Vegas area is one of the fastest growing in the       U.S. with a population that now exceeds 2.1 million people       according to an estimate from the U.S. Census Bureau. Safety       and security remain a top priority for all Americans and any       problems with the transport of more than 110,000 metric tons       of nuclear waste to the site throughout the country, or       issues with its storage there, would bring potentially       devastating consequences to the local, state and national       communities. Moreover, with taxes on Nevada's tourism       industry providing 42 percent of the state general fund, even       a modest decline in visitors' perception about the region       could have severe negative implications for the state's       economy and future growth.        We stand with the many concerned citizens, small business       operators and bipartisan members of the Nevada delegation in       staunch opposition to any attempt to restart the repository       licensing process and will work tirelessly to ensure that       radioactive waste is never stored anywhere near the world's       entertainment capital in Las Vegas.        We strongly urge members to vote against this flawed       legislation and, instead, explore alternative solutions that       respect state sovereignty and do not put Nevada's citizens       and economy at risk.        Sincerely,        Geoff Freeman, President and CEO--American Gaming       Association; Virginia Valentine, President--Nevada Resort       Association; Mary Beth Sewald, President and CEO--Las Vegas       Metro Chamber of Commerce; Rossi Ralenkotter, CEO--Las Vegas       Convention & Visitors Authority; James Murren, Chairman and       CEO--MGM Resorts International; Joe Asher, CEO--William Hill       U.S.; Keith Smith, President and CEO--Boyd Gaming       Corporation; Mark P.

Oppose H.R. 3053, Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of           2017.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: UNITE HERE represents more workers in       Nevada than any other union in the country. Our Nevada       affiliate, Culinary Local 226, represents 60,000 workers who       are the backbone to the tourism and hospitality industry of       the Strip. The role of our union is to fight for what's best       for these 60,000 workers and their families, and in the case       of H.R. 3053 the best interest of our members is clearly to       vote no and oppose all attempts to license a nuclear waste       repository at Yucca Mountain.        Turning Yucca Mountain into a nuclear dumping ground will       put all 60,000 UNITE HERE members of Culinary 226 and their       families at enormous risk, along with all 2.1 million people       living in the Greater Las Vegas area. Yucca Mountain is       dangerously close to where our members and their families       live, as well as to the economic heartbeat of Nevada that       keeps the economy afloat--only 90 miles from the Las Vegas       Strip.        The continued health of our members and their families in       Nevada is on stake with your vote on H.R. 3053. To keep       60,000 UNITE HERE workers safe in Nevada, we urge you to       oppose H.R. 3053.            Sincerely,                                                         D. Taylor,                                           International President.     Mr. Chair, you have heard that the legislation before you  now, ``Screw Nevada 2.0,'' is a work of compromise, a bipartisan  effort, not perfect, but a step forward. Well, that, frankly, is an  opinion. It is not the facts. Here are the facts:   The legislation overrides environmental laws, allowing the EPA to  move the goalposts in terms of radiation limits to ensure that nothing  will ever interfere with the agenda of the nuclear industry.   It sets up a consent-based process for the establishment of an  interim storage facility but imposes a permanent facility at Yucca  Mountain.   It increases the amount of nuclear waste to be dumped in Nevada by 37  percent, 110 metric tons more that were not considered in any of the  environmental or safety studies being used to justify the project.   It also removes the prohibition currently in law that prohibits  Nevada from being the de facto interim storage facility until a  permanent one can be licensed.   It was also changed after passing out of committee to address the  high scoring costs, making it less likely that we get host benefits.    Mr. Chair, also, contrary to the sponsor's comments, the  area around Yucca Mountain is not some desolate area. It has iconic  wildlife, endangered species, and Native American artifacts.   Also, the proposed facility sits above the water table and on an  active fault and can only be reached by roads that travel through 329  of your congressional districts.   Finally, like New Mexico, the people in Nevada have suffered from  tests of atomic weapons that the government told us: Don't worry; it  will be safe.   In short, this bill does nothing to really address the root of the  problem, and I urge Members to vote against it.   It has cost us 36 years and $15 billion, and all we have to show for  it is a hole in the ground. We should be doing consent-based  decisionmaking that will move us forward and not continue this failed  policy that is bad politics and bad policy.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment, which is also supported by my  Nevada colleague (Mr. Kihuen) is very simple and straightforward. It  sets up consent-based site decisionmaking as an alternative to  ``Screwing Nevada 2.0,'' which just continues the process that has  lasted 36 years, has cost $15 billion, is going nowhere in the Senate,  and has nothing to show for it but a big hole in the ground.   Consent-based siting, on the other hand, is fair. Nevada doesn't want  your nuclear waste. We didn't get any benefits from it, and we didn't  generate it. But Texas and New Mexico do want it, so why not let them  have it?   It is also a sound policy. It was the number one recommendation of  the esteemed Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. Now,  you can argue the politics, you can distort the science, you can assert  it is the law--as though a 1982 policy is the Ten Commandments--but you  can't have the truth.   Now, my colleagues don't want this dangerous waste in their backyards  any more than Nevadans do. I get that. That is pretty easy to  understand. But it is funny, they didn't mind the jobs; they didn't  mind the tax revenue, the cheap power, and the political support they  got from the nuclear power industry over the years that it has existed.  Now, they just want somebody else to clean up their mess.   Well, I say, instead of screwing Nevada one more time, why don't we  really work together so we can finally and effectively solve the  problem? We could do this with consent-based siting for both interim  and permanent storage facilities. This would be a real solution that  could take us into the future. So I would urge my colleagues to support  the Titus amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I would just respond to two things. I thank the gentleman  for recognizing what Nevada did to help win the Cold War. We were the  site of atomic testing for years. We still bear those scars. But this  is not about military waste; this is about commercial waste.   Second, while I appreciate the chairman's concern about Nevada and  giving us benefits, the health and safety of Nevadans is not for sale  to the nuclear power industry.   Mr. Chair, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  DeFazio), my colleague and the ranking member of the House  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Chairman, that is in Washington. It is not in Oregon.  If you don't even know where Hanford is, I am not sure you really  understand what took place there.   I would just say: The law of the land, that is a great argument. You  forgot about that argument when you tried to repeal ObamaCare 60 times  and have done everything you can to roll back Dodd-Frank. So law of the  land is a pretty weak, specious argument.   This is not just about the safety of Nevada. This is about doing what  is right, finding a policy that will work, that is based on consent,  that the experts say is the way to go, that has a chance to get out of  the Senate and really move us forward so we do quit wasting time, so we  do quit wasting money, and we find a real solution to  [[Page H3910]]  an issue that does affect the entire Nation.   That is why it should be consent based. That is why I think we should  support this amendment and oppose the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would say again, please keep in mind that  this has an opportunity to pass. It will really solve the problem. It  will not turn the clock back to an old way that has failed, that is  faulty science, bad politics, and even worse policy.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
