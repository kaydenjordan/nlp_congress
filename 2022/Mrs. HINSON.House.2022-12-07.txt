 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize NASA astronaut  [[Page H8807]]  Raja Chari, a native of Cedar Falls, Iowa, a decorated Air Force pilot,  and commander of the NASA SpaceX Crew-3 mission.   Raja recently returned from a successful mission to the International  Space Station, a milestone in U.S. space exploration. I had the  privilege of meeting Raja yesterday to hear more about his mission with  his team, and I appreciate his passion for ensuring that the U.S. wins  the 21st century space race--not China.   Raja is an inspiration to the next generation of aspiring astronauts,  fighter pilots, and scientists. He is a role model for my two boys, Max  and Jax, and other young Iowans who truly want to shoot for the stars.   From Cedar Falls, Iowa, to the International Space Station, Raja has  made America proud, and he has made Iowa proud.                            ____________________
