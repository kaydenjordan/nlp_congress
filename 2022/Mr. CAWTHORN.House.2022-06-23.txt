 Mr. Speaker, our Founders were clear. The Second  Amendment was designed as the backbone upon which individual rights and  liberties could be secured.   Efforts by the ruling class in our government are aimed at crippling  this Nation and corroding our Republic.  [[Page H5832]]    It is true: Red flag laws sound benign on paper. Flagging dangerous  individuals and keeping them from weaponry seems like a cut-and-dried  issue, but a simple cursory glance at the actions of our overreaching  Federal Government clearly shows that these laws are ripe for Federal  abuse. They will abuse your rights and mine.   Make no mistake, red flag laws will be used to flag those who vote  for freedom, strip them of their right to self-defense, and empower  faceless bureaucrats to dole out or not to dole out the right of self- defense to a downtrodden and oppressed class of citizens.   They will be weaponized to demonize and destroy political dissidents  in this country. If you raise your children to adhere to Proverbs  instead of POTUS, you may be stripped of your gun rights. If you vote  against the regime, you may be stripped of your gun rights. If you  refuse the medical decisions pushed by the regime, you may be stripped  of your gun rights.   To the American people, I say this: It is not a right if you have to  ask permission to exercise it. We are very near to this government  becoming the exact reason our Founders penned the Second Amendment, not  to hunt deer but to defend against tyranny or invasion.   Red flag laws sound harmless on paper. We all want to keep firearms  out of the hands of dangerous people, but remember who the government  says that you are. The CDC has labeled you a national security problem  for protecting your health. The FBI, last September, called your  mothers and wives domestic terrorists for protecting your children. A  House committee labeled half the country as coup-sympathetic just a few  weeks ago.   The same faceless fact checkers who censor your speech will seize  your sovereignty and come to your front door, and they won't be coming  with a clipboard and a smile.   These liberal lackeys will show up before dawn, invade your home,  seize your property, and smash any concept of individual liberty you  may possess. Remember the actions the ruling elite took against those  at Waco and Ruby Ridge.   We must wake up. We cannot trust this government, and we must not  give them more legal avenues to persecute Americans that they took an  oath to defend.               Investigate Fires at Food Processing Facilities     Mr. Speaker, what is next? You want our guns. You took  our gas. Now, it seems that even the simple act of providing food is  too difficult for this administration to accomplish.   Last week, according to The Washington Times, a fire ravaged a  Festive Foods plant near Waupaca, Wisconsin. Earlier this month, at a  JBS meatpacking plant near Green Bay, a fire caused nearly $30,000 in  damage. In April, fires destroyed the headquarters of Azure Standard, a  distributor of organic food in Oregon; the Taylor Farms processing  facility in Salinas, California; and an East Conway Beef & Pork butcher  shop and slaughterhouse in Conway, New Hampshire.   At least 12 U.S. food processing facilities have burned down in the  last 6 months. Does no one else believe that this is worth an  investigation?   This comes as 37 million chickens have been killed on U.S. poultry  farms this year due to the avian flu, the worst outbreak in recorded  U.S. history, and the deaths of at least 2,000 cattle in Kansas during  a heat wave this month.   These accidents are coming at a time of shortages across our Nation.  Essentials such as fuel, semiconductors, and even baby formula have  ceased being commodities and have become as rare as coherent speech  from the White House.   The American people have every right to be skeptical and to demand  answers about the incidents shutting down food facilities.   It begs the question: What exactly are they doing in the White House  about this? Why has a seemingly unexplainable series of food industry  accidents gone unreported by the media?   Mr. Speaker, does no one care that children are starving while you  and your colleagues feast at Le Diplomate?   We survived the Great Depression because our supply chains were local  and a large share of American households grew much of their own food. I  hope we are all practicing hunting and gardening because I am afraid  that we may need it soon.                            ____________________
