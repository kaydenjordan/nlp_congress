 Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Norton for that great  introduction.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 66, the Route 66  Centennial Commission Act, and I thank Mr. Davis for being so kind as  to begin the sponsorship of this bill because it is something that we  all share, and we are proud of it.                                time  1300    I also want to thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves for  their support in moving this bill quickly in this Congress. Last  Congress, we put it through--we almost got it through. But here we are  again, and we hope this time it will go through.   Route 66 runs east to west through my whole district as Foothill  Boulevard and Huntington Drive in the cities of La Verne, San Dimas,  Azusa, Duarte, and Monrovia.   My district's restaurants include great food, tacos, Mexican food,  Asian food, and great meals. And I challenge my friend to come and  visit us, so we can take him through the whole area.   The shops and businesses, like so many others dotting the interstate,  from the heartland to the West Coast, provide rest breaks for  travelers, allowing them to sample local flavors of the communities  that are proud to be connected with this iconic road.   The city of Duarte, home to the fabulous City of Hope, a cancer  treatment center, also celebrates Route 66 every September with a  parade of classic cars, equestrian groups, marching bands, and the  whole gamut. In fact, Route 66 signs have been a part of these  communities for many years.   The theme of the Los Angeles County Fair last year was Route 66, with  memorabilia and Route 66-themed movie nights. They also have indicated  strong support for again, next year, highlighting Route 66, so that  more people can be made aware of how important this route is.   States and local governments across the country are reinvesting in  Route 66 as an icon of American history and culture. The Federal  Government should be involved in this effort as well.   H.R. 66 creates a national commission to recommend activities to  commemorate the 100th anniversary of Route 66 in the year 2026. It will  also direct the Department of Transportation to develop a plan on the  preservation of Route 66. The Department is required to consult with  the eight States through which it travels, which include California,  Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois.   Madam Speaker, Route 66 is a significant part of America's past, but  it also continues to provide transportation, economic, and community  benefits to our societies today. We must continue to improve this  historic road so that many more generations can, in the words of Chuck  Berry, get their kicks on Route 66.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 66, not only  because it is the right thing to do, but it is a preservation of an  iconic portion of our history in the United States.
