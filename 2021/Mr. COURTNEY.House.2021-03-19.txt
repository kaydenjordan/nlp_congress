 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Budget  Committee for his and his committee staff's steady hand over the last  couple of months to make sure that the American Rescue Plan was enacted  last week.   Mr. Speaker, in that week's time up to today, the American people  have had a chance to listen to the debate and evaluate for themselves  what they think of the American Rescue Plan. A Morning Consult poll  that came out yesterday showed 72 percent support for the plan, 44  percent among Republicans across the country.   Why not? Ninety million Americans on Wednesday received $1,400 checks  totaling $242 billion. For those Americans who are not connected  digitally to the IRS, they are going to get their checks through the  mail.                                time  1000    For those Americans who are filing their 2020 tax returns, whose  income now qualifies them for the economic impact payments, they are  going to receive their checks.   On Monday, people who were on unemployment got an extension because  of the American Rescue Plan. These are working people in the service  sectors, in the commercial real estate sector, in most parts of the  economy that are still hurting out there.   Every ``no'' vote was a ``no'' vote in terms of people getting that  critical economic help.   Another vote of confidence happened on Wednesday, which is, the  Federal Reserve Board met and voted to keep their key benchmark rate at  zero, not just for a couple of weeks or a couple of months, but for the  balance of 2021, for all of 2022, and into 2023.   So for all of the historical arguments that we are overheating the  economy and inflation is going to go up, Jerome Powell, Donald Trump's  nominee as chair of the Federal Reserve, took questions for over an  hour on this inflation issue, argued, accurately, with a battalion of  economists that they have at the Federal Reserve that there is still  slack in this economy and 10 million folks on unemployment need to get  this type of fiscal relief that the American Rescue Plan responsibly  targeted, which is going to make sure that this country recovers as  soon as possible.   This is a routine bill today. We have done it over and over again in  the last 10 years. Vote ``yes'' and make sure that this economy, as the  Chairman of the Federal Reserve advised us, gets the help it needs.
