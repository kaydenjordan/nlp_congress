 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3233, the  National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United  States Capitol Complex Act.   On January 6, 2021, our democratic republic came under direct attack  in an attempt to block the certification of Joseph R. Biden as the duly  elected President of the United States of America. Donald Trump and  others sought to subvert the will of voters when they incited violent  rioters to invade the U.S. Capitol with the hope of overturning a  legitimate election. Criminals and domestic terrorists, many espousing  racist and hateful ideologies, desecrated the sacred center of the  people's government. This was terrifying and infuriating for those  whose lives were in danger and for the millions of Americans who  watched in horror. I am grateful for the actions of the U.S. Capitol  Police and DC Metropolitan Police officers who put their lives on the  line to protect this institution and the people who work here. I also  mourn for the lives that were lost.   Many questions remain about the actions of those involved and the  security response that day, as well as in the days prior to and  following the violent attack on the Capitol. The country deserves  answers. This independent, bipartisan commission will investigate and  report the facts surrounding the events of January 6. It will provide a  full and fair accounting of the mistakes made and lessons learned. And,  importantly, the commission will recommend steps that Congress and the  federal government can take to prevent future violence and strengthen  our democratic institutions.   Our Nation is resilient, and the Constitution will endure because of  the commitment of those who have sworn to support and defend it. In  keeping with my oath, I look forward to acting on the findings of the  National Commission so the country emerges stronger from this dark  chapter of its history.
