 Mr. President, it is my honor and privilege to pay tribute  to an outstanding leader and warrior, Air Force Gen. Darren W. McDew,  commander of U.S. Transportation Command. General McDew is retiring  this month, having served this great Nation for 36 years and completing  a most distinguished career.   General McDew graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1982,  where he was regimental commander and received a degree in civil  engineering. A command pilot in both the KC-135 and C-17, General McDew  held assignments from Maine to California, while accumulating over  3,300 hours in 10 different types of aircraft.   His desire to serve grew from the example set by his father who  achieved the rank of master sergeant in the Air Force. General McDew  has commanded at virtually every level that the Air Force has to offer:  squadron, group, wing, numbered Air Force, and major command. His first  command was of the 14th Airlift Squadron at Charleston Air Force Base.  He often speaks of his time leading the mighty Pelicans in the great  State of South Carolina as being one of his most rewarding assignments.   A constant voice of reason, motivation, and inspiration, General  McDew has devoted his life to this Nation. He has provided counsel to  three Presidents, served as the Air Force liaison to the U.S. Senate,  and built trust with the American people as the Air Force's Director of  Public Affairs. I personally have sought his advice, as have my  colleagues. The Members of this Chamber and workers across many parts  of the Federal Government will miss his leadership and candor.   General McDew's illustrious career is culminating with his current  position, where he leads the 144,000 men and women of U.S.  Transportation Command. He is responsible for coordinating the  Department of Defense's global deployment and distribution enterprise.  His transformational leadership has bolstered readiness, increased  cyber awareness and security, and prepared the Department of Defense  for challenging transportation and logistics missions in the future. He  challenged old ways of thinking and compelled the Joint Force to adapt  and evolve for the dynamic and uncertain security environment of  tomorrow.   For 36 years, his wife, Evelyn, has selflessly cared for the families  under his command and in their community. I cannot overstate the  importance of the support the spouses and families provide to their  servicemember in our Armed Forces. Service and sacrifice are not  limited to just the servicemember, but often extends to the entire  family. On behalf of the Senate, we thank Evelyn and their children,  Keisha and Keith, for their dedicated service to our military and our  Nation. The Air Force will not lose just General McDew, but an  exceptional family as well upon his retirement.   I would like to help close out the final chapter of this inspiring  airman and Joint Force leader's career with a heartfelt thank you from  all the men and women of the U.S. Senate, the Congress, and Nation.  General McDew, Godspeed. We thank you, Evelyn, and the entire McDew  family, for their service over a remarkable 36-year career. We wish you  well in your future endeavors, and we pray that those who follow in  your footsteps do so in the same spirit of selfless service to our  great Nation that you have so ably shown.                            ____________________
