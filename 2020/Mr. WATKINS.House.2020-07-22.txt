 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of democracy  around the world and, in particular, in Jammu and Kashmir.   The human rights violations there are already alarming. And now with  COVID-19 plaguing the world, people there and everywhere must have  access to the tools necessary to fight this disease.   As telecommunication blackouts, suppression of media reports, human  rights abuses, and mass detentions continue in Jammu and Kashmir,  COVID-19 concerns are amplified. There have already been disturbing  reports that PPE and critical equipment are being blocked from entering  the region.   Without adequate resources and internet access, hospitals and medical  centers don't stand a chance. And lives being lost are lost to the  world.   I urge the global community and actors in the region to work together  to ensure that citizens of Jammu and Kashmir have access to the care,  services, and resources needed to defeat this disease.                            ____________________
