 Mr. Speaker, the Air Force Research Laboratory  Information Directorate, otherwise known as Rome Lab, stands at the  forefront of advanced cyber research and development projects within  the Air Force and plays an integral role in ensuring that our military  has the 21st century tools to dominate in cyberspace and on the  battlefield.   The importance of Rome Lab in my district in New York State cannot be  overstated. That is why I have continued to advocate and secure record  level funding for Rome Lab.   I am grateful to have Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman  Kay Granger, who has advocated for increasing by another $10 million  for our Federal funding to enhance current research and development  into our small Unmanned Aerial Systems, an essential tool of modern  warfare.   Additionally, our office secured over $200 million in funding, which  represents a 10 percent increase over last year's level, and another  $14.2 million in funding for a perimeter fence around Rome Lab to  secure this vitally important and highly sensitive asset.   The high-tech ecosystem and hub of research and development built  around Rome Lab has created a rich environment for entrepreneurs to  start new ventures and to thrive in the Mohawk Valley.   It is estimated that Rome Lab's impact in 2017 was over $392 million  in the surrounding five-county region.   It is an honor to represent the talented, dedicated, and hardworking  workforce at Rome Lab. It is critically important that we protect this  asset.                            ____________________
