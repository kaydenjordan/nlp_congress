 Mr. Speaker, this week, the Committee on  Ways and Means released a report highlighting the disparities between  the cost of prescription drugs in the United States and other developed  nations.   This report found that on average, drug prices in the United States  were nearly four times higher than prices in similar countries.   The sky-high cost of prescription drugs affects all of our  communities, and too many Americans cannot afford the medications they  need. The Medicare Program alone last year spent $135 for prescription  drugs.   It is a lot of money, but it is also a lot of leverage, a lot of  leverage that should be used to negotiate lower drug prices for  Medicare and for the American people.   Negotiated drug pricing should be enacted now.                            ____________________
