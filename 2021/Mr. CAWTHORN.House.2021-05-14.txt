 Madam Speaker, the deadly conflict plaguing Israel  becomes worse and worse each day.   Since Monday, the vile and despicable terrorist organization Hamas  has launched over 1,000 rockets from Gaza into Israeli population  centers.   The fact that Members of this body are speaking out in support of  these terrorists leaves me sickened. The differences between these two  sides are shocking. There is no debate that if Israel were to lay down  their arms entirely, there would be a genocide. But if Hamas were to  lay down their arms, there would be nothing but peace.   The fact that Representatives here in this Chamber would side with  violent extremists is mind-boggling. I encourage these Members to go to  Gaza, see how they murder members of the LGBTQ community, see how they  marginalize and abuse women, how they treat those of different faiths.   Let me be clear: There is no moral equivalency between these two  sides. It is our duty to protect Israel, and if anyone is to ever  invade Israel, I promise you that there is no crevice on Earth that  will conceal you from the wrath of God.   I would also be remiss to not recognize that some Members of this  body in the majority party have spoken out against Hamas, and for that,  I thank you.                            ____________________
