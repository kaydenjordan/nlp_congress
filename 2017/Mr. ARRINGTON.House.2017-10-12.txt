 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the people of  west Texas, home to 14 million acres of farmland, making it one of the  largest agriculture production regions in the world.   I have spent a lot of time with these plowboys and cowboys over the  years, and I can tell you this: these men and women don't work our land  and our cattle for the money, and they certainly don't do it for  recognition.   But today is National Farmers Day. Let's pause and pay tribute to the  American farmer.   Farming was man's first profession. Farming saved and sustained our  first colony at Jamestown. Farming helped fund the Revolution, securing  the very freedoms we have and cherish today.   Farming has allowed us to feed and clothe our own people, and that  food and fiber independence has contributed to America being the most  powerful, most prosperous, and most generous Nation in the history of  the world.   God bless our farmers.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen  hero, Officer Floyd East, Jr. Officer East was a police officer for the  Texas Tech University Police Department. On Monday, October 9, Officer  East completed his final patrol to protect and serve.   Officer East has been described by friends as someone you could rely  on and someone who was always there to help or just listen. No doubt,  he represented the very best of the values of Texas Tech.   His loss reminds us that policemen and -women put their lives at risk  every day. He left behind a loving wife, Carmen, who generously allowed  him to dedicate his life to keeping us safe.   To his children, Ana and Monica: Our prayers are with you. Scripture  tells us that ``there's no greater love than for a man to lay down his  life for his friends.'' That was God's greatest gift to this world and  that was your dad's greatest gift. Our Red Raider family is behind you,  and we will never forget Floyd and how he held the thin blue line. God  bless your family.                            ____________________
