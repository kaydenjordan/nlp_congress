 Mr. Speaker, yesterday news reports  suggested that President Biden's Secretary of Education was involved in  requesting a letter from the National School Boards Association,  calling for the FBI to intimidate parents who have shown up to school  board meetings.  [[Page H50]]    The House Education and Labor Committee must hold immediate hearings  with the Secretary so that we can ask him under oath if he solicited  this memo.   The Federal Government should never treat parents like terrorists for  showing up at public hearings to oppose the racist critical race theory  or the perverted sex-ed curriculum that is being forced upon our  children.   Parents are in charge of the school system, not liberal activists  from Washington, D.C., who are using the FBI as their political police  force.                            ____________________
