 Mr. President, I come to the floor today with a heavy  yet full heart to pay tribute to someone I owe so much to, someone who  millions of Americans living with disabilities owe so much to, Judy  Heumann.   To honor her, I want to start by describing the environment we are in  for those who may be listening in who may be visually impaired. We are  in the United States Senate Chambers. I am sitting in the top row of  chairs. I am sitting in my wheelchair. I am an Asian-American woman  with brown hair, and I am wearing my signature red lipstick, just as  Judy used to wear.   Judy was more than a friend; she was a personal hero to me. She was a  person who devoted her life to expanding disability rights, to making  sure that accessibility in this country is not an afterthought but, in  fact, is the norm.   She worked so hard because she recognized a simple truth: that  everyone, whether they know it or not, is just 1 day, 1 split-second  away from acquiring a disability and needing the protections and rights  that too many take for granted, rights that every American deserves.   You know, when I earned my disability in 2004, I actually considered  myself pretty lucky. I say ``lucky'' because when I got home from Iraq,  the Rehabilitation Act had been the law of the land for more than 30  years, and the Americans with Disabilities Act had been in place for  more than a decade, both of which Judy had fought tirelessly to  implement and, in fact, was the author of, and both of which empowered  people like me to lead full lives. So, yes, pretty darn lucky because I  wouldn't be able to roll my wheelchair through the maze of the Capitol  Building and onto the Senate floor today to give this speech without  those laws or without the unwavering advocacy and leadership of Judy  Heumann.   You see, Judy passed her exams to earn a teaching license before  people with disabilities had equal protections under the law, but she  was denied that license by the school board even though she passed the  exams--denied it just because of so-called concerns about legal  liability in the workplace because she had a disability.   They said that because Judy used a wheelchair, she represented a fire  hazard and couldn't safely teach in a classroom. Judy, rightfully so,  wasn't going to take that for an answer, so she got to work. She worked  and she worked and she worked. She fought and she fought some more. She  made a fuss. She caused what civil rights giant John Lewis called  ``good trouble.''   It is in large part because of her never giving up that the  Rehabilitation Act exists, that the ADA exists, and that my full,  wonderful, beautifully chaotic life is possible. For that and for so  much more, I will be forever grateful for Judy Heumann.   Judy passed away earlier this month, but what she lived for will live  on forever. I will never forget the hard-earned lessons she taught me  about what it means to truly fight for our civil rights, to keep up  that work day after day after day, and to make sure we empower those  who come next to continue reaching toward a more just and more  accessible future.   In her name, I will forever keep striving to bring about that better  tomorrow when people with disabilities won't have to work so hard just  to live our daily lives.   Rest in power, Judy. We miss you already.           190th Anniversary of the U.S. Partnership with Thailand    Mr. President, ``sawadee ka.'' I come to the floor today to  commemorate a special moment, the 190th anniversary of the U.S.  partnership with the Kingdom of Thailand.   I am an American, but my Thai heritage makes me a living example of  the unshakeable bond between our two nations.   Our nations have a long, long history of friendship. For centuries,  our countries have learned from and leaned on each other militarily,  diplomatically, economically, culturally--you name it. From the  environment to our economies, national security to cyber security, we  have helped one another grow and evolve, adapting to a world that is  evermore connected, adapting to an era in which technology allows  allies half a world away to be there for each other in half an instant.   There is a reason Thailand is often called Washington's oldest ally  in Asia. Ever since an American ship landed on Thailand's shores more  than 200 years ago, ever since President Andrew Jackson and Thai King  Rama III signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation formalizing  peaceful relations between our countries, ever since King Mongkut  offered to send elephants to President Abraham Lincoln an ocean away,  our nations have proven that there is no greater asset than a partner  you can count on in times of both peace and conflict. Time after time,  we have worked side by side to catch the bad actors running  international criminal networks, to give humanitarian relief to those  who need it, to keep the peace far beyond our own borders.   We have seen our shared interests and values manifest time after time  over the past 190 years. To name just a few examples, more than 300,000  people of Thai descent--myself included--live in the United States  today, and thousands more come to study every semester.   The jointly run Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences  has been at the forefront of research on infectious diseases since the  1960s, developing treatment for a host of diseases that have saved  millions of lives in both our countries and around the world.   Under a 2002 framework, hundreds of U.S. companies have invested in  Thailand, fueling bilateral trade of over $74 billion in 2020 alone.   And, during World War II, the United States worked with Thai students  in the United States and dissidents inside Thailand to create the Free  Thai Movement. Then, our security alliance was eventually formalized  under the Manila Pact of 1954 and the Thanat-Rusk communique in 1962.  And, now, the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in Thailand helps  organize more than 400 joint exercises per year, including Cobra Gold,  the largest multilateral exercise in the Indo-Pacific region.   In 2023, with more and more geopolitical threats rising by the day,  the strength of our bond is as important as ever. Our alliance provides  some sense of stability amidst that chaos and some sense of security  amidst the unpredictability. It helps to make a tenuous situation a  little bit more tenable.   In just a few months, Thailand will hold national elections for the  second time since the military coup of 2014. As in other countries,  Thailand's path to democracy has had its challenges. There have been  setbacks as well as advances. But in this moment, I know I speak for my  colleagues in this Chamber when I say we look forward to an election  that is free and fair, an election that cements Thailand on the road to  a stable democratic system based on the rule of law, civilian  authority, and respect for internationally recognized human rights.   Let me just close by saying: For the progress that Thailand has made  toward that more democratic future, for the friendship our two nations  have shared, as well as for all the years that I was lucky enough to  call Thailand my home as a child, I am endlessly grateful, and I am  forever proud to call myself an American of Thai descent.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I have nine requests for committees  to meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
