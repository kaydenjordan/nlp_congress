 Mr. Speaker, let's discuss voting in America.   Mr. Speaker, 53 years ago--I believe we all know it--Congress passed  the Voting Rights Act to stop discriminatory practices which denied  minorities the right to vote. Poll workers would ask people of color  ridiculous questions like how many jelly beans are in a jar or use  humiliating literacy tests and poll taxes to take away this  constitutional right from good, decent people.   Now here we go again. Because the President of the United States just  can't accept the fact that he lost the popular vote, which he did, my  Republican colleagues are using racial fears and dishonest words like  ``protecting our elections'' to encourage Americans to turn against  each other.   If my GOP colleagues want to protect our elections, they should join  us in restoring the Voting Rights Act, which was gutted in 2013. If my  Republican colleagues want to protect our elections, they should join  us in passing legislation to protect the special counsel. But obviously  the GOP feels that they can't win on their merits, so they will  suppress the vote instead, change the rules, close polling places in  Black and Latino communities, remove legitimate voters from voting  rolls, pass laws like the one in North Carolina that targeted African  Americans with--and I quote--surgical precision.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are tired of the division and  distractions from the White House and the GOP to turn us against our  neighbors, especially along racial lines. And 53 years after the  passage of the Voting Rights Act, the American people expect men and  women of conscience to step up and refuse to repeat the mistakes of the  past.
