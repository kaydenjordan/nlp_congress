 Mr. President, in just a short while, the Senate will  vote to reauthorize important provisions of the FISA Amendments Act. As  we all know, section 702 remains one of the most important tools that  our national security professionals use to combat terrorism and to keep  Americans safe.   Let's be very clear about what section 702 does. It enables our  intelligence community to collect communications from foreign  terrorists on foreign soil who threaten America and our allies. That is  what it does. Make no mistake--section 702 does not allow the targeting  of American citizens, nor does it permit the targeting of anyone, no  matter their nationality, who is known to be located here in the United  States.   The men and women we trust to protect this country say that this  capability is essential to their missions. They tell us that it has  saved American lives. That is why we cannot let this capability lapse.  The world remains dangerous. We need our Armed Forces and intelligence  community to protect us, and they need us to give them the tools to do  it.   I look forward to renewing this important provision on a bipartisan  basis in a short while.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, Saturday will mark 1  year since President Trump's inauguration--a year spent working with  Republicans to roll back runaway regulations, stand up for veterans,  fund our troops, strengthen national security, and pass once-in-a- generation tax reform.   Today, unemployment is at its lowest level in over a decade.  According to Gallup, the American people are more optimistic about  their job prospects than they have been in 17 years. And just  yesterday, the Dow Jones closed above 26,000 for the first time in  history.   The engine of American free enterprise is the American people, and  when government gets out of the way and helps provide the conditions  for growth, good things happen.   Just yesterday, Apple--the highest valued public company in the  world--announced a plan to create more than 20,000 new jobs and invest  $30 billion in new capital right here in our country. As a direct  result of tax reform, Apple will pay special bonuses worth $2,500 to  employees and begin to repatriate the $250 billion in cash it has been  holding overseas. Let me repeat that. Billions and billions of dollars  are coming back to America because Republicans passed historic tax  reform and gave us a 21st-century tax code. This will have an impact  not just in Silicon Valley but all across the country. In Harrodsburg,  KY, Corning employs hundreds of people in a high-tech facility. It  partners with Apple to manufacture the special glass used in iPhones  and iPads. This glass is made in Kentucky.   Republicans in the House and Senate passed tax reform without a  single Democratic vote, although I certainly hope our folks across the  aisle will celebrate the new jobs in their States and the new  opportunities that are already being created for their constituents. We  know that when Washington gets  [[Page S266]]  out of the way, American workers and job creators can do what they do  best. The results are speaking for themselves.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on an urgent matter, Congress is  fast approaching our Friday deadline to fund the government. The choice  before us is quite simple: We can pass a noncontroversial, bipartisan  bill to keep the government open, or Democrats in Congress can  manufacture a crisis and force a government shutdown over the entirely  unrelated issue of illegal immigration, which we have until March, at  the very least, to resolve.   Leaders in both parties have engaged in constructive talks on the  best solution for those who fall under the Obama administration's  illegally established DACA Program, along with other important  immigration issues. The President has made it clear that any  immigration bill must not only treat the symptoms of illegal  immigration but also address the conditions that cause it. His four  pillars for reform are increasing border security, reforming chain  migration, resolving the DACA issue, and addressing the visa lottery.  Those are the four pillars.   My position is straightforward. When negotiators produce a compromise  that the President supports, it will receive a vote here in the Senate.  No such solution yet exists, so the negotiations continue. The DACA  issue does not face urgent deadlines until March at the very earliest.  Our deadline to fund the government is tomorrow. One is an emergency,  and one is not.   Later today, we anticipate the House will pass a bill that continues  government funding and also attends to another urgent bipartisan  concern. It will reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance  Program for a full 6 years, giving needed security to the families of  the 9 million American children who depend on the program for coverage.   A continuing resolution plus a 6-year SCHIP extension is a  commonsense package that every Member of this body should support.   Just consider my Democratic colleagues' own words on this very  subject of the Children's Health Insurance Program. Just last month,  the senior Senator from Pennsylvania said: ``Any uncertainty about the  Children's Health Insurance Program is . . . an insult to the  country.'' That is the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. He represents  342,000 children enrolled in SCHIP. Now he will have a chance to end  that uncertainty.   Our newest colleague, the junior Senator from Alabama, made SCHIP a  central issue in his campaign. He presented himself as a champion of  vulnerable kids. He said the Senate had to ``stop playing political  football with the health care of our children.'' Now he represents  150,000 of those children. Will he help us put a stop to the political  games?   The senior Senator from Ohio said: ``Healthcare for our kids  shouldn't be controversial . . . it shouldn't be partisan. It should be  easy.''   The junior Senator from Maine called a potential lapse in SCHIP ``an  abdication of our responsibility.''   The junior Senator from Oregon said: ``Struggling families would like  to have some stability, not have their children be a bargaining chip in  some broader vision.''   All of these Democratic Senators represent tens of thousands of  children who depend on SCHIP. I am more than puzzled why they would  threaten to turn their backs on those children--and shut down the  government while they are at it--over the entirely unrelated issue of  illegal immigration. Why would anyone suggest it is a good idea to not  fund SCHIP for 6 years and to not fund the government because they are  upset over illegal immigration, which is an issue we have until March  to address?   Last year, the Senate Finance Committee unanimously agreed on a  proposal to extend SCHIP by 5 years. The continuing resolution we  expect to take up will extend it for 6, with no partisan attachments.  It shouldn't be a difficult vote.   There is nothing--nothing--in such a continuing resolution that my  Democratic friends actually oppose. Surely they do not oppose  continuing to fund programs for opioid treatment and prevention, even  as negotiations continue on additional funding. Surely they do not  oppose continuing to fund our military and our national security, even  as negotiations continue on additional funding. They couldn't possibly  want to cut off existing funding for veterans, the VA system, and  America's seniors simply because we are still negotiating additional  funding.   My friends on the other side of the aisle do not oppose a single  thing in this bill--nothing. They know they can't possibly explain to  our warfighters and veterans, to our seniors, to our opioid treatment  centers, to the millions of vulnerable children and their families who  depend on SCHIP for coverage--how do you explain this?--or to all  Americans who rely on the Federal Government for critical services like  food inspections and Social Security checks. Why would they filibuster  government funding and shut down vital programs for Americans because  we have not yet agreed on the best way to settle an unrelated issue  that we have at least until March to resolve?   So let's fund the government, extend SCHIP, and do right by the  millions of Americans who elected us to serve them. That is how we can  continue serious discussions on issues facing our Nation.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the House has sent us a bill that  should be an easy ``yes'' vote for every Senator in this Chamber--an  easy ``yes'' vote. This bill continues government funding, prevents a  needless shutdown, and extends a key health insurance program for  vulnerable children for 6 years. Its content is bipartisan. There are  no provisions that any of my Democratic friends oppose. It is a simple  step that will let us continue bipartisan talks without throwing the  government into disarray for no reason.   Americans are surprised this is even a debate. I don't blame them. I  share their surprise that some Democratic Senators see the prospect of  a government shutdown for more than 300 million Americans, see a  possible lapse in health coverage for 9 million vulnerable American  kids, and they have attempted to hold all of that hostage until we  resolve a nonimminent problem related to illegal immigration.   The surprise is compounded for anyone who listens to the public  statements of my Democratic colleagues and takes them at their word.  Less than a week ago, the senior Senator from Colorado was asked  whether it was prudent to shut the government down over the issue of  illegal immigration. He insisted it was not.   Last month, my friend, the senior Senator from West Virginia, had  this to say: ``I'm not going to make 300 million people suffer because  I can't get the process working the way it should.''   The junior Senator from Virginia put it even more clearly. This is  what he had to say: ``I will exercise every bit of leverage I can . . .  but if there is a vote that would lead to a shutdown, that is where I  draw the line.''   Not more than 2 days ago, the senior Senator from Missouri said she  wasn't ``interested in drawing a line in the sand'' because ``that's  how negotiations get blown up.''   Well, I hope their votes this evening reflect those recent  statements.   Some of my colleagues say they are reluctant to support this measure  not because of illegal immigration but simply because they are tired of  continuing resolutions. They point out that this is a suboptimal way to  fund our government, especially our warfighters.   That is precisely why Republicans worked hard all last month and all  this month--all last month and all this month--to try to negotiate a  long-term spending caps agreement that would bring stability back to  government funding, but the Democratic leadership made it clear they  would not be serious about these spending talks until this unrelated  immigration issue was solved.  [[Page S304]]    So now, unfortunately, a continuing resolution is the only option our  Armed Forces have this evening. Let's not pretend for a moment--not a  moment--that our men and women in uniform and their families benefit  from a government shutdown.   This is how we got here. My Democratic colleagues' demand on illegal  immigration, at the behest of their far-left base, have crowded out all  other important business. They have crowded it all out over the issue  of illegal immigration. Now they are threatening to crowd out the needs  of veterans, military families, opioid treatment centers, and every  other American who relies on the Federal Government, all over illegal  immigration.   There is no imminent deadline facing the DACA Program. Congress has  at least until March to arrive at a bipartisan solution that is  acceptable to Republicans, Democrats, and the person who needs to sign  the bill--the President of the United States. Do veterans, opioid  treatment centers, and the families of fallen soldiers need to suffer  before a compromise is reached?   Democratic Senators' fixation on illegal immigration has already  blocked us from making progress on long-term spending talks. Now, that  same fixation over illegal immigration has them threatening to  filibuster funding for the whole government.   Years ago, my friend, the Democratic leader, described how  irresponsible it would be to shut down the government over the issue of  immigration. He said it would result in ``governmental chaos.'' That is  what my friend, the Democratic leader, said a while back, but earlier  today on the floor, he insisted that we put every other American  priority on hold--put it on hold--until we resolve immigration. Only  then, he said, can we work on defense spending or domestic spending or  CHIP or disaster relief--put all of that on hold over the issue of  illegal immigration with no imminent deadline. It only needs to be  addressed by March.   Well, that is apparently how our Democratic colleagues rank their  priorities. It is not how I would rank mine. I don't think it is how  many of our colleagues on either side would rank theirs either, but we  will have a chance to find out in the coming days.   It is certainly not how the American people expect us to act. I think  the American people clearly would not expect us to act this way.   The bill before us is an opportunity to correct course. It is a  chance for my colleagues to remember that we represent millions and  millions of American citizens.   The American people want the Federal Government open for veterans,  military families, and the vulnerable. They want food and drug  inspections to continue without interruption. They want death benefits  to continue to go out to the families of servicemembers killed in  action. They want children in low-income families to continue receiving  health coverage through SCHIP. They want a sensible compromise on  immigration. But they cannot for the life of them understand why--why-- some Senators would hold the entire country hostage until we arrive at  a solution to a problem that doesn't fully materialize until March.   Military families, veterans, and children benefiting from the SCHIP  program don't need to be shoved aside--they don't need to be shoved  aside--while we continue good-faith negotiations. So we ought to pass  this resolution, and we ought to get back to work.    Madam President, not to prolong the debate, but the  Presidency under our constitutional system is not irrelevant. He is the  person who signs things into law. And most of us in the House and  Senate on the Republican side are interested in what his views are, and  those have not been made fully apparent yet.   What we have before us deals with a real emergency--tomorrow night at  midnight. What our friends on the other side are pushing is not an  emergency. It doesn't have anything to do with what is before us. It is  completely irrelevant to the issue of avoiding a government shutdown  and taking care of 300 million Americans, most of whom depend on the  government in one way or another.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand the Senate has received  a message from the House to accompany H.R. 195.    Madam President, I move that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany H.R. 195 and ask for the yeas and nays  on my motion.    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to the Senate amendment to H.R. 195.   I ask unanimous consent that there now be up to 10 minutes of debate,  equally divided, on the motion to concur and that following the use or  yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the motion to concur  with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk on  the motion to concur.    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to the Senate amendment to H.R. 195, with a further amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to concur  with amendment.    Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the  desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I move to refer the House message on H.R. 195 to the  Committee on Appropriations to report back forthwith with instructions.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion.    Mr. President, I have an amendment to the  instructions.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.    Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the  desk.    I object.    Mr. President, this is not terribly complicated.   We have been in discussions for a couple of months on all of the  issues that are urgent--the funding of the government, the Children's  Health Insurance Program--and other matters that we all know need to be  dealt with.   My good friend, the Democratic leader, is saying we have had too many  continuing resolutions but suggests we pass yet another one, and the  bill that is before us that we just voted to proceed to, I believe,  enjoys the support--every element of it enjoys the support of almost  everybody on both sides of the aisle. So it is appropriate to ask the  question, Why are we where we are? There is only one reason: the  continuous interjection of an issue, about which there is no urgency,  into a discussion about how to deal with a potpourri of issues that do  need to be urgently met, and that is the issue of illegal immigration.   So what our friends on the other side are saying is, they are  prepared to shut down the government over the issue of illegal  immigration. On that issue, there is a bipartisan interest in solving  the DACA problem, but the President has given us until March. The last  time I looked this was January. My colleagues, where is the urgency  here? There isn't any.   So the reason these talks have gone on so long is because they have  insisted, continuously, on throwing the illegal immigration issue into  the pool of these other issues and are now saying to the American  people: We are going to shut the government down if we can't have our  way on this issue right now, even though it only becomes a problem in  March.   So I hope the American people understand why we are where we are. No  amount of trying to obfuscate this and confuse it with all of these  other issues makes any sense at all. There is pretty broad bipartisan  agreement that we need to address every single one of these issues, but  the reason we are here right now is, our friends on the other side say:  Solve this illegal immigration problem right now or we are going to  shut the government down. That is a  [[Page S307]]  fact. That is not spin. That is a fact. That is the only reason why we  are where we are tonight. So I hope the American people will not be  confused about this.   We want to fund the government. We want to solve the S-CHIP problem  and a variety of other issues that almost all others agree on, and we  wanted to do it before tomorrow night, but my assumption is at some  point between now and tomorrow night, 41 Members of the opposition  party are going to prevent us from passing a measure, the details of  which they all support, because they can't get their way on this  illegal immigration issue which really only becomes urgent in March.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Democratic leader has mentioned a  variety of issues, all of which were being discussed over the last 2  months in the hopes that we could reach an agreement to address them  all. So now, I gather, he is saying he opposes the bill because it  doesn't have everything we have been talking about in it, even though  the things that are in the bill he does like. So the complaint now is,  it doesn't have the other issues in it. The reason it doesn't have the  other issues in it is because we haven't been able to reach a global  agreement on how much we are going to spend.   These talks have been going on endlessly. Many of you have not been  involved in them. We are exhausted. On and on and on we have been  talking about all this--everything the Democratic leader has mentioned.  Why will they never let us reach an agreement? Illegal immigration.  That is what they shoehorned into all this--shoehorned that issue right  into this and said: We will not solve any of this other stuff until we  deal with this.   Now I gather the Democratic leader is questioning the good faith of  some of us about whether we want to deal with the DACA issue. I do. I  see Senator Cotton back here, Senator Tillis--I think we all would like  to deal with the DACA issue, but there are some serious problems with  legal immigration, and this is a big enough issue to warrant being  discussed all by itself without being shoehorned into a bill full of  real emergencies because there is no real emergency in the immigration  area. We have until March to deal with it.   So make no mistake about it, we are where we are for one reason and  one reason only, within a day of a government shutdown, and that is the  insistence of our friends on the other side that we deal with this  nonemergency right now because they were unwilling to close out all of  these other issues we have been discussing ad nauseam, literally for  months.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m., Friday,  January 19; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to concur in the  House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 195.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request  that I propounded earlier.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:15 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, January 19, 2018, at 11 a.m.                            ____________________
