 Madam President, it is an honor to speak on behalf  of Judge Cory Wilson of Mississippi and in support of his nomination to  the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.   I have known Judge Wilson for many years. His experience and legal  knowledge make him an excellent choice to serve on the appellate court.  Numerous colleagues of Judge Wilson's from different backgrounds and  political affiliations have risen in support of his nomination and  spoken to his personal qualities.   After his impressive nomination hearing and an outpouring of support  from Mississippians, who know him best, there is no question that Judge  Wilson will be a fair and impartial judge who follows the rule of law.  Judge Cory Wilson will serve on the Fifth Circuit with honor,  dedication, and distinction.   I am also pleased a judge from Mississippi will mark a historic day  as the 200th Federal judge to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate during  the Trump administration. Judge Wilson's confirmation represents a  pivotal point in the President's work to ensure there are more smart,  conservative jurists in the Federal judiciary. Under the leadership of  President Trump and Leader McConnell, the Senate has prioritized  confirming bright, well-qualified men and women who will serve our  country for years to come.   I am proud to support Judge Cory Wilson and urge my colleagues to  approve his nomination.   I yield the floor.
