 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan  for putting this together. You can see that Ohio and Michigan can  periodically get along with each other.   I am honored to rise for a few minutes here, Mr. Speaker, to address  this House for the final time as a sitting Member of Congress. I think  it is appropriate to begin with the preamble to the United States  Constitution.   ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect  Union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the  common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings  of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.''   ``We the people.'' This is the people's House. There have been 12,421  Members of Congress who have sat here in this Capitol. Of almost 700  million people, who at one point or another were citizens of the United  States, 700 million, and a little over 12,000 were sent here to govern  this country, to meet the obligations that the Founding Fathers put in  the preamble of the United States Constitution.   I will tell you, there have been some great Americans, some of the  best, who have served in this Chamber. But there also have been  scoundrels, crooks, and liars. This is the people's House. This is the  people's House, so it has reflected over, in a few years, 250 years,  the world's oldest republic.   If there is one thing I hope that all Members and all citizens can  grasp and touch, it is gratitude. I know I feel tremendously grateful  to come from a working-class family in Ohio and end up here for 20  years serving the communities that I grew up in, that I played sports  in, that I raised my family in. It is an honor to be a citizen of the  United States.   This country has fed more people, clothed more people, cured more  people, and liberated more people than all the other countries in the  world combined.   I think to get out of this mess that we are in, the polarization, the  hate, the anger, the fear, the first step out of that is with  gratitude. If we all start from a place of gratitude, we will have a  much different opinion of the country, of each other, and of what is  possible for us, because this country has always done great things. But  we do great things when we are together, when we embrace normalcy, when  we embrace decency, when we embrace compassion.   When you walk through these doors, you are a leader, and you are  charged with making the tough decisions, the hard decisions, not the  easy decisions, not the ones that are going to make your next election  a little easier. But the challenge today is to be called to lead and  lead vigorously, lead boldly, because that is what the world needs us  to do right now.   This country has always been innovative. We need to enter an era of  reform, of reconciliation, and of innovation across the board.   The systems are all broken. The economic system is broken, the  immigration system is broken, the welfare system is broken, the  education system is broken, and we are not going to fix these if we are  not decent to each other, if we don't talk to each other.                                time  1400    Some of the solutions will be conservative, some will be liberal and  progressive, but it is through that conflict, those arguments and  debates that this very Chamber was set up to do that we come to the  best possible solution, and that, ultimately, is what we are talking  about.   We the people have got to come together. As we approach the 250th  anniversary of this country, let us renew our commitment to each other  so that we can meet President Lincoln's charge ``that this Nation,  under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of  the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the  Earth.''
