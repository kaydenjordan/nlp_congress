 Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to commit H.R. 1628 with instructions, on behalf of myself and Senator  Hirono, to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions to  eliminate provisions that threaten to make healthcare unaffordable for  those with preexisting conditions. I ask unanimous consent that it be  printed in the Record.   The motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal, Durbin, Stabenow,  Feinstein, Leahy, Brown, Harris, Franken, Carper, Coons, Udall,  Shaheen, Van Hollen, Menendez, Reed, Manchin, Cardin, Murphy,  Duckworth, Warren, Wyden, Whitehouse, Heinrich, Warner, Klobuchar,  Nelson, Bennet, Markey, Booker, and King.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Ms. Baldwin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) eliminate provisions that threaten to make health care       unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.
