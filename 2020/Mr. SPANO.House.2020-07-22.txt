 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank those Members who have  joined me in standing with millions of struggling Americans by calling  for the adoption of the Keep Employees' Earnings Protected Act, also  known as the KEEP Act, and to encourage my colleagues who haven't done  so to do so and stand with us.   As this body debates another relief package, a keystone of such  legislation should be a temporary payroll tax holiday. I introduced  this bill to allow our workers to keep more of the money that they have  already earned, thus infusing critical capital into our economy without  involving Federal bureaucracy.   It is now more critical than ever to ensure that families have the  funds, their funds, to reinvest back into our economy and to continue  our economic comeback by buying locally and supporting each other.  Employers, too, can use their tax savings to invest in their businesses  and in their workforces.   No government program, no matter how generous, can replace a strong,  functioning economy. President Trump has called on Congress to deliver  this bill to his desk for signature, and the time to deliver is now.  The American people are waiting and watching.                          Holding China Accountable     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lend my voice to House  efforts to hold China accountable for their role in the spread of the  coronavirus.   China lied; Americans died. It is really that simple.   China's socialist government not only misled the international  community in what they knew and when they knew it, but they also  colluded with the World Health Organization to cover for them. China's  irresponsible behavior led to a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, which has  brought about death and economic mayhem across our planet. As the  evidence mounts, China is now censoring those speaking out.   Congress must stand together, shoulder to shoulder, to ensure the  Chinese Government is held responsible for the damage they have caused  and to explore avenues to promptly bring manufacturing back to the  U.S., including pharmaceuticals.   I also commend President Trump for pulling the United States out of  the WHO until they, too, have been held accountable for their actions.  Not a penny of taxpayer dollars should ever go toward international  organizations that look the other way solely for political or economic  interests, especially one that operates in the public health arena.    The time for answers is now.                        Honoring Sergeant Andrew Bosko     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Andrew Bosko, a  Lakeland, Florida, World War II veteran who is 98 years young.   Andy was born in Ohio, raised in Pennsylvania, and is one of 13  children of immigrant parents from Austria and Czechoslovakia.   He entered the Army Air Corps in 1943, assigned to the Seventh  Fighter Command in Hawaii. In 1945, the command was reassigned to Iwo  Jima to provide emergency landing fields supporting bombing operations  against Japan.   Meanwhile, Andy's wife and true love, Sophia, was supporting the war  as a Rosie the Riveter. Yet, they still found time to write each other  every single day.   Following the war, Andy worked as a machinist in New York and later  participated in several other businesses.   Andy, you, together with your bride of 74 years, represent the  greatest of our Greatest Generation.   They experienced economic and social turmoil and a world war, and  then they helped rebuild our Nation into the greatest on Earth.   It is an honor to serve Andy, as he, for so many years, has served  us.                          Reestablish Law and Order     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the House minority  and Trump administration's efforts to reestablish law and order in our  country and to stop mob rule.   For almost 2 months, communities throughout our country, particularly  Democrat-led urban centers, have experienced levels of lawlessness and  civil unrest unseen for decades. I am not referring to those who have  exercised their First Amendment rights to peaceably assemble and  protest. No. I am talking about those who vandalize, destroy, and  knowingly break the law,  [[Page H3620]]  stirring havoc and instilling fear into families and business owners.   From San Francisco to Portland, from Minneapolis to New York City and  everywhere in between, we have seen the consequences of protecting the  mob over innocent civilians. This cannot be, and it cannot continue.   Law and order must be brought back to our neighborhoods, and we must  hold cities and their leaders accountable for failing to adequately  protect those whom they have sworn to serve.   All Americans, regardless of ZIP Codes, have a right to feel safe in  their homes and on their roads. Mob rule will not be tolerated. We must  reestablish law and order in America, and we must do it now.                            ____________________
