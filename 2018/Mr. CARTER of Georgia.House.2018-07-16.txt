 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my  colleagues for introducing this critical legislation.   As it stands, the OTC monograph system is slow and outdated, leading  to new changes being stuck in the pipeline for years with no light at  the end of the tunnel. As a pharmacist, I know how important it is to  my patients that they have access to new uses and applications.   Regardless of the application needed under a monograph, today's  legislation puts in place changes that will help those who I have spent  my life assisting: the patient.   This legislation establishes a mechanism for safety label changes,  giving these new efforts an outlet through which to get changes for the  public quickly available and on shelves.   This critical legislation will shorten market exclusivity by 6 months  for certain new over-the-counter products approved without a new drug  application and will also bolster the staffing capability at the FDA  overseeing the OTC drug industry.   Over-the-counter drug innovation has faced challenges for years, and,  with  [[Page H6237]]  this legislation, we finally have an opportunity to open up these  channels that will help everyone.    I voted for this legislation through the subcommittee and through  full committee and am proud to offer my full support to pass this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  constituent in my district, Mrs. Lynda DuRant, who saved her husband's  life by bravely and correctly administering CPR in an emergency  situation.   An educator in the Effingham County public school system, Mrs. DuRant  used her CPR training to save her husband John's life when he suffered  a significant cardiac event. The doctors said later that her immediate  and proper use of CPR was crucial to his survival.   CPR has only a 10.6 percent success rate, because it is often  performed incorrectly.   With early June being National CPR and AED Awareness Week, I  encourage everyone to become certified in administering CPR.   Like Mrs. DuRant, you never know when you will be called upon in an  emergency to save a life.   Thank you, Mrs. DuRant, for your brave action and for reminding us of  the importance of this critical skill.                            ____________________
