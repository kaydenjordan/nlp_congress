 Madam Speaker, I would like to join the United States  Coast Guard in welcoming the recently commissioned U.S. Coast Guard  cutter Angela McShan. The ship is part of a new fleet of cutters that  boasts short response times and larger vessels, which will help patrol  the coast from south Jersey all the way down to the Caribbean.   This cutter was named after the late Master Chief Angela McShan, who  served the Coast Guard for over 20 years, and she was the first Black  woman to earn the title of master chief petty officer.   The cutter was commissioned with the help of McShan's seven brothers  and sisters in boarding the cutter for the first time and raising the  flag so the ship could set sail.   I am excited to see the U.S. Coast Guard Training Center Cape May  flourish with the upgrade of the new cutter, and I am honored to have a  hero like Angela McShan watching over our officers from heaven.   Madam Speaker, we are proud of Angela McShan. We are proud of the  Coast Guard, both in the United States of America and in south Jersey.                            ____________________
