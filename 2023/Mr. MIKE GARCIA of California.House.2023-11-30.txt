 Madam Chair, it should not take an act  of Congress to stop our President, the President of the United States,  from sending $6 billion to Iran. Iran is the world's most prolific  sponsor of terrorism, but here we are, having to go through this.   This administration has said that this money is to be used for  humanitarian purposes only. Madam Chair, that is like giving money to a  junkie and expecting them to buy food with it. You can tell them to buy  food with it, and they can promise you that they will buy food with it.  We all know he ain't buying food with it.   In this case, Iran will not use this money for humanitarian  assistance. Even if they did, it would just free up other cash so they  could fund their international terror organizations and nuclear  ambitions. Now that we have control of these assets, let's not let this  money be weaponized against us, our allies, and especially Israel.   Madam Chair, I urge support of the bill.
