 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am  honored to stand before you today to pay tribute to the life and  service of a true American hero, First Sergeant P. Andrew McKenna, by  naming the Bristol Post Office in his honor.   A native of Bristol, Rhode Island, Sergeant McKenna dedicated 17  years of his life to serve and protect our country in the United States  Army.   Born in 1980 to his mother, Carol, and father, Peter, Sergeant  McKenna knew at the age of 5 years old that he wanted to be a soldier,  and by the age of 7 that he wanted to serve the Nation as a Green  Beret. His family and close childhood friends recall him wearing  camouflage-patterned clothes almost every day.   Sergeant McKenna attended Mount Hope High School in Bristol,  graduating in the spring of 1998. Upon graduation, he immediately  enlisted in the Army as an infantryman.   After just 3 years, he went to selection for the Green Berets. He  completed the grueling Special Forces Qualification Course in 2003,  achieving his lifelong dream to be a part of the military's most elite.   Sergeant McKenna was then assigned to the First Battalion, 7th  Special Forces Group. He went on to serve one tour of duty in Iraq and  five more tours in Afghanistan.   During his first tour in Afghanistan, from 2004 to 2005, First  Sergeant McKenna was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor for his  tremendous courage under fierce enemy fire during a mission that  resulted in the death of a senior Taliban official. He would then go  [[Page H1351]]  on to earn 18 military awards, including the Defense Meritorious  Service Medal, the Purple Heart, the Army Commendation Medal, and the  Army Achievement Medal.   First Sergeant McKenna is remembered at each of his duty stations for  his intense work ethic, strong attention to detail, commitment to  excellence, quick sense of humor, and infectious smile. To this day,  former team leaders and fellow servicemembers praise his motivation,  leadership, and ability to bring out the best in the people around him.   Of the countless stories I could tell that exemplify these values in  Sergeant McKenna, there is one that stands out.   In 2011, Master Sergeant Chris Corbin, a fellow Green Beret, was  forced to undergo a double amputation on both legs after stepping on a  hidden IED in Afghanistan. During a months-long recovery process at  Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, First Sergeant McKenna  would make the 5-hour drive from Fort Bragg, located in North Carolina,  to visit Master Sergeant Corbin, sometimes spending multiple days or  even weeks at his bedside. Master Sergeant Corbin would later go on to  credit Sergeant McKenna's reliability and motivation for getting him  through his recovery.   This same selfless devotion to his fellow servicemembers was, of  course, not a first for Sergeant McKenna, and it would not be his last  in a decorated life that was ended far too soon.   He was stationed at Camp Integrity in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August  of 2015 when Taliban soldiers exploded a car bomb outside the gates of  the compound in the middle of the night. Four heavily armed insurgents  opened fire on security contractors guarding the Special Forces  complex, killing eight guards and breaching the facility. Sergeant  McKenna was messaging with his mother at the time, and her last message  to her son went unanswered.   After hearing an explosion and gunshots, he immediately grabbed his  weapon and proceeded to engage the enemy alongside fellow Green Beret,  Master Sergeant George Vera.                                time  1730    During the ensuing firefight, First Sergeant McKenna lost his life  and Master Sergeant Vera suffered critical wounds to his spine, kidney,  liver, and leg.   Their decision to charge into the fight without hesitation and regard  for their own safety likely prevented the deaths of many, many soldiers  stationed at that base.   First Sergeant McKenna's bravery and his ultimate sacrifice allowed  supporting personnel to eliminate the Taliban attack and secure the  complex.   First Sergeant McKenna was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for  Valor in Combat, the Nation's third highest decoration for valor, for  his courageous and lifesaving actions.   He was fearless. He was heroic. He represented the very highest  examples of service, duty, and sacrifice throughout his career and on  this fateful day. However, in the words of his friend, Master Sergeant  Corbin: ``That's just Drew. There's dozens of times he's done stuff  like that.''   First Sergeant McKenna was laid to rest in St. Mary's Cemetery in  Bristol next to his brother, Patrick, who passed away in 2005.   He is survived by his mother and father, whom I had the honor of  hosting for President Obama's final State of the Union Address.   The First Sergeant P. Andrew McKenna, Jr., Memorial Scholarship Fund,  set up in his memory, awards $6,000 in scholarships every year to Rhode  Island high school students planning to attend college or serve in the  Armed Forces.   Andrew McKenna was a true American hero who embodied the very best of  Rhode Island values.   His patriotism, loyalty, and sense of shared purpose were reflections  of his strong character and the values he learned growing up in  Bristol.   I consider myself fortunate to have met First Sergeant McKenna in  2015 at the Bristol Fourth of July parade and for my continued  relationship with his wonderful family.   I am proud to lead the effort here in Congress to honor First  Sergeant McKenna's legacy that means so much to his family, his  friends, the town of Bristol, and the State of Rhode Island.   Mr. Speaker, I extend my gratitude to Chairman Gowdy and Ranking  Member Cummings for their support of this bill, as well as my good  friend and cosponsor of this bill, Congressman Jim Langevin.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their courtesy and urge my  colleagues to support this bill.
