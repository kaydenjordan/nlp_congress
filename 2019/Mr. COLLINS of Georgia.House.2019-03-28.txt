 Mr. Speaker, thus far, I have released four  transcripts of interviews from the Judiciary Committee into the  apparent wrongdoing at the FBI and the Justice Department.   Today, I release the fifth.   The American people deserve transparency, they deserve to know what  transpired at the highest levels of the FBI, and the origin of the  probe into President Trump's campaign.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I request the link, dougcollins.house.gov/ nellieohr be placed in the Record so the American people can review the  transcript of Nellie Ohr's interview.   I will continue to work to release as many transcripts as possible.   The American people deserve the truth.  [[Page H2891]]                                ____________________
