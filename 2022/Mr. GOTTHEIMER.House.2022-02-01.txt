 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Pete DuPre.   Pete, better known as Harmonica Pete around the world, was a true  American hero, an advocate for veterans and a constant inspiration to  all those who were touched by his music. Spending time with him was a  true honor that I will never forget, nor will my 12-year-old daughter,  Ellie. She met him for the first time 4 years ago. They became pen pals  and good friends.   Pete recently passed at the age of 98.   Pete served for 3 years overseas as a U.S. Army medic in some of the  most important battles of World War II, including the Battle of the  Bulge, a true turning point in the war for Allied Forces.   Pete returned home and continued to represent our Nation, traveling  the globe, performing as an ambassador for the Greatest Generations  Foundation. He earned his nickname by playing our national anthem on  his harmonica at  [[Page H326]]  the United States Women's National Soccer Team game against Mexico in  my home State of New Jersey, at the Vikings stadium in front of tens of  thousands of people, on the USS Arizona Memorial to commemorate the  74th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, and nursing homes nationwide and so  many more. Pete touched so many Americans.    As we mourn the loss of Harmonica Pete, we pray for his five  children; Michael, James, Robert, Pierre, and Mary Ann; his late wife,  Jane; and his grandchildren; and all the friends and family he touched.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Pete  DuPre.                            ____________________
