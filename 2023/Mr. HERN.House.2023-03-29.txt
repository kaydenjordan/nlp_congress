 Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on my amendment.    Mr. Chairman, President Biden and congressional Democrats  continue their attacks on traditional energy with proposed tax hikes  that will kill jobs, raise fuel prices, and leave America more  dependent on foreign oil.   This administration's proposed oil and natural gas tax hikes are  harmful to our economy. The oil and natural gas industry accounts for  10.3 million jobs and is nearly 8 percent of our Nation's GDP.   This amendment shows it is the sense of Congress that we disapprove  of this administration's proposed harmful tax hikes on the oil and gas  industry.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to be  simultaneously concerned about high prices at the  [[Page H1588]]  pump while aggressively pursuing an agenda designed to entirely phase  out oil and gas from domestic energy production. The audio simply  doesn't match the video.   Uncertainty surrounding energy policy decisions in D.C. is causing  oil and natural gas producers to make decisions based on unfavorable  policies that haven't passed yet.   Repealing the immediate deduction of intangible drilling cost would  cost 265,000 jobs. For every job lost in the oil and gas sector by  repealing IDCs, two-and-one-half times as many indirect jobs are lost.   The percentage depletion deduction is the small business deduction  for the smaller producers of oil and gas. Eliminating percentage  depletion would force many family-owned small businesses to lay off  employees or, worse, shut down operations altogether.   I am proud to support H.R. 1 to restore American energy independence.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of our colleagues to disapprove of President  Biden's tax hikes on the oil and gas industry by supporting this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Dakota (Mr. Armstrong).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
