 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is  ironic that I come to the floor to be with my friend, the chairman of  the Intelligence Committee, with whom I have proudly served and with  whom I have worked on many different projects within the intelligence  community and the jurisdiction of that committee. But this is one where  we clearly see things differently.   Mr. Olsen, for most of his career--and it has been a distinguished  career--has operated as a nonpartisan public servant. But as Senator  Grassley, ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, said at the time  he had his hearing there, once the previous administration took office,  it was like a switch got flipped and he turned into a partisan warrior.   Over the last few years, Mr. Olsen has made a series of serious  ultrapartisan statements. Prior to the 2016 election, he said that ISIS  supported Donald Trump for President. Following the election, he  claimed that the electoral college should be abolished because it is a  national security threat. He signed on to a number of letters  hysterically criticizing then-Attorney General Barr and the Justice  Department, and he failed to disclose these writings and other critical  information to the Judiciary Committee during the hearing on his  nomination.   I believe now, more than ever, it is absolutely critical that the  Justice Department and our intelligence community operate free from  political influence and bias. But I have no confidence that, if  confirmed, Mr. Olsen's partisan switch will get flipped back off. I  fear he will continue to pursue his political objectives from within  the Department, using the powerful tools of the Department of Justice  to pave the way for his partisan political agenda.   And lest anybody think these concerns are unprecedented or  groundless, let me just point out that we now have a former lawyer with  the FBI that has pled guilty for falsifying an application to the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the process of investigating  an American citizen. He has now pled guilty and is now serving  probation, a lawyer with the FBI who erroneously communicated  information to the court with which they relied upon to issue a warrant  to surveil an American citizen, using the powers of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court.   And then, just this last week, another lawyer has been indicted by  Mr. Durham, the special counsel--somebody who has a distinguished  career as a former Federal prosecutor and has worked at a prominent  firm that typically represents the Democratic Party.   He now has been indicted for lying to the FBI, and it rises out of a  conversation he had with a general counsel at the FBI, suggesting that  there was some link between the Trump administration--or Trump  organization and a criminal-linked Russian lender called Alfa Bank.  [[Page S6577]]    The indictment says that Michael Sussmann lied about the capacity in  which he was providing this information to the FBI. But, in fact, what  he did is prepare white papers using confidential information obtained  from a technology client and fed that to the FBI while he claimed to be  just a good citizen wanting to pass this information along when he was  actually on the payroll of the Clinton campaign.   And, obviously, then talking to the press, leaking this narrative to  the press, this has, I think, contributed to this false narrative of  somehow that the Russians colluded with then-Candidate Trump in order  to win the election. There has been no evidence at all, whether if you  look at the inspector general report--Inspector General Horowitz--about  the now debunked Steele dossier, which supposedly was the basis upon  which the FBI opened their investigation.   So what we are talking about is people in positions of trust and  confidence in the U.S. Government abusing their power, lying to the  FBI, and lying to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in order  to pursue a partisan political objective.   Now, I have no idea what Mr. Olsen would do, but I don't think we can  take any risks, given the fact he has now turned into a partisan  warrior. We have got ample examples of people who, perhaps against  their better judgment, have thrown into this resistance attitude and  simply forgotten their professional responsibilities. And when it comes  to the intelligence community and national security, we don't need any  more partisan warriors in these positions of trust. These should be  nonpartisan professionals.   So I don't think Mr. Olsen has certainly satisfied me or many of my  other colleagues that he can flip that partisan warrior switch off. For  that reason, I object.    Mr. President.    Mr. President, what I was referring to earlier are  examples of abuse of power by people in the U.S. Government who are in  a position to do things to average citizens that, frankly, if they can  do them to powerful individuals like candidates for President or our  sitting officeholders, what is the little guy supposed to do?   If people are so blinded by their partisanship or their desire to get  somebody that they violate their oath, they violate the law, and abuse  power, what is the average man and woman supposed to do?   You know, it reminds me a little bit of the hearing that we had just  a couple of days ago in the Judiciary Committee, where this monster  named Larry Nassar, an Olympic physician for 18 years, systematically  and routinely sexually assaulted and abused young female Olympic  athletes.   And for years, these Olympic athletes tried to get the FBI to  investigate their allegations against Dr. Nassar.  [[Page S6578]]  And it took an extended period of time--I think it was a year and a  half--before the FBI actually undertook the investigation. But it took  a couple of our colleagues--people like Senator Blumenthal from  Connecticut, Senator Jerry Moran from Kansas--in order to stay on this  issue until, finally, this monster, Dr. Nassar, was charged with crimes  and convicted and now is going to serve in prison the rest of his life.    But it haunts me to think, if these elite Olympic athletes whose  names are known all around the world could not get the government to  respond to their assault and to do them justice, what chance do the  rest of us have? I am not worried about Members of Congress; I am  worried about my 29 million constituents.   And so the examples I gave of Mr. Clinesmith, who lied to the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court in order to get a warrant to illegally  surveil an American citizen--that is an abuse of power that causes me  very grave concern.   And when I read the indictment of Michael Sussman lying to the FBI  about his connection to the Clinton campaign, while he compiled  information that was confidential, gave it to the FBI, claimed to just  be a good citizen and not representing any client, when in fact he was  on the payroll of the Clinton campaign, and he was systematically  leaking this information to the press to feed this narrative about  Russian collusion--which has obsessed Congress and the country for  years.   And now we know there is no factual basis for the allegations against  then-Candidate Trump or then later President Trump. The Russian  collusion narrative was not true, but it was fed by partisans who  abused their power in order to gain politically.   So I don't know Mr. Olsen that well. Like I said, I know he has had a  distinguished career. But something clearly snapped when he became a  partisan lawyer. And I simply do not have confidence that he will not  abuse his power in pursuit of his partisan aims.   There are better people that the President could nominate to serve in  this sensitive position, and I will not, in good conscience, agree to  simply allow somebody with this sort of track record to be confirmed.   And as my colleagues know, the majority leader has all the tools he  needs at his disposal to have a vote on the Senate floor on this  nomination. But it shouldn't be done by unanimous consent. It shouldn't  be done outside of the public attention because there are so many  things competing for people's attention. I think this is a debate and a  conversation we need to have about powerful public officials abusing  their power for partisan political gain.   What chance does the average American have if they will abuse that  power to go after powerful public figures like a candidate for  President or an incumbent President of the United States?    Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to complete  my remarks before the vote.    Mr. President, our friends across the aisle are moving  full steam ahead with what I think is fairly described as a reckless  tax-and-spending spree, which is chock-full of unnecessary,  unwarranted, and flatout unaffordable policies.   Remember that we had to spend a lot of money--borrowed money--during  the COVID crisis, which we did on a bipartisan basis because it was a  national--indeed, an international and global emergency.   But as we continue to get people vaccinated and put the pandemic in  the rearview mirror, our colleagues simply want to continue spending  money that we don't have to pursue their ideological and political  agenda, to grow the government, to intrude more in people's lives, and  to take more of what they earn rather than let them spend it as they  see fit.   Our colleagues want to impose crippling tax hikes on job creators at  a time when many of them are still digging out of the recession that  was part of the pandemic. They want to dole out permanent welfare  without requiring able-bodied men and women to work. They want to  discourage medical innovation through price fixing and implement a  range of items from their far-left wish list.   After charging nearly $2 trillion on the taxpayers' credit card  earlier this year, our Democratic colleagues are back at it for round  2. And this time, they are going all out. That is especially true when  it comes to the energy sector.   Over the past few years, we have seen no shortage of unrealistic and  downright harmful policies to reduce carbon emissions. Now, there is a  smart way to do it, and there is a self-defeating way to reduce  emissions. One is to reduce the use of coal and increase the use of  things like natural gas, which has much lower carbon content than coal.  And we are doing that, and we have reduced emissions as a result.   But our colleagues have proposed everything from the socialist  paradise that is the Green New Deal to more targeted but no more  realistic net zero emission bills.   This reckless tax-and-spending spree compiles the most outlandish  proposals into one of the greatest hits albums. The hallmark of this  legislation is a full range of tax increases on the fossil fuel  industry, which ultimately are passed along to consumers and contribute  to inflation and the increased costs that they have to pay in order to  fill up at the pump.   Whether we are talking about energy, agriculture, or any other  industry, higher taxes always mean higher prices for consumers. It is  inevitable.   Businesses can't just take the increases as a hit to their bottom  line. They might raise taxes, lay off employees, postpone expansion  plans, or implement all of the above, but that is exactly what this  proposal would spur when it comes to the energy sector.   It increases taxes already paid by energy companies on income earned  in the global marketplace and subjects energy employers to double  taxation of their foreign income. It also adds a brand new tax, the  Superfund excise tax, which was eliminated 25 years ago--all in pursuit  of more revenue to grow the size of the government.   Our friends across the aisle want to resurrect this tax and force  energy companies to pay more on every barrel of crude oil that is  sold. Once again, the ultimate burden won't be on those companies. It  will fall to consumers who are already struggling to keep up with  inflation.    Gasoline prices are up 42 percent over last year. Natural gas is up  21 percent. Families in Texas are paying more on everything from  electricity to groceries, to vehicles. This smorgasbord of higher taxes  will only drive up costs for working families and hurt the very job  creators we have been trying to help, over the last year and a half,  dig out from under COVID-19.   You have to wonder, if these policies are going to hurt working  Americans and the economy, who benefits? Well, for starters, our  geopolitical adversaries will benefit. The higher cost on domestic  crude would, once again, make the U.S. reliant on imports of oil and  gas from overseas, from countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and  Venezuela perhaps.   President Biden unintentionally demonstrated the hypocrisy of this  approach when he pushed, earlier this year, to beg OPEC, the  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, to increase  production overseas to bring down oil prices here in the United States.  In other words, he doesn't want American oil and gas producers to  produce oil and gas. He wants the Russians and the Saudis to do it to  help us bring down prices here in America.   It is just crazy. It makes no sense. If the President is worried  about affordable energy, he needs to quit pushing policies that will  drive up the cost for consumers at the pump.   Other big winners include wealthy electric vehicle drivers. The sort  of subsidies that are contained in this proposed package includes a tax  credit for electric vehicle purchases, even if these cars are made--you  guessed it--in China. And it is subsidizing--it is taking middle-income  taxpayers' money and giving it to people who are buying expensive cars  because they are incentivized by the tax credit. Meanwhile, we have 280  million cars on the road in America that still depend on oil and gas in  order to function because they have, yes, an internal combustion  engine.   On top of that, a bigger tax credit is given to electric cars built  in union shops. Now, why would you favor a political supporter like  organized labor?  [[Page S6579]]  Well, I think the answer may be pretty obvious. Maybe union-built  electric vehicles are more green than other electric vehicles or maybe  it is a favor doled out to a special interest group by my friends on  the other side, to a political constituency.   As a reminder, unlike gas-powered vehicle drivers, EV drivers don't  even pay anything for the highways that they drive their car on. They  don't pay into the highway trust fund, which comes out of the cost of a  gallon of gas, to help maintain our roads and bridges.   So our friends across the aisle just keep on coming with tax breaks  for the well-off and the well-to-do in a way that will burden hard- working Texans and Americans.   I support efforts to reduce carbon emissions to preserve our air,  land, and water for future generations, but these efforts shouldn't  pick winners and losers, especially when wealthy Americans are reaping  the benefits at the cost of blue-collar workers.   Like the rest of the reckless tax-and-spending spree proposal, the  cost of this energy proposal far exceeds any benefit. It will drive up  costs for American families, hurt our global competitiveness,  ultimately hurt our allies that depend on exported LNG to provide  energy diversity, and it will empower our adversaries.   So there is no reason to stick taxpayers with the bill for these  unnecessary policies when there are better ways to keep costs for  consumers low while protecting our environment.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill  for introduction in the Congressional Record. The bill's purpose is to  designate the community-based outpatient clinic of the Department of  Veterans Affairs in San Angelo, Texas, as the ``Colonel Charles and  JoAnne Powell Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic''.                                  S. 2771         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.          Congress finds the following:        (1) Colonel Charles Powell and his wife, Mrs. JoAnne       Powell, served the community of San Angelo, Texas, with       character and dignity.        (2) Colonel Powell served as the base commander of       Goodfellow Air Force Base from 1980 to 1984.        (3) When the Powells moved to San Angelo, Charles was       ordered to help Goodfellow avoid closure and the displacement       of many members of the Armed Forces from the community they       had grown to love.        (4) The impact of Charles' career can still be felt today       at Goodfellow Air Force Base, as it serves as a training       school for thousands of members from every Armed Force to       train in cryptology, intelligence, and firefighting.        (5) JoAnne assisted thousands of constituents in the       district offices of Representatives Tom Loeffler, Lamar       Smith, K. Michael Conaway, and August Pfluger.        (6) One of the several duties JoAnne spearheaded was the       annual process of nominations to the military service       academies, which was always a year-round process for her.        (7) With JoAnne's assistance, many of the young men and       women of the 11th congressional district of Texas went on to       serve the United States and attend one of the military       service academies.        (8) In addition, JoAnne was a fierce advocate of veterans       and helped thousands of individuals gain access to the       veterans benefits they rightfully earned.        (9) JoAnne's compassion and dedication helped make the       Concho Valley a better place.       SEC. 2.
