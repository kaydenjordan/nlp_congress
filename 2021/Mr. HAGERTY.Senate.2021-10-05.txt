 Mr. President, on August 7, I came to the Senate floor  to oppose the expedited passage of what is known as the bipartisan  infrastructure bill. I did that for several reasons, including because  it was obviously going to be taken hostage and used by Democrats to  impose Big Government socialism on America.   In those August 7 remarks, I said:         I am frustrated with this legislation . . . because it is       tied to . . . the Democrats' real ambition, which is their       multitrillion-dollar march to socialism that they will unveil       right after this infrastructure legislation is passed.        Democrats have admitted this . . . is [their] plan.        They previewed phase 1 of this scheme in March, when they       spent $1.9 trillion in the name of COVID relief. Of course,       90 percent of it had nothing to do with COVID. It was really       just a payoff to their most loyal political supporters.       Sadly, it is now causing the highest inflation . . . in       decades . . . [which] is a daily tax on every American who       [is buying] goods and services.    I went on to lay out phase 2, the step-by-step plan some Democrats  are using to launch their Big Government socialism fantasy.   Step 1, I said, was to change the conversation to trillions. Make  billions look small. Condition the Congress. Condition the media.  Condition people.   That has happened.   Step 2, I said, was to tell everyone that the United States needs  infrastructure.   That has happened too.   Step 3, I said, was to redefine the term ``infrastructure'' to  include Big Government socialism programs. Really muddy it up so that  no one could understand what they were actually talking about.   That has happened.   Step 4, I said, was that when more reasonable Democrats in the Senate  balk at some of the more extensive or egregious items, promise them a  two-track process: one for hard infrastructure and one for social  programs. Confuse the situation even further.   That has happened.   Step 5, I said, was to negotiate as much of the Democrats' socialist  wish list as possible into the infrastructure track. Then, put the rest  of the wish list into the Big Government socialism wish list bill.   That also has happened.   Step 6, I said, was to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill  through the Senate as quickly as possible. The Trojan horse would then  be through the gates.   Unfortunately, that has also happened.   Step 7, I said, was to hold that infrastructure bill hostage in the  House of Representatives until everything they couldn't get into the  infrastructure bill--meaning the trillions of dollars in Big Government  spending programs--also passes the Senate.   That is what we are seeing happening right now, just as I predicted  in early August.   Step 8, I said, was for the President to say that he wouldn't sign  the infrastructure bill into law if it is not accompanied by trillions  of dollars in Big Government socialism programs.   This has also happened.   Step 9, I said, was to get the Big Government socialism part passed  by circumventing the filibuster in the Senate. This would require  abusing an arcane loophole called reconciliation to pass trillions of  dollars in Big Government socialism with only 50 Democrat votes.   Step 10, I said, was to give more moderate Democrats political cover  to support the parliamentary trick and Big Government socialism  spending. To accomplish this, radical Democrats in the House are  threatening to shoot the hostage--the hostage is the infrastructure  bill that passed the Senate--a bill that more moderate Democrats more  strongly support.   These final two steps have not yet been executed because some  Democrats see the peril in following the dangerous instincts of the  most extreme elements of their party.   On September 27, the most radical House Democrats, backed by Speaker  Pelosi, stated that they were ``committed to voting for the  infrastructure bill only after [their Big Government socialism bill] is  passed.''   On September 29, one of the most outspoken of that group made it even  clearer, saying:         [S]everal months ago, we had an agreement with . . .       everybody else throughout the entire party . . . we will move       forward on this $3.5 trillion. And we will link the [two       bills, meaning the bipartisan infrastructure bill] and the       [big government socialism bill].    In revealing this, she confirmed that the far left has been  manipulating everyone involved in this process.   When I laid out Democrats' plans on the Senate floor back in August,  I used the word ``abracadabra'' to illustrate the sleight of hand  Democrats were attempting to pull off, saying that the American people  might not even notice--until it is too late--that their wallet has been  stolen and their country has been fundamentally changed.   Fortunately, it seems the American people are wising up to the trick.  The question I asked at the time--and the question the American people  should be thinking about--is this: If all of these policies and all of  the spending is so good, why does getting it done require a  parliamentary house of mirrors?   The answer to this question is that many Democrats know that the Big  Government socialism bill is unpopular; it is bad for the country.  Otherwise, the hostage-taking wouldn't be necessary.   This radical dream of Big Government socialism is stalled out at the  moment. So, at Speaker Pelosi's direction, President Biden drove up to  Capitol Hill on October 1 and, according to one Representative, told  House Democrats that in order to get the infrastructure bill done, we  have to get this agreement on the Big Government socialism bill through  the reconciliation.   According to a House Democrat, the President said that he wanted  ``both bills to go at the same time'' and specifically praised the far- left House Members who were ``exuberant,'' according to a progressive  congressional caucus member.   In other words, the far left is in charge, and President Biden  embraces that fact. His actions made clear that the infrastructure bill  is merely a tool to pass this Big Government socialism legislation.  Both must pass or neither will pass. Rather than use his platform to  defuse the hostage situation, President Biden is egging on the hostage- taking, and he is demanding Big Government socialism as the ransom.   Following President Biden's meeting with House Democrats, POLITICO  quoted a Democratic observer who said:         The fact that the president came to the Hill and whipped       against his own bill is the strangest thing I've ever seen.   [[Page S6903]]     It is very strange indeed, but it underscores the sad reality that  the far left is in charge of the Democratic Party.   What we have witnessed these past 9 months is the biggest bait-and- switch in American political history. The American people didn't vote  for Big Government socialism in 2020. Yet the Biden administration  proudly proclaims that it is the most radically leftwing administration  in American history.   According to POLITICO this morning, President Biden held a call with  progressive House Members yesterday in which he told them that he was  ``getting more and more frustrated with moderate Democrats.'' For what?  For refusing to be steamrolled by an agenda that most Americans don't  want?   Democrats' extreme politics are eclipsed only by their incompetence,  from Afghanistan to inflation, from our energy dependence to a border  collapse. Why? Because far-left radicals are dictating the agenda, and  they are calling all the shots.   With respect to this infrastructure hostage situation, the only  question now is, Will every Democrat pay the ransom of Big Government  socialism? And what is included in this ransom?   First, Democrats are currently haggling over the top-line cost. Will  it be $3.5 trillion, $2.5 trillion, $1.5 trillion, or something in  between? Again, this is trillions of dollars--with a ``t''--that we are  talking about.   The number that they use is actually irrelevant because the bill will  actually cost far more when you peel away the budget gimmicks. The  overall cost of the bill is only labeled at $3.5 trillion because  Democrats are pretending--again, for budget projection purposes--that  many of these costly programs are simply temporary and they will  terminate in a few years.   Ask any Democrat whether this bill just includes some temporary  spending--spending that will soon phase out. Ask them this: How will  they vote when it comes time to prevent the program from expiring? You  know this. Once you turn this sort of spending on, it will be next to  impossible to turn it off.   This is like valuing the cost of your home at the initial downpayment  price and ignoring the 30-year mortgage that follows.   Current estimates are that $3.5 trillion really will be more like  $5.5 trillion, and that is just in the first decade alone. Yet all of  Washington is currently obsessed with negotiations over where this  phony number is going to land. This is another distraction. It is a  tactic to divert your eyes from what is in the bill. No matter what  number is used, the total cost of this bill is vastly higher than they  claim, tens of trillions of dollars over my children's and your  children's lifetime. That is before even accounting for inevitable cost  overruns, waste, and program expansions. Of course, this means most of  the Big Government socialism bill will be debt-financed because the  bill will cost far more than projected even in the short run.   Given our current debt of nearly $30 trillion, allowing the fuse to  continue to burn on this new, inflation-fueling, economy-crushing level  of debt borders on insanity. It is the kind of thing that toppled world  powers in the past.   Now is the time to get our fiscal house in order or at least avoid  making it worse. Democrats want to solve the problem of a burning house  not by throwing water on it but by throwing on gasoline and arguing  that 50 gallons of gasoline is, well, better than throwing 100 gallons  of gasoline on it.   As obscene as Democrats' spending has become, focusing on cost  obscures the more insidious, destructive nature of Big Government  socialism.   Without careful oversight from the American people and their elected  Representatives here in Congress, government bureaucracy can't help but  serve its own interests. Over time, the bureaucracy has fed itself,  becoming ever more powerful, ever more hungry, and ever more present in  the lives of the American people.   Many Democrats believe in feeding the bureaucratic beast. They want  the government to grow, and they want Americans to be ever more  dependent upon government from cradle to grave. They want permanent  government control over childcare, over preschool, raising your  children, over healthcare, over energy, jobs, employers, and the list  goes on. This will mean that Americans must turn to Big Government for  more and more of life's necessities.   Big Government will increasingly control the lives of Americans  beginning in their formative years. Once the Federal Government is in  charge of funding preschool and daycare that has crowded out all the  private competition, you better believe the Federal Government will be  providing the lesson plans for your children as well.   This legislation will dramatically expand the welfare entitlement  state, meaning they will provide even more incentives for American  workers not to work. At a time when small businesses are desperately  searching for workers, this is the wrong thing to do. It will fuel  inflation; it will pile on more debt for our children and  grandchildren; and it will drastically increase taxes and regulations  on all Americans. More fundamentally and more sadly, it will move  America closer to a European socialist model where government  dependency replaces opportunity and where the dignity of work is lost.   The strength of America is our unique system--our spirit, our work  ethic, and our compassion for one another. The foundation for all this  has been the freedom to pursue our dreams thanks to the system of free  market capitalism--a system that has spread the American dream across  the globe. That dream spread because our country offered something  different.   This plan to spend tens of trillions of dollars fundamentally  threatens the American system and the American dream, not only by  jeopardizing our fiscal stability but by ushering in Big Government  socialism, which, if history is any guide, tends to crowd out  everything else and, perhaps, especially opportunity.   The American people have proven that they will flourish if permitted  to do so. In this sense, the only thing that can stop the American  people is the size and the reach of the American Government. For the  Senate to participate in imposing such self-inflicted wounds on our  country would be profoundly sad. History will not look kindly upon it.   However, one point from my remarks this summer remains just as true  today:         It only takes one Democrat to end this insanity, to stand       up and say he or she won't participate in this scheme.    The American people and their children and grandchildren will no  doubt be grateful if one of them chooses to do so.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
