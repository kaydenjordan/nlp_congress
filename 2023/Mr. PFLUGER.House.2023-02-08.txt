 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Chairman Comer's  resolution. The radical D.C. Council is literally putting the integrity  of our election system at risk.   They have passed a bill to allow illegal immigrants, Chinese and  Russian agents, foreign exchange students, and quite literally anyone  else who finds themselves on the streets of D.C. in our Nation's  Capital for longer than 30 days the ability to vote in elections.   This should not be a partisan issue, and you don't have to be a  Republican to understand why this is wrong.   Voting is a sacred right, regardless of what was just said. Voting is  a sacred right. This ridiculous measure disenfranchises millions of  legal American citizens and opens up our election system to a host of  security issues. In fact, the Mayor of D.C. didn't even sign this.   Congress must pass this resolution today, but we should also move to  pass my bill, H.R. 192, to make it clear to D.C. that they cannot ever  allow noncitizens to influence our Nation's Capital. We are putting  every single Member, both Republican and Democrat, on the record about  whether they support noncitizens voting.   Of course, I urge my colleagues in the House and the Senate and  President Biden to pass our bill, to pass this measure, to sign it into  law immediately.   Let me just say one thing in response to my colleague on the other  side of the aisle who a few moments ago said, ``We brought back our  worst possible instincts,'' I think when referencing the Republican  Party. This tells you everything you need to know. It tells you  everything you need to know about Americans. Please listen up, this  tells you everything you need to know, that the radicals want you to  think that this is normal, and it is not.   Americans deserve confidence in our election system and confidence in  knowing that only legal American citizens are casting their vote in  elections here in this country.
