 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2938) to exempt from the calculation of monthly income  certain benefits paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the  Department of Defense, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2938         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Honoring American Veterans       in Extreme Need Act of 2019'' or the ``HAVEN Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF CURRENT MONTHLY INCOME.         Section 101(10A) of title 11, United States Code, is       amended by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the       following:        ``(B)(i) includes any amount paid by any entity other than       the debtor (or in a joint case the debtor and the debtor's       spouse), on a regular basis for the household expenses of the       debtor or the debtor's dependents (and in a joint case the       debtor's spouse if not otherwise a dependent); and        ``(ii) excludes--        ``(I) benefits received under the Social Security Act (42       U.S.C. 301 et seq.);        ``(II) payments to victims of war crimes or crimes against       humanity on account of their status as victims of such       crimes;        ``(III) payments to victims of international terrorism or       domestic terrorism, as those terms are defined in section       2331 of title 18, on account of their status as victims of       such terrorism; and        ``(IV) any monthly compensation, pension, pay, annuity, or       allowance paid under title  [[Page H7216]]       10, 37, or 38 in connection with a disability, combat-related       injury or disability, or death of a member of the uniformed       services, except that any retired pay excluded under this       subclause shall include retired pay paid under chapter 61 of       title 10 only to the extent that such retired pay exceeds the       amount of retired pay to which the debtor would otherwise be       entitled if retired under any provision of title 10 other       than chapter 61 of that title.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The overriding principle of the bankruptcy system is to give people  who are overwhelmed with unmanageable debt a fresh start through  meaningful financial relief.   The Bankruptcy Code, either directly or indirectly, affects millions  of Americans, and all types of businesses, from large to small.   The system is supposed to work for everyone, from consumer debtors  and small business owners, to family farmers, servicemembers, and  veterans, and give them a new pathway to economic prosperity. But as we  have heard during a recent oversight hearing held by the Subcommittee  on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, the bankruptcy system  is not working.   In light of these concerns, the House Judiciary Committee unanimously  passed four bipartisan pieces of legislation to address this concern.  These include H.R. 2938, the Honoring American Veterans in Extreme Need  Act of 2019, or the HAVEN Act. This legislation, which has been  championed by my colleague on the committee, Congresswoman Lucy McBath,  addresses a fundamental unfairness in current bankruptcy law that  affects veterans receiving disability benefits.   Although Social Security benefits are not treated as income for  purposes of the Bankruptcy Code's means test, veterans' disability  benefits do constitute income under this test, even though, much like  Social Security, these benefits are a lifeline to many of its  recipients and are otherwise protected from seizure by creditors.   By counting such benefits as income, many veterans become ineligible  for the more immediate discharges available under Chapter 7 and,  instead, they are steered into Chapter 13, which requires a debtor to  make payments to creditors pursuant to a 3- to 5-year plan before he or  she can receive a discharge.   H.R. 2938 corrects this obvious inequity. It would treat certain  veterans' disability benefits paid by the Department of Veterans  Affairs and the Department of Defense the same as Social Security  payments under the Bankruptcy Code's means test.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath), the author of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass the HAVEN  Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3304) to exempt for an additional 4-year period, from the  application of the means-test presumption of abuse under chapter 7,  qualifying members of reserve components of the Armed Forces and  members of the National Guard who, after September 11, 2001, are called  to active duty or to perform a homeland defense activity for not less  than 90 days, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3304         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Guard and       Reservists Debt Relief Extension Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVISTS DEBT RELIEF AMENDMENT.         Section 4(b) of the National Guard and Reservists Debt       Relief Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-438; 122 Stat. 5000) is       amended by striking ``11-year'' and inserting ``15-year''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Under current law, National Guard members and reservists who serve on  active duty are, like other active-duty servicemembers, exempt from the  Bankruptcy Code's means test, which determines whether a debtor's  income is too high to have all of his or her debts erased in  bankruptcy.   Unless otherwise exempted, servicemembers and veterans must complete  the required forms and submit the specified paperwork to satisfy the  Bankruptcy Code's means test.   This requirement even applies to servicemembers who have returned to  the United States from active service and, thus, no longer receive  combat pay. Under the means test, a servicemember must calculate his or  her income based on the average monthly income that he or she received  during the six months preceding the filing date of the bankruptcy case,  rather than the debtor's actual income, which may be less because of  the debtor's noncombat status.   H.R. 3304, the National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Extension  Act of 2019 responds to this concern. This legislation would extend for  4 years the temporary authorization exempting certain qualifying  reserve component members of the Armed Services and National Guard  members from the Bankruptcy Code's means test.   This critical protection for National Guard members and reservists  must be extended before it expires at the end of the year. H.R. 3304  was unanimously passed out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to pass this important legislation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3311) to amend chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code,  to address reorganization of small businesses, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3311         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business       Reorganization Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. REORGANIZATION OF SMALL BUSINESS DEBTORS.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 3311, the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, is  legislation that I introduced with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Cline), to make a series of reforms to current bankruptcy law, which  would streamline the financial reorganization of small businesses.   Small, locally-owned businesses are the economic lifeblood of our  communities. But according to the Small Business Administration, only  about 20 percent of small businesses survive after their first year.   It is essential that our bankruptcy system does not punish  entrepreneurship and investment by foreclosing opportunities for small  businesses to financially reorganize.   This gap in the Bankruptcy Code is primarily due to the fact that  this process was designed with large, complex corporations in mind, and  does not include adequate protections or safeguards for small  businesses.   H.R. 3311 addresses this shortcoming by requiring the appointment of  a  [[Page H7220]]  trustee to monitor these cases and giving cases greater flexibility to  approve small business reorganization plans in a fair and equitable  manner.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3311, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I am proud to have introduced  H.R. 3311, the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019 with the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline), and I thank him for his strong  leadership on this issue, as well as the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins).   This bipartisan legislation was unanimously approved by the Judiciary  Committee and will address gaps in our bankruptcy system to provide  financial relief to small businesses.   This legislation is supported by the nonpartisan National Bankruptcy  Conference, as well as the American Bankruptcy Institute. I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass H.R. 3311.   I yield back the balance of my time.
