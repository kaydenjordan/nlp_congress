 Mr. Speaker, the Republican corporate tax  cut bill is a massive takeaway from middle America and a massive  giveaway to corporate America.   The Treasury Secretary says that these tax cuts will pay for  themselves, and more. News flash for the Treasury Secretary: Tax cuts  don't pay for themselves. They never have, not once, in human history.   What does pay for itself are Federal historic tax credits. When  Federal historic tax credits are used to renew historical buildings,  $1.20 for every $1 in tax credits is generated. When historic buildings  are renewed, including in my  [[Page H9721]]  community of Buffalo, New York, Main Streets across America are  restored, jobs are created, and new business income and property tax  revenues are generated.   The Federal historic tax credit does, in fact, pay for itself, and  more, by helping cities and communities to become economically  independent and self-sufficient.                            ____________________
