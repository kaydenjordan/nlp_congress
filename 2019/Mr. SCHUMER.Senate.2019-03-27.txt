 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded    Mr. President, there is so much going on. So I will be  addressing several topics today: healthcare, climate change, Mr.  Mueller's report, and Puerto Rico.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, two nights ago, President Donald Trump and Attorney  General Barr decided to escalate their 2-year war against healthcare to  a whole new level. They declared that the entire Affordable Care Act,  and the healthcare for tens of millions of Americans and protections  for more than 100 million, is unconstitutional and ought to be  eliminated.   Now, the President wants to go back to repeal and replace again? Make  our day. The Republicans here in the Senate tried over and over to deal  with repeal and replace. They couldn't because they have no  replacement. The American people spoke loud and clear in the November  2018 elections and addressed the Republican antics by defeating them  resoundingly. The American people resoundingly rejected the Republican  plan of repeal and replace for healthcare. In fact, very few Republican  Senators would embrace it when they were running as candidates.   Indeed, if the Republican Party wants to be, in Donald Trump's words,  ``the Party of healthcare,'' God help the middle class. God save the  middle class. God save people with disabilities. God save the hundreds  of millions with preexisting conditions.   If the administration had its way, the elimination of the Affordable  Care Act would send premiums soaring for millions of Americans. It  would revoke coverage for tens of millions more who gained coverage  through Medicaid expansions. It would strike protections for hundreds  of millions, even people who get coverage through their employer. It  would tell college students and graduates aged 21 to 26 that they could  no longer be on their parents' healthcare.   Let's not forget that this decision would impose billions of dollars  in new prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare. Does the  Republican Party really want to raise the price for senior citizens  when they buy drugs? That is what they are doing. That is what  President Trump is doing. I wasn't at the lunch where the President  talked about this, but I didn't hear any reports of any Republican in  that room rejecting what the President said when he said repeal and  replace. This Republican Party is the Party of healthcare? Come on,  now.   You can't undo all the healthcare for tens of millions, the  protections for preexisting conditions for hundreds of millions, the  drug costs for tens of millions of seniors, the protections for  millions of young college graduates,  [[Page S2014]]  and say you are for healthcare. You just can't.   Compounding the injury, the President's latest budget wants to cut  more than $1 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid. In doing so, the  President is breaking his promise, blatantly and uncaringly. He doesn't  care about what he promised people. He is breaking his promise to the  American people that he would do no such thing. This is the party of  healthcare? The Department of Justice's decision is a moral and  institutional outrage. Not only would it harm Americans, but it would  undermine the rule of law.   Today I am announcing a new plan--a new way for my colleagues to show  that they mean what they say. I am introducing a simple amendment to  the pending appropriations bill we are considering here in the Senate.  It will very simply prohibit the Department of Justice from using any  funding to litigate the downfall of ACA in the circuit court. Let's see  how all of our Republican colleagues who said they don't want to take  away protections for preexisting conditions, who said they don't want  to take away healthcare for millions, and who said they want to lower  seniors' drug costs vote on this.   Will the leader do what he has been so characteristic of doing in the  majority and block a chance for this amendment? Will any Republican on  the other side stand up and say: Don't block it, Mr. Leader; we have to  protect the American people's healthcare.   We shall see.   My Republican friends, you are going to have the chance this  afternoon or when they vote on this bill to show us which side you are  on.                                Climate Change    Mr. President, the Senate finally held the Republican leader's  promised political stunt vote on the issue of climate change and the  results did not make the Republicans happy. The stunt was exposed for  what it was. The whole issue of climate change--for the first time,  really--was debated here and turned on our Republican colleagues. It  became clear to the American people that our Republican colleagues have  no plan for climate change.   We have heard what they are against. We haven't heard a peep about a  comprehensive plan that they are for. The attempt by the Republicans to  make a mockery of the issue completely backfired. Leader McConnell was  forced to answer some questions that he has ducked for a very long  time. Whether or not Leader McConnell intended it, the fact is, at the  very least, that this Chamber is doing something it hasn't done in  years. It held an actual debate on the topic of climate change.   McConnell's stunt, again, boomeranged on him and his colleagues, and  they finally had to discuss this issue rather than do what they have  liked to do for the last 5 years and sweep it under the rug.   Yesterday, the day before, today, and continuing in the future, we  ask our Republican colleagues three simple questions to which they owe  an answer to their constituents. First, do you believe climate change  is real? Second, do you believe climate change is caused by human  activity? And third, do you believe Congress has to act immediately to  deal with this problem?   We are finally getting some answers, thanks to McConnell's trick that  he eventually played on himself. No less than Leader McConnell was  asked by the press yesterday afternoon at his Ohio Clock press camp if  he believes in climate change, and he said he believes it is real and  he believes it is caused by human activity. Well, there is one more  step if you believe all that: What is your answer--not what you are  against but what you are for?   I want to commend Senators Roberts, Alexander, and Murkowski. They  came to the floor and stated unequivocally and clearly that climate  change is real and caused by humans. Make no mistake, in this glacial  atmosphere controlled by the Republicans, when it comes to climate  change, this is real progress, but, of course, it is not close to  enough.   As to the third question, Leader McConnell offered no solution. All  we got was a sham vote that he voted against. So I ask Leader  McConnell: What is your plan? Some Republicans now seem to admit the  challenges of climate change. OK, that is good. Now, what is your  solution?   Turning the Senate floor into a campaign ad studio is not a solution  to climate change, nor is it very effective even for their own  purposes. Several Senators seemed to suggest that this problem can  simply be solved by funding for more research. I support funding for  research. It should be part of any climate plan. Yet I say to my  friends--particularly, those from coal States--that is not going to  solve the problem. Dealing with coal sequestration and coal technology  will, at best, solve 1 percent of the problem. So I say to my friends:  What about the other 99 percent, because 1 percent isn't enough?  Temperatures will still go up. The oceans will still rise. The terrible  kinds of disaster--flooding, tornadoes, and wildfires--that we have had  will continue. To simply say that you are doing some research into how  to deal with coal is not close to solving the problem.   Yesterday was a golden opportunity for this Chamber to come together  and show the American people that Republicans are serious about  tackling the threat. I asked to create a bipartisan select committee on  climate change. Let's get some of the people who are most interested in  this issue from different ideological stripes and from different places  in the country to come together and come up with a solution. Of course,  once again, the Republican leader blocked that genuine attempt.  Unfortunately, my good friend, the junior Senator from Wyoming,  objected when we asked for this. Instead, the Senate wasted the  American people's time on a ridiculous charade featuring a sham vote  that fooled no one.   Read the press today. Read the Wall Street Journal. Yesterday's vote  on the Republican version of the Green New Deal was not just a cynical  ploy--although it was--it was the ultimate ``tell'' that Republicans,  for all their talk, have no real plan to combat climate change, no real  plan on healthcare, and no real plan on climate change--just a lot of  political stunts.   I am glad that finally, though--this is the good news here--some of  my colleagues are starting to see the light and admit that it is real  and admit that it is caused by human activity. Now, they need to put  their money where their mouth is and work with us to take action that  matches the scale of the problem. If our colleagues refuse to join us  on a bipartisan basis in creating this select committee, we Democrats  aren't going to wait. We will take action on our own.   Later today, we will be announcing our own path. We are going on  offense on climate change, keeping a spotlight on this issue and making  sure that this Chamber keeps debating this most urgent issue of our  day.   We cannot play politics with our children's future any longer. I have  a new grandson. By the time he grows up, I don't want the waters to be  rising, the climate to be changing, and the whole world totally  discombobulated so he can't live a good and happy life. We should all  feel that way.   Avoiding the problem, whether it is because special interests are  saying to avoid it--the Koch brothers, coal industry, oil industry, and  everyone else--is not serving our country well.                                 Puerto Rico    Mr. President, the Republicans and the White House are refusing to  make several minor changes to the disaster bill under consideration  today--changes that will help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and  the Northern Mariana Islands.   Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria a year and a half ago-- devastation we haven't probably seen in any other part of our country.  It is reported that nearly $91 billion of damage was done by the  hurricane.   Puerto Rico is still struggling to recover. These are American  citizens. Let's not forget that. These are not people from some foreign  land. Yet it has been publicly reported that the President has told his  staff to find ways to limit Federal dollars from going to Puerto Rico.  It was even reported that at yesterday's lunch with Republicans, the  President complained that Puerto Rico has been getting too much aid. He  said he ``doesn't want another single dollar going to the island,''  even though he has held up the dollars that Democrats and Republicans  voted for.   We help Americans when there is a disaster. We don't pick and choose  because they may not vote for us--or  [[Page S2015]]  vote at all--or because we don't like the elected official. These are  people who are hurting.   What the President is doing with Puerto Rico is disgraceful but  typical of his view to divide and pick winners and losers. What the  President is doing is unacceptable and un-American.   I urge my Republican colleagues to come to the table, to accept the  commonsense changes we have proposed to help the territories recover-- the same proposals that passed the House--and to help us pass a  disaster package that addresses the needs not of some but of all  disaster survivors and that addresses the needs of all Americans who  are affected, not just those he happens to like. That is not what any  President before has done. That is not what America does.                                Mueller Report    Mr. President, finally, I want to say a few words on the report by  Special Counsel Mueller.   From the start, the Democrats have argued that nothing short of full  transparency will satisfy the American people's right to know what  happened during Russia's attack on our election. That is why it is  unacceptable that Mr. Barr, who reached his initial conclusions  quickly--in 48 hours--now needs several weeks, he says, to review the  report, and there are reports that he may now only release a summary of  that finding.   First, let me talk about the time.   Attorney General Barr moved like a hare to get out the summary he  wrote with the purpose of exonerating the President. He is now moving  like a tortoise to issue Mueller's full report. People are going to  ask: What the heck is going on? Is there some political motivation  here? Americans are entitled to see the full report, not a summary.   We all know the intelligence community can redact parts of the  report--small they will be--to protect secret sources, but we also  expect the rest of the report to be issued, not a summary. Mr. Barr has  issued one brief summary already, and many Americans don't trust that  summary because they want to see the whole report before jumping to a  conclusion. So we need the report now, without delay. We can't have  political considerations enter into it. ``Oh, we will delay it for  several weeks to let things cool off.'' I hope that is not what is  happening.   In any case, we need the report now. This is too important for Mr.  Barr to be playing politics. He can remove any cloud of suspicion by  releasing the full report as the President and members of his party  call for. When we read reports that Barr only wants to release a  summary and that Leader McConnell is unsupportive of transparency,  something doesn't smell right.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 908         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fluke Fairness Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Summer flounder is an important economic fish stock for       commercial and recreational fishermen across the Northeast       and Mid-Atlantic United States.        (2) The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and       Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) was reauthorized in       2006 and instituted annual catch limits and accountability       measures for important fish stocks.        (3) That reauthorization prompted fishery managers to look       at alternate management schemes to rebuild depleted stocks       like summer flounder.        (4) Summer flounder occur in both State and Federal waters       and are managed through a joint fishery management plan       between the Council and the Commission.        (5) The Council and the Commission decided that each       State's recreational and commercial harvest limits for summer       flounder would be based upon landings in previous years.        (6) These historical landings were based on flawed data       sets that no longer provide fairness or flexibility for       fisheries managers to allocate resources based on the best       science.        (7) This allocation mechanism resulted in an uneven split       among the States along the East Coast which is problematic.        (8) The fishery management plan for summer flounder does       not account for regional changes in the location of the fluke       stock even though the stock has moved further to the north       and changes in effort by anglers along the East Coast.        (9) The States have been locked in a management system       based on data collected from 1981 to 1989, thus, the summer       flounder stock is not being managed using the best available       science and modern fishery management techniques.        (10) It is in the interest of the Federal Government to       establish a new fishery management plan for summer flounder       that is based on current geographic, scientific, and economic       realities.

SUMMER FLOUNDER MANAGEMENT REFORM.         (a) Fishery Management Plan Modification.--Not later than 1       year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Council       shall submit to the Secretary, and the Secretary may approve,       a modified fishery management plan for the commercial       management of summer flounder under title III of the       Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16       U.S.C. 1851 et seq.) or an amendment to such plan that--  [[Page S2050]]         (1) shall be based on the best scientific information       available;        (2) establishes commercial quotas in direct proportion to       the distribution, abundance, and location of summer flounder       as reflected by fishery independent surveys conducted by the       National Marine Fisheries Service and State agencies;        (3) considers regional, coastwide, or other management       measures for summer flounder that comply with the National       Standards; and        (4) prohibits the establishment of commercial catch quotas       for summer flounder on a State-by-State basis using       historical landings data that does not reflect the status of       the summer flounder stock, based on the most recent       scientific information.        (b) Consultation With the Commission.--In preparing the       modified fishery management plan or an amendment to such a       plan as described in subsection (a), the Council shall       consult with the Commission to ensure consistent management       throughout the range of the summer flounder.        (c) Failure to Submit Plan.--If the Council fails to submit       a modified fishery management plan or an amendment to such a       plan as described in subsection (a) that may be approved by       the Secretary, the Secretary shall prepare and consider such       a modified plan or amendment.
