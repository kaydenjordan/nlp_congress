 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  5665, the Combating International Islamophobia Act. I thank my friend,  Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, for her leadership on this issue, and also  Chairman Meeks and the Speaker for bringing this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, the bill creates mechanisms for the State Department to  monitor and combat international  [[Page H7800]]  Islamophobia. There are approximately 1.8 billion Muslims in the world,  including 3.5 million Muslims in the United States.   Now, the truth is, while Islamophobia is not a new phenomenon, anti- Muslim violence has increased significantly over the past 20 years.  Just ask any Muslim what Islamophobia is.   We have seen incidents such as the terrorist attacks on mosques in  New Zealand, atrocities against the Uyghurs in China, and Islamophobic  laws in France that prevent girls from wearing the hijab in public.    The United Nations Human Rights Council now says that discrimination  and hatred toward Muslims have risen to epidemic portions.    Mr. Speaker, whether in the Halls of Congress,  our districts, or across the world, we will not tolerate Islamophobia.  We know what it is. We must work together to end this bigotry.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5665.
