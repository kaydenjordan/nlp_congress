 Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, on behalf of all the citizens of west  Kentucky, I thank everyone in America for the outpouring of support,  the prayers, the financial support, the people who took off and  traveled to west Kentucky to help remove debris and save people who  were trapped under roofs and buildings that had collapsed.   The devastation there is unlike anything I have ever seen. And in  talking to the media that is all in Mayfield, Kentucky, right now as we  speak, it is the worst damage they have ever seen from a tornado.   But the people in west Kentucky are resilient. They have so much  pride in their communities. Neighbor has helped neighbor, and that will  continue.   I ask, Madam Speaker, for a moment of silence on the House floor to  remember the 74 citizens of Kentucky who perished in the terrible  series of tornadoes that swept through our State this weekend.
