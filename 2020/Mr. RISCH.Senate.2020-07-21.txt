 Madam President, I rise in memory of Marcos Gil of  Arimo, ID, who gave his life on April 28, 2018 rescuing a young woman  from drowning.   When 17-year-old Marcos Gil saw his girlfriend caught in a circular  current downriver from a waterfall, he rushed to her aid. Despite being  a poor swimmer, Marcos jumped into the Portneuf River to save the 14- year-old girl as she called for help, submerging himself in the  powerful current and pushing her toward the bank of the river. With  Marcos' help, the young woman was able to grab hold of a branch at the  edge of the riverbank and swim to safety. Tragically, Marcos was unable  to extricate himself from that same current, drowning in the process of  saving the young woman's life.   Those who knew Marcos described him as friendly, deeply caring and  eager to serve, and the story of his courage and sacrifice continues to  resonate throughout eastern Idaho and beyond. Members of the community  have rallied around the Gil family, including the Bannock County  Sheriff's Office, which honored Marcos posthumously with the first ever  lifesaving award presented to a civilian, and the Red Cross of Greater  Idaho, which recognized Marcos with its East Idaho Real Heroes award.  This year, Marcos was posthumously awarded the Carnegie Medal by the  Carnegie Hero Fund Commission. The award, which is given to recognize  those who have risked their lives to save others, will be presented to  his parents, Margarito and Silvia Gil.   At just 17 years old, Marcos Gil left the world far too soon. He is  deeply missed by his family and all who were fortunate enough to know  him, and his bravery and heroism will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
