 Madam Speaker, as we know, March 7 marks the 55th  anniversary of the 1965 Selma march, where courageous men and women  crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery to  peacefully fight for the right for Black Americans to register to vote.   I rise today to honor those who marched and to spotlight and  highlight the Sisters of St. Joseph in my home district of Rochester,  New York. The Sisters of St. Joseph came to Alabama from New York and  played an integral role in running the Good Samaritan Hospital in  Selma, Alabama.   The 600 peaceful marchers that day were met with tear gas and clubs,  and the Good Samaritan Hospital was the only facility within nine  counties that would serve Black citizens. Despite having just emergency  room beds, the sisters diligently cared for the huge onslaught of  people who had been attacked and beaten in their pursuit of equality.   Some of the nuns present reside in Rochester today, and I could not  be prouder to call them my constituents. Let us celebrate them as  courageous leaders and honor them by committing to continue their fight  for justice and equality.                            ____________________
