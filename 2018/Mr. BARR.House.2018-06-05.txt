 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5655, the Camp  Nelson Heritage National Monument Act, which would establish the Camp  Nelson Heritage National Monument in Jessamine County, Kentucky, as a  unit of the National Park Service system.   I would like to especially thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Bishop), chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, for his support  of this legislation and for guiding us through this process and  bringing it to the House floor.   Throughout my time in Congress, Mr. Speaker, I fought to bring  national attention and recognition to Camp Nelson, a site that has the  ability to unite our Nation and inspire a greater understanding and  appreciation for Civil War history, African American history, and a  compelling story of the struggle for freedom.  [[Page H4754]]    Camp Nelson was founded in 1863 as a Union Army supply depot,  training center, and hospital for the Federal Armies in Kentucky and  Tennessee. The camp, located in southern Jessamine County, Kentucky,  covered 4,000 acres, with over 300 buildings and fortifications. It  housed 2,000 to 8,000 troops, over 1,000 civilian employees, and, after  1864, over 3,000 African American refugees. The existing site contains  several important Civil War resources that demonstrate the cultural and  historical themes prominent at the time.   The most significant aspect of Camp Nelson's history was its role as  the third largest recruitment and training center for U.S. Colored  Troops and home to many of their families. Because of its proximity to  the Confederate States, African American men fled to Camp Nelson to  enlist and escape slavery. Because the Emancipation Proclamation did  not apply to Kentucky, a slaveholding border State not part of the  Confederacy, Camp Nelson represented for a time the only avenue for  Kentucky slaves to achieve emancipation.                                time  1715    By the time the 13th Amendment was ratified and ended slavery in  1865, 70 percent of Kentucky slaves had already been emancipated,  largely in part because of the efforts made at Camp Nelson. Today, the  site at Camp Nelson retains rich archeological evidence, including  several earthen fortifications and other original landscape features  dating back to the Civil War encampment.   Camp Nelson is recognized as a National Historic Landmark, a key  requirement in the process of being included as a unit of the National  Park System. It is also part of the Civil War Discovery Trail and the  National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.   Additionally, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has recommended  that this site become a national monument. I want to thank Secretary  Zinke for his personal attention to this effort and for his support and  recommending to the President designating Camp Nelson as part of the  National Park Service.   Camp Nelson has proven its ability to unite the people not just of  Jessamine County and the Commonwealth of Kentucky, but of the Nation as  a whole. Even further, it has the potential to convey nationally  significant information about the survival and persistence of African  American soldiers and their families as they fought for their freedom.   Over the past few years, I have met with stakeholders and descendants  of those who lived and worked at Camp Nelson. It is apparent that this  site, based on their testimonies, is important not only to the history  of the Commonwealth, but to the history of our Nation.   I would like to thank these local stakeholders who shared their  stories and educated me and my staff about the significant  contributions of this historical site. Their advocacy and support  effectively demonstrated the positive local sentiment about Camp  Nelson.   Specifically, I would like to thank Reverend Robert Gates, Sr., the  pastor of the historic First Baptist Church of Camp Nelson. His great- great-grandfather on his mother's side was the Sergeant Reverend Jesse  Tull, Sr., who was a member of Company C, 119th U.S. Colored Infantry  and made great contributions at Camp Nelson. Also, Reverend Moses Lee  Radford, pastor of the Nicholasville First Baptist Church; the County  Judge Executive David West; former County Judge Executive Cassidy, who  was a major contributor to acquiring the land for the county and  preserving the history there; Dr. Stephen McBride, director of  interpretation and archeology at Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park;  and Mrs. Mary Kozak, special projects director for Jessamine County,  Kentucky, who has worked tirelessly for about 20 years preserving the  history of Camp Nelson.   I also want to thank several others who contributed greatly to our  efforts and assisted in gaining support for this effort, including  Governor Matt Bevin; the Jessamine County Fiscal Court; the Lexington- Fayette NAACP chapter; the Jessamine Chamber of Commerce; the Kentucky  Historical Society; and my colleague Congresswoman Marcia Fudge from  Ohio, among others.   It is one of my goals in Congress to make Camp Nelson a place where  the entire Nation can experience the rich history it has to offer and  appreciate the amazing story it tells about the long march toward  freedom for African Americans in Kentucky and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
