 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about how proud I was to  support the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act last  week. It decriminalizes marijuana and expunges marijuana arrests from  the books.   Marijuana laws have been devastating to minority communities. African  and Latino Americans are four times more likely to be arrested for  marijuana offenses than are White Americans, and they receive longer  prison sentences for the same crimes.   Today, minorities are in prison for offenses that are no longer  crimes in most States. This bill would give these Americans a fresh  start.   In addition, the bill has an opportunity trust fund to create  opportunities for minority marijuana businesses.   It is time we passed this bill and ended the gross injustice of  marijuana law enforcement in this country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6387) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish a  school security coordinating council, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6387         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``School and Daycare       Protection Act''.       SEC. 2. SCHOOL SECURITY COORDINATING COUNCIL.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 710 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 714. School security coordinating council.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 6387, the  School and Daycare Protection Act.   Over the years, we have seen horrific school shootings from Columbine  to Sandy Hook to Parkland.   As a father of triplets, I cannot imagine the pain of those who have  lost loved ones to school violence.   As I look back at my time leading the Committee on Homeland  Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and  Recovery, I take pride in the work that we did in the school security  space.   Under my leadership, school security was, for the first time in  Congress, viewed as a homeland security issue.   The Department of Homeland Security certainly takes that view, too.  My bill, the School and Daycare Protection Act, recognizes that there  are a diverse range of DHS entities with school and campus security  responsibilities and seeks to ensure that activities are coordinated.   H.R. 6387 establishes a standing council within DHS to coordinate  school security activities, plans, and policies, and requires DHS to  report to Congress about the council's activities.   Additionally, it authorizes DHS to participate in the government-wide  SchoolSafety.gov clearinghouse.   Within DHS, there are some incredibly useful school security  strategies, tools, and research being produced.   CISA published a K-12 School Security Guide. Secret Service put out  an operational guide for preventing targeted school violence. And FEMA  maintains a multi-hazard toolkit to help school officials manage  everything from tornadoes to active shooters.   H.R. 6387 would help ensure that such DHS school security efforts are  coordinated to get education officials actionable tools and support.   A version of this bill passed the House last Congress, and in this  Congress, the committee approved it with strong bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4162]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank the gentleman for supporting this bill. We know that this is  an issue that is of a bipartisan nature. We all want to make sure that  our children are safe in school and between home and school.   We all have an interest in getting the best information and resources  to school administrators, teachers, and parents to protect our  children.   H.R. 6387 focuses on ensuring that DHS is effectively coordinating  internally to help combat violence and other terrorist threats facing  schools.   Consideration of H.R. 6387 is particularly timely, given how often  schools continue to be targeted.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6387, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5633) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance  transparency regarding reports conducted by the Inspector General of  the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5633         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5633, and yield  such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson), the author of this bill and the chairman of the Committee on  Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared  to close after the gentleman closes.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   A transparent Office of Inspector General is a critical piece of a  functional and effective Department of Homeland Security.   H.R. 5633 seeks to make the DHS OIG more transparent by requiring  additional public reporting by the DHS OIG so that the public and  Congress know how their tax dollars are spent and can hold the DHS  Secretary and other leaders within the department accountable  [[Page H4164]]  for wrongdoings by the agency or its personnel.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1540) to provide for joint reports by relevant Federal agencies  to Congress regarding incidents of terrorism, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1540         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Reporting Efficiently to       Proper Officials in Response to Terrorism Act of 2021'' or       the ``REPORT Act''.       SEC. 2. DUTY TO REPORT.         (a) In General.--Whenever an act of terrorism occurs in the       United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the       Attorney General, the Director of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation, and, as appropriate, the head of the National       Counterterrorism Center, shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees, by not later than one year after       the completion of the investigation concerning such act by       the primary Government agency conducting such investigation,       an unclassified report (which may be accompanied by a       classified annex) concerning such act.        (b) Content of Reports.--A report under this section       shall--        (1) include a statement of the facts of the act of       terrorism referred to in subsection (a), as known at the time       of the report;        (2) identify any gaps in homeland or national security that       could be addressed to prevent future acts of terrorism; and        (3) include any recommendations for additional measures       that could be taken to improve homeland or national security,       including recommendations relating to potential changes in       law enforcement practices or changes in law, with particular       attention to changes that could help prevent future acts of       terrorism.        (c) Exception.--        (1) In general.--If the Secretary of Homeland Security, the       Attorney General, the Director of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation, or, as appropriate, the head of the National       Counterterrorism Center determines any information described       in subsection (b) required to be reported in accordance with       subsection (a) could jeopardize an ongoing investigation or       prosecution, the Secretary, Attorney General, Director, or       head, as the case may be--        (A) may withhold from reporting such information; and        (B) shall notify the appropriate congressional committees       of such determination.        (2) Saving provision.--Withholding of information pursuant       to a determination under paragraph (1) shall not affect in       any manner the responsibility to submit a report required       under subsection (a) containing other information described       in subsection (b) not subject to such determination.        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Act of terrorism.--The term ``act of terrorism'' has       the meaning given such term in section 3077 of title 18,       United States Code.        (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) in the House of Representatives--        (i) the Committee on Homeland Security;        (ii) the Committee on the Judiciary; and        (iii) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; and        (B) in the Senate--        (i) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental       Affairs;        (ii) the Committee on the Judiciary; and        (iii) the Select Committee on Intelligence.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1540, the REPORT Act.   In December of 2015, a terrorist attack in San Bernardino,  California, left 14 people dead and 22 wounded. Local law enforcement  and first responders were heroes that day, saving lives just as they do  every day across this Nation.   When terrorists strike our communities, Americans understandably have  questions, and they look to us, their elected Representatives, for  answers.   Our constituents want to know whether there were warnings or  indications of a potential attack; whether anything could have been  done to prevent it; and what can be done to thwart future attacks.   H.R. 1540, the REPORT Act, authored by Congressman Pete Aguilar,  seeks to ensure that Members of Congress can be more responsive to  their constituents by requiring better communication by Federal  agencies with Congress following an attack.   Specifically, the bill would require the Secretary of Homeland  Security, in coordination with the Attorney General and the FBI  Director, to submit to Congress an unclassified report within 1 year of  completing a terrorism investigation.   The report, which may include a classified annex, must include a  statement of facts regarding the attack; information on any homeland or  national security gaps that could be addressed to prevent future  attacks; and any recommendations for measures, including changes in the  law, that would improve homeland or national security.   This vital information needs to be shared by the executive branch  with the legislative branch to strengthen our Nation's terrorism  response and prevention efforts.   H.R. 1540 is a commonsense measure, and I urge my colleagues to  support it. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar), the author of this commonsense  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation faces a complex and evolving terrorism threat  landscape. We all celebrate the heroic first responders who save lives  when an attack occurs, but the American people also expect Congress to  respond to attacks and prevent future ones.   The REPORT Act is a commonsense bill that would ensure Congress has  the information necessary to do just that.   The REPORT Act received bipartisan support during the committee  consideration, and an earlier version of the bill passed the House in  the 115th Congress by voice vote.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1540, the REPORT Act, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4209) to support remediation of illicit cross-border tunnels, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4209         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Illicit Cross-Border       Tunnel Defense Act''.       SEC. 2. COUNTER ILLICIT CROSS-BORDER TUNNEL OPERATIONS.         (a) Counter Illicit Cross-border Tunnel Operations       Strategic Plan.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs       and Border Protection, in coordination with the Under       Secretary for Science and Technology, and, as appropriate,       other officials of the Department of Homeland Security, shall       develop a counter illicit cross-border tunnel operations       strategic plan (in this section referred to as the       ``strategic plan'') to address the following:        (A) Risk-based criteria to be used to prioritize the       identification, breach, assessment, and remediation of       illicit cross-border tunnels.        (B) Promote the use of innovative technologies to identify,       breach, assess, and remediate illicit cross-border tunnels in       a manner that, among other considerations, reduces the impact       of such activities on surrounding communities.        (C) Processes to share relevant illicit cross-border tunnel       location, operations, and technical information.        (D) Indicators of specific types of illicit cross-border       tunnels found in each U.S. Border Patrol sector identified       through operations to be periodically disseminated to U.S.       Border Patrol sector chiefs to educate field personnel.

(ii) Staffing needs, including the following:         (I) A position description for counter illicit cross-border       tunnel operations personnel.        (II) Any specialized skills required of such personnel.        (III) The number of such full time personnel, disaggregated       by U.S. Border Patrol sector.         (2) Report to congress on strategic plan.--Not later than       one year after the development of the strategic plan, the       Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall       submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on the       implementation of the strategic plan.        (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and       Border Protection $1,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2023       and 2024 to carry out--        (1) the development of the strategic plan; and        (2) remediation operations of illicit cross-border tunnels       in accordance with the strategic plan to the maximum extent       practicable.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4209, the DHS Illicit Cross- Border Tunnel Defense Act.   Since 1990, more than 200 cross-border tunnels built by smugglers and  transnational criminal organizations have done smuggling of illicit  drugs, humans, weapons, and money, and have been discovered along the  U.S. border with Mexico.                                time  1245    The Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2012, signed into law by  President Obama, enhanced the criminal penalties for unauthorized  construction,  [[Page H4166]]  financing, or use of a tunnel or subterranean passageway between the  U.S. and another country.   Yet, since that time, transnational criminal organizations, or TCOs,  continue to construct illicit cross-border tunnels in the hopes of  circumventing detection by border authorities.   The tunnels are mainly used to traffic narcotics, such as heroin,  fentanyl, and methamphetamine, and facilitate the illicit movement of  weapons, contraband, and currency.   Introduced by Congressman Pfluger, H.R. 4209 seeks to build upon  existing law to enhance Customs and Border Protection's capacity to  detect and remediate illicit cross-border tunnels. In 2013, CBP  established a Tunnel Program Management Office to develop and acquire  technology to detect tunnels.   With funding and technological advances, CBP has significantly  increased its ability to detect the existence of tunnels. These  developments have allowed the agency to progress from manual methods of  detection, such as human observation of traffic patterns and routine  patrol operations, to the use of sensors to detect, classify, and  localize subterranean activity.   To help the Tunnel Program Management Office become more effective,  H.R. 4209 provides dedicated funding and requires the development and  implementation of a comprehensive and strategic approach to tunnel  threats.   In addition to authorizing $1 million annually to purchase  specialized material to seal the tunnels, the bill directs DHS to issue  a strategic plan that addresses resource needs, including technology  and staffing needs, to identify, assess, and remediate illicit tunnels.   The bill also requires the submission of a report to Congress on  activities carried out to implement the strategy.   This legislation is very timely. Just as technology that allows our  government to detect the existence of these illicit tunnels has  improved, so has the technology used by transnational criminal  organizations to construct them.   In January 2020, CBP discovered the longest smuggling tunnel ever  found on the U.S.-Mexico border. The tunnel stretched for more than  4,000 feet and was equipped with a makeshift elevator, drainage and air  ventilation, and high-voltage electrical cables.   The consequences of not detecting and shutting down these illicit  cross-border tunnels stretch far beyond our border communities. The  impact of narcotics and weapons making their way into American  communities can be devastating.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4209, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am prepared to  close after the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me just commend the gentleman from Texas for this  well-thought-out legislation. The challenge of ending the scourge of  drugs in our communities is complex as there are many ways these  poisons come into our communities.   H.R. 4209 targets illicit cross-border tunnels. By joining me in  supporting this legislation today, Members can help CBP continue to  carry out its detection and remediation program in a strategic and  commonsense way.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4209 seeks to make smart and bipartisan investments  in our Nation's border security. For that reason, I urge my colleagues  to support H.R. 4209, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4476) to establish the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  Trade and Economic Security Council and the position of Assistant  Secretary for Trade and Economic Security within the Department of  Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any  extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4476,  the DHS Trade and Economic Security Council Act of 2021.   One of the Department of Homeland Security's core missions is to  preserve and uphold the Nation's prosperity and economic security.  However, in 2020, DHS completed an economic security assessment that  found that COVID-19 ``laid bare some growing gaps in the U.S. economy,  particularly around manufacturing and supply chains for tangible  goods.''   To ensure the U.S. has a secure, resilient, and prosperous economy,  the assessment concluded supply chain gaps that could be exploited by  adversaries should be mitigated.   H.R. 4476 seeks to help minimize such vulnerabilities and enhance  economic security efforts at DHS by codifying two existing entities  within the Department: one, the DHS Trade and Economic Security Council  and, two, the position of Assistant Secretary for Trade and Economic  Security.   H.R. 4476 specifies that the mission of the council, composed of  members across the Department, is to assist the DHS Secretary with  identifying risks to trade and economic security, setting priorities  for the Nation's trade and economic security, and proposing changes to  enhance economic security.   Additionally, H.R. 4476 outlines what the Assistant Secretary for  Trade and Economic Security's responsibilities would be to perform,  including supply chain activities and enhancements.   H.R. 4476 will help enhance the reliability of our domestic supply of  essential goods to secure our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, January 27, 2022.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: I write concerning H.R. 4476, the       ``DHS Trade and Economic Security Council Act of 2021,''       which was additionally referred to the Committee on Energy       and Commerce.        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 4476, the Committee agrees to waive formal consideration       of the bill as to provisions that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee. The Committee takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I also request that       you support my request to name members of the Committee to       any conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter       into the report on H.R. 4476.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                     Committee on Homeland Security,                                        House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, January 27, 2022.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 4476, the ``DHS Trade and Economic Security Council Act       of 2021.'' I recognize that the Committee on Energy and       Commerce has a jurisdictional interest in H.R. 4476, and I       appreciate your effort to allow this bill to be considered on       the House floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on Energy and Commerce       with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill       or similar legislation in the future, and I would support       your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House--Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 4476 in the Committee       report on this measure and in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration of this bill. I look forward to working       with you on this legislation and other matters of great       importance to this Nation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                          Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted America's economic  security and exposed supply chain vulnerabilities.   As a proud New Jerseyan, I would like to acknowledge the yeoman's  work the Port of New York and New Jersey, the largest container port on  the East Coast, has done during the pandemic to meet the demands of the  growth in e-commerce and move cargo into our communities in a timely  way.   As our economy continues to recover, H.R. 4476 will help ensure that  DHS is well-positioned to proactively address potential threats and  vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries or exacerbated.   I thank my colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee for  unanimously supporting H.R. 4476, and I urge all of my colleagues to do  the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
