 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.   In the spirit of good sportsmanship, I accept the gentlewoman's wager  and the barbecue that I will get to enjoy next week.   The Houston Astros are an amazing team, with 101 wins, but the  Dodgers are better, with 104. I know that the Astros stumbled across  that finish line to make it to the World Series. I know it is going to  be a hell of a game between the two teams.   If we lose, I will bring some French dip sandwiches from the  Louisiana institution, Philippe's, in downtown Los Angeles.   Let the best team win. Play ball.
