 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.   I join my colleagues tonight in honoring a devoted public servant and  friend, Rick Perry.   Rick has dedicated his life to making Texas and America even greater,  exemplified by his service in the U.S. Air Force and his record as the  longest-serving Governor in Texas history.   Over two decades ago, I served under then-Governor Perry as his  secretary of state, where we worked to create a better Texas. Together,  we sold our home State to America and the world by ushering in  unprecedented economic growth and creating one of the strongest  economies in the United States and, frankly, the world. We would often  tell prospects: Texas wasn't open for business; Texas was wide open for  business.   We traveled across the Nation, visiting our communities and even  stopping by a few ballparks along the way, where I played catcher as he  threw out the first pitch. I would tell you that he threw more balls  than he threw strikes.   I also have fond memories of our families spending quality time  together over the years. Running the river in Austin wasn't bad either.   Rick's principled and sharp leadership has been a great asset to our  Nation while serving as the United States Secretary of Energy, paving  the way for greater economic growth and energy independence. Who better  to serve as Energy Secretary than the former Governor of the leading  energy State in our country?   It has been an honor to play on his team and to have his support.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Rick, Anita, Griffin, Sydney, and their new  grandbaby all the best in the next season of their lives.   Mr. Speaker, again, I remind Secretary Perry how much I appreciated  his call on the night of the baseball shooting to simply tell me, ``I  am with you, brother.''   May God bless Texas. May God bless the Perry family. May God bless  this greatest country in the world, the one that Rick Perry helped  create and maintain, the United States of America.
