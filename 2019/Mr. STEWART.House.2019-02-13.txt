 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for chairing this  Special Order.   You listen to our colleagues, and it is hard to listen to this and  not just feel overwhelmed by it. Some things are so emotional and some  things are so obvious that there are times when you just speak from the  heart.   One week ago tonight, little baby Dawson was born to my family, a  beautiful little baby boy, my sixth grandson. It is unbelievable to me  that someone would argue that you could take that child, moments before  birth, pull him from his mother's protection, and destroy that life,  take away any chance he has of having any happiness in this world, take  away any chance he has of being loved in this world; that you would  suggest that and not call it evil.   That we could have this conversation like the Virginia Governor who  said, Well, we'll take that infant; we'll make them comfortable while  we decide how we are going to kill it. How could you have that  conversation and not call it evil?   If you think that is okay, go make that argument to the American  people. But while you are making that argument, be honest. Yes, this is  a baby. Yes, it is moments from birth; in some cases the child has been  delivered. It is alive, laying there before you. Yes, you are going to  kill it.   Most Americans find that repulsive. Most Americans find it  unbelievable that we are having this conversation. Most Americans find  it evil.   Please help us save these children.
