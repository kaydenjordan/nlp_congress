 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 5, H.R. 21,  making appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. I  further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I would like to speak on the preceding  motion, but before I do, I would like to yield my time to my colleague  from New Mexico.    I will briefly conclude my comments recognizing my  colleague from Indiana is also on the floor.   I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his words. He spoke about the  [[Page S290]]  motion I just made. I will be on the floor tomorrow and Saturday and  next week--Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday--to share stories that have  been shared with me and are being shared with me every day by  Virginians affected and the Agencies the Senator from New Mexico  discussed and others.   Just to clarify, the motion that I made earlier was to pass a House  bill that is pending before us. It is an appropriation for the  remainder of the fiscal year for the following Departments and  Agencies: Department of Interior; Environmental Protection Agency;  Forest Service; Department of Treasury, including the IRS; Judiciary;  Executive Office of the President--we are trying to fund the Executive  Office of the President; the District of Columbia; Department of  Agriculture, including the Food Stamp Program; the Food and Drug  Administration; Department of Transportation; Department of Housing and  Urban Development; Department of Commerce; Department of Justice,  including the FBI; science-related Agencies, including NASA; the  Department of State and several related and independent Agencies.   That was the motion that I made that was objected to by the majority  leader.   Three items quickly. There are three levels of surreal illogic to the  position we are in. The first is, we are having a legitimate debate  between Congress and the President on border security and immigration  reform. That is a very legitimate debate, in which there are  intellectually respectable differences of opinion. If we are having a  debate about that, why would we punish the workers who are charged with  administering the Food Stamp Program? Why punish workers in the  National Forest and National Parks? Why punish the citizens who need  those services? The first level of illogic to the position we are in is  we are punishing both workers and the citizens who need services  completely unconnected with the border and immigration reform issue.   Surreal illogic No. 2. If we are having a debate about safety and  security on the border, why would we demand Customs and Border Patrol  folks work without pay? Those who are affected and who are part of the  Agencies dealing with the dispute are, by all accounts, the frontline  people who are dealing with this--immigration judges, Custom and Border  Patrol folks, ICE agents, DEA agents, the Coast Guard, which interdicts  drugs, FBI, U.S. marshals, BATF agents--why would we make their lives  harder when they are the safety and security professionals who are  charged with dealing with the issue we are trying to figure out?   The final level of surreal illogic, as I yield to my colleague from  Indiana, is this. I want to thank all my colleagues because a week ago,  by unanimous consent, we passed a backpay bill that the President  signed yesterday. Now we have guaranteed that the Federal Treasury will  write a check for the paychecks for all of these workers. It is  actually probably going to be more because to close and restart  actually costs a little bit more. We agreed to pay backpay in this and  any future shutdown to these workers.   So if we are going to pay them anyway, why wouldn't we want them to  be serving Americans instead of being furloughed? If we are going to  pay them anyway--if the Federal Treasury is going to write that check-- wouldn't it be better if they are in their offices answering phones,  processing food stamp applications, and serving their fellow Americans  than locked out of their offices?   We bar Federal workers from striking because of the need for  continuous government operations, but we are locking them out of their  offices while we have agreed to give them full payment for the work  they would have been doing had we not locked them out. That is not  fiscally smart.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President. I regret it is necessary to re-introduce  legislation that prevents a President from withdrawing the United  States from NATO. Recent reports confirm that President Trump has  repeatedly proposed doing so over the past year. In addition to concern  over U.S. national security, this threat to withdraw also raises  important constitutional issues. What is the role of Congress in  treaties--not just entering into them, but also leaving them?  Particularly with a treaty obligation that is as central to U.S.  security as NATO--as repeatedly affirmed by Congress--no president  should or can be allowed to unilaterally withdraw without the advice  and consent of the Senate.   Our allies with whom we have fought alongside since World War II and  earlier in some cases, are questioning our allegiance for the first  time in the history of the modern international order. President Trump  has called our European allies ``foes'' while aligning himself with a  brutal authoritarian, Vladimir Putin, over the professional assessment  of the U.S. intelligence community. Last year, at the NATO summit in  Brussels, the President insulted our allies and threatened to leave the  alliance if defense spending was not ramped up. The President has also  questioned the U.S. commitment to NATO's mutual defense provision and  we still do not know what he discussed with President Putin at their  meeting in Helsinki. As such, we are forced to ask what options we have  to preserve U.S. membership in the primary tool of peace and stability  for the last 70 years, NATO.   In response to the only invocation of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty,  more than 1,100 servicemembers from our NATO allies have given their  lives fighting alongside the United States. This is a sacrifice that  should not be cast aside by our President who continues to depict the  alliance as a protection racket and ``obsolete.'' While we must  continue to press every country to increase defense spending to meet  the agreed-upon goal of 2 percent of GDP by 2024, the President should  not disparage our allies and threaten NATO withdrawal. Unfortunately,  without action from Congress, he might just do so. For this reason, we  must firmly state opposition, use our constitutional powers of advice  and consent and of the purse to block any withdrawal and preemptively  authorize legal proceedings to challenge any decision to terminate U.S.  membership.   The legislation I am introducing today along with Senators Gardner,  Reed, Graham, Coons, Rubio, Blumenthal, and Collins, is a bipartisan  message to the President and the necessary tool needed to block this  President, or any President, from unilaterally terminating the NATO  treaty. It is the position of the Senate, supported by this Resolution,  and previous resolutions, including the original vote of 82-13 in 1949  to give the Senate's advice and consent to join NATO, that the United  States through its elected officials is unequivocally opposed to the  U.S. withdrawing from NATO.   I am proud to have bipartisan support for this bill to ensure that  the safety of the American people is prioritized through our continued  membership in NATO. Lastly, supporting this bill would fittingly honor  the late Senator John McCain, one of the fiercest advocates for NATO,  who co-sponsored this bill last year--one of the last bills he co- sponsored. I strongly encourage my colleagues in both the Senate and  the House of Representative to support this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President.
