 Madam President, I thank the leader for his kind remarks  and incredible research. I particularly appreciate the comments about  Flip McConnaughey, whom I worked with for 40 years before he passed  away from cancer. If there was ever anybody in the United States who  had a municipal problem, he would work with me as we grew Gillette, and  he was able to solve a lot of those municipal problems. So he was the  go-to person on the Hill for all of that.   I say to the Senator, I really appreciate those comments, as well as  all of the other things you mentioned, particularly the ones about  Diana. Without her, I would not have had the shoe store, I would not  have been in politics, I would not have been here, nor would I have  been able to do anything. I wouldn't have traveled around Wyoming. She  does most of the driving so that I can work on speeches and  legislation, and it is a chance for us to visit a little bit too. We  don't get to do a lot of that here in Washington because of the  schedules, again.   But I particularly want to thank you for your leadership during this  time. It has been phenomenal, like the research that you did on that  speech. The strategy that you put into legislation is incredible. You  get a lot done, in spite of the differences we might have with the  House or with the other side of the aisle or occasionally with the  President, but you keep us moving forward. It is a talent that is hard  to do under the circumstances that we work, and I really appreciate it.  So thank you for your comments.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
