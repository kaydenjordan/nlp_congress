 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Stanley  Police Officer Nick Winum, who was tragically killed in the line of  duty this weekend.   Originally a successful tomato farmer on the Eastern Shore, Officer  Winum followed his calling to serve others and joined the Virginia  State Police. After working for more than a decade as a State trooper,  Officer Winum transitioned into the Stanley Police Department in 2016,  where he served until his passing.   For the last 15 years of his life, he put the well-being of his  neighbors above his own, and our community is forever grateful for the  sacrifice he made while keeping our streets safe.   Officer Winum is survived by the love of his life, his wife, Cara;  his children, Jedediah, Aubrey, Jackson, and Nicki; his granddaughter,  Willa; as well as his parents, siblings, and 24 nieces and nephews.   He is remembered as a man of honor and principle who loved the Lord,  his family, and his country.   To honor this patriot, those who knew him will continue to carry on  his legacy of kindness, compassion, and service to others. I join his  law enforcement colleagues in mourning his passing and extend my  deepest condolences to his family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the Constitution vests primary responsibility  in State legislatures to set the times, places, and manner of  congressional elections, allowing States and localities to determine  how best to conduct elections that suit the needs of voters in their  communities.   But the bill before us today, and this amendment also, reverses the  longstanding history of State control over the electoral process, makes  unconstitutional changes to our election laws through a top-down  Federal power grab, and places unprecedented limitations on political  speech.   Rather than strengthening the election process by working with  Republicans to find bipartisan solutions, H.R. 1 was written without  any input from Republican Members. Some of the most egregious  provisions include mandating that States allow ballot harvesting,  mandating same-day registration in all 50 States, abolishing the  signature requirements for mail-in ballots, mandating absentee ballots  be accepted up to 10 days after election day, mandating that States  send ballots in the mail proactively, and, finally, forcing taxpayers  to pay politicians to campaign for office.   This bill is nothing more than an attempt by Democrats to cement  their fragile and fleeting majorities at taxpayer expense.   The bill would limit the free speech of my voters, use my voters' tax  dollars to fund candidates, and violate the Constitution by superseding  the Commonwealth's ability to determine their own laws on voter  eligibility.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this  misguided and radical legislation.    Madam Speaker, the death of George Floyd last year led to  communities across the Nation to come together to speak out against  injustices, call for additional accountability and transparency in  policing, and advocate for solutions that could move us forward  together as a nation.   But instead of working with Republicans to find a bipartisan  solution, the Democrat majority has, once again, written a partisan  bill to ram through the House with no committee markup,  [[Page H1063]]  no open amendments, and no meaningful bipartisan collaboration. That is  not what the American people sent us here to do.   This legislation will impede the ability of good police officers to  do their jobs effectively and uphold the rule of law. Our dedicated  police officers who serve our communities work tirelessly to ensure  that lawlessness does not prevail in our streets and neighborhoods.   The effect of this bill on law enforcement is to levy unfunded  mandates on local governments, force law enforcement to leave the  profession, and, yes, defund the police.   Madam Speaker, as you said, defund the police is not a slogan, but a  policy demand.   Madam Speaker, I will vote ``no'' on this, and I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no.''
