 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Devin McQueen, who loved baseball and his friends, but loved his family  more than anything.   I am here to honor his mom, Colleen McQueen; his dad, Derrick  McQueen; his uncle, Michael McLaughlin; and all of his family.   Devin was only 15 when he passed away after battling multiple rare  diseases and chronic illnesses.   I am so glad that our community came together and honored his life  and spirit when we recently unveiled a beautiful sculpture in his  memory. The sculpture in his honor is called ``The Strength of a  Giant.'' It is a sculpture by artist Scott LoBaido of a boy pushing a  large boulder towards a blue sky.   Ever upward and ever forward, with the strength of a giant: that is  what Devin's life was all about.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say to Devin: We won't forget you.                            ____________________
