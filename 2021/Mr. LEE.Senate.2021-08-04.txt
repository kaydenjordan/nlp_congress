 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, infrastructure is the physical backbone of  our country, and it is an example of positive, constructive American  achievement and accomplishment.   Unfortunately, this particular bill, in its process, content,  pricetag, and long-term effects, simply will not serve the country,  Americans, and particularly Utahns well. It will ultimately be  detrimental to our economy, to the daily lives of the American people,  and even in some cases the infrastructure itself.   Now, I am not saying I don't appreciate the hard work, goodwill, and  excellent intentions of my colleagues who put many long hours, weeks,  and months into crafting it; nor am I suggesting that there aren't good  things in the bill, good things that would benefit deserving people in  this country.   As I have said before, the question is not whether or not  infrastructure is a good and a necessary thing; nor is the question  whether the bill contains some good things.   The question is, rather, how much should the Federal Government be  involved in infrastructure? And if it should, where it should. How much  should it be spending on it?   The truth is the particulars of this bill take the scope far beyond  what should be under the realm of the Federal Government, under the  domain of the Federal Government, specifically at a price far beyond  what we can afford and at a time when we are already far into feeling  the sting of inflation.  [[Page S5795]]    There is a reason that our Founding Fathers reserved ``numerous and  indefinite'' powers to the States while providing ``few and defined''  powers to the Federal Government. Article I, section 8 of the  Constitution literally lists the particular powers given to Congress.  It tells us what they are. And you will notice that infrastructure  generally is not one of them.   Now, in some cases it does make sense that the Federal Government is  involved in some infrastructure. The Interstate Highway System is a  good example of that. Postal roads, also specifically accounted for in  article I, section 8, are another example of that.   This bill, however, includes things like bike paths and  beautification projects, mass transit systems, surface roads, roads  that start and stop in one State and are not part of the Interstate  Highway System--things that, while good and lovely and useful, are a  far cry from what the Federal Government can and should reasonably and  successfully oversee. What is more, it does so at an enormous pricetag,  one that will dig us even deeper and deeper into debt at the expense of  the American people, both now and further down the road.   Now, proponents of the bill insist, and will continue to insist as we  debate this, that the bill is paid for. But, in fact, despite the  staggeringly large amount of money that it spends--estimated to be $1.2  trillion in total, the largest amount for a package of this kind in  history by far--it still does not have a score from the Congressional  Budget Office.   Normally we don't vote on, much less pass, something like this  without a CBO score. We don't have one. And I regret to say that many  of the so-called pay-fors amount to flimsy budget gimmicks that, in  reality, do no such thing as pay for the bill.   So what are these so-called pay-fors?   Well, let's take the new reporting requirements on cryptocurrency,  for example, which would allegedly bring in $28 billion. Everything  about this pay-for is half-baked and unclear.   How exactly will additional revenue reporting generate new tax  revenue? And how can you possibly apply stock exchange-style reporting  requirements to something so different and decentralized as Bitcoin,  Dogecoin, and other cryptocurrencies?   At best, this revenue gimmick will fail. At worst, it will hamper  financial innovation for decades to come.   Take the mandated sales of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,  which the bill sponsors claim will produce $6 billion in revenue  starting 7 years from now. But do we realistically know what the demand  for oil might be at that time or what can happen in the meantime when  we might need to use oil in this Strategic Petroleum Reserve?   What happens when we get 5 years down the road and Congress  determines that we should hold onto the oil a bit longer until we might  be able to generate more revenue from the sale?   What if even more of these sales are congressionally mandated in  these years, essentially flooding the market and causing the price of  that same oil to crash?   Take the pension smoothing component of the bill, which would only  cause us to lose more money in the long-term and simultaneously  threaten the solvency of retirement benefits--the retirement benefits  of millions and millions of American workers.   Take the rebate rule delay, which so far has never, and may never, go  into effect. Delaying something that has no set time for implementation  cannot realistically be predicted to produce $49 billion in savings.    Take the $20 billion in future spectrum auctions. While spectrum  auctions can certainly produce a great deal of revenue, this possible  future auction may end up never happening. It could have significant  restrictions on it due to the dynamics of adjacent bands, or it could  simply produce far less than we are being asked to assume today.   Finally, take the claim of $205 billion in unused COVID funds. Upon  further investigation, it includes only roughly $50.2 billion of unused  COVID funds as a real pay-for.   The other $150 billion is simply spending that didn't happen because  the country began to emerge from the pandemic. Many States ended the  enhanced unemployment benefits that were keeping more people out of  work, and other States, local communities, businesses, and families  didn't require as much Federal spending, thanks to their own successes  and their own resiliency.   In other words, this other $150 billion is not a pay-for. It is fake.  It is simply spending or lost revenue that was never realized. And  whether this bill passes or not, this $150 billion will never be  realized.   No, the numbers for these pay-fors do not add up. The math for this  bill is faulty, to say the least. What is more, much of the massive  amount that it will be spending will not even be efficient or effective  spending on infrastructure. Even if this were the role of the Federal  Government, then we ought to make sure that it spends those funds  efficiently and effectively.   But, unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that along with Federal  dollars come a whole host of Byzantine laws and regulations that  prevent precisely that, including restrictions imposed by everything  from NEPA to the Davis-Bacon Act.   The Davis-Bacon Act artificially inflates labor prices by requiring  that all federally funded construction projects worth more than $2,000  pay workers at least the prevailing wage rate on non-Federal projects  in the same locality. And it has substantially driven up the cost of  Federal projects, hindered economic growth, wasted taxpayer dollars,  and hurt unskilled laborers each year. In fact, it is estimated that  repealing it would save taxpayers $10.7 billion over 10 years.   NEPA has imposed similar burdens and costs. Signed into law in 1970,  it was intended to account for the environmental consequences of  proposed Federal actions or projects. But over the last 50 years, it  has substantially deviated from its original purpose, morphing into a  complex, bureaucratic labyrinth; stalling projects from frivolous  lawsuits and bureaucratic delays; and dramatically increasing the cost  and timeline of their completion. Sometimes this law stretches projects  that should take a couple of years to complete into decades.   At the very least, we ought to reform these costly, ineffective  regulations--and do so drastically--so that Federal infrastructure can  be completed better and faster, which is exactly what I proposed in the  amendment that I put before this body yesterday.   But this bill, in its current form, is ultimately not good for  Utahns, and it is not good for the American people. Driving more  Federal money into infrastructure, unfortunately, means we will pay  more to build less. We will be paying more to build less. It means less  money going to steel and concrete in the ground, and a whole lot more  going to lawyers, accountants, lobbyists, compliance specialists, and  bureaucratic delays. It means longer and more expensive projects.   Now, this varies State by State, but in Utah, it is estimated that  adding Federal dollars to a project increases the overall cost by 20  percent--sometimes as much as 40 percent. Not only will it mean more  expensive projects, but more expensive products too.   Another provision in this bill would impose new fees on dozens of  chemicals used in countless products and consumer goods in our day-to- day lives--chemicals found in concrete, wood, plastics, rubber, dyes,  detergents, drugs, and pesticides for food, just to name a few. So  every time you buy one of those products--or almost any product, for  that matter--you will be paying a little bit for this. Only it is not a  tax; it is a fee, and it is hidden from your view. So the consumer--the  poor and middle-class taxpayer--doesn't see a tax increase. They just  see that they are paying even more for everything that they buy.   Another provision would extend Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's ``g- fees'' for an entire decade. These fees could add thousands of dollars  to the mortgages of home buyers at a time when that first home is  increasingly out of reach for many. Utahns can't afford this. Congress  is supposed to be addressing problems like these, not making them worse  with sneaky new fees. This comes at a time when Americans are already  feeling the sharp sting of snowballing inflation.    Now, this graph highlights some of the problem. It highlights what  the American people have felt over the last 12 to 18 months. You will  notice a  [[Page S5796]]  curve sloping sharply upward. Today, inflation is at 5.4 percent, which  means, on average, the goods you buy today are 5.4 percent more  expensive and the savings you have responsibly accrued are actually  worth less.   And don't forget--the Federal Government's reckless spending has  exacerbated this trend. Look at how the red has grown, what we see  here. The red that you see in this chart, these are deficits. Look at  how it has grown. The red portion of the graph is deficit spending.   While we surely needed to spend some additional money during the  COVID pandemic, did we really need to spend this much more, to the  point where we were borrowing a lot more than we were taking in? You  know, we borrowed close to $4 trillion last year. Even if you think  that we did need to spend this much more, wouldn't we try to get our  country back on track and to discontinue this unfunded spending spree  that contributes to runaway inflation?   Look, from gas to groceries and from homes to healthcare, every day,  it is getting harder for hard-working Americans to afford the basic  necessities of day-to-day life. Take just a quick look here at everyday  items. These are not luxury items that we associate with the elite;  these are things that ordinary people purchase every day. Compared to  the period of time before the pandemic, not so very long ago, just 16  months ago, eggs are now 13 percent more expense; milk is 11.3 percent  more expensive; chicken breast, 11.3 percent more expensive; bread is  9.4 percent more expensive; and gas is more than 27.5 percent more  expensive.   The fact is that packages like this one are not without their effects  on the people we have taken an oath to represent. At the end of the  day, it is the American people whose tax dollars we take to pay for  packages like this. At the end of the day, it is the American people  who will bear the brunt of the debt we are forcing upon them. At the  end of the day, it is the American people who will feel the effects in  every aspect of their daily lives--in their workplaces, their  communities, and their families--and they should get a say in it.   They certainly shouldn't have to sign on to something that was made  known to the American people at 10 p.m. on Sunday night. Those who  drafted this legislation had 4 months to review it and 4 months to get  to know it. The American people shouldn't be asked to pass this in 4  days.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in reference to my amendment No. 2279, this  is what we are trying to deal with here.   In order to help expedite the review of projects that are subject to  NEPA, Congress authorized in the FAST Act for States to assume the  duties of conducting the NEPA analysis.   For example, the Federal Highway Administration has entered into  agreements with seven States--including Alaska, Arizona, California,  Florida, Ohio, Texas, and Utah--to assume this responsibility with  great success, providing an opportunity for States to leverage their  unique understanding of their own States in order to better carry out  NEPA's requirements.   To build on this success, Congress should look to expand the ability  of States to partner with the Federal Government for these types of  reviews in their States' water infrastructure projects.   My amendment would require the Department of the Interior to set up a  program similar to the existing Surface Transportation Project Delivery  Program so that any State may voluntarily assume the Agency's NEPA  responsibilities for their water storage infrastructure projects.   As I said just a moment ago, States already have a history of  successfully conducting this work in the transportation space.   In 2020, for example, California conducted 33 environmental  assessments, 32 findings of no significant impact, 2 environmental  impact statements, 3 records of decision, and the list goes on and on.   In just the last half of 2020 alone, Arizona conducted over 50  categorical exclusion analyses. These are clearly roles that States are  able and excited to handle.   In fulfilling these responsibilities, States would be subject to the  same rigorous environmental requirements as their Federal partners,  employing the very same standards. Just as projects led by Federal  Agencies can be halted due to insufficient NEPA analysis, States would  also be held to the same standard.   With much of the West experiencing severe drought, with dire  consequences, allowing States to aid the Federal Government in NEPA  review in order to expedite water storage infrastructure projects is  not just common sense, it is a necessity. It is a matter of survival.   I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 2279.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. President, it is important to remember these are the  exact same standards that would apply. We do this all the time in other  areas. Federal regulatory Agencies, on a continual basis, with the  blessing of Congress, are given authority to carry out a Federal  program.   In fact, we already do this with NEPA in the context of the Federal  Highway Administration.   This works. States are competent. It is a matter of expanding the  human resources to which we have access.   These are the exact same standards. There is no environmental threat.  This would just allow this stuff to get done faster.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2279     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, if there had been a recorded vote on  amendment No. 2478 to amendment No. 2137 to H.R. 3684, ``To require the  Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce to  promote and administer programs in the public and private sectors to  assist the development of minority business enterprises and to ensure  that such Agency has the necessary supporting resources, particularly  during economic downturns,'' I would have voted nay.                            ____________________
