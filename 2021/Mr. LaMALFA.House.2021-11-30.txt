 Madam Speaker, as the Supreme Court hears oral arguments  in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, I stand  before the House to proclaim strongly my commitment to being pro-life.   Three years ago Mississippi passed a law by an overwhelming majority  to limit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with reasonable  exceptions. The State legislature and then-Governor Phil Bryant  supported this bill to protect the life of mothers and the dignity of  the unborn. Abortion precedents established in Roe v. Wade and Planned  Parenthood v. Casey have prevented States from passing laws to protect  unborn babies before viability--the age at which a child could survive  outside the womb.   Medical advancements like ultrasounds and prenatal surgeries have  shown the humanity of the unborn which points to the value of life from  the moment of conception. Unborn babies have a heartbeat as early as 5  weeks, and by 15 weeks they can taste, make facial expressions, and, of  course, feel pain.   Confronted by a culture that continues to take human lives for  granted, I applaud the State of Mississippi for their pro-life stance  and their challenge of outdated precedent that prevents protections for  the unborn.   Madam Speaker, I will always stand for life.                            ____________________
