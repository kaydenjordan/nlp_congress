 Mr. Chair, the goal of the American with Disabilities  Act is to provide access for the disabled. That goal must be pursued  and protected.   It is important to distinguish, however, that the ADA is not intended  to feed drive-by lawsuits and put good people out of business.   Unfortunately, my State of California has become ground zero for  abusive ADA lawsuits. I have heard from many small businesses in my  congressional district that have fallen victim to abusive ADA lawsuits  that are not aimed at improving access to the disabled. In fact,  California accounts for roughly 40 percent of ADA lawsuits nationwide,  despite being home to just 12 percent of the country's disabled  population.    Protecting small businesses from abusive lawsuits and ensuring  disabled Americans have adequate access are not mutually exclusive  goals. That is why I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 620 and believe  its passage is critical to both the disabled and to our small  businesses. By giving businessowners adequate time to make appropriate  changes to provide access, we are returning to the original spirit and  intent of the ADA.   I thank my friend from Texas, Representative Poe, for his leadership  on this issue, as well as the bipartisan group of cosponsors for their  support. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill and ensure  that serial litigants are no longer rewarded for taking advantage of an  important and meaningful law.  [[Page H1185]]
