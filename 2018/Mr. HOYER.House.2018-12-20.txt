 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   What a sad day.   Chairman Frelinghuysen, I feel badly that you are leaving on this  note. I know it is not your wish. I know that, if you were in charge,  we would have reached agreement. I know, under your leadership, we  passed--we didn't pass them. Six bills were forged in a bipartisan way,  not our bills, your bills.   Mr. Speaker, the seventh bill is also agreed to, save one item, so  that approximately 96 percent of the legislation has been agreed to by  both sides, and the United States Senate has passed a continuing  resolution based upon those bills by voice vote. Yet here we are,  twisting in the wind at 7 p.m. on the day before the government shuts  down.   What a sad performance. What a regrettable lack of responsibility,  how we have undermined the faith of our people, treated the Federal  employee terribly, and given cause for the rest of the world to think:  What are they doing?   There is not one person on the Republican side of the aisle who  believes that, if they pass this bill, it will be accepted by the  Senate. Not one of you believes that. So we are playing political games  here to pander to the President of the United States, who sadly  rejected a compromise that was reached by all of us.                                time  1900    The majority leader of your party and the Speaker were for this  compromise. We were for this compromise and the Senate was for this  compromise. One person, why are we here?   I will shut down the government, absolutely. I am proud to shut down  the government. That is what the President of the United States said  just a few days ago. And today, he put the entire Congress in a tizzy.   How sad it is that the Republican leadership of this Congress and the  last Congress have consistently been unable to meet their fiscal  responsibilities.    John Boehner brought a bill to open up the government and,  sadly, only 78 Republicans would follow their leadership--Mr. Boehner,  Mr. Cantor, Mr. McCarthy--only 78, and the rest, including the present  Director of OMB, voted to keep the government shut down.   So I am not surprised that we are here, but it is sad that we are  here acting so irresponsibly. If we have one duty as we come here, it  is to have our government function effectively for our people. We are  failing tonight.   This is a pretense. This bill is going nowhere. The Senate won't  accept it. Perhaps the Senate will send it back, amended--perhaps. But  we are, we think, adults. Let's act responsibly. Defeat this bill.
