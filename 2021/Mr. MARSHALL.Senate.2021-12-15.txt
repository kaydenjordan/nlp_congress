 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 40th  anniversary of the U.S. Coast Guard Pay and Personnel Center in Topeka,  KS. The Pay and Personnel Center was first established in 1979 in the  suburb area of Washington, DC. In 1982, with the help of Senator Bob  Dole, the center permanently moved to the Frank Carlson Federal  Building in Topeka. It is a true honor that I and my staff have the  pleasure of working with this devoted lineup of leaders on a routine  basis.   The Pay and Personnel Center offers a focused and essential service  to more than 142,000 men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard. Their  mission is to provide caring and responsive personnel and compensation  services for each of their military members, retirees, annuitants, and  other customers in support of the Department of Homeland Security  missions. The Pay and Personnel Center has continued to operate with  superb attention to detail without much attention publicly. They carry  out the passionate mission of providing the compensation and services  necessary to keep our Coast Guard focused, secure, and dedicated. These  men and women truly go above and beyond to help our Coast Guard  members.   I offer congratulations and accolades to the Pay and Personnel Center  on 40 years of hard work and superior service to our men and women in  the U.S. Coast Guard. The center is an illustrious example of the Coast  Guard motto, Semper Paratus, Always Ready. I ask my colleagues to join  me in recognizing this milestone.                            ____________________
