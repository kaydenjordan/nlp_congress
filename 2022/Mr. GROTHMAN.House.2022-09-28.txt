 Madam Speaker, over the last couple of weeks, there  have been stories again about our southern border, which I think is the  biggest crisis facing America today.   We will refresh the American public and remind them that whereas 2  years ago, 5,000 to 10,000 people were crossing our border and being  let in the country, we have now, in an average month, over 150,000  entering the country.   In any event, there are rumors that, right now, Venezuela is--as  there were rumors about Cuba about 40 years ago--letting people who are  prisoners out of Venezuela to come to the United States.   Given that Venezuela considers the United States an enemy, a country  that they are hostile to, why wouldn't they? The question is, where is  the press corps? And why isn't the press corps demanding more  information about the type of people that are crossing our southern  border and particularly about Venezuelans who are coming in the country  and whether there are any particular traits that these people have?   I beg the press corps to wake up a little bit and do a little  research here.                            ____________________
