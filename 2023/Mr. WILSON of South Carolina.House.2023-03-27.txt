 Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, Secretary  of State Blinken admitted at the Foreign Affairs Committee hearing that  175 Americans are still in the terrorist safe haven of Afghanistan,  despite the Biden promise of leaving no Americans behind.   President Donald Trump was correct; the surrender was the greatest  foreign policy humiliation in U.S. history.   Biden refuses to release letters he claimed, on August 26, 2021, that  blamed military leaders for his disastrous decision.   A March 6 Washington Post editorial said the Biden administration  will be judged by victory in Ukraine, liberating all of Ukraine from  war criminal Putin. Democracies with rule of law must prevail over  authoritarians by rule of gun with the Ukraine invasion, Taiwan  threats, and nuclear capabilities against Israel and America.   Sadly, with an open southern border with nearly 200 names of known  terrorists crossing under Biden, American families have never been at  greater risk of mass murder.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years from the global war on terrorism as it continues  moving from Afghanistan's safe haven to America.   Our prayers for the families in Nashville.                            ____________________
