DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this  measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4611, the DHS  Software Supply Chain Risk Management Act of 2021.   With each passing day, we see cyberattacks becoming increasingly more  frequent and sophisticated, posing a significant threat to homeland  security and the U.S. economy.   The tactics cybercriminals use to steal information or disrupt access  to critical information systems are ever evolving. Many prey upon  vulnerabilities within the victim's security measures or the victim's  software supply chain.   The ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline and the attempted hack  of a water treatment plan in Oldsmar, Florida, earlier this year, show  just how easily critical infrastructure systems can be compromised.   Last year's compromise of the SolarWinds Orion software supply chain  demonstrated how widespread and damaging such attacks can be.   In the SolarWinds attack, cybercriminals were able to add malicious  code to a commercial software product that was subsequently downloaded  by several Federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland  Security.   As the lead Federal agency for cybersecurity, it is important that  DHS lead by example, aggressively protecting its own networks.   To that end, H.R. 4611 would enhance the Department's ability to  protect its networks by modernizing how it buys information and  communications technology or services.   H.R. 4611 directs DHS to issue Department-wide guidance to improve  visibility into the supply chain for software purchased from new and  existing contractors.  [[Page H5536]]    Specifically, under this legislation, contractors would have to  provide a bill of materials that identifies each part or component of  the software supplied to DHS and take steps to ensure that each item is  free from known security vulnerabilities or defects.   The bill of materials process is akin to the listing of ingredients  on a package of food.   Once DHS has this detailed supply chain information, it will have far  greater visibility into what it is purchasing and installing on its  networks.                                time  1545    With this information, DHS can take more timely action to mitigate  risks associated with software on its network.   Importantly, H.R. 4611, which was introduced by my colleague from New  York (Mr. Torres), requires DHS to instruct personnel on how to enforce  the new requirements to hold contractors accountable.   Finally, the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to  review the department-wide guidance and assess how it aligns with  President Biden's recent executive order on improving the Nation's  cybersecurity.   As the President stated in this order, the Federal Government must  take decisive steps to modernize its approach to cybersecurity to keep  pace with today's dynamic and increasingly sophisticated cyber threat  environment.   I could not agree more.   Enactment of H.R. 4611 would be a decisive step toward improving  DHS's ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks on its  own networks.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres), the vice chair of the Committee  on Homeland Security and the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time to close.   As the lead Federal agency for cybersecurity, DHS has taken steps to  increase public awareness of software vulnerabilities routinely  exploited by malicious cyber actors.   To identify and manage these types of vulnerabilities on its own  network, DHS needs better visibility into the supply chains of the  software it procures.   Enactment of H.R. 4611 would ensure that DHS has access to the  information it needs to enhance its ability to manage the risks to its  own networks.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4611, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4089) to direct the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop and disseminate best practices for rental companies  and dealers to report suspicious behavior to law enforcement agencies  at the point of sale of a covered rental vehicle to prevent and  mitigate acts of terrorism using motor vehicles, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4089         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Darren Drake Act''.       SEC. 2. BEST PRACTICES RELATED TO CERTAIN INFORMATION                     COLLECTED BY RENTAL COMPANIES AND DEALERS.         (a) Development and Dissemination.--        (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security       shall develop and disseminate best practices for rental       companies and dealers to report suspicious behavior to law       enforcement agencies at the point of sale of a covered rental       vehicle.        (2) Consultation; updates.--The Secretary shall develop       and, as necessary, update the best practices described in       paragraph (1) after consultation with Federal, State, local,       and Tribal law enforcement agencies and relevant       transportation security stakeholders.        (3) Guidance on suspicious behavior.--The Secretary shall       include, in the best practices developed under paragraph (1),       guidance on defining and identifying suspicious behavior in a       manner that protects civil rights and civil liberties.        (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than one year after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland       Security shall submit to Congress a report on the       implementation of this section, including an assessment of--        (1) the impact of the best practices described in       subsection (a) on efforts to protect the United States       against terrorist attacks; and        (2) ways to improve and expand cooperation and engagement       between--        (A) the Department of Homeland Security;        (B) Federal, State, local, and Tribal law enforcement       agencies; and        (C) rental companies, dealers, and other relevant rental       industry stakeholders.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The terms ``dealer'' and ``rental company'' have the       meanings given those terms in section 30102 of title 49,       United States Code.        (2) The term ``covered rental vehicle'' means a motor       vehicle that--        (A) is rented without a driver for an initial term of less       than 4 months; and        (B) is part of a motor vehicle fleet of 35 or more motor       vehicles that are used for rental purposes by a rental       company.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4089, the Darren Drake  Act.   This month the Nation observed the 20th anniversary of the September  11th attacks. Next month we mark the fourth anniversary of the  deadliest terrorist attack to be carried out in New York City since the  9/11 attacks.   In that attack, a lone wolf, inspired by ISIS, rammed a rented truck  into pedestrians and cyclists who were out enjoying a sunny Halloween  afternoon on a pathway that ran along the Hudson River.   That attack took the lives of 8 people and injured 11 others. One of  the victims of the attack was Darren Drake, a 32-year-old bicyclist and  the namesake for this important legislation.   While it is not within our power to bring back Darren Drake or the  seven other victims of this tragedy, we do have the ability to learn  from this event to better address the threats of vehicle-based attacks.   H.R. 4089, introduced by my colleague from New Jersey (Mr.  Gottheimer), seeks to ensure that rental vehicle facilities, like the  one where Darren Drake's killer rented a truck, are better equipped to  prevent vehicle-based attacks.   Specifically, the Darren Drake Act requires the Department of  Homeland Security to develop best practices for vehicle rental  companies and dealers to report suspicious behavior in a manner that  protects civil rights and civil liberties.   The bill directs DHS to consult and share best practices with State  and local partners and rental companies to help strengthen  communication and relationships to guard against vehicle-based attacks.   H.R. 4089 is a commonsense measure that acknowledges that vehicle  rental companies are important partners in efforts to prevent vehicle- based terrorist attacks and provide them with the tools to identify  suspicious behavior and notify authorities.   I urge my colleagues to support the Darren Drake Act and reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), the sponsor of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time to close.   Madam Speaker, from the 2016 Bastille Day truck attack in France to  the 2017 deadly car ramming in Charlottesville to the 2017 attack that  took the lives of Darren Drake and seven others, we have seen the use  of vehicles to carry out terrorist attacks become disturbingly common.   Our Nation faces a complex and evolving threat landscape. But the  threat of vehicle-ramming attacks is not going away.   As long as would-be terrorists seek to use rental vehicles as weapons  of terror, we must provide rental dealers with the ability to do their  part.   I urge my colleagues to support the Darren Drake Act, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (S. 1917) to establish a K-12 education  cybersecurity initiative, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1917         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``K-12 Cybersecurity Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in the past few weeks, millions of students have  returned to school across the country. The range of public health,  safety, and security risks that schools face today is truly astounding.   In recent years, schools have increasingly been subjected to  ransomware attacks where cybercriminals lock networks and demand ransom  payments, sometimes while threatening to release sensitive information,  including students' personal data.   According to the K-12 Cybersecurity Resource Center, in 2020 alone,  there were over 480 publicly disclosed cyber incidents at schools in  the United States, an 18 percent increase over the previous year.   Notably, the rate of such incidents increased in the second half of  last year as COVID-19 forced schools to shift to virtual learning,  creating new risks, such as the disruption of online classes and online  school meetings.   The impacts of ransomware attacks on schools have included the  cancellation of classes, the release of sensitive information, like the  name of a 9-year-old student being evaluated for a disability, and  costs as high as $7.7 million for Baltimore County schools to respond  to and recover from a November 2020 attack.   With many schools still operating under virtual or hybrid conditions  because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the vulnerabilities to such  cyberattacks are even greater.   In December, the FBI Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency, or CISA, and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis  Center released a joint cybersecurity advisory to alert schools to the  increase in cyber threats and provide best practices on how to reduce  the risk of such incidents.   To further assist K-12 schools, we must do more to help schools guard  against cyber threats.   S. 1917, the K-12 Cybersecurity Act, introduced by Senator Gary  Peters from Michigan, requires CISA to conduct a study of the  cybersecurity risks facing K-12 educational institutions and develop  recommendations based on that study.   By developing an online training tool kit for schools, and making the  study and recommendations publicly available, CISA will be able to  provide schools with targeted information to better protect their  networks and reduce their cybersecurity risk.   An identical version of this legislation was introduced in the House  by the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin) and cosponsored by  Representatives Matsui, Slotkin, Garbarino, and Clyde. The House  measure was reported favorably by the Homeland Security Committee by  voice vote in July.   Passing S. 1917 today would send this bill to the President for  signature, allowing CISA to begin this important work to better secure  our schools.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, while we are in the process  of getting the sponsor of this legislation prepared to give his  comments, let me say that we all have been involved in making sure that  our schools are as safe as possible. Clearly, this legislation, as  offered by Senator Peters and Representative Langevin and others, is  integral to making sure that our schools are kept as safe as possible  from cyberattacks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Langevin), the sponsor of the House version of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   With sophisticated cybercriminals operating overseas launching  ransomware attacks on our schools, it is essential that the Federal  Government step up efforts to support the cybersecurity of our schools.   Without more assistance, many of our Nation's school districts will  continue to be vulnerable, as many lack the cyber expertise to defend  against these incidents.   Enactment of the K-12 Cybersecurity Act would enhance the technical  support provided by CISA to schools to help better protect school IT  networks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1917, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 4426) to amend the Homeland Security Act of  2002 to ensure that the needs of children are considered in homeland  security planning, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4426         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security for       Children Act''.       SEC. 2. RESPONSIBILITIES OF SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY.         Section 102 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       112) is amended by adding at the end of the following new       subsection:        ``(h) Planning Requirements.--The Secretary shall ensure       the head of each office and component of the Department takes       into account the needs of children, including children within       under-served communities, in mission planning and mission       execution. In furtherance of this subsection, the Secretary       shall require each such head to seek, to the extent       practicable, advice and feedback from organizations       representing the needs of children.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, during disasters, children are uniquely vulnerable to  physical and emotional harm. Sixteen years ago, Hurricane Katrina  opened our eyes to the disproportionate consequences of disasters on  our Nation's children. It uprooted 300,000 children, forcing them to  enroll in new schools, and separated 5,000 children from their  families, some for months.   Drawing on the lessons from Katrina, the National Commission on  Children and Disasters in 2010 issued recommendations to better protect  children during catastrophes. To date, fewer than a quarter of those  recommendations have been implemented.   Children today face a diverse range of homeland security challenges  that impact their lives. We have seen COVID-19, school shootings,  hurricanes, and wildfires disrupt access to education and have far- reaching impacts on the lives of children.   According to a study published this week, children today will  experience three times as many climate-related disasters as their  grandparents.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a Washington Post article on the  consequences of climate change for children.                         [From The Washington Post]  Today's Kids Will Live Through Three Times as Many Climate Disasters as                       Their Grandparents, Study Says                   (By Sarah Kaplan, September 27, 2021)         Adriana Bottino-Poage is 6 years old, with cherub cheeks       and curls that bounce when she laughs. She likes soccer, art       and visiting the library. She dreams of being a scientist and       inventing a robot that can pull pollution out of the air. She       wants to become the kind of grownup who can help the world.        Yet human actions have made the world a far more dangerous       place for Adriana to grow up, according to a first-of-its-      kind study of the impacts of climate change across       generations.        If the planet continues to warm on its current trajectory,       the average 6-year-old will live through roughly three times       as many climate disasters as their grandparents, the study       finds. They will see twice as many wildfires, 1.7 times as       many tropical cyclones, 3.4 times more river floods, 2.5       times more crop failures and 2.3 times as many droughts as       someone born in 1960.        These findings, published this week in the journal Science,       are the result of a massive effort to quantify what lead       author Wim Thiery calls the ``intergenerational inequality''       of climate change.        Drawing on multiple climate and demographic models, Thiery       and 36 colleagues compared the risks faced by previous       generations to the number of extreme events today's children       will witness in their lifetimes. Unless world leaders agree       on more ambitious policies when they meet for the United       Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, this fall, the       study says, today's children will be exposed to an average of       five times more disasters than if they lived 150 years ago.        The changes are especially dramatic in developing nations;       infants in sub-Saharan Africa are projected to live through       50 to 54 times as many heat waves as someone born in the       preindustrial era.        The disparities underscore how the worst effects of climate       change will be experienced in places that contributed least       to warming, by people who have had little say in the policies       that allow continued emissions to occur, Thiery said. More       than half of all greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were       generated after 1990, meaning that most of the disasters       today's children will experience can be linked to emissions       produced during their parents' lifetimes.        ``Young people are being hit by climate crisis but are not       in position to make decisions,'' he said. ``While the people       who can make the change happen will not face the       consequences.''        Aggressive efforts to curb fossil fuel use and other       planet-warming activities can still dramatically improve the       outlook for today's children, he added. If people manage to       limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit)       above preindustrial levels, newborns' risk of extreme heat       exposure will fall almost by half. They could see 11 percent       fewer crop failures, 27 percent fewer droughts and almost a       third as many river floods than if emissions continue       unabated.        But the world is nowhere near meeting that 1.5 degree       target. A U.N. report published earlier this month warned       that, based on countries' current climate pledges, greenhouse       gas emissions could actually increase by 16 percent by the       end of the decade. That would put the planet on track to warm       by 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of       the century.        This makes Adriana angry. The Woodbridge, Va., first-grader       already worries about the wildfires in California, where her       half brother lives. She has heard about islands being       inundated by rising seas, caught glimpses of hurricanes and       droughts on the news.        Meanwhile, adults ``don't listen, and they keep doing it       and keep making the Earth hotter'' she added. ``Everything       will keep getting worse and worse until I grow up. Somebody       has to do something.''        The Science paper was partly inspired by Thiery's three       sons, who are 7, 5 and 2. But its implications are not       restricted to children. Anyone under 40, he said, is destined       to live a life of unprecedented disaster exposure,       experiencing rates of extreme events that would have just a 1       in 10,000 chance of happening in a preindustrial world.        ``It used to be a story of, like, `yeah we have to limit       global warming because of grandchildren,' `` he said. ``This       study is making clear that climate change has arrived. It's       everywhere.''        The numbers provided in the study are almost certainly an       underestimate, said co-author Joeri Rogelj, director of the       Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at       Imperial College London. Data limitations, and the complexity       of the analysis, meant the scientists didn't assess the       increased risk of some hazards, such as coastal flooding from       sea level rise. The study also doesn't take into account the       increased severity of many events; it only looks at       frequency.        On the other hand, he noted, countries also have a chance       to adapt to the changes that are coming. If the world invests       in making communities safer--for example, installing flood       barriers, adopting fire-safe building codes, providing       shelter for people at risk from deadly heat--disasters don't       have to be as destructive for future generations as they are       for people today.        ``Our aim is for this not to be the conclusion of this       debate,'' Rogelj said, ``but for this to be the start of       looking at the lived experience of children being born       today.''        Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of       Technology who was not involved in the new research, called       it a ``robust study'' based on established findings from the       United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. As       a scientist, Cobb said, she was unsurprised by the results.        But Cobb is also a mother to four children. Reading the       report through that lens, she said, ``it brings into sharp       focus what so many economic models of climate change impacts       fail to capture--the vast toll of human suffering that is       hanging in the balance with our emissions choices this       decade.''        She added: ``The moral weight of this moment is almost       unbearable.''        In a report published in conjunction with Thiery's       findings, Save the Children International called on world       leaders to make the changes necessary to meet the 1.5 degree       Celsius target. Wealthy nations must also follow through on       their unmet pledge to give $100 billion per year to help low-      income countries curb their own emissions and adapt to       changes that are already underway, the group said.        Yolande Wright, who directs the nonprofit's climate       efforts, also hopes the findings will bolster legal efforts       to force climate action on behalf of children. Last year, a       federal appeals court threw out a case brought by 21 American       young people who argued that the government's failure to act       on climate change was a violation of their  [[Page H5541]]       rights. Similar cases have been filed in Portugal, Peru and       elsewhere.        ``Now that we can really quantify how a child in their       lifetime will see so many more of these extreme events . . .       it helps make the case,'' Wright said.        Environmental attorney Dan Galpern, general counsel and       director of Climate Protection and Restoration Initiative,       agreed that ``anticipatory research'' like this can help       establish governments' and corporations' liability for real       harms experienced by kids.        Young people already say climate change has touched their       lives and harmed their mental health. In a recent survey of       16- to 25-year-olds, scientists found that three quarters of       respondents feared the future and more than half believed       they would have less opportunity than their parents. Nearly       60 percent said their governments had betrayed them and       future generations--making them feel even more anxious.        ``The future for me and everyone who comes after is so       insecure,'' said Emanuel Smari Nielsen, a 14-year-old climate       activist from Norway. ``When politicians and those with power       do not do anything, it makes me feel tired. It almost makes       me angry.''        Adriana, the 6-year-old, said she feels ``super nervous''       when she thinks about what the future might hold. In those       moments, there's nothing that helps her feel better.        ``I just wait till I'm done thinking about it,'' she said.        Experts say one way to help children cope with climate       anxiety is to help them feel empowered to do something about       it. The Save the Children report calls for communities,       countries and global institutions like the U.N. to give young       people a greater role in setting climate policy.        Cormac Buck, an 8-year-old from Savannah, Ga., has decided       to stop eating meat (except for the occasional chicken       nugget). He is part of a group of kids at his school who have       asked teachers and administrators to use fewer fossil fuels.        ``Sometimes I hear some depressing things happening, like       some animals because of climate change are really close to       extinction . . . and I feel sad,'' he said. ``And then I       normally try to think of a way to stop that from happening       again.''        And adults must earn back children's trust, Thiery said, by       making the dramatic emissions reductions that have been so       long delayed. Our choices now will determine whether kids       grow up in a world with four times as many heat waves or       seven times as many heat waves, a world with occasional crop       failures or chronic food shortages.        ``We can still avoid the worst consequences,'' he said.       ``That is what gives me strength as a father . . . Their       future is in our hands.''     Mr. Speaker, the safety of our children  is central to our country's well-being, and we must ensure that, for  its part, the Department of Homeland Security is equipped to consider  these needs.   The Homeland Security for Children Act would ensure the unique needs  of children are taken into account throughout the Department by  mandating the DHS Secretary direct all components and offices to  consider children when creating policies and implementing programs.                                time  1615    It specifically directs the Department to seek feedback from  organizations that represent children when developing and carrying out  policies and programs.   H.R. 4426 would also permanently authorize a ``children's technical  expert'' within the Federal Emergency Management Agency to prioritize  the interests of children in emergency preparedness, response, and  recovery initiatives.   Lastly, the legislation, as introduced by my colleague from New  Jersey (Mr. Payne) would require DHS to report to Congress on the  Department's work to incorporate children's interests throughout all  its work.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  4426, the Homeland Security for Children Act, and I reserve the balance  of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                Washington, DC, September 23, 2021.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives. Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: I write concerning H.R. 4426, the       Homeland Security for Children Act. There are certain       provisions in this legislation that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 4426, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to       forgo action on the bill. However, this is conditional on our       mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill       would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I also request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this Committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the committee       report on H.R. 4426 and into the Congressional Record during       consideration of the measure on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. Defazio,      Chair.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                 Washington, DC, September 23, 2021.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.

I       recognize that the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure has a jurisdictional interest in H.R. 4426,       and I appreciate your effort to allow this bill to be       considered on the House floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure with respect to its jurisdictional       prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the       future, and I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees to any House--Senate       conference involving this legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 4426 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you on this legislation and       other matters of great importance to this Nation.            Sincerely,                                             Bennie G. Thompson,                                                           Chairman,                                    Committee on Homeland Security.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's children need our help. Natural disasters  have impacted one in three Americans. Since the onset of the COVID-19  pandemic, over 5.5 million children have tested positive, and  conditions are not trending in the right direction.   According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, last week, with kids  back at school, the number of infected children had exponentially risen  to the third highest level since the beginning of the pandemic.   As a partner to schools, which are critical to infrastructure, the  Department of Homeland Security has a critical mission to play in  helping to protect children. To do so effectively, it is critical that  children's unique needs are front and center in DHS programs and  policies. Enactment of the Homeland Security for Children Act will do  just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4426, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 4094) to conduct a pilot program at foreign  last point of departure airports to permit passengers and their  accessible property to continue on additional flights or flight  segments originating in the United States without additional security  re-screening, and for other purposes, as amended.  [[Page H5542]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 4094         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``One-Stop Pilot Program Act       of 2021''.       SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM FOR ONE-STOP SECURITY.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding 44901(a) of title 49,       United States Code, the Administrator of the Transportation       Security Administration, in coordination with U.S. Customs       and Border Protection, is authorized to conduct a pilot       program at not more than six foreign last point of departure       airports to permit passengers and their accessible property       arriving on direct flights or flight segments originating at       such participating foreign airports to continue on additional       flights or flight segments originating in the United States       without additional security re-screening if--        (1) the initial screening was conducted in accordance with       an aviation security screening agreement described in       subsection (d);        (2) passengers arriving from participating foreign airports       are unable to access their checked baggage until the arrival       at their final destination; and        (3) upon arrival in the United States, passengers arriving       from participating foreign airports do not come into contact       with other arriving international passengers or those       passengers' property or other persons who have not been       screened or subjected to other appropriate security controls       required for entry into the airport's sterile area.        (b) Requirements for Pilot Program.--In carrying out this       section, the Administrator shall ensure there is no reduction       in the level of security or specific aviation security       standards or requirements for screening passengers and their       property prior to boarding an international flight bound for       the United States, including specific aviation security       standards and requirements regarding the following:        (1) High risk passengers and their property.        (2) Weapons, explosives, and incendiaries.        (3) Screening passengers and property transferring at a       foreign last point of departure airport from another airport       and bound for the United States, and addressing any co-      mingling of such passengers and property with passengers and       property screened under the pilot program described in       subsection (a).        (4) Insider risk at foreign last point of departure       airports.        (c) Re-Screening of Checked Baggage.--The Administrator may       determine whether checked baggage arriving from participating       foreign airports referenced in subsection (a) must be re-      screened in the United States by an explosives detection       system before such baggage continues on any additional flight       or flight segment.        (d) Aviation Security Screening Agreement Described.--An       aviation security screening agreement described in this       subsection is an agreement signed by the Administrator,       without delegating such authority, and entered into with a       foreign country that delineates and implements security       standards and protocols utilized at a foreign last point of       departure airport that are determined by the Administrator to       be comparable to those of the United States and therefore       sufficiently effective to enable passengers and their       accessible property to deplane into sterile areas of airports       in the United States without the need for re-screening.        (e) Re-Screening Requirement.--If the Administrator       determines that the foreign country participating in the       aviation security screening agreement has not maintained and       implemented security standards and protocols comparable to       those of the United States at foreign last point of departure       airports at which a pilot program has been established in       accordance with this section, the Administrator shall ensure       that passengers and their property arriving from such       airports are re-screened in the United States before such       passengers and their property are permitted into sterile       areas of airports in the United States. In the case of       continued or egregious failure to maintain such security       standards and protocols, the Administrator shall suspend or       terminate the aviation security screening agreement, as       determined appropriate by the Administrator, and shall notify       the appropriate congressional committees of such suspension       or termination, as the case may be, not later than seven days       after such suspension or termination.        (f) Certifications and Briefings to Congress.--Not later       than 30 days before an aviation security screening agreement       in accordance with subsection (d) enters into force, the       Administrator shall provide to the appropriate congressional       committees the following:        (1) A copy of such agreement.        (2) A homeland security threat assessment for the country       in which such foreign last point of departure airport is       located, information on any corresponding mitigation efforts       to address any security issues identified in such threat       assessment, and the Administrator's plans for ensuring       through joint covert testing or other measures compliance       with the security standards and protocols set forth in such       agreement.        (3) A certification that such agreement satisfies all       requirements specified in subsection (b) or, in the event       that one or more of such requirements is not so satisfied, an       identification of the unsatisfied requirement and information       on what actions will be taken to ensure such remaining       requirement is satisfied before such agreement enters into       force.        (4) A certification that the Administrator consulted with       stakeholders, including air carriers, airport operators,       relevant interagency partners, and other stakeholders the       Administrator determines appropriate.        (5) A detailed briefing on the substance of paragraphs (1)       through (4).        (g) Sunset.--The pilot program described in subsection (a)       shall terminate six years after the date of enactment of this       section.        (h) Report to Congress.--Not later than five years after       the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary of       Homeland Security, in coordination with the Administrator,       shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a       report regarding the implementation of the pilot program       described in subsection (a), including information relating       to the following:        (1) The impact to homeland security and international       aviation security, including any benefits and challenges, of       such pilot program.

(3) The impact and feasibility of continuing such pilot       program or expanding into a more permanent program, including       any benefits and challenges.        (i) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be       construed as limiting the authority of U.S. Customs and       Border Protection to inspect persons and baggage arriving in       the United States in accordance with applicable law.        (j) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Administration; tsa.--The terms ``Administration'' and       ``TSA'' mean the Transportation Security Administration.        (2) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the       Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration.        (3) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives; and        (B) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental       Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4094, the One-Stop Pilot  Program Act of 2021.   This legislation seeks to simplify and streamline the security  screening process for certain international air travelers arriving in  the U.S.   It does so by directing the Transportation Security Administration to  carry out a pilot program to allow passengers arriving from certain  foreign airports to proceed directly to their connecting flights in the  United States without having to go through the domestic security  screening process.   Under current law, TSA is required to screen international passengers  and their belongings upon their arrival in the U.S. before they can  continue on to a connecting flight at a domestic airport. In practice,  this means that upon landing, passengers must go through a TSA  checkpoint with their carry-on items and have their checked baggage  rescreened by TSA.   Under the pilot program required under H.R. 4094, arriving  international passengers would forego TSA screening when transferring  to a domestic flight if they originated from certain airports where  strong security measures are in place on the front end.   As amended, this bill requires foreign airports participating in the  pilot to uphold security screening standards and procedures that are  comparable to those used by TSA. In doing so, passengers and their  belongings at these airports will be securely screened before they  arrive in the United States so they can more easily catch their  connecting flight to their final destination.   Beyond an improved passenger experience, requiring security standards  and protocols at foreign airports to be on par with those used in the  U.S. could help strengthen aviation security around the globe.   Mr. Speaker, 20 years after 9/11, enhancing transportation security  remains a critical priority. With that, I support H.R. 4094, and I urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5543]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the pilot program authorized under H.R. 4094 is intended  to provide TSA and its international aviation security partners with an  opportunity to streamline travel and enhance security.   Importantly, H.R. 4094 includes essential security guardrails to  ensure that the pilot is carried out in a way that does not result in  lessened security standards regarding, for example, the carriage of  small knives on planes or the transfer of upstream passengers without  rescreening.   That is why the legislation, which was introduced by the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Katko), received bipartisan support when it was  approved by the Committee on Homeland Security in July.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 4682) to prohibit the Secretary of Homeland  Security from operating or procuring certain foreign-made unmanned  aircraft systems, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4682         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Unmanned Aerial Security       Act'' or the ``UAS Act''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON OPERATION OR PROCUREMENT OF CERTAIN                     FOREIGN-MADE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS.         (a) Prohibition on Agency Operation or Procurement.--Except       as provided in subsection (b) and subsection (c)(3), the       Secretary of Homeland Security may not operate, provide       financial assistance for, or enter into or renew a contract       for the procurement of--        (1) an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) that--        (A) is manufactured in a covered foreign country or by a       corporation domiciled in a covered foreign country;        (B) uses flight controllers, radios, data transmission       devices, cameras, or gimbals manufactured in a covered       foreign country or by a corporation domiciled in a covered       foreign country;        (C) uses a ground control system or operating software       developed in a covered foreign country or by a corporation       domiciled in a covered foreign country; or        (D) uses network connectivity or data storage located in a       covered foreign country or administered by a corporation       domiciled in a covered foreign country;        (2) a software operating system associated with a UAS that       uses network connectivity or data storage located in a       covered foreign country or administered by a corporation       domiciled in a covered foreign country; or        (3) a system for the detection or identification of a UAS,       which system is manufactured in a covered foreign country or       by a corporation domiciled in a covered foreign country.

(d) Drone Origin Security Report to Congress.--Not later       than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act,       the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the       Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a terrorism threat       assessment and report that contains information relating to       the following:        (1) The extent to which the Department of Homeland Security       has previously analyzed the threat that a UAS, a software       operating system associated with a UAS, or a system for the       detection or identification of a UAS from a covered foreign       country operating in the United States poses, and the results       of such analysis.        (2) The number of UAS, software operating systems       associated with a UAS, or systems for the detection or       identification of a UAS from a covered foreign country in       operation by the Department, including an identification of       the component or office of the Department at issue, as of       such date.        (3) The extent to which information gathered by such a UAS,       a software operating system associated with a UAS, or a       system for the detection or identification of a UAS from a       covered foreign country could be employed to harm the       national or economic security of the United States.        (e) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Covered foreign country.--The term ``covered foreign       country'' means a country that--        (A) the intelligence community has identified as a foreign       adversary in its most recent Annual Threat Assessment; or        (B) the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination       with the Director of National Intelligence, has identified as       a foreign adversary that is not included in such Annual       Threat Assessment.        (2) Intelligence community.--The term ``intelligence       community'' has the meaning given such term in section 3(4)       of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4)).        (3) Unmanned aircraft system; uas.--The terms ``unmanned       aircraft system'' and ``UAS'' have the meaning given the term       ``unmanned aircraft system'' in section 331 of the FAA       Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-95; 49       U.S.C. 44802 note).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I  [[Page H5545]]  may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4682, the Unmanned Aerial  Security Act.   Mr. Speaker, to help carry out many of its many missions, the  Department of Homeland Security has increasingly come to rely on  drones.   For instance, DHS utilizes drones to get ``eyes in the sky'' to make  timely assessments about the extent of damage caused by hurricanes,  tornadoes, and other natural disasters in instances in where FEMA  cannot easily deploy personnel to affected areas by ground.   In remote parts of the land border, DHS uses this technology to  detect and prevent illicit drug activities. With so many unmanned  aerial systems in the marketplace today developed in nations that are  considered foreign adversaries, there are legitimate security concerns  about the integrity of data they collect.   In fact, recent reports suggest that Chinese-manufactured drones  might be compromised and used to send sensitive information to the  Chinese Government. In response to security concerns, the Departments  of Interior and Defense have taken steps to limit their use of foreign- made drones.   H.R. 4682, the Unmanned Aerial Security Act, would direct the  Department of Homeland Security to take similar protective measures. It  would prohibit DHS from purchasing or using drone systems manufactured  in a foreign country that is deemed to be an adversary by either the  intelligence community's Annual Threat Assessment or the Secretary of  Homeland Security.   Importantly, H.R. 4682 does allow the DHS Secretary to waive the  prohibition, case by case, in certain circumstances, such as for  counter-drone research, testing, development, training, or for certain  intelligence operations.   H.R. 4682 has bipartisan support and was reported out of committee by  voice vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers,  and I am prepared to close after the gentleman from Mississippi closes.  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague from Mississippi (Mr. Guest) for  introducing this bill that seeks to ensure the integrity and security  of the drone systems that the Department of Homeland Security operates.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4682, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 4363) to establish a daily public reporting  requirement for covered contract awards of the Department of Homeland  Security, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4363         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Contract Reporting Act       of 2021''.       SEC. 2. DAILY PUBLIC REPORT OF COVERED CONTRACT AWARDS.         (a) Daily Report.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary shall post, maintain, and       update in accordance with paragraph (2), on a publicly       available website of the Department, a daily report of all       covered contract awards. Each reported covered contract award       shall include information relating to--        (A) the contract number, modification number, or delivery       order number;        (B) the contract type;        (C) the amount obligated for such award;        (D) the total contract value for such award, including all       options;        (E) the description of the purpose for such award;        (F) the number of proposals or bids received;        (G) the name and address of the vendor, and whether such       vendor is considered a small business;        (H) the period and each place of performance for such       award;        (I) whether such award is multiyear;        (J) whether such award requires a small business       subcontracting plan; and        (K) the contracting office and the point of contact for       such office.        (2) Update.--Updates referred to in paragraph (1) shall       occur not later than two business days after the date on       which the covered contract is authorized or modified.        (3) Subscribing to alerts.--The website referred to in       paragraph (1) shall provide the option to subscribe to an       automatic notification of the publication of each report       required under such paragraph.

(b) Undefinitized Contract Action or Definitized Amount.--      If a covered contract award reported pursuant to subsection       (a) includes an undefinitized contract action, the Secretary       shall--        (1) report the estimated total contract value for such       award and the amount obligated upon award; and        (2) once such award is definitized, update the total       contract value and amount obligated.        (c) Exemption.--Each report required under subsection (a)       shall not include covered contract awards relating to       classified products, programs, or services.        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Covered contract award.--The term ``covered contract       award''--        (A) means a contract action of the Department with the       total authorized dollar amount of $4,000,000 or greater,       including unexercised options; and  [[Page H5546]]         (B) includes--        (i) contract awards governed by the Federal Acquisition       Regulation;        (ii) modifications to a contract award that increase the       total value, expand the scope of work, or extend the period       of performance;        (iii) orders placed on a multiple award or multiple-agency       contract that includes delivery or quantity terms that are       indefinite;        (iv) other transaction authority agreements; and        (v) contract awards made with other than full and open       competition.

(6) Total contract value.--The term ``total contract       value'' means the total amount of funds expected to be       provided to the contractor at issue under the terms of the       contract through the full period of performance.        (7) Undefinitized contract action.--The term       ``undefinitized contract action'' means any contract action       for which the contract terms, specifications, or price is not       established prior to the start of the performance of a       covered contract award.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  4363, the DHS Contract Reporting Act of the 2021. I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security spends billions of  dollars each year to acquire goods and services needed to carry out its  missions.   It purchases everything from disaster relief supplies to passenger  screening equipment to software designed to protect Federal Government  networks from cyber threats.   The Department's Inspector General and the Government Accountability  Office have consistently identified challenges with respect to DHS  contract management efforts.   For instance, the DHS Inspector General has identified instances  where FEMA awarded contracts to inexperienced vendors that were unable  to deliver critical supplies in response to major disasters.   In June 2020, GAO determined that U.S. Customs and Border Protection  had misspent funding that Congress specifically appropriated for  migrant medical care and related supplies.   H.R. 4363 seeks to improve visibility in DHS' contract awards by  requiring daily reporting of contract awards on the Department's public  website. The reports are to include key information about the award,  such as the purpose of the contract and where work is expected to be  performed.   The reports are also to include information about the award  recipient, such as the name of the company and whether it is considered  a small business.   H.R. 4363 has bipartisan support and was reported out of committee by  voice vote. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers,  and I am prepared to close after the gentleman from Mississippi closes.  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time, and I am prepared to close.  [[Page H5547]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, DHS obligated the $20 billion on goods and services in  fiscal year 2020, making it the fourth highest spending civilian agency  in the Federal Government.   Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the Department's funds  are well spent. Enactment of H.R. 4363 would provide greater  transparency into the Department's contract awards and enable better  oversight of DHS's spending.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4363, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
