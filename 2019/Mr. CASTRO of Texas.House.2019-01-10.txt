 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for Chairman Engel's  leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee.   I look forward to continue working with Chairman Engel to advance  U.S. foreign policy and national security this Congress.   I'd also like to thank my colleague from Texas, Ranking Member  Michael McCaul, for authoring this measure with me.   Mr. Speaker, U.S. Foreign Service Offices voluntarily serve in some  of the most dangerous pockets of the world to advance U.S. national  interests and security abroad.   Changing technologies force us to adapt our security practices to  ensure our diplomats' safety.   This includes threats posed by location-tracking consumer devices  that reveal physical locations and movements.   I was glad to reintroduce the Protecting Diplomats from Surveillance  Through Consumer Devices Act last week with Ranking Member McCaul.   This legislation requires the State Department to account for  location-tracking consumer devices in broader U.S. embassy and  consulate security policies.   As lawmakers, we have a moral obligation to ensure our men and women  in the line of duty have the protections they deserve.   This legislation does just that.   Protecting our nation's frontline civilians is not a partisan issue,  it's an American issue.   We must ensure our security policies and practices nimbly adapt to  evolving technologies and tactics used by our enemies.   That's why I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this measure.
