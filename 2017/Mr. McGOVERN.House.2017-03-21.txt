 Will the gentleman yield?    I appreciate the gentleman informing us about next  week, but I am concerned about this week still.   Can the gentleman inform me whether or not we will have a CBO score  on the healthcare repeal bill that we are going to be taking up in the  Rules Committee tomorrow?    Will we have a CBO score before the Rules Committee  meets?    I thank the gentleman.   But as I said in the Rules Committee, I just think, under regular  order, we ought to have the score and know how many people will lose  their health insurance before we consider it in the Rules Committee.                            ____________________
