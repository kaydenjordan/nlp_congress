 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud New  Yorker deeply troubled by the epidemic of gun violence that has plagued  our Nation for too long, leaving a wake of sorrow and grief that  extends from generation to generation.   I cannot overstate how yesterday's reckless and detrimental Supreme  Court ruling that struck down a 100-year-old New York State law puts  innocent Brooklynite lives at risk.   What is more, there are no gun manufacturers in New York City. Yet,  despite removing thousands of guns from our streets, illegal guns are  arriving by car, train, and bus every single day through the Iron  Pipeline.   That is why today's vote on the Safer Communities Act is an  imperative. It addresses the issue of straw purchasing and the gun  trafficking that is prevalent across New York City.   Let me take this opportunity to thank and give honorable mention to  Congresswoman Robin Kelly and Congresswoman Lucy McBath for their  courageous and unwavering fight to stop this sea of gun violence in our  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, we must pass commonsense gun legislation, and I am proud  to vote ``yes.''
