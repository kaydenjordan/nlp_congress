 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues and this  House to oppose H.R. 3755. This legislation overrides nearly all pro- life protections on the books and codifies a federal right to abortion  at any stage of pregnancy until birth. This bill isn't just misleading.  It's a radical departure from the national consensus that exists in  America right now in favor of life. But if H.R. 3755 goes forward, laws  that protect unborn children with Down Syndrome and babies with other  disabilities go away everywhere. Laws allow parents to be involved in  their minor children's decision-making disappear. Laws that provide for  medical consultations prior to this procedure--  [[Page H5157]]  gone. This isn't just politics as usual. It's a power play that targets  the powerless. It should never come to this. There is a common-sense  consensus on this issue. A great majority of the American people want  to see life protected. This is worth the fight. This is the time to  stand up for our most vulnerable. This is the time to reach for what  matters most. This is the time to choose life. H.R. 3755 must not  become law of the land.
