 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Empowering  Beneficiaries, Ensuring Access, and Strengthening Accountability Act of  2019 and its provisions extending critical access to mental health and  addiction treatment.   Let's be clear: One in five Americans live with a mental illness.  Nearly all of us have a friend, a family member, or neighbor who has  been diagnosed. Mental illness touches all our lives in some way.   When we passed the Excellence in Mental Health Act in 2014, we made  an investment in behavioral health that expanded access to necessary  treatment. Eight States established community-based clinics providing  24-hour crisis care, better coordinating physical, mental, and  substance abuse treatment. This provided much-needed support to  patients and their families.   In combating opioid addiction, Certified Community Behavioral Health  Centers are already making a difference. In the first year of  implementation, these clinics served nearly 400,000 patients with  serious mental health and addiction disorders, providing 80,000  individuals with lifesaving treatment for the first time.   Headline after headline tells us we need to preserve and,  importantly, expand access to programs like this. While the bill before  us will extend funding to programs in eight existing States for the  next 2\1/2\ years, our work here is far from done.   People are struggling with the stigma of mental illness and substance  use disorder across the country. Every American should have access to  the same top-notch care as patients in the pilot programs. That is why  I will continue to be a fierce advocate for expansion of the Certified  Community Behavioral Health Centers program. I look forward to continue  working with my colleagues so that we can create new opportunities to  expand access to mental healthcare and conquer the addiction crisis  that has harmed far too many families.
