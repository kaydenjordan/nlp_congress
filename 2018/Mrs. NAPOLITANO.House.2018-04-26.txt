 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Denham  amendment, which would overturn a Federal court decision that  determined that California meal and rest break laws apply to truckers.   On July 4, 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that  trucking operators in California must allow for 30-minute meal breaks  after 5 hours of work and a 10-minute rest break after 4 hours worked.  This meal and rest break is very reasonable, when you consider that  truck drivers can be subject to 14 hours of on-duty time.   This amendment would not only preempt California's law, but would  also preempt laws in 21 other States and territories that guarantee  meal and rest breaks.   This amendment is further harmful as it includes broad preemption  language, as Mr. DeFazio stated, that would prohibit State and local  governments from enacting laws that ``impose any additional obligation  on motor carriers.'' This preemption would attack State minimum wage  laws, sick leave laws, family leave laws, and other laws that protect  truck drivers' pay and benefits.   Mr. Chairman, States should be allowed to set these important  standards for truck driver working conditions as they see fit for the  health and safety of their workers and for our citizens.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to oppose the Denham amendment, and  I include in the Record letters of opposition from the Teamsters,  American Association for Justice, Truck Safety Coalition and others,  and the National Employment Law Project.  Teamsters Letter Opposing Denham Amendment Regarding Truck Driver Wage                              and Benefit Laws         This week, the US House of Representatives will consider       legislation to reauthorize funding for the Federal Aviation       Administration (FAA).        The trucking industry is trying to hijack that bill. They       want to insert language which takes away almost any       protection truck drivers are granted under state law. This       includes destroying the right to paid sick leave, paid       vacations, FMLA, state guarantees of a lunch or rest break       during a shift, and worse.        The language states the following:        ``A State, political sub-division of a State or political       authority of 2 or more States  [[Page H3675]]       may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other       provision having the force and effect of law prohibiting-      employees whose hours of service are subject to regulation by       the Secretary under section 31502 from working to the full       extent permitted or at such times as permitted under such       section, or imposing any additional obligations on motor       carriers if such employees work to the full extent or at such       times as permitted under such section, including any related       activities regulated, under part 395 of title 49, Code of       Federal Regulations.''        Say you're a trucking company who doesn't want a driver       taking a few hours off for a doctor's appointment this week.       Now you're in luck! Under this provision, the driver isn't       working to the ``full extent permitted'' under the minimal       federal rules, so they lose any state protections       guaranteeing them the right to go to the doctor!        What happens if that driver needs to take extended state-      protected FMLA? Taking time off under state FMLA laws would       mean that driver is not working to the ``full extent'' they       otherwise could be under the federal rules, so it's not       allowed!        What if a state decides that a truck driver should get paid       while they wait in line for hours on end to drop off their       load? Well, that's an additional obligation being put on the       employer, and that won't be allowed either!        The House must not include this anti-safety, anti-worker       provision in the FAA bill. This provision would overturn any       state's law that goes above the bare minimum federal rules       for truck drivers. No state could demand that drivers need to       get paid for non-driving time or take action against       companies who misclassify their drivers as independent       contractors. Any state laws that raise wages or protect the       working conditions of drivers would immediately be       overturned. It refers to these state laws as ``additional       burdens'' being placed on motor carriers and says that they       need to be done away with. States couldn't even give drivers       time off to go vote! What's worse, all these changes are made       retroactive to 1994. All of the progress states have made       over the past two decades would evaporate overnight.        Truck crashes are up 45% from 2009. Injuries are up 57%,       and deaths from those crashes are also up 28%. Now is not the       time to push drivers even further by taking away protections       that make sure they are well-rested and alert.        We urge you to OPPOSE the Denham amendment (amendment #140       as filed with the rules committee) if it comes up on the       floor during consideration of the FAA bill H.R. 4.        Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact       me.            Sincerely,                                              Samuel P. Loesche,                                         Legislative Representative,      International Brotherhood of Teamsters.                                   ____                 [From the American Association for Justice]   Protect Truck Drivers and Highway Safety: Oppose Preemption of State                   Protections in the FAA Reauthorization         AAJ strongly opposes the Denham amendment to H.R. 4, the       FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. This amendment preempts       state and local labor regulations, laws, and court decisions,       many of which have been on the books for decades, protecting       commercial truck drivers. What was originally offered to just       preempt state labor protections, commonly known as the ``meal       and rest break'' protections, morphed into something much       broader and much worse in that it now preempts ANY       ``additional obligation on motor carriers.'' Therefore, this       amendment will provide for a sweeping exemption for       commercial trucking drivers from being covered by all state       and local wage and hour laws, including, but not limited to       meal and rest break laws, paid sick leave, minimum wage, sick       pay, jury duty, disability and medical leave, and even       worker's compensation laws.        The Denham amendment would deny truck drivers, including       many who exclusively work only within their home state, from       state protections. Included in these protections is meal and       rest break laws that allow truckers to take a lunch break       and/or a rest break after driving on the road for a certain       number of hours. In most cases, these breaks are no more than       a ten-minute rest or a half hour lunch and often only occur       when an employee works a full day, still allowing the       employer the flexibility to determine when and how they are       taken.        Meal and rest break protections are especially important       for highway safety. Commercial truck drivers are a class of       workers whose fatigue has been a consistent and proven cause       of highway injuries and deaths. Commercial truck drivers       often operate trucks exceeding 26,000 pounds and typically       work up to 14 hours a day, which puts other drivers and       pedestrians at serious risk of injury or death. In fact,       nearly 4,000 people die in large truck crashes each year,       with driver fatigue being the leading cause.        Protecting highway safety should be a top priority of       Congress. Oppose the Denham Amendment.        By preempting state laws that protect workers, this       amendment should be opposed because of the following:        The Denham amendment provides a sweeping exemption for       motor carrier drivers from being covered by State and local       wage and hour laws, including meal and rest break laws, paid       sick leave, minimum wage, sick leave, jury duty, disability       and medical leave, and even worker's compensation laws. It       should be noted that the Federal government has NO policy on       many of these protections including sick leave, paternity       leave, or family leave meaning, that if these workers are       exempt from coverage under State law, and there is no Federal       law, they are left without any protections. In addition, the       amendment prohibits any additional obligations on motor       carrier employers--which gives these employers a blank check       to continue the current unsustainable models of driver       compensation and also pre-emptively stops any future reforms       to improve driver wages and working conditions at the State       and local level.        This is a clear violation of states' rights. This amendment       would eliminate each state's ability to protect their workers       and citizens, an area which has historically been recognized       as part of a state's police powers. Under the 10th amendment,       there has always been a presumption against preemption of       state laws that protect the welfare, safety and health of the       public, including a state's labor laws. If this amendment is       adopted, Congress would be overturning hundreds of state laws       that have provided its workers, including truck drivers, with       employee protections they need to carry out their work in a       safe and productive manner.        Congress has rejected numerous attempts to preempt similar       state meal and rest protections in the past, repeatedly       declining to overturn the ability of states to govern the       work and safety conditions of their workers in this area. In       addition, the Department of Transportation also opposed meal       and rest break preemption in 2014, arguing that ``there is a       presumption against preemption in areas of traditional State       `police powers' or control, and that labor laws are a clear       area of traditional State control. Currently, twenty states       have versions of these types of protections on the books       which would immediately be wiped out by this amendment,       including laws in CA, CO, CT, DE, IL, KY, ME, MA, MN, NE, NV,       NH, NY, ND, OR, RI, TN, VT, WA, and WV.        If preempting meal and rest break laws in twenty states was       not bad enough, the new Denham amendment is broader,       preempting state employment and labor laws in ALL 50 States.       Some of the state laws that would be impacted by this overly       broad amendment are: minimum wage, sick pay, jury duty,       disability, medical leave and even worker's compensation       laws. If this Denham amendment passes, truck drivers, who       frequently avail themselves of worker's compensation benefits       based on the precarious nature of their job, will no longer       be covered by their state worker's compensation laws. This is       an atrocious and unfair attack on one class of workers.        Under Federal law there is no available remedy to a worker       if a trucking company chooses to break the law and refuse a       worker to take a meal or rest break. State laws, on the other       hand, like the one in California, impose a monetary fine on       the employer equal to one hour's pay if the employer violates       the law. Therefore, if this amendment is adopted there will       be no remedy and thus no incentive for trucking companies to       allow drivers to take breaks, creating a serious public and       highway safety issue. It should be noted that these breaks       are not mandatory and are instead at the discretion of the       individual driver.        By eliminating the incentive for trucking companies to       follow the law and allow their truckers to take breaks, this       amendment would result in a greater likelihood of crashes due       to fatigue. Nearly 4,000 people die in large truck crashes       each year and driver fatigue is the leading cause. This       amendment not only harms the safety of commercial truck       drivers, but the motoring public and pedestrians at large.        The amendment would also overturn state laws that require       workers to be paid for all hours worked at the agreed upon       minimum rate. Instead, companies would be allowed to only pay       drivers for the time they spend driving, despite the fact       that drivers are required to spend a great deal of time       performing non-driving duties in the fulfillment of their       employment such as pre and post trip inspections, maintenance       and loading and unloading.        The amendment would preempt state law that limits the       number of hours a regulated driver may work including state       disability discrimination and workers' compensation       provisions where an employer has discretion to return a       driver to work with limited work hours following an accident       or illness. Moreover, the amendment would eliminate the right       to take any leave under state versions of the Family and       Medical Leave Act or allow reasonable accommodation to       provide an employee time off of work for prayer or religious       practice under state religious discrimination laws.        The amendment applies retroactively: If wiping out worker       and truck drivers' existing rights weren't bad enough, this       amendment applies retroactively and would therefore wipe out       lawsuits, settlements, and judgments won by truck drivers for       employer violations going back to 1994. That's 23 years of       jurisprudence and judgments that held trucking companies       accountable for breaking the law and violating their       employees' rights. The retroactivity provision is an affront       to states' rights and state courts.  [[Page H3676]]                                          ____                                                    April 18, 2018.      Re Preemption of State Rights in FAA Reauthorization.       Hon. Members of the House,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the undersigned       organizations, we write to remind you of our continued       opposition to the inclusion of any language in the FAA       reauthorization bill that would preempt state regulations       that protect commercial drivers. These essential,       longstanding laws were specifically designed to reduce worker       fatigue and to protect workers and the public from workplace       crashes, injuries, and deaths.        As you know, previous Congresses have rejected such       preemption language, commonly known as the ``meal and rest       break'' provision, time after time because it would overturn       the ability of states to govern the working conditions of       their truck drivers. This amendment would deny truck drivers,       including many who never leave that state, from taking the       lunch break and/or a rest break which they are granted under       state law. In most cases, these breaks are no more than a       ten-minute rest break or a half hour break for lunch. They       often only occur when an employee works a full day and the       employer typically retains flexibility to determine the       manner in which their employees take these breaks. Twenty       states have versions of these laws on the books which would       immediately be upended, including laws in CA, CO, CT, DE, IL,       KY, ME, MA, MN, NE, NV, NH, NY, ND, OR, RI, TN, VT, WA, and       WV.        In addition to being bad policy, Congress has not had a       single public hearing on this issue or any meaningful       discussion and analysis of its merits. This fundamental       change to surface transportation policy clearly falls within       the jurisdiction of a surface transportation bill, and yet it       was rejected during the last highway bill. It has no place in       any legislation reauthorizing of the FAA.        We urge you to continue to reject any language overturning       basic state protections for truck drivers as you consider FAA       reauthorization legislation. We greatly appreciate your       support for protecting American workers and look forward to       working with you to safeguard these important state laws.            Sincerely,          The International Brotherhood of Teamsters;          American Association for Justice;          Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association;          Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety;          Truck Safety Coalition;          Road Safe America;          Parents Against Tired Truckers;          Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways;          Center for Auto Safety;          Consumer Federation of America;          Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association;          SMART-TD (UTU);          KidsAndCars.org;          Trauma Foundation.                                   ____                                   National Employment Law Project       Vote ``NO'' on Denham Amendment to H.R. 4        Congressman Denham has introduced an amendment to the       Federal Aviation Administrative Authorization Act, (FAAAA)       that would prohibit states from enacting or enforcing any law       or regulation that imposes on interstate motor carriers any       obligation beyond that covered in the so-called ``hours of       service'' regulations under federal law.        The amendment provides that ``A State, political sub-      division of a State, or political authority of 2 or more       States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other       provision having the force and effect of law prohibiting       employees whose hours of service are subject to regulation by       the Secretary under section 31502 from working to the full       extent permitted or at such times as permitted under such       section, or imposing any additional obligations on motor       carriers. . . .'' While the amendment specifically overrules       state rest and meal breaks provisions, its broad language       would reach even farther and deny truck drivers the       protections of a wide range of state and local labor       standards that have protected them for decades.        The bill represents an enormous overreach by the federal       government and overrules decades of court precedents       confirming that truck drivers are entitled to basic minimum       and prevailing wages, paid sick days, and to be properly       classified as employees. It would carve truck drivers out of       traditional workplace protections like unemployment       compensation and workers' compensation as well as more recent       standards that states and localities, have seen fit to afford       their residents.        This big government overreach is the latest phase of the       corporate ``preemption'' strategy, backed by industry front       groups like ALEC and conservative donors like the Koch       Brothers, that seeks to go over the heads of state and local       governments to roll back a wide range of broadly popular       worker protections. This sweeping rollback would reverse that       eighty years of worker protections and leave truck drivers       more vulnerable to long hours and abusive working conditions.        Here are some examples of how the law would affect millions       of truck drivers across the country:        Workers compensation and truck safety. Truck drivers have       the highest number and rate of fatal occupational injuries of       any occupation in the United States. They also have the       second highest rate of all occupations for non-fatal serious       injuries and illnesses. Yet this amendment would deny       workers' compensation benefits to all drivers and deny states       the right to establish safety and hazardous cargo controls,       under the guise of providing uniform federal law.        Minimum wage. At a time when Congress has kept the federal       minimum wage frozen at just $7.25 since 2009, more and more       states have been stepping in to fill the void. Currently, 31       states and more than 40 localities have approved minimum wage       increases above the current federal level of $7.25, affecting       the pay of 15 million workers. But the amendment would strip       truck drivers of these minimum wage protections.        Independent contractor abuses. Worker misclassification is       a pressing issue for truck drivers across the country, and       across the country, courts and administrative agencies are       finding, applying state laws, that truck drivers have been       illegally treated as independent contractors by the       companies. The amendment would reverse these decisions and       allow companies to continue to violate the law.        Paid family leave and paid sick days. Currently, the       District of Columbia, 9 states (Connecticut, California,       Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont, Arizona, Washington, Rhode       Island and Maryland) and dozens of local jurisdictions extend       paid sick leave to workers. And California, New Jersey, New       York and Washington State provide paid family leave to       workers in those states. The amendment would take away that       benefit from truck drivers in some of the highest trucking-      dependent states in the country.
