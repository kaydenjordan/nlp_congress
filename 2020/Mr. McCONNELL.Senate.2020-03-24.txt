 Madam President, for weeks now, the American people  have been contending with the coronavirus pandemic that is spreading  across our country and the massive, massive disruptions to daily life  it is creating for all of us. They are grappling with small business  closures, mass layoffs, and uncertainty for their families. But that  isn't all. For the last several days now, in the midst of all that--in  the midst of all that--they have also had to watch the Senate spin its  wheels.   As we convene this morning, roughly 40 percent of our population is  under stay-at-home orders from State leaders. Employers across America  are wondering how they will keep the lights on. Doctors, nurses, and  healthcare professionals are literally crying out for support. We  literally have Army field hospitals on the way to being set up in our  major American cities.   In the space of just a few weeks, this has become, unfortunately, our  new normal. This is a national crisis. It is the most serious threat to  Americans' health in over a century and quite likely the greatest risk  to Americans' jobs and prosperity that we have seen since the Great  Depression.   Hundreds of thousands of Americans have already lost their jobs  because so much of our commerce has been put on pause. Families are  wondering how they are going to pay their rent or mortgage in 8 days.  Rent is due on April 1. People don't know how they are going to pay  bills or make their car payment.   Many other hard-working Americans are still employed for now but fall  asleep every night wondering if it will be there when they wake up to  that email or phone call tomorrow.   American seniors have seen decades of savings cut down in the space  of days as the markets literally tumble.   Our national life has literally been transformed in less than a  month. The urgency and the gravity of this moment cannot be lost on  anyone. Every day, every hour the Congress delays in passing a  significant relief package, we risk more American livelihoods and the  safety of more healthcare professionals. That is why, right after I  fast-tracked the Democratic House relief bill through the Senate, I  immediately turned the Senate toward developing an even bigger and  bolder relief package for the American people.   Nine days ago, I laid out the key objectives of our work. We had to  send direct financial assistance to Americans--direct assistance to  Americans. We had to help Main Street small businesses. We had to act  to stabilize the foundations of our economy for workers. And, of  course, we had to send more resources to medical professionals and our  healthcare system.  [[Page S1976]]    Five days ago, Senate Republicans released our initial framework for  the CARES Act. We put forward bold policies like sending cash directly  to Americans, pouring money into small businesses, lending to national  industries to prevent mass layoffs, and surge resources for doctors,  nurses, and patients. We knew we needed a proposal to address our  Nation's pain at literally every level.   Now, in the past few days, some voices have tried to pit some  Americans against other Americans and argue that directly helping  workers and strengthening businesses are somehow conflicting  priorities. That is utter nonsense. American workers need paychecks.  They need jobs.   The working men and women of this country do need direct relief from  government in this crisis, but for goodness' sake, they also need their  paychecks. They need to be able to resume their lives and their jobs  once this is over. The two things can't be separated. There is a term  for when you separate employees from employers. There is a term for  that. It is called unemployment. Let me say that again. There is a term  for when you separate employees from employers. It is called  unemployment. That is what we are trying to avoid.   This is no time to point fingers or stoke these culture wars. This is  the time to unify. Perhaps now more than at any moment in living  memory, all of us Americans are in this together. This pandemic is not  the fault of the American workers who make this country run. It is not  the fault of small business owners. It is not the fault of major  national employers. Everyone needs help. We are all in this together.  We need an ``all of the above'' approach, and that is what our  framework put forward: help for workers and families and employers and  healthcare providers.   As soon as Republicans put out a draft proposal to treat every aspect  of this crisis, I immediately called for bipartisan talks. That is not  something you see often in Washington. As soon as I released our first  draft, I immediately invited the other side, these folks over here, to  make their suggestions. That is what you call urgency.   We set up bipartisan working groups. I asked negotiators to work  together to turn our rough draft into something that could pass the  Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. Republicans and Democrats  traded ideas. Democrats asked for many changes to the initial draft and  received many. The updated text, released a few days ago, included  proposals from the other side. And, of course, as our colleagues have  dragged out the last several days, even further changes have been made  at their request.   This majority has gone out of its way to make this process as  bipartisan and as open as possible. The administration has bent over  backward to work with Democrats and address their concerns. Now, at  last, I believe we are on the 5-yard line. It has taken a lot of noise  and a lot of rhetoric to get us here. That, of course, sometimes  happens in this town.   At different times, we received Democratic counteroffers that  demanded things like new emission standards or tax credits for solar  panels. We saw the Speaker of the House release an encyclopedia of  unrelated demands as though it were a coronavirus proposal somehow. In  spite of all that, we are very close. We are close to a bill that takes  our bold Republican framework, integrates further ideas from both  parties, and delivers huge progress on each of the four core priorities  I laid out a week ago.   Today the Senate has a chance to get back on track. Today we can make  all of the Washington drama fade away. If we act today, what Americans  will remember and what history will record is that the Senate did the  right thing, that we came together, that we took a lesson from the way  Americans are uniting all across the country and working together, that  we combined ideas from both sides and took a bold step to protect  Americans and help our Nation through this crisis.   I am not sure how many ways to say it, but the clock has run out. The  buzzer is sounding. The hour for bargaining as though this were  business as usual has expired.   The American people need our Democratic friends to take yes for an  answer. I hope that will happen today. Doctors and nurses need masks.  Families need help. Small businesses need cash. Hospitals need funding.  Their Senate majority is ready to deliver those things. We have been  ready to deliver those things for a while. I hope today is the day this  body will get it done.                            ____________________     Madam President, I have an update for the information  of all the Senators and for the information of the American people, and  it is good news. It is good news for the doctors and nurses in  emergency rooms around the country who are waiting for more masks and  more funding. It is good news for families all across America. At last  we have a deal.   After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a  bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic. It  will rush new resources onto the frontlines of our Nation's healthcare  fight, and it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy  as fast as possible to help American workers, families, small  businesses, and industries make it through this disruption and emerge  on the other side ready to soar.   The bipartisan CARES Act will squarely address each of the four big  priorities that I laid out in my legislation at the beginning of the  process about a week ago. It will rush financial assistance to  Americans through direct checks to households from the middle class on  down and through a significant and creative expansion of unemployment  insurance during this emergency.   It will deliver historic relief to Main Street America through  hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency loans so more small  businesses can survive this and keep paying their workers.   It will help secure our economic foundations and stabilize key  national industries to prevent as many layoffs as possible, while  keeping big companies accountable, as both sides have sought to do.   And, of course, it will push major relief to hospitals and healthcare  providers, invest in new medicines and vaccines so we can beat this  virus faster, and help get more equipment and masks to the frontline  heroes who put themselves at risk to care for patients.   In effect, this is a wartime level of investment into our Nation. The  men and women of the greatest country on Earth are going to defeat this  coronavirus and reclaim our future, and the Senate is going to make  sure they have the ammunition they need to do it.   I am thrilled that we are finally going to deliver for the country  that has been waiting for us to step up.   I am relieved that my distinguished Democratic colleagues are ready  to take yes for an answer. This has been a long week for the Senate,  but it has been a much longer week for the hundreds of millions of  Americans who find themselves in this strange new reality, where every  morning brings new worries about their health, about their loved ones,  and about whether their job or their small business will still exist at  this time next week.   So, Madam President, help is on the way. The American people are  already rising to this grave challenge, and the Senate is about to  follow suit. We are going to pass this legislation later today.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon,  Wednesday, March 25; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to H.R. 748.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:46 a.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, March 25, 2020, at 12 noon.
