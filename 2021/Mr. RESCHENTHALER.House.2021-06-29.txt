 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today provides for consideration of  four pieces of legislation: H.R. 2662, the inspector general reform  bill; H.R. 3005, which requires the removal of certain Capitol statues;  H.R. 3684, the Democrats' surface transportation reauthorization bill;  and then H. Res. 503 which establishes a select committee to  investigate January 6.   The first bill, H.R. 2662, reforms appointment requirements,  authorities, and oversight of Federal inspectors general.   Republicans agree that reforms are necessary. We agree it is  necessary to ensure that IGs have the tools they need to conduct robust  investigation and oversight. In fact, there are several provisions in  this bill that we introduced with Republicans as coleads.   But unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, rather than working toward a  bipartisan solution, the majority once again chooses a partisan  approach and rejected good-faith efforts from Republicans to craft a  proposal that both sides agreed on. The bill before us today includes  problematic language limiting a President's authority to remove an IG  even when that IG has committed dereliction of duty of an important  act.    Further, H.R. 2662 requires the President to name the first assistant  as acting IG without any exceptions, even when that assistant may be  implicated in the very same misconduct that led to the removal of the  previous IG.   Lastly, the bill grants the authority to issue subpoenas for former  Federal officials without providing the necessary protections to  prevent abuses of this authority.   Mr. Speaker, without these problematic provisions, the IG reform bill  could come to the floor with broad, bipartisan support. It is just an  absolute shame though, I must say, it is not surprising that my  colleagues across the aisle once again threw away an opportunity for  bipartisanship simply to score cheap political points with their  radical liberal base.   In keeping with that theme, the rule makes in order H.R. 3684, the  Democrats' retread of last year's Green New Deal. Only this time it is  now disguised as infrastructure. Instead of working with Republicans to  provide desperately needed infrastructure investment, House Democrats  doubled down on the same mandates, the same restrictive policies, and  the same social justice warrior priorities that failed to go anywhere  last year.   This partisan package spends nearly $548 billion on progressive  priorities and programs while actually restricting new road and bridge  construction. That is right. It actually restricts new construction of  roads and bridges. When we talk about the money, like I said, it is  about $550 billion. That is an 11 percent funding increase over last  year's bill and a whopping 79 percent increase over the bipartisan FAST  Act, the last surface transportation reauthorization bill that was  passed by this Chamber.   Alarmingly, but not surprisingly, this bill is not paid for. So then  where does the money come from? Well, the answer is simple, deficit  spending. Deficit spending which further fuels inflation and increases  the cost of things like gas and food that all American families need.  Simply put, every American will pay more for everything to meet the  demands of the Democrat's far-left radical base.   You would hope that with a price tag like this, with an impact on  American families like this, that the bill would actually provide for  massive investment to fix our Nation's crumbling roads and bridges. But  you would be wrong. H.R. 3684, puts climate and the Green New Deal  above real infrastructure needs. In fact, up to $1 out of every $2  spent in this bill is tied up in Green New Deal mandates. This bill  puts up roadblocks for transportation and also puts up roadblocks for  transporting clean-burning, affordable LNG--obviously, liquefied  natural gas--which is another blow to blue-collar workers already  devastated by Joe Biden's war on American energy and his war on blue- collar workers.   In focusing on this radical far-left priority, the majority has  failed to include the regulatory reforms necessary to address money- wasting permitting delays that currently plague critical infrastructure  projects. Think about it. Right now, it takes 6 years on average just  to break ground on major public projects; 6 years. An average of 20 to  30 percent of infrastructure project costs are lost to red tape. These  costs are real money. This means that about $164 billion in this bill  would actually just be wasted on red tape and project delays.   But that is not even the most egregious example of wasteful spending  in this legislation. This bill lifts a bipartisan ban and allows the  Federal Transit Administration to spend money on art. That is right.  According to liberals across the aisle, art is now infrastructure.  America's taxpayer dollars are  [[Page H3254]]  hard at work in--clearly, newspeak liberal, or really newspeak on  display--calling art infrastructure.   Finally, the bill favors big urban areas to the detriment of smaller  rural communities like the ones I represent in southwestern  Pennsylvania. H.R. 3684 prioritizes funding for urban transportation  modes like transit and rail over roads and bridges that everyday  Americans use. In fact, more money is given to electric vehicle  charging stations than to the entire Rebuild Rural grant program.   I would also be remiss if I failed to point out that those very same  electric vehicles cannot be built without critical minerals from China.  China is, of course, the world's number one polluter. So where are the  climate priorities? Where are the environmental priorities that my  colleagues on the liberal side of the aisle claim they care about?   At the end of the day, the Democrats are prioritizing their fantasy  of the Green New Deal over traditional concepts of actual  infrastructure. My colleagues across the aisle, the Liberal Party, have  chosen to bow down to the woke mob that they are terrified of. They  have chosen to prioritize woke liberal yuppies over rural America and  blue-collar workers that actually work for a living.   Mr. Speaker, for this reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind my colleagues across the aisle of  some important facts.   For one, you can't make solar panels without mining, because you have  to mine critical minerals. You also can't make windmills without steel,  and you can't make steel without mining coal. So that is just something  to keep in mind.   Mr. Speaker, last month, CBP encountered more than 180,000 illegal  immigrants at our southern border. That is a new 21-year high. Think  about it. Last month, in 1 month, almost 200,000 illegal immigrants  were at our southern border.   Many of these illegal immigrants are traveling from and through high- risk South and Central American countries where COVID-19 infection  rates are skyrocketing. South America, in particular, has become a  major COVID-19 hot spot with death rates eight times above the global  average.   And yet, the Biden administration is considering ending Title 42, the  public health authority that allows Customs and Border Patrol to  quickly turn back migrants due to the dangers posed by highly  contagious diseases. CBP heavily relies on Title 42 authority to expel  adults and family units that illegally cross the border. In May of  2021, CBP expelled more than 100,000 individuals under Title 42.                                time  1300    Mr. Speaker, thanks to the draconian shutdown measures from far-left  Governors, including Pennsylvania's Tom Wolf, many States are still  recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Ending Title 42 puts that  fragile recovery at risk, especially at a time when powerful variants  continue to pop up across the globe.   That is why, if we defeat the previous question, I will personally  offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider my good  friend's, Congresswoman Yvette Herrell, PAUSE Act. The PAUSE Act would  provide for stringent enforcement of Title 42, and would prohibit HHS  and DHS from weakening Title 42's implementation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, here to explain the amendment is the  bill's author, my good friend, Congresswoman Herrell. I yield 5 minutes  to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Yes, I do.    Mr. Speaker, just another fact of life now. We  cannot make an electronic vehicle without critical minerals.  Unfortunately, due to the red tape that is put upon the mining industry  by liberals across the aisle, we are now dependent on China for roughly  80 percent of our critical minerals. Simply put, we now cannot make an  electric car without China.   Here to talk about another predicament that liberals across the aisle  put us in is my good friend from Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, once again, this Chamber is considering legislation that  could easily have passed with bipartisan support. If Democrats would  stop appeasing their radical, progressive base and they would stop  worrying about what whiny, spoiled millennials are saying on Twitter,  if they decided they would finally try to approach their work here in  some kind of bipartisan manner, then we could work for real solutions  for real Americans that would help the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
