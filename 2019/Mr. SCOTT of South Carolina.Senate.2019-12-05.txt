 Madam President, first, I thank the  Democratic leader for the opportunity to move forward on this unanimous  consent.   As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 212, H.R. 2486.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent  that the Alexander-Murray amendment at the desk be agreed to and that  the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time.    Madam President, I know of no further  debate on the bill, as amended.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Madam President, to avoid the risk of  being redundant, I want to put a little skin on the bones as relates to  what this act really means to college students, particularly those  college students entering into the process for the very first time and  their families.   What it means is simply this: Simplification means more education for  a lot more students, and that is good news. We oftentimes talk about  the importance of keeping the American dream alive and keeping it well.  This will provide significant opportunities for low-income students to  get through the process very quickly.   In South Carolina we have eight HBCUs. The economic impact of those  graduates is around $5 billion of lifetime earnings. This bill makes  that more achievable, more attainable, and keeps the American Dream  alive and well.
