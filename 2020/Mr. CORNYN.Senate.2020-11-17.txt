 Mr. President, I was listening to our friend, the  Democratic whip, and his advice to President Trump to capitulate before  the recounts and before the litigation that has been filed has been  finally decided. I know they would like to have him do so, but he is  completely within his rights to use the existing procedures in the  States and in the local jurisdictions where these elections were  conducted to review the results to see if there are discrepancies.   I also know they would like to say it is just about President Trump,  but more candidates other than President Trump were on the ballot. We  ought to be in the position of trying to preserve every legal vote for  every candidate and making sure there are no mistakes, and there is a  process in place to make that happen.   I don't know what the ultimate outcome will be--I sort of have a  sneaking suspicion about what the trend line looks like--but 72  million-plus people voted for President Trump and Vice President Pence.  Out of respect for them, at least, if not for the President and the  Vice President themselves, we ought to let this process play itself  out. There will be a peaceful transition of power. I have no doubt  whatsoever.
