 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Grace Learning Center in Franklin, Pennsylvania, for 20 years of  service to the community.   Grace Learning Center is an after-school program dedicated to  providing children with a safe, fun, and educational environment each  school day.   In the late 1990s, Grace Evangelical Lutheran Church began exploring  the possibility of offering a free after-school program for families in  need. They were licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Public  Welfare and opened their doors in 1999.   At Grace, children have the opportunity to expand their intellectual  and creative abilities, while gaining an appreciation for their  families and community.   Grace Learning Center maintains close ties with the local schools in  order to encourage scholastic achievement in all areas. Grace welcomes  children of all socioeconomic levels and gives special regard to  children in need.   Grace provides a loving, caring, and secure environment where  children are taught to make wise and responsible choices.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Grace Learning Center on 20 years of providing  a safe after-school environment for elementary school students and  helping them reach their full potential.                            ____________________
