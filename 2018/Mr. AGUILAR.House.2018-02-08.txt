 Mr. Speaker, we have a choice today.   I want to compliment the work that the committees have done to reach  an agreement on these funding levels. I am not here to quibble with  those funding levels.   What I am here to ask for is a chance. If this is the people's House,  we deserve an opportunity to address these issues. I have never said  this is a bad deal. I have just said this is an incomplete deal. It is  incomplete because we haven't had the commitment that we need to  address critical issues that are important to our communities. We have  addressed some in this: opioids, community health centers. Those are  important issues in all of our communities.   But we haven't addressed issues that are important to everyone. Like  Leti Herrera who was my guest to the State of the Union who lost her  sister in December, who is scared, who wants to know when her  priorities are going to be our priorities. She wants to know when we  are going to bring up these issues.   And I can tell her, the Senate has a commitment; they are going to  talk about these issues. But the people's House has not said that we  are going to talk about these issues. We are going to say, well, when  the President signs off, then we will have a conversation. He doesn't  have a card that votes in these machines. He has a voice. He should be  consulted. He doesn't have a voice in the people's House. He doesn't  have a vote here with me and you.   All we want is a commitment to bring up a bipartisan, bicameral bill  that addresses these issues. All we want is a chance. All we want is an  opportunity to address these issues that are important to our  communities.   Please, please, please give us that opportunity to have that  conversation.
