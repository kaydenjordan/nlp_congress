 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership, his continued leadership on this subject.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring awareness, more awareness to the  continued censorship of conservative voices.   Leftist bias and discrimination continues to threaten a diversity of  thoughts and viewpoints being represented in the public arena. It is  not hard to find examples of conservative voices being silenced.   In fact, we know that Democrats and the White House have been  colluding with private companies in recent years to censor and  eliminate conservative voices.   In fact, back in February of 2021, Democrats on the Energy and  Commerce Committee went so far as to write and ask AT&T's DIRECTV to  censor OAN, FOX News Channel, and Newsmax. Then, in January of 2022,  AT&T-owned DIRECTV complied and dropped OAN from their platform and  their channel lineup.   Now they are planning to do the same thing with Newsmax, the fourth  highest-rated cable news channel, or the fourth most popular one, and a  top-20 cable channel overall.   Meanwhile, DIRECTV carries 10 to 12 liberal news channels with a much  lesser audience, and actually pays them to be on their platform.   It is wrong for DIRECTV to make nonbusiness decisions for ideological  reasons that are in direct conflict with the interests of their  customers, their employees, and their shareholders.   Worse yet, it is wrong for DIRECTV to utilize their business to  suppress conservative voices by infringing on the constitutional  freedoms of speech and the freedom of the press because Newsmax is  actually a media company that is trying hard to hold government  accountable.   Why else would DIRECTV drop one of their most popular channels?                                time  1845    DIRECTV's actions are just another example of Big Tech and big media  being leveraged to discriminate against conservative voices.   Whatever happened to classic liberalism where we allowed a variety of  viewpoints to be heard and let people think for themselves?   Republicans must conduct appropriate oversight to determine the  degree to which Democrats in Congress and the White House are colluding  with media companies to suppress First Amendment freedom of speech and  freedom of the press.
