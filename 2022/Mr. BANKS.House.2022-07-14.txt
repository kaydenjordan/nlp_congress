 Mr. Speaker, our Constitution is clear: The President is  the Commander in Chief.   Sidestepping the President and violating the chain of command is a  grave crime.   According to Bob Woodward's book ``Peril,'' General Mark Milley  directed senior military officials not to follow the President's  orders, unless General Milley approved them first.   When I asked General Milley about ``Peril'' at an Armed Services  hearing, he claimed he hadn't read it.   Senator Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to General Milley asking  him to verify or refute the book's claims. He hasn't responded.   I am calling on General Milley to set the record straight. General  Milley is accused of secretly seizing the President's military powers.  That is the most serious crime. If he is innocent, he has a duty to say  so.                            ____________________
