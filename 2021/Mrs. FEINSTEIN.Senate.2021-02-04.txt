 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Cannabidiol and Marijuana Research Expansion Act with my colleagues.  This bill is identical to our bill which was unanimously passed by the  Senate during the last session of Congress.   While anecdotal evidence suggests that marijuana and its derivatives,  like cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, may be helpful in treating  serious medical conditions, anecdotes alone cannot be the basis for  developing new medications. Rather, medication development must be  based on science.   That is why our bill seeks to streamline the process associated with  researching marijuana that may have unintentionally stymied important  research. It does so by requiring the Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA) to quickly approve or deny applications to research CBD or  marijuana and by establishing a process through which applicants may  submit supplemental information, if necessary. It also improves  regulations related to changes to approved quantities of marijuana  needed for research and approved research protocols.   In addition, the CBD and Marijuana Research Expansion Act seeks to  increase medical research and reduce reliance on a single source of  marijuana or CBD for research purposes. It authorizes medical and  osteopathic schools, research universities, practitioners and  pharmaceutical companies to produce the marijuana they need for  approved medical research that can then be used to develop proven,  effective medicines. Upon FDA approval of these medications,  pharmaceutical companies are permitted to manufacture and distribute  them.   Our bill also facilitates better communication between doctors and  patients.   It is my understanding that some doctors and patients are hesitant to  have frank conversations regarding the use or marijuana, CBD, or other  marijuana derivatives because of marijuana's status as a schedule I  drug. This can adversely impact patient care, especially if patients  are using marijuana or its derivatives without their doctor's  knowledge. That is why our bill specifically authorizes doctors to  [[Page S478]]  discuss the potential harms and benefits of using such products with  their patients.   Finally, to broaden our understanding of marijuana and CBD even  further, our bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to  expand and coordinate research to determine the potential medical  benefits of CBD or other marijuana-derived medications on serious  medical conditions.   I have heard from many parents and adults who have turned to CBD and  marijuana as a last resort to treat medical conditions. In many cases,  these individuals have seen positive results.   Despite this, however, many are also concerned about the lack of  science-based information related to proper delivery mechanisms,  dosing, or potential interactions that CBD or marijuana may have with  other medications. Some also worry because these products aren't well  regulated or factory sealed, and often are labeled incorrectly.   Additional research will increase our ability to adequately address  these concerns. Not only are patients asking for additional research,  but so too is the medical community. In fact, the need for additional  research, along with the need to increase the supply of CBD and  marijuana for research purposes was underscored in the National Academy  of Sciences report, titled ``The Health Effects of Cannabis and  Cannabinoids: The Current State of Evidence and Recommendations for  Research.''   If the science shows that marijuana and its derivatives, including  CBD can effectively treat serious medical illnesses, we should enable  products containing these substances to be brought to the market with  FDA approval. But in order to make this determination, we must reduce  the barriers that currently impede important research. I hope my fellow  Senators will join me in supporting this important piece of legislation  again, and I look forward to working with my House colleagues to ensure  it is enacted.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Menendez, Ms.          Warren, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Cortez Masto, Ms. Sinema, Mrs.          Murray, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Sanders, Mr.          Casey, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Merkley, Mrs.          Gillibrand, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Kaine, Ms.          Duckworth, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Booker, Mr. Tester, Mr. Ossoff, Ms.          Smith, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Schatz, and Mr. Warner):   S. 254.
