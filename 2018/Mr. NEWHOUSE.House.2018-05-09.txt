 Mr. Speaker, by the direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 879 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 879         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 3053) to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of       1982, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and       Commerce now printed in the bill, it shall be in order to       consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment       under the five-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       115-69. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be       considered as read. All points of order against that       amendment in the nature of a substitute are waived. No       amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute       shall be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such       amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such amendments are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any       Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any       amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill       or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made in       order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 879, providing for consideration of  an important piece of legislation, H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy  Amendments Act of 2018. The rule provides for consideration of this  measure under a structured rule, making three amendments offered by the  minority in order. This legislation passed out of the Energy and  Commerce Committee on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis by a vote of  49-4, and has been a comprehensive effort spearheaded by my colleague  from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) over several Congresses.   Mr. Speaker, in 39 States and in 121 communities across this country,  including in the Tri-Cities community in my home district, in the great  State of Washington, the Federal Government continues to fail to meet  its obligation to collect and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high- level radioactive waste. This spent fuel and waste is generated as a  result of commercial nuclear power production, and as a byproduct of  our Nation's nuclear defense activities, including used fuel from  nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers and from the legacy  waste created from uranium and plutonium development as nuclear weapons  deterrents.   No one knows the magnitude of impact stemming from the development of  these nuclear deterrents more than the Tri-Cities community, where the  Hanford Site played a major role within the Manhattan Project during  World War II to develop the first atomic bomb. It was because of the  extraordinary work of the more than 50,000 workers at Hanford that we  were able to end World War II, and later the Cold War.   However, this work came with great repercussions. The Hanford Site  contains 56 million gallons of high-level radioactive waste, and is one  of the world's largest nuclear cleanup efforts. Fifty-six million  gallons, Mr. Speaker, enough to fill this room that we are standing in  today more than 20 times.   This amount of radioactive waste has been a legacy issue in my  district since the 1940s. My constituents fully understand the impacts  holding this waste has on the region. The Federal Government must keep  its commitment to collect and dispose of it to a permanent repository.   Thankfully, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy  Amendments Act of 2018, would make great strides in addressing this  very problem. H.R. 3053 would, rightfully, move forward with the  licensing of the Yucca Mountain facility in Nevada as the first  permanent geological repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level  radioactive waste.   First designated by Congress in 1987 as the location for these  materials to be disposed of, the site has undergone extensive  scientific and technical evaluations. In 2002, the U.S. Department of  Energy concluded that Yucca Mountain met all of the requirements to  serve as a permanent repository. In  [[Page H3845]]  2008, DOE applied to construct the repository, but the Obama  administration illegally terminated the effort for what appeared to be  political, rather than scientific, reasons. Fortunately, for our  Nation, and for the communities like the Tri-Cities, this  administration has stated its firm commitment to getting this project  back on track and moving forward.   Not only does central Washington continue to store the legacy waste  from Hanford, but it is also home to the only nuclear power plant in  the Pacific Northwest, the Columbia Generating Station. While H.R. 3053  provides for a path forward for a long-term solution for waste disposal  at Yucca Mountain, it also authorizes DOE to contract with a private  company to temporarily store spent nuclear fuel for the very first  time.   Communities that host nuclear power production sites across the  country have, for far too long, been held responsible for the  management of spent fuel, even though, under law, it is the legal  obligation of the Federal Government to collect and dispose of it. This  legislation directs DOE to initiate a program to consolidate and  temporarily store commercial spent nuclear fuel during the development,  construction, and initial operation of a repository.   H.R. 3053 provides for other innovative and necessary management  tools for waste, including encouraging DOE to take ownership of spent  nuclear fuels from facilities that have ceased commercial operation,  and allowing the Department to enter into contract with private storage  facilities.   The legislation also protects taxpayers by reducing legal  liabilities. Consumers of nuclear energy across the country have paid  over $42 billion into the nuclear waste fund, with nearly $40 billion  still waiting to be spent to dispose of nuclear waste. This includes  more than $200 million from Washington State ratepayers.   What have they received from the Federal Government for paying of  these fees, Mr. Speaker?   Absolutely nothing. Not one ounce of waste has been collected, which  is the very purpose of the fund.   This legislation will reform the fund to protect ratepayers by  assuring there is a definite answer on the Yucca Mountain repository  prior to restarting the fee collection.   Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege of visiting the Yucca Mountain  facility. While it may seem to some like just a dusty 5-mile tunnel  bored 1,000 feet deep in a remote Nevada desert, I found it to be an  impressive site and full of potential. The Federal Government has spent  decades, and billions of American taxpayer dollars, studying the best  place for a repository. The conclusion was that Yucca Mountain is now  the legal repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive  waste under the law.    I cannot express more ardently the importance of moving this effort  forward, both for my district and districts around the Nation. This  legislation takes a great leap forward for a long-term solution, while  also tackling serious impacts and disparities of the current situation  facing these communities.   Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward rule, allowing for considering  of H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018. I  encourage my colleagues to support the rule, as well as the underlying  legislation, to address this vital issue for our entire Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for joining me in  support of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, getting back to my State of Washington and the legacy of  the Federal Government's work at Hanford, like I said, they left behind  56 million gallons of radioactive and chemical waste that is currently  being stored in 177 underground tanks in temporary storage.   I had the fortune of being able to join a bipartisan congressional  tour of Yucca, of the Yucca Mountain site, to see firsthand what we  were talking about. Under the law, Yucca is the Nation's permanent  nuclear repository.   What I saw deep beneath the mountain in a remote desert that is  between, I think, 90 and 100 miles north of Las Vegas--it has been  referred to as the most studied site on Earth. But imagine this: being  inside a 5-mile-long tunnel with 1,000 feet of rock above your head and  1,000 feet of rock below your feet. That is what we are talking about.   The Federal Government has spent $15 billion over decades preparing  the site as the Nation's sole permanent nuclear repository. Yucca has  been deemed safe by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the NRC. A  recent safety evaluation found that the site could safely isolate spent  nuclear fuel for 1 million years.   Mr. Speaker, the prospect is that Yucca could stand in two different  ways: it could be a monument to billions of dollars in government waste  instead of being a monument to a solution that we promised every  American in this country.   I hope it is the latter, Mr. Speaker, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me quote the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee,  [[Page H3847]]  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), who said that:         Overall, this legislation is a balanced step in the right       direction that will benefit ratepayers, taxpayers, and those       living near nuclear facilities housing nuclear waste.    So I am happy to have his support for this legislation as well.   And just a couple of points from the gentlewoman from Nevada, whom I  deeply respect and take her perspective on this with a great deal of  gravity.   The transportation issue has been brought up several times. Nuclear  waste is transported in this country already, and I have just got to  tell you, the vessels, the containers that I have witnessed that this  waste is being temporarily stored in and used for transportation,  literally, is missile-proof. I mean, it is in containers that are very  solidly contained and in such a way that the safety factor is many  times over to ensure that, in case of any incident, that there would be  no contamination.   As far as the language, it is true that the bill would allow the  potential increase of storage capacity at Yucca Mountain. However,  there is a strict process of approval that would have to be gone  through in order to increase the amount of nuclear waste stored at  Yucca Mountain, so it is not a given, passing this legislation. It  would be something that would go through a very long, strict process.   I just have to say that we would gladly have entertained any  amendments to clarify or perfect language along those lines as far as  the storage amounts in Yucca Mountain.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), who has been carrying the banner for the Yucca  Mountain project for many Congresses.   (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me say, it is a pleasure to manage a rule with my  friend from Florida (Mr. Hastings), and my hands are wide open, not  tipped whatsoever.   Mr. Speaker, the American people have spent over $15 billion in  research and development of the Yucca Mountain project. It would be  utterly foolish, in my estimation, to literally flush this time,  energy, and capital down the drain, particularly as the Department of  Energy has deemed that the site has met all the requirements to move  forward with the licensing process.   The rule we have debated here today provides for consideration of  very, very important legislation, H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy  Amendments Act of 2018, which would jump-start this vital effort to  move the Yucca Mountain plan forward.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to speak in favor of this rule, and I  urge all of my colleagues to support House Resolution 879 and the  underlying legislation to provide relief and a long-term plan for  communities like those in my district and those in Mr. Hastings' State  of Florida, and the rest of our districts around the Nation.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as  follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 879 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, the amendment specified in section 3 shall be in       order as though printed as the last amendment in the report       of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution if       offered by Representative  [[Page H3849]]       Rosen of Nevada or a designee. That amendment shall be       debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by       the proponent and an opponent.        Sec. 3. The amendment referred to in section 2 is as       follows:       SEC. 206. STUDYING THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF ALTERNATIVE USES                     OF YUCCA MOUNTAIN SITE         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy may not take any       action relating to the licensing, planning, development, or       construction of a nuclear waste repository at 6 the Yucca       Mountain site until--        (1) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget       submits to Congress, and makes available to the public, a       study on the economic viability and job-creating benefits of       alternative uses of the Yucca Mountain site as outlined in       GAO Report 11-847, published on September 16, 2011,       including--        (A) defense activities, such as a command facility for       unmanned aircraft systems;        (B) a secure electronic data center;        (C) the development of renewable energy sources; and        (D) scientific research; and        (2) Congress holds a hearing on the alternative uses under       subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1).        (b) Definition. In this section, the term ``Yucca Mountain       site'' has the meaning given such term in section 2 of the       Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101).                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
