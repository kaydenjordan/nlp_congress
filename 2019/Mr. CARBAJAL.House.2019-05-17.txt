 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance  of buying American-grown flowers.   Whether it is celebrating a wedding or graduation, or sending  condolences, flowers have been used to mark significant occasions for  thousands of years.   I have seen the value this industry adds to our economy and  communities during my visits with our hardworking central coast farmers  and workers. The cut flower industry generates thousands of jobs and  produces $1.2 billion in economic activity each year through flower  farmers, distributors, and florists.   California grows an astonishing 75 percent of American-grown flowers,  yet only a fraction of the flowers sold across the country were grown  here. That must change.   This week, Senator Feinstein and I introduced a resolution to  designate July as American Grown Flower Month and to encourage  consumers to buy flowers with the ``Certified American Grown'' label.   By passing H.R. 379, we will honor the beauty this industry brings to  our homes year-round and help keep our American-grown flower industry  prosperous.   I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.                            ____________________
