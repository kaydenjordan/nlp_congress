 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Lofgren for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the most powerful movements in American history, those  that have made the most change in our country, have often been started  by young people.   More than a dozen years ago, many young Dreamers took to the streets  of cities like Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, New York, and so many  other places throughout our country asking that they be recognized  fully as Americans. Many of these are folks who were brought here when  they were 6 months old, 5 years old, or 3 years old and have only known  the United States as their home country.   Today, the House of Representatives recognizes their Americanness and  takes a step forward to move them out of the legal limbo in which they  have found themselves and, unfortunately, in which they have lived  their lives. These are folks who are servicemembers, they are  teenagers, they are engineers, and they are workers in the fields. They  are people who are producing for our country, who are making this  Nation strong. They are people who we can be proud of. They are, like  us, Americans. And today, most of all, we give them something to  celebrate as we acknowledge their Americanness.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Speaker Pelosi for her hard work. This is the  second time, under her tenure as Speaker, that a Dream Act has passed.  I thank Lucille Roybal-Allard, Pramila Jayapal, and everybody on the  Judiciary Committee who has also done the hard work of shepherding this  bill through.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 6.
