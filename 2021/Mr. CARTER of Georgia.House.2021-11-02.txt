 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Bess  Brunson for being named to Georgia Trend's 2021 40 Under 40 class.   Driven by her passion to improve the financial health of others, Bess  received her undergraduate degree in business from Virginia Tech. Since  returning to Savannah, she has successfully served her community  through various positions at The Fiduciary Group.   Beth is the third generation of the Butler family to work at The  Fiduciary Group, which was founded in 1970 by her grandfather, Lee  Butler. Dedicated to serving others, Bess works tirelessly to prepare  individuals for their life beyond retirement.   Outside of the workplace, Bess is an active volunteer throughout the  First District. She serves on the board of the Historic Savannah  Foundation's 13th Colony and Savannah Country Day School alumni board.  Her dedication to preserving Savannah's history while continuing the  legacy of The Fiduciary Group is truly inspiring.   I am honored to recognize Bess for this prestigious accomplishment,  and I know she will continue to make a positive impact throughout  Georgia's First Congressional District.                   remembering and honoring charlie waldrop     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor one of my pharmacy mentors, Charlie Waldrop of  Savannah, Georgia, who sadly passed away on October 20 at the age of  102.   A devoted public servant, Charlie was a World War II veteran, a  pharmacist, and a friend to all who knew him.   Charlie was drafted into World War II at the age of 22. He would go  on to serve throughout Europe, successfully attaining the rank of major  before finishing his military service in 1946.   Discovering his passion for public health, Charlie continued his  education at the University of Georgia's College of Pharmacy. Charlie  then returned to Savannah, where he would serve his community for the  next 40 years as a pharmacist at Crumbley's Pharmacy.   Charlie's life was defined by his extraordinary character, and I am  grateful for his lifetime of service to Georgia's First District and  our great Nation. I am also thankful for the great example he set for  me when I was a pharmacy intern working under Charlie.   My thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                       congratulating o.c. fowler, jr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate O.C.  Fowler, Jr., of Chatham County for being recognized as Veteran of the  Year by the Veterans Council of Chatham County.   Georgia's First Congressional District is home to many of our  Nation's veterans who put everything on the line to protect our  freedom. So being recognized as Veteran of the Year is an incredible  honor.   Mr. Fowler joined the United States Navy in 1967 and flew over 3,300  flight hours in helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. After seeing how  Vietnam veterans were treated after they returned home, Mr. Fowler  dedicated his life to ensure that our servicemembers are  unconditionally supported.   Among his many lifetime achievements, he helped raise over $35,000  for local charities, including the Chaplain's Fund at Hunter Army  Airfield. He is also an active member of the United States Service  Organization, the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force, and  the Savannah Council of the Navy League.   I can't thank Mr. Fowler enough for his outstanding service to our  Nation, and I want to congratulate him again on this wonderful  accomplishment.              recognizing and honoring deborah rodriguez garcia     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Deborah Rodriguez Garcia for being named to Georgia Trend's 2021  40 Under 40 class.   Deborah graduated from Georgia Southern University with a master's in  modern language. This fueled her knowledge and incredible drive, which  she is using to make a difference across the globe.   Deborah creates educational opportunities for migrant and refugee  communities. She focuses on helping children become more resilient  through play-based learning. Thanks to Deborah, refugee children in  South Asia find comfort in early learning opportunities through a  version of Sesame Street in their native clothing and language.  Children in Latin America, South Africa, the Middle East, and Asia have  benefited immensely from her passion and experience.   On behalf of the people of the First Congressional District of  Georgia, I congratulate Deborah on her nomination to Georgia Trend's  2021 40 under 40 class and offer my appreciation for her continued  service and dedication toward children across the world.                            ____________________
