 Mr. Chairman, my, my, my, the Republican  attacks on abortion never seem to end, and now they are targeting the  servicewomen in the military.   After that extreme decision by the Supreme Court overturning Roe v.  Wade, half of the States in our country are banning or severely  restricting access to legal abortion. Take a look at this poster and  this map. The dark-shaded States are where these abortion restrictions  are now in place. Look at those black dots. Those are the over 500  military bases in our country. Many of them are in States that now ban  or restrict abortion.   Mr. Chairman, that is why, last year, the Department of Defense  established travel transportation allowances for servicemembers and  dependents who need to travel to access abortion. Shamelessly, the  Republicans are now seeking to block this effort.   Our servicemembers leave their homes, their families, their friends,  and are willing to risk their lives to serve our Nation. They train  hard. They have dreams. They have goals. We trust them with Black  Hawks, intelligence operations, and special ops. We should trust them  with their own healthcare decisions, including when it comes to  deciding whether to start or grow a family.   Mr. Chairman, they stand for our freedom; it is time to stand for  theirs.
