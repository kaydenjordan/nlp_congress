 Mr. President, we continue to welcome our new  Senators-elect, who are in town this week for orientation meetings and  votes on party leadership. Yesterday evening, the Democratic leader and  I had the honor of toasting our future colleagues at our traditional  bipartisan welcome dinner.   It is quite a distinguished group. Some of our new colleagues are  talented legislators who will simply be relocating from the other side  of the Capitol. Some are coming to the Senate as private citizens who  have built successful careers outside the world of politics. Some have  already served as statewide elected officials and are coming to  Washington for the first time.   It is our pleasure to welcome these future Senators and congratulate  all of them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, speaking of looking ahead, just a few  hours ago our Republican conference came together and chose the  leadership team that will serve for the 116th Congress.   Our Republican leadership team will feature faces both new and  familiar. We are looking forward to earning our colleagues' trust and  working as hard as we can to seize the opportunities that will lie  before us this coming Congress.   It is my honor to have been asked by my colleagues to continue  serving as leader. I can honestly say that not a day goes by when I am  not humbled and honored by this opportunity to serve my colleagues, the  institution of the Senate, and our incredible country in whatever  measure I am capable.   I know my friend the Democratic leader feels much the same. I want to  congratulate him on his election as leader once again. I look forward  to working with him and his colleagues to move the ball and to make  bipartisan progress for the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on to the work that is currently  before us: We voted yesterday to advance important legislation that  will preserve our national security, ensure our readiness, and expand  economic opportunity. The bill before us to reauthorize the Coast Guard  funding will ensure that the brave men and women who put themselves in  harm's way every single day have access to the resources they need.   America calls on our Coast Guard to protect our ports, to protect our  coasts, to safeguard the shipping lanes that enable American commerce,  to stem the tide of illegal drugs before they reach our shores, and to  brave even the fiercest natural disasters that save American lives.  They always answer the call. They are always ready. So it is our  obligation as a Congress to keep the Coast Guard authorized and  adequately resourced to do the job.   When we pass the legislation before us, we will do just that, and we  will do even more because this bill also includes important reforms  that will streamline needlessly complicated government regulations and  help communities and small businesses harness the great resource that  is America's waterways.   In my home State of Kentucky alone, we have 1,900-plus miles of  navigable waterways. They support 13,000 jobs. This bill includes a  major victory for those Kentuckians and for Americans in a number of  other States.   The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act will unwind the confusing,  redundant tangle of rules and regulations that States, the EPA, and the  Coast Guard have all piled on to vessel owners and barge operators who  are, frankly, just trying to make a living. With this legislation, that  tangled mess will go away. It will be replaced by a single, efficient,  and uniform standard, which the Coast Guard will enforce. It is a  commonsense step, and it is something that has been thoroughly  bipartisan.   This legislation passed the Commerce Committee on a voice vote. It  has actually been reported out several different times, including when  the Senate was controlled by Democrats. So I look forward to delivering  these important measures for the Coast Guard, for Kentuckians, and for  many more Americans when we pass this legislation later today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we will also vote to advance the  nomination of Michelle Bowman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board.  Ms. Bowman brings experience as a community banker and as a banking  regulator, currently serving as the State Banking Commissioner of  Kansas. Her nomination comes before us in a year when the Senate has  taken substantive legislative action on behalf of America's community  banks and the communities they serve.   As we were reminded when we passed bipartisan reforms to Dodd-Frank a  few months ago, smaller lenders provide more than 50 percent of small  business loans and nearly 80 percent of agricultural loans nationwide.  So it is as important now as ever that these institutions and their  needs are represented on the Federal Reserve Board.   By any standard, Ms. Bowman is very well prepared to serve in a seat  designated specifically for an expert on community banking. So I urge  each of my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm another of the  President's well-qualified nominees for Federal service.    I object.
