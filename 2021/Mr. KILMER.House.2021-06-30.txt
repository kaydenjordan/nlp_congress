 Madam Speaker, people in the Pacific Northwest have faced  horrific news this week regarding potential catastrophic die-off of  salmon populations resulting from rising water temperatures from this  week's heatwave.   Sadly, in our region, deteriorating infrastructure and failing  culverts have long had a negative impact on water quality and have  threatened the salmon that are so important to our economy and to our  identity.   But today, through this bipartisan amendment, we have some good news.  This amendment would create a new grant program within the U.S.  Department of Transportation for culvert restoration to aid fish  passage and recovery efforts.   It provides $800 million for the new National Culvert Removal,  Replacement and Restoration Grant Program.   By providing this dedicated funding for culvert restoration, the  Federal Government can restore fish passages and provide critical  access to upstream habitat for aquatic species.   I am grateful for Senator Cantwell's partnership and that of Chair  DeFazio and for the support of bipartisan Members from the Pacific  Northwest, who know how important this effort is to protecting clean  water and recovering salmon populations in our region.    This is good news, and I encourage my colleagues to support this  amendment.
