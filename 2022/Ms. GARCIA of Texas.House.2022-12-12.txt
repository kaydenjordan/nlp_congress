 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize how important  the recent passage of the Respect for Marriage Act is for America.   Earlier this year, the Supreme Court's mega-Republican appointed  Justices shocked the world with their Dobbs decision.   House Democrats knew that the same reasoning these Republican- appointed judges used in their attack on women's abortion rights could  be used on the LGBTQ+ community's right to marry whom they chose. So we  decided to be proactive, to put people over politics, to put love over  hate.   Last week, we passed the Respect for Marriage Act to protect the  LGBTQ+ community's right to marry whomever they love.   As a member of the Equality Caucus, I am incredibly proud to have  supported the Respect for Marriage Act, which will be signed tomorrow  by the President, because in our country, when we say the pledge and we  say, ``justice for all,'' it means for all. It means freedom for all.  It means protecting our rights for all.                            ____________________
