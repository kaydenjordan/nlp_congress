 Madam Speaker, memo to my friends across the  aisle: violence, including workplace violence, is already illegal; and  it should always be prosecuted, regardless of whether it happens in the  name of Antifa or BLM, or even if it is directed at those police  officers working to keep us safe.   Again, violence in the workplace is already illegal, and you  certainly won't decrease it, Madam Speaker, with calls to defund or  even eliminate law enforcement and correctional facilities.   Talk about increasing workplace violence, Madam Speaker, and you  wonder why more Americans are purchasing firearms to protect themselves  with the anarchy you seem to be promoting.   Speaking of law enforcement, do we actually want to protect police  from workplace violence, too?   Or do we want to continue to increase it with a dishonest narrative  that makes it more difficult for them to do their jobs and keep us all  safe?   But here we find ourselves again today with our daily portion of  proposed unnecessary workplace regulations intended to punish law- abiding American employers, making their lives more costly and more  difficult.   Specific to those who would be most negatively impacted by this bill,  in a 2018 American Hospital Association survey, 97 percent reported  that they already have workplace violence prevention policies in place.   In addition, OSHA, of course, is already enforcing workplace violence  prevention policies.   So why are we trying to saddle employers with new regulations  estimated by the CBO to cost private entities at least $1.8 billion-- that is $1,800 million, for my friends across the aisle--in just the  first 2 years of mandated implementation, and then $750 million  annually going forward?   Where does this money come from for these unnecessary mandates?   From consumers in higher prices. You might call this hidden tax  increases. This is how all regulations are paid for, unless they  actually force the organization to go out of business because they  can't deal with the cost.   The CBO estimates that the cost to public healthcare facilities will  be $100 million in the first 2 years. The last thing that financially  struggling rural hospitals, like those in my district, need are more  unfunded mandates from Washington.   While we seem to be far off course today, Congress, in the past, has  actually passed statutes that make regulations more accountable,  requiring that bureaucrats give public notice regarding new rules and  mandates, and solicit feedback before implementation.   But, today, House Democrats want to make it easier for OSHA to issue  one-size-fits-all regulations without having to receive any feedback  from the public.   Article I of the Constitution mandates that Congress make our Federal  laws, not Federal agencies and their unelected bureaucrats.   Congress should make the regulatory process more accountable to the  taxpayer. That is why I introduced a bill called Article I Regulatory  Budget Act that would require agencies to account for the cost of  regulation.    In that spirit, Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking  Member Foxx for her leadership on regulatory reform with her Unfunded  [[Page H1857]]  Mandates Accountability and Transparency Act. I am proud to stand with  her as we try to shrink the size of the Federal Government and its  negative impact on those we represent. So I oppose this bill.                                time  0945
