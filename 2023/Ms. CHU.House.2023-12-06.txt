 Mr. Chairman, as chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific  American Caucus, I rise in strong opposition to the DETERRENT Act.   The DETERRENT Act would burden higher education institutions and  Federal agencies by needlessly complicating existing research security  measures. Further, the bill would impose unreasonably expansive  reporting requirements on individual researchers. What is worse is that  it would broadcast their personal information on public databases;  therefore, casting a chilling effect disproportionately on the Asian- American academic community.   From the incarceration of Japanese Americans in World War II to  racial profiling of Chinese-American scientists under the failed China  Initiative, countless Asian Americans have had their lives destroyed  because our government falsely accused them of being spies. Already, 72  percent of Asian-American academic researchers report feeling unsafe.   Safeguarding national security can be done through commonsense  reforms that Democrats have offered that don't come at the expense of  U.S. scientific innovation, global collaboration, and the Asian- American community. In fact, Congressman  Bobby Scott has submitted  such an amendment that is a commonsense reform.   Meanwhile, this bill, the DETERRENT Act, is a bill that I urge all my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on.
