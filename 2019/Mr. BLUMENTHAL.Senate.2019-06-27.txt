 Mr. President, tomorrow this body faces an  opportunity, in fact, an obligation to reassert its proper  constitutional role in warmaking.   I urge my colleagues to support the Udall-Kaine amendment, a  provision to prohibit funding for unauthorized and unapproved military  operations against Iran. No vote will be more important during this  session than the one we cast tomorrow. It is not only the imminence of  potential conflict, it is the reality that we would be surrendering our  proper constitutional responsibility and our right if we fail to adopt  this amendment. The American people already believe we have ceded too  much authority to the executive branch; that we are implicitly, if not  directly and explicitly, approving an imperial presence. This amendment  puts us to the test before the American people.   The Congress has a job to do. We should do that job tomorrow. We  should insist that we have the authority and we have the obligation to  consider whether there are military operations against Iran.   We can talk about policy. There is no question that Iran is a malign  and treacherously bad actor in that part of the world. There is no  doubt that it poses a clear and present jeopardy to the world  community. Iran may well have installed mines on the two tankers that  were severely damaged recently and may well be the culprit in shooting  down an American drone in the past week, but the United States is on a  perilous course. We are on a dangerous course toward continued  escalation and possible miscalculation that may create a spiral of  uncontrollable military responses.   It isn't that we have a dangerous policy, it is that we have no  policy, no strategy, no endgame articulated by the President of the  United States or anyone in this administration. To resort to military  action rather than reliance on diplomatic approaches is a recipe for  potential disaster.   This unintended escalation could result from more miscalculation or  it could result from purposeful desire on one side or both sides among  a small number of advisers or military leaders that there be a resort  to kinetic activity, but we have, in the meantime, an opportunity to  resort to diplomacy, to enlist our allies and partners. This situation  is the result of our putting those allies, in part, in an  extraordinarily difficult position.   The current tensions with Iran today are the direct result of  President  [[Page S4609]]  Trump's ill-conceived policy toward Iran ever since he carelessly and  recklessly discarded the Iran nuclear deal last year. His approach to  foreign policy has been indecisive and chaotic, and that is partly the  reason why tensions have escalated with an adversary rather than  preserving key nuclear agreements and engaging in diplomacy.   We must now deescalate and resort to diplomacy. Even if one disagrees  with that point, puts aside the President's bellicose and bullying  rhetoric, and even if there is the thought that Iran is solely and  completely responsible for this situation, the United States should not  engage in military operations without the authorization of  Congress. Yes, it may defend against or deter an immediate attack that  is so urgent that defense of the country has to be undertaken by the  Commander in Chief. But this Senate should prevent the President from  entering and starting and engaging in another war in the Middle East  under the misguided idea that there is a 2001 authorization that allows  him to do so legally.    Let me be perfectly clear. A failure of the prohibition funding  amendment we will consider tomorrow is not itself an authorization for  the President to wage war with Iran. The Constitution trumps any  statute. The Constitution requires action by Congress. Without  congressional authorization and anything short of specific authority  for declaration of war from Congress, starting or waging a war with  Iran would be unconstitutional.   But the NDAA on the floor this week is an opportune time--in fact, a  perfect opportunity--for Congress to reassert its constitutional  authority over the role of the declaration of war. We must seize this  moment. We can't simply allow or rely on the outdated 2001  authorization for the use of military force. We cannot allow its intent  to be so distorted and stretched and our constitutionally required  oversight to be disregarded. We have an obligation to conduct oversight  continually and push back on an administration that makes false claims  to advance its warmongering agenda.   The NDAA we passed today gives us the authority to undertake our  defense of the Nation.                            ____________________     Let me begin by thanking Ranking Member Jack Reed of  Rhode Island and Chairman Inhofe of Oklahoma, as well as my other  colleagues on the committee and my staff, who have worked tirelessly on  this to include key elements of my proposal that are important to our  military, as well as to our Nation.   This NDAA includes comprehensive reforms to the Military Housing  Privatization Initiative. It changes military housing in ways that are  long overdue and will prioritize families, ensure long-term quality  assurance, and enhance accountability.   In the hearings held by the Armed Services Committee with military  families who have experienced adverse health effects and financial  burden from residing in hazardous housing, one point was absolutely  clear: Our Nation is failing military families who live in this  military housing. The conditions, widespread and prevalent, are  entirely unacceptable. I was heartbroken to hear much of this testimony  from military families who already sacrifice so much and who have  struggled to secure safe and livable conditions.   I visited some of the homes at the New London base, and I was struck  by the mold, the repairs that were needed, the defects in appliances,  and the complaints about lack of proper air-conditioning and heating.  We owe our military families much better, and we owe law enforcement  the support they need to crack down on fraudulent private contractors.   I am also proud that the NDAA includes my provision to prohibit the  Trump administration from modifying military installations to detain  migrant children who have been forcibly separated from their parents.  The separation policies of this administration have been absolutely  abhorrent and antithetical to our values and ideals. They have been  shameful and disgraceful.   We have seen the photos, and those pictures are worth a thousand of  my words today, but the misuse of military resources, as I have  repeatedly emphasized, to implement this administration's radical  immigration enforcement agenda--this provision is a small but necessary  step toward protecting migrant families from the cruelties of this  family separation policy. It is only the beginning. We need to ensure  that the Department of Homeland Security reimburses the Defense  Department when military resources are used for support at the border.  This kind of measure will hopefully prevent DHS from using the Pentagon  as a piggy bank--a financial resource for cruel and inhumane policies.   We need to ensure that the President is stopped from abusing his  Executive authority by deploying troops to assist in deportation.   We also considered floor amendments to the NDAA. I want to highlight  an amendment that I offered to improve equity in the post-9/11 GI bill  benefit. Last July, the Pentagon issued a new policy on servicemembers'  ability to transfer unused education benefits to their family members.  These new policies prevent servicemembers with more than 16 years of  military service from transferring education benefits at the time that  military servicemembers opt to transfer rather than when they become  eligible. The Pentagon argues that these changes were made to ensure  that the Department keeps a key retention tool--all while breaking our  promise to military families by moving the goalpost of transfer  eligibility and exacerbating inequities in transferring educational  benefits. Most notably, disqualifying servicemembers with more than 16  years of military services counterintuitively penalizes the men and  women who have served this country in uniform for the longest time.   My amendment would make the post-9/11 GI bill an earned benefit  rather than a retention tool and ensure that all servicemembers who  have completed 10 years of service in the armed services and  Armed Forces are eligible to transfer their benefits to dependents at  any time, both while serving on Active Duty and as a veteran.    Despite the passage of the NDAA and the need for this amendment  continuing, I will continue to champion equitable education benefits  for our military families.   This year's NDAA makes important, unprecedented investments in the  submarines, helicopters, and aircraft built in Connecticut. They are  not only manufactured in my State--employing thousands of skilled  workers vital to our defense industrial base--but they are also  critical to our national security. They keep our country safe, and they  make sure our Nation and our military have a fair fight. They play a  vital role in our defense industry thanks to the unparalleled skills  and unstinting dedication of our manufacturing workforce. Because of  that workforce, we are able to build the best submarines and the best  F-35 engines and other aircraft engines and helicopters in the world-- not only through that skilled workforce and those major contractors but  the workers at suppliers and contractors, who are equally vital.   Last year, we built two submarines. This year, there will be two  more, with procurement for another major part of a submarine. As we  begin accelerating production of those Virginia-class submarines, the  New London Sub Base must have the capacity to support increased  submarine output. That is why I fought for $72.3 million to replace  Pier 32 at Sub Base New London, ensuring a modern landing to  accommodate multiple Virginia-class submarines.   I was proud to lead the fight for increased investment in those  Virginia-class submarines. That included $4.7 billion for those two  submarines and nearly $4.3 billion in that advance procurement for a  third Virginia-class submarine.   The NDAA also includes $2.3 billion--which is $140 million above the  President's request--for the Columbia-class program.   I was proud, as well, to champion over $10 billion for 94 F-35s,  which are important to all of our military services. That is an  additional 16 above the President's request.   In helicopter production, we will keep faith with the warfighters and  with our defense industrial base at Sikorsky.   Today's effort is a tribute to the leadership and the bipartisan  efforts in  [[Page S4610]]  this Congress. I thank and applaud my colleagues for coming together on  behalf of our Nation's defense, which is especially important in a time  of disillusionment and seeming dysfunction for the American people.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my  defense fellow, Joshua Culver, be granted floor privileges for the  length of the current debate on the NDAA.
