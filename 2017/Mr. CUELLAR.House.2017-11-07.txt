 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her condolences  and her prayers for Sutherland Springs.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Mr. Byrne and, of course, Chairman Foxx,  for their work on this particular bill. I thank Mr. Correa, Mr.  Peterson, and the other supporters of this legislation.   Prior to August 2015, the joint employer standard used by the NLRB  [[Page H8571]]  made it easy to understand who is and who is not a joint employer. For  decades, a joint employer relationship existed when one company  exercised ``direct and immediate'' control over another company's  workforce.   However, as you know, under the case Browning-Ferris Industries, the  NLRB departed from many years of legal precedent in August of 2015 by  establishing a new, expanded joint employer standard. This standard  could trigger employer liability by a company exercising vaguely  defined indirect control over an employee.   We have heard from local businesses from my district and across the  State of Texas, and it is clear that this decision is causing them  significant confusion.   In my district--let's say in Laredo, Texas, there is a local  restaurant owner who says that his restaurant currently employs close  to 1,000 local employees.                                time  1700    This expanded joint employer standard has limited his investment in  his business and the number of workers that he has. Reverting back to  the former joint employer standard that we had for so many years would  allow him to hire the employees that he needs to hire and reinvest  money.   This new expanded standard makes it difficult for local franchisees  like this one in Laredo to offer the employer relationship support from  franchisers for the fear that these benefits could be used against them  in a joint employer lawsuit.   Those fears are well founded. For example, the Progressive Policy  Institute, known for its pragmatic ideas, says that the expansion of  this joint employer doctrine ``may do more harm than good.''   This is why I am supporting this legislation. We are asking that it  revert back to the legal standard that we used for many years.
