 Mr. Speaker, after the fall of the Soviet Union,  the Russian bear started roaming Eastern Europe with its hungry  appetite to gobble and dominate politics and the Governments of  Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine.   Each nation has had a portion of its sovereign territory occupied by  the Napoleon of Siberia, Putin. His military is there, too.   I have been in each nation and talked to the speakers of each of the  parliaments. Now the three countries are working together in a  trilateral bond to thwart Russian interference and also improve their  democratic processes.   For as it is written in Ecclesiastes: ``A cord of three strands is  not easily broken.''   I also commend the Atlantic Council for their work with these nations  in promoting democratic ideals, combating corruption, and increasing  personal freedom.   The United States should encourage and support this trilateral union  to prevent the hungry bear from eating up each nation and returning  them to the old days of Russian oppression.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
