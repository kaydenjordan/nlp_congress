 Madam President, just very briefly, I have served in  three legislative bodies during my lifetime: the Mississippi State  Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and then, since New Year's  Eve of 2007, here in the United States Senate. I have never had a  better friend in any legislative capacity than Roy Blunt. So this is a  very profound moment for me and a very emotional moment for me.   If there were ever anyone who was a born legislator, that person is  Roy Blunt. He sprang to this Earth with the ability to understand a  diverse group of individuals representing diverse parts of the country,  both in the House and in the Senate, and to bring them together for a  result. This country is so much better off because of the legislative  skills and the legislative accomplishments of Roy Blunt. There are  people who are well today who had been sick, and they are well because  of the efforts of Roy Blunt. There are people alive today who would not  have been had it not been for the legislative skill of Roy Blunt.   This Republic will go on and this body will go on, of course, but  there will be a void in this room, in this Chamber, in this Senate,  because of the absence of Roy Blunt. I don't remember a finer mentor  whom I have ever served with, and it is my great honor to count him as  a close friend forever and to salute his service today.   I yield the floor.    I ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins, Senator  Inhofe, and I be allowed to give our remarks before the next vote.    Madam President, as we see, this is that difficult time  of the year when we pause and say goodbye, farewell, and Godspeed to  departing Members of this body.   Senator Collins and I are prepared to act as a team at this moment to  wish the very best and pay tribute to two individuals, Richard Shelby  of Alabama and Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma.
