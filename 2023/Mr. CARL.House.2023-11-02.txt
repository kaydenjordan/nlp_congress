 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Simpson for his remarkable work  on this bill, particularly under these trying circumstances.   Mr. Chairman, we are $33 trillion in debt. We cannot spend our way  and we cannot regulate our way out of that debt without having some of  the sacrifices that are in this bill, quite frankly.   Chairman Simpson has done an outstanding job identifying the key  priorities despite a challenging allocation.   One area of concern I would like to address is related to the Biden  administration's handling of royalties on Federal land. I would like to  emphasize the impact on Warrior Met Coal, which produces metallurgical  coal crucial for steel production and happens to be the largest  exporter from the Port of Mobile, Alabama, which I am honored to  represent.   Regrettably, Warrior Met Coal's Federal lease application with the  Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land Management has been  marred by delays. The Interior Department's shifting requirements,  including the recent demands for an environmental impact study on top  of a comprehensive environmental assessment completed over a year ago  have been the latest obstacles in a near decade-long effort to secure  this lease.    As you are aware, Mr. Chairman, the Mineral Leasing Act requires the  maximum economic recovery of coal within  [[Page H5246]]  the proposed lease area. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing permit  delays, Federal coal is not currently being efficiently mined, causing  further setbacks in Federal coal mining. Every day that passes without  progress results in a loss of crucial revenue from coal royalties for  affected communities, the State of Alabama, and the Federal Government.  These are the fees that will help pay some of this debt down.    This situation is unacceptable, and I am eager for our  colleagues and staff to identify ways to move forward ensuring that the  Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land Management uphold  their responsibilities under the Mineral Lease Act that impacted  communities receive the essential funding they require.                                time  1130    Now, regarding the specific language included in the bill, it  highlights the importance of the Bureau of Land Management's production  of domestic coal on Federal lands, with a particular emphasis on  distinguishing between metallurgical coal and thermal coal.   Additionally, the bill is focused on clawing back wasteful spending,  reducing bureaucracy, and maintaining responsible funding levels to  serve the best interests of our constituents in this Nation. It  addresses the needs of prioritizing essential programs, protecting  critical minerals, promoting oil and gas lease sales, and limiting  burdensome regulations, among other key priorities.   Continuing to claw back wasteful spending is one step closer to  getting our spending under control. I support this bill. It is my hope  that, by working together, we can address these critical issues and  ensure a brighter future for our communities.
