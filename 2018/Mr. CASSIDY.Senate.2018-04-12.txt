 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I honor today the life and sacrifice of  one soldier in particular, U.S. Marine Corps LCpl Taylor Conrad, who  was 24 years old and was a Central Louisianan.   Our military men and women deserve recognition. They sacrifice time  away from family and friends and put themselves in harm's way to  advance our country's interests. Every day, they risk their lives to  secure our safety. In the case of Taylor Conrad, along with three of  his fellow marines, he tragically lost his life last week when their  helicopter crashed during a training mission in California.   A Louisiana native and Central High School graduate, Taylor  exemplified the qualities of a good marine. He was tough,  compassionate, and wanted to help others. In high school, Taylor played  football and was an accomplished powerlifter. He also volunteered in  the Best Buddies program, which matches students with schoolmates in  the special ed program.   A teacher said:         The one thing that made Taylor such a special friend with       our kids is he didn't approach them in a way that he felt       sorry for them. He approached them in a way where he truly       wanted to be their friend.    The school's athletic director said Taylor's ``love for those who  need the most is something I'll never forget.'' There was one child who  would never speak except, with Taylor, he would laugh. That was the  effect Taylor had on others.   After school, Taylor decided to serve our country by joining the  Marines. He went on to become a CH-53 helicopter crew chief in the 3rd  Marine Aircraft Wing's Heavy Helicopter Squadron 465. One marine who  served with Taylor had this to say of him:         He was the gold standard. He pushed everybody and he cared       about everybody. I wouldn't be the Marine I am now if it       wasn't for him.    Our hearts go out to everyone whose life was touched by Taylor. We  especially pray for his family, including his daughter, who was born  just last October. Their loss is great, and their hearts are heavy. I  want them to know that Louisiana and our entire country mourn with them  because our loss is great too. When they lost a brother, a son, and a  dad, we lost a good man, a great marine, and a fellow American.   Thank you.
