 Mr. Chairman, it kind of blows my mind. You look  at the sign that was just displayed by our colleague; it says that the  Republican budget is a bad deal for working Americans.   Well, I don't know what Americans you folks are talking to, but the  middle class Americans that I talk to, they want an economic growing,  job creating, tax cutting budget and tax relief effort. That is what  they want out of the House. That is what the Republican plan is  bringing.   We not only rebuild our military, but we do something that has not  been done in years. We begin to get into that mandatory spending and  the out-of-control spending that we have here in our Nation's Capitol.   Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the biggest  threat to our national security is our national debt. How are we ever  going to do that if we don't begin to address mandatory spending?   Mr. Chair, we have brought a good budget, a responsible budget, one  that balances in 10 years to the floor. We need to get every colleague  in this Chamber to get behind it because it is good for working  Americans, it is good for working families, and it is the responsible  thing to do.
