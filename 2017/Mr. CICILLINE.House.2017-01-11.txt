 Mr. Speaker, for almost 8 years, we have heard about  Republicans' plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.  During that time, the House has voted dozens of times to repeal or  defund ObamaCare; but now as Republicans prepare to take control of the  White House, it is clear that Republicans don't have a plan to replace  ObamaCare. Instead, they will repeal and displace millions of  hardworking Americans, cutting them off from quality, affordable health  care and making it even harder to get ahead.   The Republican repeal and displace plan will take away health  insurance from 30 million Americans and will increase prescription drug  costs, premiums, and out-of-pocket expenses for American families; and  it will end health coverage for millions of Americans in order to give  a huge tax cut to the richest Americans. Repealing ObamaCare will also  cause a loss of 2.6 million jobs, including 12,100 jobs in my home  State of Rhode Island.   Mr. Speaker, let's be clear: the Republicans' repeal and displace  plan is just wrong. It is time for Republicans to end this charade and  get back to doing the people's work by partnering with Democrats to  strengthen and improve the Affordable Care Act and stop threatening all  these harms on the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page       37, line 9.        Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page       39, line 12.        Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the       table of contents accordingly):                   TITLE VII--EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES       SEC. 701. EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES.         This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not       apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in       section 551 of title 5, United States Code) pertaining to the       prevention of the transmission of foodborne illness or       assistance to domestic and foreign food facilities to meet       preventive-control requirements for safety, such as hazard       prevention practices in human and animal food processing,       packing, and storage facilities. The provisions of law       amended by this Act, as in effect on the day before the date       of the enactment of this Act, shall apply to such rules.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Chairman, the bill before us today promises to  update the ways that agencies make and enforce their rules and  regulations. But in many ways, it is a solution in search of a problem.  When issuing a rule, Federal agencies must already adhere to rigorous  analytical process of considering alternatives, justifying the cost of  a rule, and considering input from stakeholders.   Within this framework, agencies have been granted the necessary  latitude to react quickly to urgent crises in consumer safety. It has  preserved the safety of our food and our drinking water and has  protected our families from defects in the products that we rely upon  every day. However, the passage of this bill would put that safety and  that protection at risk.   With H.R. 5, we are getting six reform bills rolled into one. This  sweeping regulatory bill would cumulatively add 60 new procedural and  analytical requirements to the agency rulemaking process, invite  frivolous litigation against agencies, empower special interests, and  emphasize cost-saving over public protection.   If enacted, H.R. 5 will needlessly create such an enormous burden on  the rulemaking process that it threatens to hamstring agencies and  discourage them from pursuing new rules at all. In its present form,  this bill endangers our Nation's environmental, public health,  workplace safety, and consumer financial security protections.   My amendment would offer critical protection by exempting rules  pertaining to the prevention of the transmission of foodborne illness  or assistance to food facilities to meet preventive-control  requirements for safety.   Protecting consumers from dangerous food contamination is a worthy  goal in and of itself. And this amendment would go even further by  protecting jobs and businesses. For example, in 2015, Blue Bell  Creameries suffered a deadly listeria contamination crisis and had to  recall 8 million gallons of ice cream. After the company shut down most  of its production, Blue Bell was forced to lay off 1,450 employees from  their jobs, or 37 percent of their workforce, and an additional 1,400  employees were furloughed.   Chipotle is also still reeling from various outbreaks of E. coli,  salmonella, and norovirus over 2015 and 2016, which caused widespread  panic among customers and the company's shareholders. Despite marketing  efforts to repair its reputation, Chipotle's sales have steadily  declined, and it plans to open fewer stores in 2017. This, in turn, had  a domino effect on Chipotle's paper bowl supplier who laid off 5  percent of its employees because of decreased demand from Chipotle.   Afterward, both Blue Bell and Chipotle took aggressive remedial  steps, such as conducting deep cleansing of equipment and facilities,  changing food preparation procedures, hiring food safety consultants,  training employees, and temporarily suspending operations. The FDA  responded by proposing proactive rules, such as having manufacturers  come up with a plan to identify potential food safety problems and how  to respond to them. The FDA also proposed a rule to establish standards  for growing, harvesting, packing, and handling produce.   Both these rules could greatly assist businesses in minimizing future  food contamination and having to deal with the economic aftermath of an  outbreak. However, under H.R. 5 in its current form, similar such FDA  rules could be delayed by years or halted entirely. We can't afford to  put consumer safety and our economy at risk while Congress entangles  any real possibility for immediate and preventative action.   I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment to ensure  that we protect the public and health and safety of our constituents.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  his comments, but the assertion that this does nothing to frustrate or  jeopardize food safety is not true. This creates 60 new procedural and  analytical requirements to agency action, and that will invite  frivolous litigation, empower special interests, emphasize cost saving  over public protection, and make implementation of these rules almost  impossible.   It is important to remember, Mr. Chairman, when issuing a rule,  Federal agencies already are required to adhere to a rigorous  analytical process of considering alternatives, justifying the cost of  the rule, and considering input from stakeholders. I gave two examples  in my earlier comments that demonstrate that there is a real role for  the Federal Government in the implementation of rules to protect food  safety. There are real consequences not only to the individuals harmed  but to our economy by these sorts of events. This bill will not only  frustrate that, in many instances, it will make it impossible. I urge  my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.    I yield back the balance of my time.
