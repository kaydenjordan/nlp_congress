 Mr. Speaker, the Christmas season is here, a time during  which our small businesses typically thrive, the season that gets them  through much of the rest of the year fiscally.   This year, however, restaurants and stores are forced into shutting  their doors on much of Main Street America. However, the Paycheck  Protection Program has saved 51 million jobs across the country.   Speaker Pelosi could use this legislative week to free up the  remaining $135 billion in PPP reserves, but instead we are voting on  legalizing a schedule I narcotic, and then whether to pass a Carole  Baskin anti-tiger bill.   Now is not the time to play politics by withholding money that has  been already allocated on behalf of small business. At the end of the  year, if we do not use these funds, they will expire.   I encourage all my colleagues to join me in signing the discharge  petition for H.R. 8265, freeing up these funds immediately and reviving  the tested and effective PPP to save more small businesses this year,  especially as governments clamp down even more so on their closures.                            ____________________
