 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the accomplishments of Mr. Andrew Rugh, an Eagle Scout from  Troop 28 in Rocky Grove, Venango County, as he celebrates completing  all 138 merit badges offered by the Boy Scouts of America.   Andrew has been a member of Troop 28 for more than 7 years and has  had the support of his parents, Chad and Christina Rugh, throughout his  time in Scouting.   Becoming an Eagle Scout is a great honor. Only 8 percent of all  Scouts attain the rank of Eagle Scout, and less than half a percent of  Scouts are estimated to have completed all available merit badges.   On his path to earning each merit badge, Andrew was challenged to  learn various skills ranging from law and chess to archery and welding.  [[Page H5811]]    Alongside millions of young men and women in Scouting, Andrew  embodies the values of patriotism, courage and self-reliance.   Madam Speaker, as an Eagle Scout myself, and a member of the Scouting  community for more than 50 years, I can attest to the significance of  Andrew's achievement.   Congratulations, Andrew, on your accomplishment in Scouting and your  contribution to your community. Well done, Scout.                            ____________________
