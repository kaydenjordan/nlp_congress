 Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened by the situation we are  in today. Historically, CHIP and community health centers have been  bipartisan priorities. We are talking about programs that provide  healthcare for millions of American children and serve some of our  country's most vulnerable citizens.   Yet my Republican colleagues have inexplicably taken these programs  hostage, tucking into this bill new attempts to undermine Medicare,  sabotage the ACA, and strip hardworking Americans of their health  insurance, not to mention they are trying to extort these harmful  policy changes a month after they let CHIP and community health center  funding expire. This is absolutely unconscionable because, make no  mistake, these cuts will hurt the same Americans who depend on CHIP and  community health centers.   My Democratic colleagues and I care deeply about these programs. That  is why we have sounded the alarm for months, not just yesterday, for  months, and urged the majority to stop wasting time on ACA repeal and  get to work on renewing these lifelines for American families.   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that didn't happen, and I am  disappointed by what is happening now. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''
