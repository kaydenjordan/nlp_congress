 Mr. President, I attended the same classified briefing as  the Republican Senate leader, and I listened carefully as the  administration presented the realities of Afghanistan, and I was drawn  to a historical analogy that was best captured in a short verse by  Rudyard Kipling.   It goes like this: When you're wounded and down on the Afghan plain,  and the women come out to cut up your remains, just roll on your rifle  and blow out your brains and go to your God like a soldier.   That stark verse was a description of what happened to the British  Empire when they felt that moving into Afghanistan would be part of  their record of conquest. They learned otherwise.   The retreat from Kabul has been reported over and over, but it  basically was a retreat that killed every remaining British soldier,  every member of their family, save one. They wanted one person, the  Afghans did, to return to Queen Victoria and tell her what happened  when they threw the British out of Afghanistan. A similar story can be  told by the Soviet Union--now Russia--when they occupied Afghanistan  with visions of changing that country forever to a Russian communist  mode. They left bitterly disappointed, paying a heavy price.    So 20 years ago, in the wake of 9/11, with 3,000 innocent Americans  dead, we debated the issue on this floor as to whether the United  States would follow the British and Russians into Afghanistan.   I was here. I was asked to vote, and I remember why I voted yes. It  was simple. Those responsible for 9/11 and the deaths of 3,000 innocent  Americans were holed up in Afghanistan building their forces to strike  us again. Would we respond? The answer was obvious. Yes. No one gets  away with that sort of an attack on the United States, and I voted for  us to send our forces into Afghanistan. I dare say that neither I nor  anyone else who voted for that decision ever dreamed that 20 years  later we would still be in Afghanistan having lost 2,000 American lives  of the brave American women and men who served there; tens of thousands  of people injured, trillions of American dollars spent, with virtually  nothing to show for it. What we learned, the bitter lesson for America,  as it was for the Great Britain and the Russians, is that Afghanistan  has no appetite for outsiders.   We tried to bring them dramatic, positive improvements in their  culture and education, the liberation of women, creating new  opportunities, and maybe we had some marginal success. But it is a  battle when you try to change a nation's ethic, and we learned it the  hard way.   At the briefing today, one of our colleagues whom I respect very  much, Senator Kaine from Virginia, I thought asked the most important  question about the current situation in Afghanistan. He said it was his  understanding that the United States had spent billions, maybe more, in  the training and equipping of the Afghan military forces supporting the  government and that we had in fact trained and equipped over 100,000,  maybe as many as 300,000, of these Afghan security forces, and now they  are losing territory and melting away into the landscape when they are  under attack by the Taliban.   Senator Kaine said: I understand that there are only tens of  thousands of Taliban and hundreds of thousands of Afghan security  forces, and it appears we cannot hold our ground despite all the  training and all the money. Was this is a failure of training or more?  And those representing the administration were very candid. It is not a  failure of training. It is an issue that, frankly, cannot be  accomplished.   So when I hear the Senator from Kentucky coming to the floor and  begging us to stay, to what end? For what purpose? Senator Kaine,  myself, and others invited him and the entire Senate to openly debate  this question on the authorization for use of force in Afghanistan.  There was resistance.   And the idea of actually, finally, leaving Afghanistan after 20  years, it wasn't an original Joe Biden idea. If you remember, it was  Republican President Donald Trump, who actively engaged in the  negotiation and picking a target date for our troops to be gone. He  tried and wanted to achieve that before he left office. He didn't, but  it was clearly his intent. So to blame the Biden administration for  this decision, frankly, it is a decision that has been obvious for  almost 10 years. There comes a point when we have to acknowledge that  we cannot ask another American to die in a vain effort to change  Afghanistan into a modern nation. It will only come when the Afghan  people reach that conclusion                                Senate Agenda    Mr. President, you know well, and I do, too, that we are usually not  in session in this week of August. It is usually a time to head back  home, meet our constituents, eat our way through our State Fairs, and  enjoy some downtime with our families. This year, I was looking forward  to a visit by some of my grandkids to Springfield when Loretta and I  have a week or two of just getting to know the kids again.   We didn't get to see them much last year because of COVID-19, and I  was looking forward to the opportunity this year, but because we are in  session I was unable to. We hope maybe in a few days that changes.   I think about those grandkids, all of my grandkids--six of them at  this point, I am proud to say--and what kind of world we are going to  be leaving them.   A new school year is right around the corner. Along with all the  normal supplies, they will be buying face masks. For a young child,  this pandemic must be confusing and scary. As a parent, you want to be  honest with them, but you want to reassure them that everything is  going to be OK. That goes for all the challenges of our day, starting  with climate change.   This morning, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  released its first report in 8 years. It is an alarm bell to the world,  warning that our climate is changing much faster than we anticipated.   I would like to read a couple paragraphs from this morning's New York  Times because they summarize these U.N. reports and did that summary so  well.   ``Nations have delayed curbing their fossil-fuel emissions for so  long that they can no longer stop global warming from intensifying over  the next 30 years, though there is still a short window to prevent the  most harrowing future, a major new United Nations scientific report has  concluded.   Humans have already heated the planet by . . . 2 degrees Fahrenheit,  since the 19th century, largely by burning coal, oil, and gas for  energy. And the consequences can be felt across the globe: This summer  alone, blistering heat waves have killed hundreds of people in the  United States and Canada, floods have devastated Germany and China, and  wildfires have waged out of control in Siberia, Turkey, and Greece.''   So what do we say to our kids about this? Dad, granddad, what are you  doing about this?   How do we reassure our kids that the planet they inherit is still  going to be livable. Words aren't enough. Denial certainly isn't a  plan. We need to do something. And we need to do what generations of  Americans before us have done: face reality and face the challenges  squarely.   So I ask myself and all of us: What are we doing to make sure that my  grandkids and all of America's kids will be OK?   We are going to have a chance to answer that question this week as  the Senate begins to debate on a proposal  [[Page S6065]]  that will define the world my grandkids and everyone's kids will grow  up in.   President Biden's plan to build back better is the most ambitious  investment in America's future in a generation. And much of that plan  is included in the budget blueprint that we will be considering in a  very short time.   This budget blueprint will strengthen our Nation's economy and ensure  that working families have a fighting chance and receive a fair share  of the wealth that their work produces.   It will help close the income and opportunity gaps between the  wealthiest among us and working families who are struggling to make it.  And most importantly, it will give American workers the tools they need  to outcompete any country in the 21st century.   I listened to the criticism of the plan by the Senator from Kentucky,  and I thought: If we don't embark on an ambitious plan to deal with  climate change and to move this economy in the right direction for  working families in this country, then, frankly, we are right in  preparing, as some are, to accept a second-place finish for the United  States of America. I think that is tragic. I don't think it is  consistent with who we are as a people.   The proposal by President Biden will build on a winning economic  strategy we started earlier this year with the American Rescue Plan.   Mr. President, you remember that American Rescue Plan and I do, too,  because last year, in the year 2020, when we were facing this pandemic  on two, three, or four separate occasions, emergency bills came before  us proposed by the Trump administration, negotiated with a Democratic  and Republican Congress, presented to us on the floor, and there was  virtual unanimity. Both parties stood together in the midst of a  pandemic crisis to do what was necessary so that America could move  forward. And then came the election and then came the Big Lie and then  came the disintegration of this bipartisanship   When it was Joe Biden's turn to come up with the American Rescue  Plan, not a single Republican Senator, not one Republican Congressman,  would vote yes. Not one.   So what was in the plan that was so objectionable? Could it have been  the money invested so that we would administer the coronavirus vaccines  to every American successfully? That was in the plan.   How about more money that we put in that plan for businesses so they  could reenlist their workforce and start up again at the end of this  pandemic? That was in the plan.   How about the money that we promised American families, $1,400 cash  payment, promised by Trump, delivered by Biden? That was in the plan.  And not a single Republican would support it--not one. All of a sudden  rescue plans became a partisan measure in the U.S. Senate and the  House. The Republicans walked away from it.   Well, let me tell you what the American Rescue Plan has done. It has  revived our Nation's economy. We are on the course for a historic  recovery. In the first 6 months, President Biden's economy has added  nearly 700,000 jobs a month, on average. During the first part of the  year, our economy grew at the fastest rate in nearly 40 years. The  American Rescue Plan, which not a single Republican would support,  worked because it provided financial relief to the people who need it  the most: working families. And that relief has benefited everyone.   As part of this package--and you know it full well, Senator, because  you were one of the authors--we enacted a child tax credit that we  believe, fingers crossed, will cut child poverty in America by half.  Think about that for a moment. By half.   With the Build Back Better Plan, President Biden is proposing to  extend that credit and reduction in child poverty. That enhanced child  tax credit is already changing the lives of tens of millions of  families across America. In my home State of Illinois, there are  hundreds of thousands of parents who are now able to fill their gas  tanks and buy groceries because of it.   Let me tell you about one: Lydia. Here is what she wrote: ``With the  child tax credit, I'll be able to buy my kids their school supplies,  clothes, what they need to get back to school, and put groceries on the  table.''   In the wealthiest Nation on Earth, no parent should have to choose  between clothing her children and feeding them.   President Biden's plan to build back better is a blueprint for  America's future, a future where every family knows the safety and  dignity of financial security, and every child can reach their full  potential.   I look forward to a vigorous debate in the Senate on these and other  proposals in the budget blueprint. But right now I want to speak  specifically to the funding the budget resolution provides for the  committee I chair, the Senate Judiciary Committee.   I see the chairman of the Budget Committee has come to the floor,  Senator Sanders, and I thank you for crafting this important bill.   (Ms. WARREN assumed the Chair.)   This proposal will make historic investments in fixing our broken  immigration system. It has been 35 years--35 years--since we have had  any meaningful changes in our immigration law. If you go back to Ronald  Reagan as President, that was the last time--Simpson-Mazzoli--names  those of us who study the subject remember. Most people don't, I am  afraid. Yet that was the last time.   Is there anyone who can say with a straight face that we don't have a  broken immigration system in this country? We do.   The proposal will give us historic investments in fixing it. These  reforms have the potential to generate more than a trillion dollars of  economic growth over the next decade. I listened as the Senator from  Kentucky, the Republican leader, dismissed this whole conversation as  ``blanket amnesty''--blanket amnesty--and correlated all immigration  problems to the current challenge, and it is a challenge, that we face  on our southern border.   The reforms that we have in mind will provide a pathway to  citizenship for Dreamers. Excuse me if I take this one personally, but  it was 20 years ago that I introduced the DREAM Act in the U.S. Senate.  As I said jokingly, at the time, if you asked people, ``Who are the  Dreamers?'' they would say a British rock group--right?--led by a  fellow named Freddie.   Well, maybe they were right then, but 20 years later, when you say  ``Dreamers''--and people say it frequently--you know who we are talking  about. They are kids brought to the United States by their parents, who  grew up in this country, pledged allegiance to that flag every day in  their school classrooms, and believed in their heart of hearts that  they were Americans to the core, only to learn when the parents worked  up the courage to tell them when they were teenagers that they were  undocumented. They were kids without a country.   The DREAM Act said: We are going to give you a chance, young man,  young woman. You can earn your way to legal status and citizenship.  Keep your nose clean. Don't get in trouble with the law. Pay the  necessary fees and wait, and we will give you that chance to become  part of America's future.   And even with that uncertainty in their lives, with the inability to  qualify for even Federal Government loans to go to college, they have  written some dramatic stories. We all know them. Those of us in public  life have met them. They are doctors and nurses and dentists. They are  on the frontlines of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. They want to  enlist, and some already have enlisted, in our military. They are  lawyers. They are entrepreneurs. They are amazing, and they did it all  never certain that they were going to be accepted in America.   According to Senator McConnell, they are part of this blanket amnesty  of these immigrants who want to come to our country. Forgive me,  Senator, but they are much more than that.   This measure would also take care of temporary protected status  people--people in the United States who came here because of a crisis  in their own countries. We accepted them. They have lived here for 20  years and, now, frankly, they are caught in the middle. We give them a  chance to earn their way to citizenship.   And farm workers--do you know we have 2.4 million farm workers? These  are men and women who get out and do the dirty, dangerous, hot work  that Americans will never queue up to do. And they do it because we  want fruits and vegetables on our table. We want  [[Page S6066]]  meat and poultry processed safely, and Americans won't do the work.  Let's just be very candid about it. And I know this based on all the  people who come to my office. These farm workers have been used by our  country for years to pick our crops and deliver them safely to our  tables, and we have a bill that we put together, with the growers and  the workers in total agreement, that gives these farm workers a path to  citizenship.   When we had a hearing on it in the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of  the Republican Senators said: Oh, just what we need--instant amnesty  for farm workers.   Do you know what that instant amnesty is like? You have to show that  you have spent 10 years of your life working in the fields before you  even qualify for the 9-year process that can bring you to citizenship.  Nineteen years--instant amnesty? No, it isn't.   And, again, other essential immigrant workers who have been saving  our lives and keeping our families fed during this pandemic. They are  called essential workers, but the categories that created these  essential workers were defined by Donald Trump--not us, not Democrats.  And we believe essential workers--whom we thanked profusely during this  pandemic--if they are undocumented, should have a chance at  citizenship. Those are the groups we are trying to work to bring into a  full-time status.   This measure would expand funding for commonsense measures to make  our system safer for everyone by improving the process of asylum  claims, reducing immigration court backlogs, and starting to secure our  southern border.   More than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential critical  infrastructure workers. Tens of thousands of these young people have  been saving our loved one's lives as nurses, doctors, and medical  professionals. Hundreds of thousands of undocumented farm workers will  account for about half of our Nation's farm workforce and do  backbreaking labor every day to put food on our tables. These members  of our communities have more than earned their path to citizenship.   I am going to get into the weeds a bit here, but I want to say, under  a Senate rule known as the Byrd Rule, any provision included in  reconciliation must have a substantial and direct impact on the budget,  and this impact cannot be merely incidental. That is kind of the  roadmap for this budget resolution. I am sure the Senator from Vermont  knows it well.   Let's be clear. A pathway to citizenship as part of our immigration  package on the budget reconciliation bill would have a substantial and  direct impact on our budget. A pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and  immigrants with temporary protected status would have a budgetary cost  of approximately $42.4 billion over 10 years, according to the  Congressional Budget Office. This is a critical component of our  economic recovery. There is no world in which this budgetary impact is  merely incidental--$42.4 billion.   Creating a pathway to citizenship, though, is not just a matter of  cost. There are also benefits. It would boost our Nation's GDP by $1.5  trillion over the next 10 years. It would create 400,000 new jobs and  increase every American's annual wage by an estimated $600--win, win,  and win.   There is ample precedent for passing this important legislation  through budget reconciliation. The Republicans have used this process  to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for drilling  and enacted a $1.9 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest Americans and  corporations.   In addition, in 2005, Senate Republicans used reconciliation to  dramatically increase the number of lawful permanent residents by an  estimated 3.2 million over 10 years. Now they are saying it doesn't  belong in reconciliation. In 2005, they put it in. This is the exact  same immigration status we are proposing to give Dreamers, TPS holders,  farm workers, and essential workers.   I have tried for many years to pass a path to citizenship.  Republicans have obstructed bipartisan immigration reform time and time  again, including filibustering the DREAM Act at least five times. This  year, I convened bipartisan immigration negotiations that dragged on  for months. Republicans made unreasonable demands and insisted on  attaching partisan provisions that would actually cut legal  immigration. Republicans have rejected commonsense measures to help  secure our border   It is clear that the only viable option for passing immigration  reform is through the reconciliation process. For those who claim they  are concerned about our southern border, here is your chance. Here it  is--to invest billions of dollars in smart and effective steps to  improve border security. We need to provide a pathway to citizenship  for Dreamers and others who are contributing to our economy every day  and will help to grow it for years to come.   I am going to close by thanking the Senator from Vermont. I don't  know when I first approached him with this notion of including  immigration, but from day one, Senator Sanders has been supportive of  the concept and now has given us our chance. Millions, millions of  people who make America better are watching and hoping that in the next  days and weeks we can achieve our goal and give them a chance to find a  path to citizenship and become an important part of America's future.   I yield the floor.
