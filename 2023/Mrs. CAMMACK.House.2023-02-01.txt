 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Clyde) for hosting this Special Order on an important topic.   My speech is well beyond the time I am allotted, so I am just going  to dispense with the notes, really, and talk about how absolutely  insane, ridiculous, and unconstitutional this new rule is.   Not only has it been completely blown out of proportion what the  brace is, a brace that was originally designed for disabled veterans,  increases stability, and since 2015, had been ruled as an accessory by  the ATF which, under their own regulations, under their own guidance,  they said that they didn't have jurisdiction over accessories.   So I thought that was very interesting that now we have an unelected  swamp creature, a bureaucrat who thinks that they can now make felons-- law-abiding citizens, felons by now instituting this 120-day rule.   A lot of people have talked about this, but few have talked about the  [[Page H624]]  economic impact this will have. Based on the NICS data that we have,  this is going to be a $1.9 billion hit to the firearms industry; $1.9  billion to law-abiding citizens.   Believe me, this rule has nothing to do with gun safety. This has  nothing to do with making communities safer. This is just a backroom  attempt, a backdoor attempt to get at the firearm industry. That is all  this is and nothing more.                                time  1845    This is why, Mr. Speaker, we have to pass the SHORT Act. This is why  we have to pass the REINS Act, because the REINS Act would prohibit any  regulation that has a $100 million or more impact to an industry to  come back to Congress for an up or down vote.   You can fire your Congress-critter, but you cannot fire these  unelected bureaucrats. We need to pass the REINS Act. We need to  absolutely stop this regulation in its tracks. It is time to, once and  for all, let those swamp creatures know that the Second Amendment shall  not be infringed.   Mr. Speaker, thank you to the gentleman from Georgia and my friend,  Mr. Clyde, for hosting this special order on such an important topic.  Most of you have likely heard about the new rule from the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, that targets  stabilizing braces for pistols. The rule wrongly reclassifies these  braces as ``short rifles,'' which are heavily regulated under that  National Firearms Act. The final rule, published yesterday, January  31st started a 120-day clock for law-abiding gunowners to destroy,  forfeit, or register their braces with the ATF. Otherwise, the new  regulation will consider any unregistered stabilizing pistol brace as a  short-barreled rifle and will subject the owner to penalties of up to  10 years of imprisonment, up to a $10,000 fine, or both.   This is insane and it's an infringement on Americans' Second  Amendment rights through bureaucratic rulemaking.   For those who aren't familiar with stabilizing braces, these devices  were originally designed with disabled veterans in mind and have been  on the market for over a decade. Until last year, the ATF repeatedly  stated that stabilizing braces did not convert the handguns into short- barreled rifles. In fact, they claimed going back to 2015 that braces  were an accessory and therefore not subject to jurisdiction of the ATF.  But Now, bureaucrats at the ATF are changing course. By changing this  definition, the ATF is effectively making criminals out of millions of  law-abiding Americans when they do not register by a certain date. The  ATF is reversing over a decade of agency guidance and rulings on which  the firearm industry and law-abiding gun owners have relied for years.  The ATF estimates around three million stabilizing braces have been  sold, however, a report from the Congressional Research Service puts  that number much higher--between 10 million and 40 million.   If you look at just the cost--the cost of this new regulation--a rule  put in place by unelected bureaucrats, this one rule will cost the  firearm industry and gun owners a whopping $1.9 billion! This number  was calculated by using data in NICS and industry data on the average  cost of pistol braced firearms. Make no mistake. This new rule is not  about gun safety. This is not about gun violence. This is a back door  attempt to take down the firearm industry and make millions of law  abiding citizens--felons. We must stop this unconstitutional overreach  by the ATF and we will.   The Second Amendment is straightforward--the right to bears arms  shall not be infringed. We cannot allow the federal government to make  it harder--or impossible--for small business owners, homeowners, and  law-abiding citizens to defend themselves. That is why we must pass the  Joint Resolution of Disapproval for this rule, which prevents it from  going into effect and prohibits the ATF from implementing a similar  rule in the future. In addition, we must pass the SHORT Act, which  would remove the unconstitutional taxation, registration, and  regulation in the National Firearms Act of Short Barreled Rifles, Short  Barreled Shotguns, and those classified as Any Other Weapons.   Finally, this is just another in a very long line of examples of why  we must pass the REINS Act. The REINS Act would prohibit these swamp  creatures--the unelected bureaucratic class from legislating from the  agency rather than through Congress. The bill is simple. Any major rule  or regulation would be required to come back to Congress for an up or  down vote. Why? Because you can fire Your Congress-critter. But the  big, government establishment has made it virtually impossible to fire  these bureaucrats. Once passed, this rule would have never been allowed  to go into effect. It's time to pass the Reins act. Time to pass the  short act and protect our constitutional rights.   I am proud to join Representative Clyde in introducing these bills,  and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the issue here tonight.
