 Madam Speaker, as we close out the  month of February, I want to recognize this month as National African  American History Month. It is a way for our country to remember and  honor African American citizens and events that shaped our Nation's  history.   It is also a chance to reflect on the countless contributions made by  African Americans while many were faced with racial prejudice,  segregation, and slavery. These individuals serve as examples of  patriotism and determination. They have given people of all backgrounds  courage in themselves, faith in their dreams, and hope in others.   The American story is filled with African Americans who forever  changed their communities and our country. We take this month to  celebrate the cultural, scientific, political, and economic  contributions they have made for the betterment of our Nation.  [[Page H2276]]    We learn from the past so together we can build a better future for  all citizens. As we proclaim February as National African American  History Month, let us celebrate their lives, understand their  adversity, and lead by their examples.                            ____________________
