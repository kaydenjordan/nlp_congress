 Mr. President, in May, Jimmy Kimmel shared the story of  his newborn son Billy, who was born with a life-threatening condition  that required open-heart surgery. Kimmel said that he was fortunate to  have had good health coverage and was able to pay for the care that his  son needed, something he believed every American deserved.   A few weeks later, as efforts to repeal ObamaCare were gaining steam,  Senator Bill Cassidy explained that the bar he believed any healthcare  bill had to clear to get his vote was what he called the Jimmy Kimmel  test. He said: ``Will a child born with congenital heart disease be  able to get everything she or he would need in the first year of  life?''   When Kimmel interviewed Senator Cassidy a few days later, Kimmel  explained the test this way: ``No family should be denied medical care,  emergency or otherwise, because they can't afford it.'' Well, I am here  to report that this latest version of TrumpCare, offered by none other  than Senator Cassidy himself, fails the Jimmy Kimmel test miserably.    Over the past few weeks, there have been two ongoing conversations  about the future of healthcare in the United States. The first has been  conducted in an open, bipartisan manner in the Senate Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in full accord with the  traditions of this body. In the HELP Committee, Republicans and  Democrats alike have been talking with Governors, insurance  commissioners, and other experts on ways to address concerns of States  and consumers by stabilizing the individual market and lowering premium  costs. That is how the Senate is supposed to work, and the bill that  emerges from that process will be one that makes things better, not  worse. It will create certainty. It will bring down costs for  consumers. It is a bill that any Senator should be proud to vote for.   The second conversation is a model of how things shouldn't work. It  has occurred behind closed doors between Senate Republicans and party  operatives. It is not about making the system work; it is about passing  something--anything that can be said to repeal and replace the  Affordable Care Act, and along the way, it destroys the Medicaid  Program as we know it. As many of us have argued before, this  conversation is an affront to the traditions of this body and, more  importantly, to the will of the American people.   I urge my Republican colleagues to oppose the Graham-Cassidy bill-- the newest iteration of TrumpCare--which will rip healthcare coverage  from tens of millions of people, create higher  [[Page S5845]]  costs for consumers, and ensure the destabilization of the individual  health insurance market.   While I have worked closely with Senators Cassidy and Graham on other  bills, and I respect them, I have grave concerns with this legislation.   First, the bill undermines protections for people with preexisting  conditions.   States could apply for waivers that would allow them to charge people  more based on their health status, age, or any other factor other than  race or ethnicity. This means premiums would be higher just for being  older or sicker or having had an illness in the past. In other words,  there would be no protection for people with preexisting conditions.   Additionally, States can also seek waivers to remove the ACA's  essential health benefit requirements, which mandate that insurers that  are offering plans on the exchanges include coverage for vital  services, such as prescription drugs, maternity care, mental health,  and substance use disorder services.   While the bill technically requires States to describe--just simply  describe--how they will ``maintain access to adequate and affordable  health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions,'' there is  no definition of what that means, and there are no enforcement  mechanisms. Insurers would still be able to charge people with  preexisting conditions more for their care or exclude services  altogether. Under this plan, millions of people with preexisting  conditions could face much higher costs, if they can get coverage at  all. Again, this bill rips away protections for people with preexisting  conditions.   Second, the bill would undoubtedly reverse the significant coverage  gains we have seen in recent years and drive up the number of Americans  without health insurance.   The Graham-Cassidy proposal eliminates the ACA's premium subsidies,  eliminates the Medicaid expansion, eliminates cost-sharing reduction  payments, and more. Instead of funding these critical aspects of the  ACA, the bill would return some but not all of this funding to the  States in the form of block grants, which are authorized in this bill  from 2020 to 2026.   The bill also proposes to dramatically reduce funds for States that  have expanded Medicaid and have successfully enrolled more adults in  ACA exchanges--States like Minnesota. Instead of incentivizing success,  the bill will reward failure, initially increasing funds for States  that refuse to expand Medicaid and have done little to encourage  enrollment. But even these States lose out in the end. In fact, the  funding stops completely after 2026, resulting in enormous losses for  every State, and even prior to 2026, the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities estimates, most States will receive significantly less  funding from the Federal Government under this block grant than they do  under current law. Minnesota could lose $2.7 billion. Other Senators  who have expressed various levels of concern with this legislation  could see their States lose significant sums. Those include Arizona,  which would lose $1.6 billion; Alaska, $255 million; Maine, $115  million; Colorado, $823 million; and the list goes on. Healthcare isn't  free. These shortfalls will mean that families don't get the services  they need.   On top of all that, the Graham-Cassidy proposal caps and cuts  Medicaid--a program that provides coverage to seniors, families with  children, and people with disabilities. In Minnesota alone, that is 1.2  million people facing cuts to their benefits or losing coverage  altogether.   I believe many of us truly want to help our constituents access the  care they need. As I have said before, the ACA is far from perfect, but  it has resulted in significant improvements in millions of people's  lives.   I have heard from countless Minnesotans who have literally had their  lives or the life of a loved one saved by the ACA--the same way that  Billy Kimmel's life was saved by the treatment he was able to receive  at the beginning of his life. Take Leanna, for example. Leanna's 3- year-old son, Henry, has been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic  leukemia. His treatment will last until April of 2018. He often needs  round-the-clock care to manage his nausea, vomiting, pain, and  sleepless nights--a 3-year-old.   Henry's immune system is so compromised that he is not supposed to go  to daycare, so Leanna left her job to care for him. Leanna and Henry  are supported by her spouse, but they couldn't pay for Henry's  treatment on one salary.   Leanna says:         It is because of the ACA that Henry gets proper healthcare.       Henry can get therapy and the things he needs to maintain his       health and work towards beating cancer. Henry is still with       us because of the ACA.    Let me say that again: Three-year-old Henry is still with us because  of the ACA.   Consider Maria's story. Maria enrolled in Minnesota's Medicaid  Program after finishing her graduate degree and while looking for full- time employment. Maria was grateful for the coverage because she needed  access to treatments for her endometriosis, which was diagnosed a few  years prior while she had insurance through her employer.   Soon, Maria found her dream job, but it came with a catch: no health  insurance. Days before she was set to move and start work, she decided  to go in for one last big checkup. The results were unnerving. At the  age of 35, Maria was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. Maria had  to give up her job offer and aggressively pursue treatment for the  cancer.   Fortunately, because Minnesota had expanded Medicaid, all of Maria's  treatments were covered, and lucky for her, they worked. Maria's cancer  is in remission. Maria said: ``The Medicaid expansion of the ACA  literally saved my life.'' She told me that anyone could find  themselves on Medicaid. She said: ``Without that comprehensive,  affordable, accessible health insurance, I wouldn't be here.''   But now that all of these programs are in jeopardy, my constituents  are generally scared. They have come to me in tears, explaining that if  the Affordable Care Act is repealed or if draconian changes and cuts to  Medicaid go through, they don't know how they will care for their  elderly parents, keep their rural hospital open, or afford treatments  they or their children need.   I believe it is legislative malpractice to pass partisan legislation  that would undermine this progress, people's economic security, and  their livelihood, all to achieve a destructive political end--to do it  without holding thorough hearings in the committees of jurisdiction,  without hearing from experts, and without a complete assessment from  the Congressional Budget Office on how this legislation would affect  the American people.   I urge my Republican colleagues to once again abandon their efforts  to ram through dangerous legislation that would fundamentally  restructure our healthcare system. This new iteration of TrumpCare  fails the Jimmy Kimmel test. It is the result of a horrible process  that is not worthy of this body.   We have a better option. Over the past few weeks, Chairman Alexander  and Ranking Member Murray have held four bipartisan hearings on  individual health insurance market reforms and are working to forge a  legislative compromise to reduce premiums for consumers. We have heard  from Governors, we have heard from insurance commissioners, and we have  heard from experts--all of whom span the ideological spectrum. This is  what regular order looks like, and this is the way the Senate is  supposed to work.   I have worked with all of my colleagues on this committee in good  faith, and I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish so far,  but all of that work is in jeopardy because of a destructive, partisan,  last-ditch effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and end the  Medicaid Program as we know it.   Do not shortchange those important legislative developments. Do not  shortchange the American people. Think of the millions of children and  families who need our help right now. Oppose TrumpCare, and, instead,  let's work to improve care, lower costs, and ensure access to  healthcare when people need it the most. It is within our reach.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
