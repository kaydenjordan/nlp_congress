 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Riverside County  Sheriff's Department Sergeant Juan Zamora and celebrate his decades- long career. Sergeant Zamora is a devoted public servant, a great  father, a caring husband, and my good friend.   We both grew up in the Coachella Valley; we both graduated from  Coachella Valley High School; and we are both the proud sons of  farmworkers. In fact, it is in the fields where Sergeant Zamora gained  an appreciation for honest, hard work, and it is that very same  appreciation that fueled his desire to serve his community and drove  him to become the first in his family to go to college.   In 1997, he joined the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, rising  through the ranks and serving as public information officer before his  appointment to sheriff's sergeant in 2010. As the recipient of the  Lifesaving Award and the Unit Citation Award, he has received  recognition for all that he has done to protect and inspire our  community.   I thank Sergeant Zamora for his years of service. I wish him a long  and happy retirement filled with many more fond memories and plenty of  that barbecue shrimp he loves.   I am proud of him; our community is proud of him; and I know that  Carmen, Matthew, and Nicholas are proud of him, too.                            ____________________
