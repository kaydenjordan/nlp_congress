 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from the State of  Missouri. Working with Senator Blunt, my cochair of the Law Enforcement  Caucus, has been a terrific experience. We have had the opportunity  over several years and several Congresses now for more than a dozen  conversations, where we invite law enforcement leaders from around the  country to talk about partnership between Federal, State, and local law  enforcement, intelligence sharing, equipment issues, policy and  operational issues to allow us to provide needed support for the men  and women of law enforcement.   It is my honor to join with several of my colleagues today to  recognize the men and women of law enforcement as part of National  Police Week. Together, we offer our gratitude and our support to the  men and women of law enforcement and their families, who together  support our communities.   It is only May, and yet my home State of Delaware has already been  reminded of the tremendous risks and great sacrifices made by law  enforcement officers and their families.   In February of this year, Lieutenant Steven Floyd of the Delaware  Department of Correction was killed on the job in a prison riot in  Smyrna, the Delaware correctional center. He was a 16-year veteran of  the department and left behind his wife of 28 years, Saundra; his  children, Candyss, Steven, Jr., and Chyvante; and two grandsons.   Just last month, Corporal Stephen Ballard of the Delaware State  Police was senselessly gunned down while investigating a suspicious  vehicle. Corporal Ballard had served with the Delaware State Police for  8\1/2\ years and left behind his wife Louise and his daughter Abigail.   Delawareans are still grieving for the loss of both of these brave  men in the line of duty.   As we recognize the entire law enforcement community from across our  country during National Police Week, we should honor their sacrifice by  serving them as well as they serve us. This week and every week, we  must do everything we can to honor our obligations to fallen heroes and  their families.   In the wake of these losses in Delaware, I am committed to continuing  to  [[Page S2946]]  work with my colleagues across the aisle and across the country, like  Senators Klobuchar, Cornyn, and Senator Blunt, to make sure our  officers have the resources they deserve to do their jobs and to come  home safely at the end of every shift. That means continuing to  champion programs like the Bulletproof Vest Partnership, which  literally saves officers' lives. Delaware knows the importance of this  long-running program all too well. Two of our Delaware Capitol Police  officers who were shot in the line of duty survived due to bulletproof  vests provided through this vital and ongoing Federal-State  partnership.   I will also continue to work here in the Senate with colleagues to  reform the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program to make sure the  families of officers who lose their lives or are permanently disabled  in the line of duty receive the benefits they deserve.   Chairman Grassley, who has joined us here on the floor, is one of the  lead cosponsors of this bill, along with Senators Hatch, Gillibrand,  and Klobuchar--is one of many cosponsors. This is a bill that will take  important steps in these reforms, and it is just one step away from  passing the Senate, and my understanding is it could head to the House  of Representatives as early as later today.   Of course, our commitment to serving the men and women of law  enforcement has to extend beyond the patrol car and the police station.  Building and maintaining trust between law enforcement and the  communities they serve is essential to preventing and reducing crime  and keeping officers safe. That is why Senator Blunt and I have both  taken steps to encourage the strategy of community policing, which  helps officers do their job more effectively in partnership with local  communities. We have also continued to support local officials who are  working to bring Federal resources, expertise, and convening power to  help strengthen the bonds between the police and the communities they  serve.   In light of all these important efforts, we can't let ideology or  partisan politics in this Chamber prevent us from doing our job in  support of law enforcement. We will fail those who serve us if we do  so. We have to move forward in a bipartisan way to improve and invest  in officer safety. That is why I am proud to stand with my colleague  and partner from Missouri as cochairs of the Law Enforcement Caucus.  The mission of this bipartisan group of Senators is simple: to bring  law enforcement, community leaders, issue experts, and Republicans and  Democrats together to share ideas and generate solutions to challenges  facing State and local law enforcement. We have hosted more than a  dozen briefings and events.   Now more than ever, Senator Blunt and I are committed to this  mission. We are on the floor today to honor women and men, like  Corporal Ballard and Lieutenant Floyd from Delaware, who put on the  uniform and the badge every day, not knowing whether they will come  home at the end of their shift. We are here today for their families,  whose sacrifice and burden are heavy.   When I attended Corporal Ballard's moving memorial service earlier  this month, the most powerful speaker among many was his widow, Louise.  She stood up, stood tall, and with a smile on her face thanked the  3,000 officers from 36 States across the country who had come to stand  in solemn procession and honor Corporal Ballard's sacrifice and pay  their respects.   Louise Ballard said:         This is my Stephen's victory, when I get to see men and       women from all over the country who every single day get up       and do a job. A job that's hard, a job that requires heart.    Few jobs are as hard or require as much heart as patrolling the  streets and protecting our communities.   This week, together we honor the service and sacrifice of those law  enforcement officers whose names have been added to the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial this year and the hundreds of thousands,  even millions, who even today, even tonight, will be on patrol keeping  our communities and our families safe.   Mr. President, I yield to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary  Committee, my colleague from Iowa and partner in legislating in the  interest of law enforcement.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.    Mr. President, in conclusion, I thank my colleagues,  Senators Klobuchar, Grassley, Cornyn, and Blunt, for joining us today  in a colloquy on the floor. It is a small but important gesture of  bipartisan support, sustained and long-lasting bipartisan support for  the community of law enforcement that serves each of us and our  communities every day.   I wish to yield to my friend Senator Blunt for his closing remarks.
