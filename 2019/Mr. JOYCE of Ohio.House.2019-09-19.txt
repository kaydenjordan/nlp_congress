 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill,  despite my disappointment that a continuing resolution is necessary at  this point in time.   The alternative is a government shutdown, which would only serve to  hurt the American people by depriving them of critical services, not to  mention wasting their money.   For example, this bill continues the environmental reviews in  permitting that are necessary for economic and energy development. This  bill also guarantees that our beloved national parks, forests, wildlife  refuges, and other public lands stay open for business, especially for  those who depend on tourism and those who have already booked visits  for the upcoming holidays.   This bill continues the flow of funding critical to all the  communities working to upgrade their infrastructure so that citizens  can continue to have access to clean and safe water.   This bill ensures that our Nation will continue to meet its moral and  legal obligations to sovereign American Indian and Alaska Native  Tribes, whose ancestors paid in advance with their lives and their  lands for peace and the promise of basic services like education,  public safety, and access to healthcare.   For these reasons and more, I support this bill, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. There is so much  more upon which we agree than disagree.   Let us act on what we agree upon so that our constituents can  continue their daily lives without interruption. This bill continues  the operation of programs upon which we already agreed only 7 months  ago. Vote ``yes.''   I thank the ranking member for yielding me this time.
