 HICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from  Wyoming.   Madam Speaker, regardless of attempts from the other side to distract  and derail what we are discussing, the vote today is on the permanent  application of the Hyde amendment, which would ban taxpayer dollars  from being used for abortion.   The truth is that taxpayers get up and go to work every day. They  work by the sweat of their brow. The majority of them find the practice  of abortion to be a serious violation of their personal beliefs. Under  that situation and scenario, it is unconscionable that this body would  even consider taking the money of those hardworking taxpayers and using  their money to fund abortion.   The Hyde amendment has traditionally maintained bipartisan support.  It has been signed into law by both Democratic and Republican  Presidents since 1976. In addition to that, the Supreme Court has  upheld the law, doing so in 1980, ruling that, regardless of the  freedom recognized in Roe v. Wade to terminate a pregnancy, there is  not a constitutional entitlement to use taxpayer money to finance such  an act.   The Hyde amendment has saved the lives of roughly 300,000 unborn  children annually. It is bipartisan, it has been upheld by the Supreme  Court, and it protects taxpayers who have a conscientious objection. So  I strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support H.R. 7 when it comes before the full House for a vote today.     HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my  good friend, Chris Smith, for his leadership for so many years on this  issue of life. He is deeply loved and appreciated, and I am grateful to  be able to share this time with him as well.   Mr. Speaker, I am sure it has been said this evening already many  times over that since the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973, we have lost  over 50 million lives. That is such a staggering number, but within  that number, of course, are mothers, daughters, fathers, sons, all of  them lost to abortion.   This decision of Roe v. Wade, at the crux of the matter, is one that  has the question: When does life begin?   And with that question, I was reminded of the opinion of the Supreme  Court Justice Blackmun. During that period of time when Roe v. Wade  came into law, Blackmun made the decision and wrote in his opinion. He  said: ``We, the Court, need not resolve the difficult question of when  life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of  medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any  consensus, the judiciary,'' he said, ``at this point in the development  of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the  answer.''   What a startling statement that was made. But here we are at this  time, this body, at this point of our Nation's history, we have no need  as to speculate on this question any longer. There is clear science  that, without question, tells us when life begins. And life begins at  conception. There is no question about this.   We know inside the womb is a human life. And we know with that life,  based on what we know of God and what we in our own country know from  our own Declaration of Independence, the very first inalienable right  protected is that of life.                                time  1815    So I just believe it is time that we correct this wrongheaded  decision that was made by the Court some 44 years ago. Even just  recently, a couple of days ago, I introduced H.R. 586, the Sanctity of  Human Life Act, which makes clear that life begins at conception. I  certainly would ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill.   I just dream of the time, 44 years from now, that we could be  celebrating the right to life rather than 44 years from now looking  back and mourning over yet another 50 million American babies who have  been lost to the horrible stain of abortion. So, again, I thank you for  your leadership, and I deeply appreciate the opportunity to join you in  this Special Order.
