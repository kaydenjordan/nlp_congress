 Madam Speaker, over 7 million American men, women,  and children depend on insulin to keep themselves alive; but, between  2012 and 2016, the price of insulin nearly doubled, forcing many of  these Americans to ration this lifesaving drug.   It is unacceptable.   What we hear over and over again from big pharmaceutical companies is  that these price hikes are necessary to pay for new research. But  insulin isn't new. The first patent for insulin came out in 1923-- almost 100 years ago.   The simple truth is that the drug companies keep hiking their prices  on us because they can get away with it. As a result, Americans are  made to suffer and make impossible sacrifices while the same drugs get  sold in foreign countries for much cheaper.   That is why I am proud to support the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, smart  legislation which would allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices  for American citizens.                            ____________________
