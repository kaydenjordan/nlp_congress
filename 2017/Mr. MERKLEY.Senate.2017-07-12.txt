 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the most important three words in our  Constitution are the first three words: ``We the People.''   Our Founders chose to write those words in supersized font so that we  could, from some distance away, know exactly what the mission statement  was. Their goal wasn't to write a structure for government that would  repeat the governments of, by, and for the powerful of Europe but to  pursue differently a vision in which the will of the people would be  enacted; that government would work not just for the benefit of the  citizens at large but also empowered by the citizens at large. This is  a vision we have been very concerned about as we see the influence of  the concentration of money in American politics.   Indeed, we have five members of the Supreme Court who don't  understand the basic, fundamental nature of the first three words of  our Constitution. They adopted a court case, Citizens United, which was  the opposite of the vision of our Constitution. That vision was  articulated by Thomas Jefferson, who said that the will of the people  will be enacted only if each and every citizen has an equal voice. But  Citizens United gives a dramatic, stadium-sized megaphone to the  individuals who are the richest and most powerful in the country, at  odds with that fundamental vision that Lincoln so well summarized as  government of, by, and for the people.   We have certainly seen the case of government by and for the powerful  in the context of the recent TrumpCare bill--the Senate version  thereof--crafted in secret by 13 of my colleagues from across the  aisle, hiding from the press, hiding from the healthcare stakeholders  and experts, hiding from their own citizens. In fact, during this last  break, of the 52 Members of the Republican caucus, apparently-- reportedly--only a couple had townhalls because they were terrified of  what their citizens would say about the bill they have been crafting in  secret--the secret 13.   This bill is also known as the zero, zero, zero bill--zero committee  meetings, zero amendments considered in committee, zero months of  opportunity for Senators to go back and consult with their citizens  back in their home States.   Then what do we find as a result of this secret process of government  by and for the powerful? A bill to rip healthcare from 22 million  Americans in order to deliver hundreds of billions of dollars to the  richest Americans. In fact, if you want to summarize it, you can say  that this bill gives $33 billion--not $33,000, not $33 million but $33  billion--to the richest 400 Americans while ripping healthcare away  from 700,000. That is the number who could be funded by that same $33  billion. That would cover all of the Medicaid recipients in Alaska and  Arkansas and West Virginia and Nevada. This has incredibly grave  consequences for the peace of mind and the quality of life for these  millions of Americans. It rips $772 billion out of Medicaid.   We know the Medicaid expansion in Oregon has enabled 400,000 people  to acquire healthcare in my home State--400,000. If they were holding  hands, they would stretch from the Pacific Ocean to the State of Idaho,  across the entire east-west breadth of my State.   Think about how much of an impact this has on rural Americans. One  out of three Oregonians in rural Oregon are on the Oregon Health Plan,  Oregon's Medicaid Program. It has a big impact on our seniors--our  seniors in long-term care.   Oregon is a leader in helping families, helping individuals stay in  their homes as their healthcare deteriorates. But when they can no  longer stay in their home because of the extensive nature of their  care, many then are, through Medicaid, able to go and get care--long- term care--in a nursing home. That long-term care, paid for by the  Oregon Health Plan, covers about 60 percent of the individuals in long- term care, but in rural Oregon, it is much higher.   I was in Klamath Falls at a nursing home. I was citing the national  statistic, 60 percent, and the head of the nursing home said: Senator,  here, it is virtually 100 percent.   I looked at those residents down that long hallway who needed  intensive nursing healthcare, and one woman asked why I was there. Her  name was Deborah. When I explained it, she said: I am paid for by  Medicaid. If Medicaid goes away, I am out on the street. That is a  problem because I can't walk.   It is not just a problem for Deborah. It is a problem for all of our  residents in long-term care who need extensive nursing care. It is a  challenge. It is a real challenge. It is a real problem for our  mothers. One out of three women in maternity care are paid for by  Medicaid. Don't we want our children to get a good, strong start in  life? Don't we want maternity care from the moment a woman knows she is  expecting a child? Don't we want that? Then why do so many of my  colleagues support a bill to tear that care away from our expecting  mothers?   It is a problem for our older Americans, our older Americans whose  rates would go way up. For example, a man who is 60 years old, earning  $20,000 a year, who currently pays about $80 a month for healthcare--an  affordable policy. Under the Republican TrumpCare bill, that would go  to $570 a month.   I challenge my colleagues, find me someone earning $20,000 a year who  can pay $570 a month for healthcare. Find that individual and defend  your plan on the floor of the Senate as to why that isn't equivalent to  just taking healthcare away from that individual.   Then, of course, we have the issue of preexisting conditions. People  sometimes have an injury in high school football or maybe it is in  softball or gymnastics or in wrestling that they carry with them their  entire lives. Maybe it is something that develops further on in life.  Maybe it is asthma, diabetes, or an episode of cancer. Now they have a  preexisting condition. Under our old healthcare system, prior to 2009,  2010, they couldn't acquire insurance unless they were fortunate enough  to get it through that job, which millions of Americans do not get it  through their workplace. They were out in the cold, out on the ice.   Now we have this Republican TrumpCare bill. They want to throw those  citizens back on the ice who have preexisting conditions, not their  friends who are wealthy enough to buy healthcare on their own or heads  of corporations who get big benefit packages--not them, no, just the  struggling working Americans.   Don't we care about struggling working Americans? Aren't we a ``we  the people'' nation, not a ``we the privileged'' nation? I encourage my  colleagues to read up on the first three words of our Constitution and  what it means.   Then we have the plan my colleague from Texas has presented. It is  referred to as the Cruz amendment. The Cruz amendment--the Cruz  amendment for fake insurance. It works like this. It says, if an  insurance company provides one policy with extensive benefits--that is,  benefits essential to ordinary healthcare like maternity care and the  ability to go to a hospital, the ability to get a broken bone repaired,  the ability to get affordable drugs, just the basics of healthcare-- they have one policy with these essential benefits. They can offer  policies that cover virtually nothing. These are known as fake  insurance.   We have a President who likes to talk about fake news virtually every  day. Why do we have a President who  [[Page S3941]]  hates fake news but loves fake insurance? Why do I have 52 colleagues  here who apparently love fake insurance?   Here is what it does. It means the young and the healthy get those  policies because they cost very little, and they make a bet that they  aren't going to get hurt and they are not going to get sick. That means  that those who are older and those who have preexisting conditions have  to go for the policy that has those essential benefits, but now because  only the older individuals and the sicker individuals are getting that  policy, it is way beyond reach.   Earlier I described how a 60-year-old at $20,000 has a policy that  increases seven times, from $80 a month to $570 a month. The Cruz  amendment would make that much worse. It makes fake insurance for the  young or the wealthy and unaffordable policies for those who are older  and have preexisting conditions.   Our President said the House bill is mean, but the Senate bill is  meaner. The House bill would knock 14 million people out of healthcare  within a single year. The Senate bill, that is 15 million people.   The American Medical Association has long operated under the precept  of, first, do no harm. Wouldn't that be a good principle for  legislation on healthcare? Is it any wonder that the USA TODAY poll  says only one out of eight Americans likes this Republican TrumpCare  bill. We can turn to the PBS NewsHour poll, 17 percent. That is quite a  small number of Americans who understand that ripping healthcare from  22 million people in order to give hundreds of billions of dollars to  the richest Americans is one of the biggest takings this country has  ever seen proposed and one that so deeply and profoundly damages the  quality of life for these Americans.   Our Presidents--Republican and Democratic--over time have understood  this. President Eisenhower said:         Because the strength of our nation is in its people, their       good health is a proper national concern; healthy Americans       live more rewarding, more productive and happier lives.    He continued:         Fortunately, the nation continues its advance in bettering       the health of all its people.    Today, on the floor of the Senate, we have a different philosophy,  not the Eisenhower strategy of advancing the bettering of the health of  all of our people but in fact the Trump policy echoed by so many of my  colleagues that is about destroying the healthcare for millions of  people, taking us back in time to a place where peace of mind was  missing for millions of Americans because they couldn't either afford  healthcare or because their policies didn't cover anything. Other  Presidents over time have weighed in with very similar sentiments to  that which President Eisenhower put forward.   Let's hear it from the citizens back home. Kathryn, from Springfield,  has battled cancer three times over the last 12 years. Kathryn says  that during her last two bouts with cancer, in 2010 and 2011, she was  ``blessed enough to have qualified for the Oregon Health Plan'' and  that without it she would not be here today.   Indeed, healthcare coverage has been a blessing to so many. Let's not  rip those blessings away.   Let's go to Beth in Bend and her 34-year-old son who is living with a  rare genetic condition and relies on the Oregon Health Plan to survive.  In 2012, doctors found tumors along his spine and areas of concern in  his brain and his lungs. They are benign now but could turn into cancer  at any time. Beth's son's life depends on regular, expensive MRIs to  monitor them. He is only able to afford those MRIs because of the  Oregon health plan.    As Beth says, ``If the ACA is repealed and replaced with TrumpCare,  my son will most likely lose his current health insurance . . . the  loss of access to affordable insurance is a potential death sentence  for my son.''   Medical professionals like Caitlin, a nurse in Portland, tell us how  significant this is, and she writes:         With the passage of ObamaCare, I saw people were finally       able to come and be seen by our medical teams. Often their       disease processes were so advanced that we would have to take       very extreme measures to try to halt or reverse these disease       processes.        But as time has passed, we're able to catch things sooner       and people can actually go to primary care rather than       waiting until it's a matter of life or death and having to be       seen in the Emergency Department.    I am struck by Liz from Enterprise, who works at a clinic and told me  that the clinic has expanded in this very small, remote town in  Northeast Oregon from 20-something employees to 50-something employees.  It has doubled in size, which means an incredible improvement in  healthcare. She went on to say that they have been able to take on  mental health as well, which they never were able to do before. Why  could they afford to do this? Because the uncompensated care dropped so  dramatically that their finances improved, and they were able to hire  more staff.   Let's ask about John in Sherwood. John wrote about his grandmother.  He lost his grandmother to Alzheimer's a few months ago, but thanks to  the Oregon Health Plan, his grandmother was able to live in a nursing  home and get the care she needed 24 hours a day right up until the end.   As John says, ``I'm forever thankful for the work of President Obama  and Congress for passing the ACA. If they wouldn't have passed this  bill, my grandmother wouldn't have gotten the care she needed from  those great men and women at the nursing home.''   These stories go on forever. Over this last weekend, I did a series  of townhalls in rural Oregon, parts of Oregon that would be painted red  on a political map. I held those townhalls and then went to a series of  other Main Street walks with mayors and small incorporated cities. What  I heard everywhere I went--inviting the entire community to come to the  townhall and talk--was enormous anxiety, enormous anxiety and  disappointment that the leaders they are counting on here to make our  healthcare system work better care more about giving more American tax  dollars away to the richest Americans than they do about fundamental  healthcare for struggling working families across our Nation.   Let's listen to those individuals. I know most of my colleagues  didn't go home and listen to their constituents. As I mentioned, it has  been reported that only a couple of my Republican colleagues held a  townhall, even though this bill would affect them so profoundly. Still,  their voices are echoing through this building, through the emails,  through the phone calls, through the individuals who are coming and  visiting our offices both here and back home. Let's listen to those  voices. Let's be a ``we the people'' nation that works in partnership  with the American people to make this world, this Nation, provide a  foundation for every family to thrive.   That means we have to take an oak stick and pound it through the  heart of TrumpCare and bury it 6 feet under and then work together in a  bipartisan fashion. Think of all we could do. We know that when you  strip away reinsurance, you destroy the market for insurance companies  to go into new areas and compete. Let's restore that reinsurance.   We know that when the President holds on to the cost-share payments  and will not say whether he is releasing them, our companies don't know  how to price their policies, and they are dropping out of the exchanges  across this Nation. County after county health insurance companies are  fleeing because the President will not tell them whether he is  releasing these cost-share payments. We can fix that.   We know we have a meth and opioid epidemic across this country. I  have heard my colleagues on both sides say we have to take this on in a  more courageous, more substantial fashion. We passed authorizing  legislation, but let's put funds behind that. Let's do that, and let's  take on the high cost of pharmaceuticals.   These four things we can do together. The country would love to see  Democrats and Republicans working together to make our healthcare  system work better. That is exactly what we should be doing in  representing the citizens of the United States of America in a ``we the  people'' democratic republic.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Thomas Adamson, be granted privileges of the floor for the remainder of  the day.
