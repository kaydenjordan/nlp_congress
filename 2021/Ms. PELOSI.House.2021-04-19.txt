 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his very moving and profound statement on democracy and democratic  freedoms in Hong Kong. I thank the chairman for his leadership for  bringing this important legislation to the floor. I thank the ranking  member, Mr. McCaul, for his leadership, as well, on an ongoing basis on  this important issue and for his courtesy for yielding back.   It is always an honor to be with Chris Smith, we have been working on  these issues together for 30 years--a very long time--to demonstrate  the bipartisan nature of the support that we have for democratic  freedoms in Hong Kong, in the House, and in the Senate, bicameral and  bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, Friday was a sad day and a disturbing day for the people  of Hong Kong and for all freedom-loving people as sentences were handed  down to Martin Lee, a global champion of human rights, and to other  pro-democracy leaders for engaging in peaceful protests.   This afternoon, 3 days after that distressing development, I had the  privilege to speak with activists from the Hong Kong Democracy Council.  It was an inspiration to hear how they and the people of Hong Kong are  responding to China's crackdown with great courage; how the dream of  real autonomy cannot be extinguished by injustice or intimidation.   In our conversation earlier today--and in all my communications with  Hong Kongers--they asked that the United States Congress continue to  speak out to support their aspirations for the freedoms that they were  promised. We were there when they promised them.   Today, with this resolution, Congress is honoring that call. I thank  Chairman Meeks, Ranking Member McCaul, again, Representatives Bera and  Malinowski, and the distinguished chair of the China Executive  Commission, Mr. McGovern, for their work on this important legislation.   H. Res. 130 condemns the continued violation of rights and freedoms  of the people of Hong Kong by the People's Republic of China and the  Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.   It states that Communist China continues to ``disregard its  international legal obligations under the joint declaration'' which  mandates, among other pledges, that ``Hong Kong would enjoy a high  degree of autonomy'' and ``the personal rights and freedoms of the  people of Hong Kong would be protected by law.''   This resolution today makes clear that China has trampled on its  promises, including its draconian so-called national security law used  to target and round up peaceful protesters under the guise of  terrorism; disqualification of pro-democracy candidates from  participating in the September 6 legislative council elections; the  indictments and arrests for six Hong Kong activists living overseas--as  the distinguished chairman pointed out, including here in the United  States--and the arrests and sentencing of dozens of pro-democracy  activists, including, as was mentioned, Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, and  Ivan Lam--and opposition leaders, the Hong Kong 12, of this past  December and January. Again, I mention Martin Lee.   The United States Congress has always supported Hong Kong on a  bipartisan and bicameral basis, and we remain laser-focused on efforts  to support Hong Kong's efforts to maintain and grow the rule of law and  freedom of speech in their home, and we are determined to hold China  accountable.   Our response must include further strengthening our work with  international coalitions--this has to be multilateral--passing  legislation in addition to this resolution, to support Hong Kong,  building on the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act  in 2019.   Our legislative response must also address the plight of the Uighurs  and Tibetans and the violation of their rights in China; and we must  continue to use our platform to speak out about Beijing's crackdown on  the global stage and ensure that the voices that the Chinese Government  are trying to silence are heard.   In response, our focus must be on human rights. As I always say, if  we do not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial  interests, then we lose all moral authority to speak out on human  rights anywhere in the world.   That is what I have been stating and fighting for--as we have  together--since 1991 when I went to Tiananmen Square and unfurled a  black-and-white banner reading: To those who died for democracy.   Ever since, many of us have fought to ensure that human rights and  trade are firmly linked, from sponsoring the U.S.-China Act in 1993 and  in 1994 urging Congress to deny China most-favored nation status to  goods made by the PLA in the prisons.   Mr. Smith and Mr. Frank Wolf went there and saw the evidence of  prison labor goods being sent to the U.S. and corporate America just  ignoring the whole thing.   Then in 2000 we fought efforts to give China a blank check when it  failed to comply with its market commitment under the WTO, and they  still continue to do that.  [[Page H1929]]    We cannot allow economic interests to blind us to moral injustices  committed by China.   On Friday in a speech to court, the storied Hong Kong attorney,  Margaret Ng, quoted Sir Thomas More, the patron saint of the legal  profession, who was tried for treason because he would not bend the law  to the king's will. Margaret Ng ended her statement by paraphrasing his  final, famous words:         I stand the law's good servant, but the people's first. For       the law must serve the people, not the people the law.    With that, I support an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote for this  resolution and for the Congress' continued bipartisan and bicameral  work to support the people of Hong Kong in the face of Beijing's  exploitation of and assault on the law. It is a very important piece of  legislation, and I am so glad it is going to have bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote, and I thank the chair and the  ranking member of the committee for their leadership.
