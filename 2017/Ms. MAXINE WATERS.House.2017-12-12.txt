 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is strongly opposed by all of the consumer  groups: Americans for Financial Reform, Center for American Progress,  Center for Responsible Lending, the National Consumer Law Center, and  Public Citizen.   Why are they so opposed to this bill? This bill would, again, amend  the Truth in Lending Act--that is TILA--and the Real Estate Settlement  Procedures Act--that is RESPA--to widen the size of two exemptions that  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has already provided for  smaller sized institutions on escrow accounts for higher priced  mortgage loans and servicing requirements for small mortgage servicers.   Under the bill, escrow accounts would no longer be required for  riskier, high-priced loans at institutions with less than $25 billion  in assets. Currently, the exemption applies to firms with less than $2  billion in assets. The smaller service exception for increased  notification requirements to consumers would be increased, again, from  servicers with 5,000 loans to those with 30,000 loans.   Why do all of these consumer groups oppose this legislation? Because  it is obvious what is happening here. We are taking away the protection  from those who need it the most. We are not doing anything for  community banks. There are no $25 billion community banks.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues in this House oppose this  bill. It goes in the opposite direction of what we have done to try and  give protection to those consumers who need protection the most, and  the Dodd-Frank reform has done this, and I would just ask opposition to  this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
