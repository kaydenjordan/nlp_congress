 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Dwyer for nearly 20 years of exceptional  service to our country.   Lieutenant Colonel Dwyer started his career in the military as a  Special Forces officer, where he was deployed to Afghanistan on three  separate operations.   In 2006, during his third deployment, he was critically injured by a  grenade, losing both his left hand and his left eye. This incident only  fueled his desire to fight for his Nation.   Through his ongoing perseverance, he rose through the ranks to become  commander of Hunter Army Airfield in the First Congressional District  of Georgia. With Lieutenant Colonel Dwyer as head of Hunter Army  Airfield, the installation won the Army Community of Excellence Award  for 2019, which recognizes bases for troop morale, soldier readiness,  innovation, community involvement, and more.   Lieutenant Colonel Dwyer passed the baton to Lieutenant Colonel  Escobar to command Hunter Army Airfield on June 13.   Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel Dwyer for all of your hard work at  Hunter and for making this an installation that everyone in the First  Congressional District of Georgia can be proud of.                            ____________________
