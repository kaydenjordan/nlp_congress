 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan  national commission to investigate the January 6 siege on the Capitol.   I was in this Chamber that day. I took cover in the gallery as police  barred the door and drew their guns. I escaped with my colleagues to  watch from a secure location to watch the last vestiges of the attack  play out. I was proud to return to this Chamber that night to complete  our constitutional duty.   The events that transpired on January 6 on these grounds were not  just an attack on the building and the people who work here. It was an  effort to undermine our democracy and steal an election.   The immediate threat to the Capitol was repelled, but the threat to  our democracy remains. Every American who believes our Constitution is  the bedrock of our Nation should demand this commission, demand that we  understand what conditions led up to and enabled the January 6  insurrection, and ensure that nothing like it happens again.    It is now up to the Senate to pass the bill for the good of our  country. If not, the House must be prepared to proceed on its own.                            ____________________
