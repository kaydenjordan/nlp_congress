 ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the resolution.   As a ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have  heard a lot of misinformation about the Department of Education's  borrower defense rule and its effects on student veterans.   Here is the truth: The rule does not limit the rights or benefits  provided for veterans in the GI bill or servicemembers who use the  Department of Defense's Tuition Assistance Program, or the TAP program.  Any veteran or servicemember who is defrauded by an institution and  took out Federal loans, will have the opportunity to have that claim  fairly adjudicated, just like any other student would under the rule.    When I was chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in 2017, I  offered the Forever GI bill to make more veterans eligible to receive a  GI bill benefit and make veterans eligible to receive this valuable  benefit for life.   Mr. Speaker, 45 years ago, this Army veteran, when he left the Army,  used the GI bill. I know how valuable it is, personally, Mr. Speaker.  It helped me and my family tremendously, and that is why we wanted to  make this benefit a lifetime benefit.   Mr. Speaker, just a few months ago, this Congress passed two bills to  protect student veterans whose GI bill benefits were impacted by the  coronavirus pandemic. My record has shown that one of my top priorities  is ensuring veterans can receive a quality education, and a large part  of that is ensuring that they receive the education they were promised  and holding schools accountable for fraud.   Mr. Speaker, the Department's rule does just that. And it sets up a  clear process for borrowers to have their claim adjudicated and hold  institutions of all types accountable. This rule is fair to borrowers.  It is fair to schools. It is fair to taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I support this rule, and I support the President's veto.
