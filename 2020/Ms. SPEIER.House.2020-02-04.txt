 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the toll that gun  violence takes on survivors left to struggle in the wake of unspeakable  tragedy.   When we talk about gun violence, we usually focus on lives lost, but  the full cost of gun violence is measured in the lives irreparably  changed by physical and mental wounds. Survivors are the students who  hid under desks and in closets at their schools, domestic violence  victims who tried to hold front doors shut and shield their children,  and families left with holes where loved ones used to be. I know  because I am a gun violence survivor.   According to Everytown, 58 percent of Americans have witnessed or  been threatened with gun violence or know someone who has. This is  National Gun Violence Survivors Week. Let's honor survivors by refusing  to let their experiences become the new normal.                            ____________________
