 Madam President, I am proud to recognize Elizabeth  ``Izzy'' McKinney of Londonderry as May's Granite Stater of the Month.  A nurse and mother of two young children, Lily and Bryant, Izzy is  using poetry, illustrations, and her personal experiences to bring much  # needed attention to neurodivergent conditions in children.   When her daughter, Lily, was a toddler, she would flap her arms when  she got excited. Izzy and her husband thought nothing of it at first,  since Izzy also used to flap her arms when she was a child.   It was not until Lily started kindergarten that Izzy and her husband  realized that Lily's arm-flapping was unique. Flapping is a type of  self-stimulatory behavior that is common in children with  neurodivergence and can help them alleviate feelings of sensory  overload.   For a school project that encouraged students to highlight what makes  them special, Izzy encouraged her daughter to find things about her  that stood out from her peers.   While thinking about her daughter's project, Izzy decided to write  her own poem about her daughter's unique physical behavior to  demonstrate to Lily that it is okay to be different from friends and  classmates, that everyone has unique attributes.   Eventually, Izzy expanded the poem into a children's book called  ``What Makes Me Special.'' All the proceeds for the book go toward the  High Hopes Foundation of New Hampshire, a nonprofit that provides life- enhancing experiences for children with chronic conditions.   Later, after Izzy's second child, Bryant, was born, Izzy wrote  another children's book, this time focused on her son's  neurodivergence, dyspraxia. This book is titled ``My Buddy Bryant: A  Story of Friendship and Dyspraxia'' and encourages children to embrace  each other's differences. All the proceeds for this book go toward the  Dyspraxia Foundation USA, which seeks to educate the public about  dyspraxia and provide support and resources to families. Izzy also runs  her own blog, flappingoodtale.com, about her experience parenting two  children who are neurodivergent.   Izzy embodies the best of our State by destigmatizing neurdivergence  and promoting acceptance and inclusion. Her books provide a fun avenue  to help children and adults understand that including people who  experience physical or behavioral differences or disabilities can  strengthen our families, our committees, our State, and our country. I  wish Izzy all the best as she continues this important work.  [[Page S3933]]                                ____________________
