Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res. 502.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H. Res. 502, a resolution making  emergency appropriations to allow the Federal Government to continue  the vital response and recovery efforts that are helping the hundreds  of thousands of victims of Hurricane Harvey.   Our thoughts go out to all the people of Texas and Louisiana who are  coping with the aftermath of this storm and its catastrophic flooding.   As one of the Nation's greatest national disasters continues to  unfold before our eyes, this Congress must ensure that our Federal  Government is able to meet the short and long-term needs of disaster  victims.   I believe that every type of resource ought to be utilized to support  rescue, relief, and recovery efforts. I want to reassure the people of  Texas and Louisiana that we are there for them in their time of  greatest need.   The House Appropriations Committee has already approved a $1 billion  reprogramming request for FEMA last week, which has allowed the agency  to continue to meet the most immediate needs in the region.   It has become clear that, in the face of a disaster of such  magnitude, much more is needed to assist these states and local  communities as they recover and rebuild.   Last Friday, we received the administration's initial request for  supplemental funding for Hurricane Harvey. We are grateful for the  speed of this request, and, recognizing the urgency of the situation,  we brought this resolution to the floor today.   H. Res. 502 contains $7.4 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund,  which will allow FEMA to continue its efforts related to Harvey as well  as any additional disasters that may strike. H. Res. 502 also includes  $450 million to support the Small Business Administration's disaster  loan program that will help small businesses and homeowners come back  from the disasters.   Working closely with the Texas and Louisiana members, the  Appropriations Committee has done its due diligence to guarantee that  this funding will make best use of taxpayers' dollars.                                time  1030    I want to thank all of our Federal agencies, first responders from  around the Nation, the thousands of volunteers who immediately  responded, and all those who have been working tirelessly to make sure  that we meet the needs of the people of Texas and Louisiana.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter), the chairman of the Homeland  Security Appropriations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Culberson), from the Commerce, Justice, Science  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Poe).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Farenthold).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Farenthold).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Lance), my colleague, and I thank him for his  assistance many years ago addressing the needs of the residents of New  York, New Jersey, and Connecticut during Superstorm Sandy.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   First of all, this morning we salute the courage of all Texans and  people from Louisiana. We salute their courage and their resilience.   Once again, I want to thank all of our Federal agencies and,  obviously, the Governor of Texas, the Governor of Louisiana, and all  those agencies that have been meeting the needs of the people; and,  again, the thousands of volunteers who immediately responded and who  have been working tirelessly day in and day out to help hundreds of  thousands of people affected by this storm and saved, I may say,  countless lives.   They have fed and housed the displaced, met critical medical needs,  provided transportation, and, most importantly, gave faith to those who  have lost literally everything. These are American heroes who are  showing the best side of our Nation, and we are grateful for their  service.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Let's  get the money out the door and help the people of Texas and Louisiana.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material in the consideration of  H.R. 3354, and that I may include tabular material on the same.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 500 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 3354.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from New York (Mr. Collins) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1625                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 3354) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior,  environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September  30, 2018, and for other purposes, with Mr. Collins of New York in the  chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Lowey) each will control 1 hour.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to present H.R. 3354, the Make America Secure  and Prosperous Appropriations Act. This legislation moves Congress one  step closer to completing its critical work on our fiscal year 2018  appropriations bills ahead of the end of the fiscal year on September  30.   Our bill respects the American people, their priorities for our  Nation, and their hard-earned tax dollars, and it will help move our  great country forward to a more stable and prosperous future.   This funding, totaling $1.2 trillion, supports important domestic and  international programs that keep our people safe and help our economy  grow and thrive, protects us from terrorists and those who want to do  us harm, and assures that America has a critical role across the globe  both militarily and diplomatically.   Most importantly, this bill continues the work started with the  national security funding package that passed the House in July, the  Make America Secure Appropriations Act, and it prioritizes the safety  of the American people, targeting funding towards critical law  enforcement programs, securing our borders and our cyber networks,  fighting terrorism, combating opioid abuse, and stemming the flow of  illegal drugs and goods.   Other funds are directed to programs that provide the greatest  national benefit, including those that keep our food and drug supplies  safe, that support public health preparedness, fight devastating  wildfires, invest in critical infrastructure, and otherwise protect and  support our economy and economic freedom.   All of these investments are made responsibly. In each of our bills  within this package, we have found savings, gotten rid of waste, fraud,  and duplication, and increased oversight to ensure that no taxpayer  dollar is misspent, but we still have more work to do. This is the next  step in the process, but it is not the end.   We must also address new needs arising from terrible flooding and  damage  [[Page H6696]]  inflicted by Hurricane Harvey, which is affecting hundreds of thousands  of people across Texas and Louisiana, as well as continue all  government operations until the final appropriations package can be  conferenced with the Senate and signed into law.                                time  1630    This legislation today represents the House priorities and shows the  American people that this Chamber is moving forward, governing  effectively, and getting things done here in Washington.   Before I close, I would like to thank the members of the  Appropriations Committee for their hard work over the past few months,  and the staff that allows us to consider this bill today, especially  the 12 chairs of the subcommittees. The committee drafted, considered,  and marked up all 12 appropriations bills in under 2 months, a record- breaking pace, and as a result, we have a fine package of solid bills  on the floor this afternoon.   I particularly would like to thank the chairs and ranking members of  the committee of the bills we are considering today, as well as the  ranking member of the full committee, Mrs. Lowey, for her partnership  and friendship throughout this process. I would also like to extend my  personal thanks to our staff on both sides of the aisle for their  efforts on these bills.   This package is a product not only of the committee's work, but also  of the contribution of all Members of this body. While drafting these  bills that compose this package, we took Members' submissions very  seriously, creating a more representative bill that reflects the will  of the American people.   In July, the House took the first responsible step of providing  funding for critical national security priorities. With this bill, we  complete our work on all 12 of our appropriations bills for the fiscal  year.   This morning, the House came together on an overwhelmingly bipartisan  basis to pass desperately needed emergency funding for the victims in  Texas and Louisiana whose lives were destroyed by Hurricane Harvey.  Funding these important responsibilities of the Federal Government is  our constitutional duty to the people we serve.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), chairman of the Transportation, Housing  and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on  Appropriations.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, before I begin, I want to thank the  chairman, our members, colleagues, and the leadership for being so  understanding.   Tomorrow, I will be heading back to south Florida to be there in case  this horrible storm does head our way. Again, everyone has been  incredibly supportive and shown great solidarity. I am exceedingly  grateful for that.   I rise today to express the strongest possible support for this bill.  I applaud the leadership of Chairman Frelinghuysen for making it  possible to consider it on the floor today.   I would like to highlight some of the vital issues in this bill.   The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related  Agencies division provides $56.5 billion in discretionary budget  authority. That is $1.1 billion below the fiscal year 2017 enacted  level, but it is $8.6 billion above the budget request.    We have targeted transportation and housing funding to essential  investments in safety, infrastructure, and assistance for our most  vulnerable citizens: the elderly; the disabled; and, yes, America's  heroes, our veterans.   We also had to prioritize by reducing or eliminating nonessential  programs and scaling back administrative accounts.   For the Department of Transportation, the bill includes $17.8 billion  in discretionary appropriations and $76.7 billion in total resources.  That includes support for the FAST Act obligation limitations.   The Federal Aviation Administration is funded at $16.6 billion, Mr.  Chairman. We provide this increase to keep advancing NextGen programs  with over $1 billion and to continue to operate the safest, most  complex, most advanced air traffic control system in the world.   The bill reflects FAST Act priorities for highways, rail, and  transit. It includes $45 billion in road and bridge funding from the  highway trust fund, which is almost $1 billion above fiscal year 2017  levels. This funding will provide much-needed improvements to America's  highways and bridges.   The bill provides $2.2 billion to the Federal Railroad Administration  to continue our commitment to rail safety and to make critical  infrastructure investments. This includes FAST Act rail infrastructure  investments to address the state of good repair backlog, which we  really need to address.   As a reflection of tough choices, Mr. Chairman, our funding level for  transit Capital Investment Grants is $600 million below the 2017 level.                                time  1745    But we have, and this is important, included funding and direction to  keep upcoming projects in the pipeline.   For housing programs, we work to ensure that we continue assistance  to our most vulnerable population. The bill includes $38.3 billion for  Department of Housing and Urban Development. The bill also includes  significant increases to keep pace with inflation, almost $1 billion  above last year, for direct rental assistance to maintain, again,  housing for those who are currently served.   Homeless assistance remains a top priority in this bill. We included  funding at the enacted level and well above the budget request.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Florida.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, the bill restores a number of programs  that Members, frankly, from both sides of the aisle made sure that we  were aware of.   The bill restores a number of community development programs that  were proposed for elimination in the budget request, including CDBG and  HOME. Again, we listened to Members from both sides of the aisle, and  we made sure that that was a priority in this bill. These programs,  again, support decisionmaking at the local level where it should be.   Before I close, I want to thank the hardworking and talented staff  who helped put this together, the subcommittee staff. I was going to  read their names, and again, I know I am running out of time, but I  think this is the best staff anywhere in Congress. I also want to thank  my personal staff, my chief of staff, Miguel Mendoza, who is the deputy  chief of staff as well, and from the minority staff, Joe Carlile and  Angela, and so many others who have worked hand-in-hand with my  committee staff. And I would be remiss if I did not, in particular,  thank Mr. Price, the ranking member. He has been great to work with,  work cooperatively. I ask for your favorable support of this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Graves), the chairman of the Financial Services and  General Government Subcommittee on Appropriations.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman.
