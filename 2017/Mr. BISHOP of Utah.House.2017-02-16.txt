Res. 69) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the  final rule of the Department of the Interior relating to ``Non- Subsistence Take of Wildlife, and Public Participation and Closure  Procedures, on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska'', and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 123, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 69         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of the       Interior relating to ``Non-Subsistence Take of Wildlife, and       Public Participation and Closure Procedures, on National       Wildlife Refuges in Alaska'' (81 Fed. Reg. 52247 (August 5,       2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) and the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 69.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 69.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young), the only Member of Congress in the House from  Alaska, the dean of the Republican side.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).   Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  his time and his leadership on this issue.   I come to the floor today as the co-chair of the largest bipartisan  caucus in the United States Congress: the Congressional Sportsmen's  Caucus. On behalf of the millions of sportsmen and -women around the  country, I say to the Federal Government, enough is enough. We will not  be intimidated; we will not be strong-armed; and we will not be silent.   States have enjoyed a cooperative relationship with the Federal  Government for years on wildlife management, and this is a disturbing  shift that we have seen in the last administration.   Though I come to the floor today in defense of Alaska's management  rights of national wildlife refuges, this sets a disturbing precedent  for the lower 48 States. It is a disturbingly brazen power grab by the  Federal Government against the law, in spite of loud and widespread  opposition at the local level.   The rule removes Alaska's authority to manage fish and wildlife for  both nonsubsistence and subsistence uses in Federal wildlife. The  action by the last administration violated the clear letter of the  Alaska Statehood Act, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation  Act, and the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act.   I encourage my colleagues to support what we are doing today and  stand in support of the good men and women, the outdoorsmen in the  great State of Alaska. I know you have heard from the gentleman from  Alaska who has very clearly articulated the position of the people he  represents in that great State.   I applaud the chairman. I applaud the action that we are taking  today. I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Federal Lands in our full committee.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, in the dying days of the Obama  administration, and over vigorous protests by many wildlife and user  groups, not to mention the State of Alaska itself, the National Fish  and Wildlife Service imposed the rule that Congressman Young's  resolution overturns. In violation of the Alaska Statehood Act, the  [[Page H1262]]  Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, and the National  Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service  removed Alaska's authority to manage the fish and wildlife populations  within its own borders on 76 million acres. That is a land area larger  than 45 States.   As part of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of  1980, the State agreed to several national wildlife refuges within its  borders. In exchange for the Federal Government assuming control of  these lands, Alaska was given explicit authority to manage its wildlife  populations. This new agency rule breaks this promise. It begins a  dangerous process of seizing control of fish and game management  decisions which have by right, by law, and by custom belonged to the  States.   The North American model of wildlife conservation has been a huge  success and has sustained healthy wildlife populations for many  generations. Not only is the Fish and Wildlife Service rule illegal, it  threatens to reverse these successful land management relationships; it  places severe restrictions on the public's right to hunt and fish on  these public lands; it interferes with the State's success in managing  wildlife populations to assure that they don't overrun the ability of  the land to support them; and it shreds the cooperative relationship  that Alaska and the Federal Government have enjoyed over these lands  since Alaskan statehood.   We have three overarching objectives in the Federal Lands  Subcommittee: to restore public access to the public lands, to restore  sound management to the public lands, and to restore the Federal  Government as a good neighbor to those communities and States impacted  by the public lands. In adopting this rule, the agency violated all of  these principles.   The Federal Lands Subcommittee will spend this Congress working on  legislation to restore our public lands from the policy of benign  neglect that has plagued our land management to the point where we are  losing entire forests in the West and that has strained the  relationships between our communities and our Federal agencies. The  resolution sponsored by Congressman Young is an excellent start. I urge  my colleagues to support this resolution.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), the vice chairman of the Federal Lands  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), a member of our committee, who is also going  to talk about the reality of what we are facing here.    I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Austin Scott).   Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the assertion that removing  this rule would allow for egregious, cruel, and unsporting hunting  methods is just totally false. The people of Alaska, I trust them to  manage the game of that State. The idea, the accusation that this rule  allows for shooting of wolf pups in their den is totally false.  Disturbing wolf dens for any reason--hunting, trapping, or for wildlife  management--is illegal in the State of Alaska.   The 2016-2017 Alaska Trapping Regulations state:         The following methods are illegal for taking furbearers:       You may not disturb or destroy beaver houses or any furbearer       den.    Again, the people of Alaska can be trusted to manage their game.  [[Page H1266]]    Additionally, the claim that removing this rule would allow for the  use of airplanes or helicopters to hunt is totally false. Using  aircraft is illegal in the State of Alaska. The 2016-2017 Alaska  Hunting Regulations state:         You may not take game by driving, herding, harassing, or       molesting game with any motorized vehicle such as an       aircraft, airboat, snow machine, motorboat, et cetera.    Finally, the claim that removing this rule would allow for trapping  of grizzly bears and black bears with steel-jawed leghold traps, again,  simply totally false. Trapping or snaring big game is illegal in the  State of Alaska.   The 2016-2017 Alaska Hunting Regulations state:         You may not take game by using a trap or a snare to take       big game, fur animals, or small game.    As you can see, these claims are nothing but false rhetoric from  antisportsmen that think they know better how to manage Alaska's  wildlife than the good people of Alaska do. Alaska law already  precludes these practices, yet they are being used as an emotional  argument to hide what is clearly a bureaucratic overreach which  unfairly targets the citizens of Alaska.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  [[Page H1267]]  from Alaska (Mr. Young), the one who actually lives there and knows the  area and knows the names of the towns.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, we are here to repeal a rule issued by the Federal  Fish and Wildlife Service to restrict hunting on the national wildlife  refuges in Alaska.   This rule is a solution. The only problem is no one knows for what it  is a solution because there is no problem. And the sad part is that  means that this rule is basically a useless rule. It has no efficacy to  it. Despite the assertions that had been made repeatedly and a  cacophony of all sorts of practices that are seeming to be wrong and  bad, this rule doesn't do that.   This rule does not abandon any of the practices you are talking about  on subsistence hunting, only on nonsubsistence hunting, which simply  means that, if you are classified as a subsistence hunter, anything  that the other side talked about and raled about is actually allowed by  the silly rule. That is why the rule makes no sense.   The State of Alaska had it under control, and there is no real  problem that is solved by this rule that is totally inefficient, but  did make something nice about it.   Now, it makes things worse because it is talking about predator  control only on nonsubsistence hunting. Unfortunately, the predators  don't know, when they go after their prey, whether that prey is  designed for a subsistence hunter or a recreation hunter. They haven't  learned to distinguish that yet.   Ergo, how you administer this law is totally ineffective. It is  impossible to do so, and what you do is simply make a blanket approach  so that everyone gets harmed in the same equal fashion. That is what  Fish and Wildlife has decided to do.   In addition to that, yes, it is illegal. It usurps State authority,  and it usurps it very clearly. You know, it is amazing to me. I cannot  believe that in the first Congress that we had, the Founding Fathers  were there coming up with the Bill of Rights and the 10th Amendment,  they thought the 10th Amendment would eventually some day be imagined  by a bureaucrat in Washington to overrule Congress on matters that were  clearly intended for State discretion, but that is precisely what we  have done here.   This rule violates three congressionally passed statutes that have  precedence on this particular issue. And this rule violates Federal law  passed by Congress on three separate occasions.   What was supposed to be envisioned with this system was a cooperative  relationship between the State and the Federal Government. What this  rule simply does is allow for Fish and Wildlife on the Federal level to  have supremacy, to destroy that cooperation and coordination and take  over control totally. That is wrong. It should never be there.    There are 16 different refuges up there. That is 76 million acres of  land now going to be controlled by the Fish and Wildlife system here in  Washington. That is more acreage than 46 of the 50 States that we have.  And, once again, for many of those people, this hunting is a source of  subsistence up there.   Here is the bottom line: Mr. Blumenauer came up here and said, why  don't we let the professionals make their decisions. They do. Those  professionals are the Alaska Department of Fish and Game who know  exactly what they are doing, they know the area, and they know the  animals.   The so-called helicopter hunting that was raled against up here is  not done by any recreational hunter. Alaska doesn't allow that. The  Alaska Fish and Game will do that for management control based on  scientific purposes and reasons and that only.   This rule doesn't change any of that. No. I'm sorry, this rule  actually doesn't change any of the recreational hunting, which is  already outlawed by the State of Alaska. It only stops the Fish and  Wildlife system of Alaska from simply doing their job as they know how  to do it.   I include in the Record a letter supported by 27 different  organizations all dealing with outdoor life in support of this  particular resolution.                                                  February 6, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan, Speaker, House of Representatives      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy, Majority Leader, House of         Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy: We write       representing organizations that collectively include millions       of wildlife conservationists, hunter conservationists,       wildlife enthusiasts, and wildlife scientists, in strong       support of H.J. Res. 49 from Cong. Young (AK), which would       nullify the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (FWS) final rule       ``Non-Subsistence Take of Wildlife, and Public Participation       and Closure Procedures, on National Wildlife Refuges in       Alaska'' (81 Fed. Reg. 52248 (August 5, 2016)). Our community       exhausted all Executive Branch appeals and remedies urging       the FWS to slow down the Proposed Rule, and revise it to       reflect a proposal mutually agreed to by the State of Alaska       and the FWS; all to no end. It is time for Congress to       nullify this final rule.        This final rule boldly preempts the authority of the Alaska       Department of Fish and Game to manage wildlife for both       recreational and subsistence hunting on NWRs, which authority       of the state is affirmed by Congress in the Alaska Statehood       Act, the Alaska National Interests Land Conservation Act, and       the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act. The FWS       final rule was premised on meeting as a priority the FWS       policy on Biological Integrity, Diversity and Environmental       Health; which  [[Page H1268]]       would inadvisably set a precedent nationally. Many members of       our organizations enjoy Alaska's bounty of fish and wildlife       resources and their habitats for unrivaled hunting, fishing       and outdoor experiences. The sustainable management of these       natural resources needs to be led by the State working in       cooperation with the FWS. We urge that you favorably consider       H.J. Res. 49 which will restore the jurisdictional state-      federal relationship as Congress has previously directed.        Thank you very much for your consideration of our concerns       about this harmful and illegal rule which if left un-      remedied, significantly affects the use and appreciation of       the magnificent natural resources found in Alaska.            Sincerely,        Archery Trade Association, Association of Fish and Wildlife       Agencies, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, Council to       Advance Hunting and the Shooting Sports, Dallas Safari Club,       Delta Waterfowl Foundation, Ducks Unlimited, Houston Safari       Club, Masters of Foxhounds Association, Mule Deer Foundation,       National Rifle Association, National Shooting Sports       Foundation, National Trappers Association, National Wild       Turkey Federation, Orion the Hunter's Institute.

Madam Speaker, this comes from groups all over  the Nation who understand what is going on and also realize the problem  of this--I mean, there are some people who might think this only deals  with Alaska. Technically, it does.   The problem is, if this happens to Alaska, if the ability of the  Federal Government to supersede the State happens in Alaska, this could  also happen to anyone of the lower 48 States.   We are simply one lawsuit away from Fish and Wildlife Service being  either allowed or required to order similar regulations for everything  across the lower 48 States as well. And that is what is so difficult  and impossible to understand.   Look, let me try and sum it up this way: None of the practices that  have been railed about today actually are existing, and any of those  that are are easily controlled by the Alaska Department of Fish and  Game.   The underlying premise, both of the rule that the Fish and Wildlife  Service of the Department of the Interior did and the underlying  premise of most of the debate that has happened here on the floor, is  that only somebody who lives here in Washington has the intelligence,  the foresight, the vision to make these kind of rules that  unfortunately people in Alaska are simply too dumb to do it. You are a  bunch of redneck hicks that don't understand how to rule yourself. You  don't understand science. You barely have television.   I don't know what it is, but why do we have this mindset that only  Washington can make these decisions when actually the States have  proven, not only that are they capable, they are superior to what  happens from this Department here in Washington.   That is what this is about, an illegal rule that simply takes away  from the States what they are doing and what they are doing well; and  that is why this should be opposed. That is why this rule should be  pulled away. This midnight rule, once again, should be taken back.   Allow them to start over and do something intelligently. At least,  recognize the professionals--the real professionals who work in the  States to make this system work. They can do it. They have done it.  Allow them to do their jobs, and protect the rest of us from any judge  saying, oh, if it happened in Alaska, maybe it can happen in your State  as well. That is the fear.   This is a rule passed by Fish and Wildlife at the last minute of the  Obama administration that doesn't solve anything and will be impossible  to administer. It violates everything that has gone on before.   Vote for this rule. Bring back sanity and allow the States to do  their job as they are supposed to do and as the law prescribes for them  to do.   I urge support of this. I don't know if you are undecided on whether  I was for this resolution or not. Just, for the record, yes, I support  this resolution.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 123, the previous question is ordered on  the joint resolution.   The question is on engrossment and third reading of the joint  resolution.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third  time, and was read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the joint  resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
