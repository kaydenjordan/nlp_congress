 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great Kentucky Statesman  and a true friend. This past weekend, Kentucky lost one of its best. My  dear friend, and the former majority leader of the Kentucky House of  Representatives, Bam Carney.   Bam represented his home county of Taylor and Adair County in the  Kentucky General Assembly for many years. He rose as high as majority  leader, and remained there and would have been there as long as he  wanted to be majority leader until he fell ill. And those of us who  have kept up with Bam over the past year and-a-half know that he fought  a battle that few people could have fought over the past year and-a- half.   I am sad to report that this past weekend, Bam passed away, but he  will never be forgotten. The history books will write about Bam Carney,  and they will talk about his role as majority leader of the Kentucky  House of Representatives. They will also talk about his role as a great  educator, and a leader for education in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.   Madam Speaker, I want to take a few moments to recognize Bam Carney,  my friend. When you are involved in politics, you get to meet a lot of  political people. And I had the pleasure of serving in the Kentucky  House of Representatives with Bam Carney. I remember when he arrived in  Frankfort, Kentucky, a few years after I got there. And Bam immediately  made an impression on me. He wasn't like everybody else in Frankfort.  Bam was genuine. What you saw is what you got. Bam and I became very  close friends. In fact, I considered Bam Carney one of my best friends.  We worked together on legislation, our families became close, we played  a lot of golf together. I never beat Bam, by the way. Not many people  did beat Bam Carney on the golf course. But we became friends. He  stayed at my house on weekends. We traveled together. Bam was someone  that you could trust. Bam was someone that--in politics it is rare to  say--but you always knew where he stood. And if he told you something,  then that was good as gold because he stuck with his word.   Bam wasn't like most politicians. Bam didn't want to hide from the  controversial issues or the tough issues, the issues that Bam knew  might not be the most popular issues in his district. But Bam did what  was right and what he felt was right for the people he represented.   Bam was a career educator; a basketball coach. Bam played college  baseball  [[Page H3663]]  at Berea. Bam was a Christian. In fact, one of the last things that he  said was he was ready to go to heaven. And I know that is where he is  right now. Bam was a great brother, a great father. Bam was a great  leader, a great friend, just an all-around great person.   Kentucky lost a great statesman this past weekend in Bam Carney. I  hope that those of us who knew Bam can learn from the greatness of Bam  Carney, the great person he was, the great leader he was, and the great  representative of the people that he was. Bam represented the people,  not the special interests.   Madam Speaker, I can't say enough heartfelt things to Bam Carney's  family: His mother, his brothers, his sister, his two sons. They have  endured a lot over the past year and-a-half through Bam's sickness, and  they never left his side, never gave up hope; always having a positive  attitude. Bam Carney is the kind of person that we all need in  legislative bodies, someone you can count on and someone that is honest  and someone that is in the legislative body for the right reason.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the time today on the floor of the U.S.  House of Representatives to recognize the great life of a great  Kentucky leader and a great Kentucky friend, Bam Carney.                    Honoring the Life of James Otis Catlin     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. James  Otis Catlin of Sebree, Kentucky, who passed away earlier this month-- July 9, 2021--at the age of 90. James was a hard worker throughout his  life. He was a proud Korean War veteran, earning a Bronze Star and  Purple Heart.   His love for our country and servicemembers continued after his  military career, and he joined the Austin Collins American Legion Post  243 in 1952, eventually becoming its oldest member.   James was a dedicated servant of the Lord and an active member of  Sebree General Baptist Church. His humble service touched many in  Webster County and all of Kentucky's First Congressional District.   I will always be grateful for the sacrifice of our Nation's heroes. I  was proud to represent James in Congress, and his enduring legacy of  service and faith will live on through his family, friends, and all  those he impacted.                        Honoring Mark and Lori Wilson     Madam Speaker, for 141 years, on the first Saturday in  August, people from all over Kentucky make their way to the small  community of Fancy Farm in far Western Kentucky for the annual Fancy  Farm picnic, hosted by St. Jerome Catholic Church in Graves County.   Thousands gather to enjoy good food, good people, and good old- fashioned political stump speaking. Over 19,500 pounds of pork and  mutton are served, along with hundreds of pounds of fresh home-cooked  vegetables and homemade pies and cakes. All funds raised benefit St.  Jerome Catholic Church for charitable endeavors. Additionally, the  Fancy Farm picnic is entirely a community effort made up of local  volunteers.   Madam Speaker, today, I would like to honor two of those volunteers-- Mark and Lori Wilson--for their 15 years of service as chairs of the  picnic-speaking committee. Mark and Lori have dedicated countless hours  to make the Fancy Farm picnic a great success.   I was especially honored when Mark and Lori asked me to serve as  master of ceremonies at the 2012 Fancy Farm picnic when I was  Kentucky's commissioner of agriculture. Their efforts to create a  successful picnic every year are invaluable.   Mark and Lori Wilson will be stepping aside and paving the way for  new community leaders to step up and fill this role. However, I know  that Mark and Lori will continue to be an active presence not only on  the Fancy Farm stage, but in their proud Graves County community. I  personally appreciate not only their years of service, but also their  friendship.                                time  1945
