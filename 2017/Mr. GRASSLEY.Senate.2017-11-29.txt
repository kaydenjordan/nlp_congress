 Mr. President, the last time Congress modernized the  Tax Code was in 1986. That was more than 30 years ago, which is quite  obvious to anybody who can subtract. In the generations since, the Tax  Code has grown out of control. It has been a dream come true for whom?  The professionals in accounting and the lobbyists who protect the  loopholes. But it happens to be a real nightmare for most Americans. I  would say, for most Members of Congress, as one reads regularly, very  few Members of Congress do their own taxes.   The outdated Tax Code helps the powerful and the well connected but  hurts American workers. It hurts American industry, and it hurts  America's ability to compete with the rest of the world. That means  lower wages and less employment.   The bill that passed out of the Finance Committee moves us very much  in the right direction to make our Tax Code simpler, fairer, and more  competitive. At the heart of the legislation is a middle-class tax cut.  A typical family of four with two children making $59,000 a year could  see a tax cut of more than $1,700. That is very significant tax relief,  but you would never know it by listening to the rhetoric of my  colleagues of the other political party. They have repeatedly recited  the tired line that Republicans are only interested in giving tax cuts  to the wealthy. In fact, they began pushing that narrative even before  this bill was written. In going way back to September, they started  analyzing a bill that didn't even exist. It was a charge made by a  document that was put out, called the Big Six framework. But the  framework was no piece of legislation; it merely provided guidelines  from which to start for the tax-writing committees.   The partisan Tax Policy Center then filled in the gaps with policy  assumptions and crafted an analysis to fit its narrative and its  analysis of a piece of legislation that had not even been written. The  problem is that its narrative hasn't changed. The Finance Committee  provided policy details that it should have used to change its  narrative, but it still keeps with the same old rhetoric. I think even  the Tax Policy Center would have to agree that the Finance Committee's  product differs drastically from the underlying assumptions of its  initial analysis.   I am going to try to explain what the Tax Policy Center says about  the tax law that we ought to pass in comparison to our bill, and you  will see that there seems to be a real closeness in some of the ideas  that ought to be done that we get from the left that are in this bill,  but they don't even recognize it.   The Finance Committee used all of the available tools it was granted  under the unified framework to target more relief to middle-income  taxpayers and retain the progressivity of the Tax Code. Let's take a  look at some of the major features of the Finance's bill and how it  provides relief for the Nation's middle-class and low-income earners.   First, it nearly doubles the standard deduction, which means that  many lower income Americans will be removed from the tax rolls  completely and that tax filing season will be simpler for millions  more. Second, it doubles the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and  moderately increases its refundability. Both of these are made possible  in large part by repealing personal exemptions. Personal exemptions for  the taxpayer and spouse help to increase the standard deduction, and  the personal exemptions for children help with increasing the child tax  credit.   Interestingly enough, these provisions mirror a proposal that was put  out by the leftwing Tax Policy Center in December of just last year.  Nearly identical to the Finance bill, the very liberal Tax Policy  Center's paper argued for repealing personal exemptions, nearly  doubling the standard deduction, and increasing the child tax credit to  $2,012. According to the authors of the liberal Tax Policy Center's  proposal, such a change would ``reduce complexity, remove inequities,  and mitigate marriage penalties.'' That is exactly what the bill before  the Senate does, but they don't seem to recognize that. They sure  wanted that as a goal last year.   The fact is that these changes provide more tax relief to the middle  class and at the same time simplify the Tax Code. As the liberal Tax  Policy Center's paper points out, the value of the personal exemption  is largely dependent on the tax bracket of the taxpayer. The higher the  tax bracket, the more benefit that comes from the personal exemption.  In comparison, the child tax credit generally lowers a taxpayer's tax  liability dollar for dollar regardless of the tax bracket. As a result,  repealing the personal exemption  [[Page S7398]]  in favor of expanding the child tax credit makes the Tax Code more  progressive and targets more relief to lower and middle-income  taxpayers.   Admittedly, there are some differences between what was suggested by  the liberal Tax Policy Center and what is in the bill before us. Its  proposal would have been more generous on the refundable feature of the  child tax credit, but on the opposite end, it would have made the child  tax credit available to everyone, including to millionaires. The  Finance's bill is less generous to the affluent because it phases out  the credit for married taxpayers with incomes of over $500,000. One  would think that those on the other side--meaning the Democratic  Party--in their finding fault with this bill, would offer some credit  for taking this rather progressive approach to providing family tax  relief, but no. They continue repeating their line over and over that  this bill is a tax cut for the wealthy.   Another major feature of the Finance's bill that provides relief to  middle-class and lower income earners is the reduction of tax rates for  middle-bracket taxpayers. First, it retains the 10-percent bracket,  which many on the other side expressed concern about being repealed  based on the Big Six framework. They were wrong in using the framework,  but they have not admitted that.   Next, it lowers the current law's 15-percent bracket to 12 percent  and expands its applicability.   Additionally, it reduces what is essentially the current law bracket  of 25 percent down to 22 percent and what is essentially today's  current law 28-percent bracket to a much wider 24-percent bracket.  These rate reductions target tax relief to the very heart of America's  middle class.   One may be wondering how this middle-class tax relief bill will be  financed--largely by repealing the State and local tax deduction, also  known as the SALT deduction. Our colleagues on the other side have  tried to argue that the repealing of the State and local tax deduction  is a tax increase on the middle class. Nothing could be further from  the truth in considering the reduced tax brackets, which I just  discussed, in combination with the higher standard deduction and the  doubled child tax credit.   The repeal of the State and local tax deduction is actually a very  key piece of this legislation that makes the middle-class tax cuts  possible. The State and local tax deduction overwhelmingly benefits the  so-called wealthy, who our colleagues on the other side vehemently  argue should receive no tax benefits under this bill.   I am going to tell you now how the liberal elements in this town see  the State and local tax deduction as something that should have gone  away anyway, and now they are complaining because we are doing away  with it. Don't take my word for it. Here is what several partisan think  tanks have said about the State and local tax deduction in the past.    According to the Tax Policy Center--remember that is the leftwing  organization finding fault with the bill even before it was written-- about 40 percent of the State and local tax deduction benefit goes to  taxpayers with incomes exceeding $500,000. So we do away with the State  and local tax deduction because it benefits wealthy people, and they  don't give us any credit for it.   Keep in mind that tax filers with incomes of half a million or more  make up only about 1 percent of all tax filers, making it a very  lopsided benefit. Here is what the very leftwing Center for American  Progress has said about the State and local tax deduction:         The deduction for state and local taxes disproportionately       benefits high-income taxpayers, property owners, and       residents of high-tax states. That is because these groups       pay the most taxes at the state and local level. It also       benefits high-income taxpayers because any kind of deduction       is worth more to people in high tax brackets than in low tax       brackets.    I just finished quoting the Center for American Progress, which said  that the State and local tax deduction ought to be done away with  because it benefits wealthy people. Yet they complain to us that our  tax bill is a tax benefit for the wealthy.   To further illustrate who eliminating the State and local tax benefit  really hits, I would like to highlight a recent Bloomberg article  entitled ``Tax-Hike Fears Trigger Talk of Exodus From Manhattan and  Greenwich.'' This article is not about the concerns of middle-class  police officers or teachers on repeal of the State and local tax  deduction. Instead, it highlights concerns of wealthy hedge fund  managers who may now consider moving out of the high-tax State of New  York. The Bloomberg article states:         The problem for the Connecticut hedge-fund set--and, more       broadly, for a lot of the Wall Street crowd--is that       Republican proposals in both the House and Senate would drive       up taxes for many high-earners in the New York City area. By       eliminating the deduction for most state and local taxes, an       individual making a yearly salary of $1 million . . . would       owe the Internal Revenue Service an additional $21,000.    This legislation repeals that deduction and makes the person making a  yearly salary of $1 million pay $21,000 more in taxes, and liberal  groups are proposing doing away with it, and we put it in our bill so  that we don't let these wealthy people get the benefit of the tax  deduction, and they don't recognize it. So I ask my colleagues on the  left: Are you prepared to go to bat over SALT deductions for  millionaire hedge fund managers?   From listening to my Democratic colleagues' rhetoric, I am really  surprised by this article. I thought Republicans were all about ``tax  cuts for the wealthy'' and giveaways to Wall Street. But this article  suggests otherwise. In fact, these types of taxpayers are likely to  experience sizable tax hikes under the proposal on the Senate floor  now.   According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, by 2023,  nearly 30 percent of taxpayers with incomes exceeding $1 million will  experience a tax hike. That does not sound like a giveaway to the  wealthy to me.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to commemorate November as  National Adoption Month. During this month, we are reminded of the  importance of adoption to so many families and children in Iowa and all  across the country. As Americans are celebrating the season of  Thanksgiving with family and friends, adoptive families are celebrating  with their new families, giving thanks for the joy of somebody they  adopted.   Since the first recognition of National Adoption Day 16, 17 years  ago, nearly 65,000 kids have been adopted on National Adoption Day,  which is always celebrated on the Saturday before Thanksgiving each  year. In 2016 alone, over 4,700 adoptions were finalized on National  Adoption Day.   National Adoption Month is certainly a time to celebrate the joys of  a new family; however, it is also a reminder of the obstacles that so  many children may face. Nationally, there are over 425,000 children in  foster care. Over 100,000 of these children are hoping to be adopted.  In Iowa, there are about 1,000 kids in foster care who are eligible for  adoption.   This year, the special focus of National Adoption Month is older  youth waiting to be adopted. Teenagers, unfortunately, face more  difficulty in being adopted than do younger children.   As cofounder and cochair of the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, I have  had the chance to hear directly from teenagers in foster care. In fact,  our Senate Caucus on Foster Youth has a couple, three seminars every  year just to listen to older youth in the foster care system,  particularly those who are about ready to age out. These young people  tell me that, more than anything else, they want a loving family. They  tell me that they need families and that nobody is too old to be  adopted. The support that parents provide to teens is critical to  navigating the transition to adulthood--from making decisions about  higher education to finding a job or buying a car. A loving family  continually provides the support teens need to succeed.  [[Page S7403]]    Congress must continue to work toward policies that help make  adoption a reality for our foster youth. We must work to ensure that  all children, no matter their circumstances, have permanent, loving  homes and consistent, caring adults in their lives. I am glad that the  Senate preserved the adoption tax credit in the tax reform legislation,  and I am hopeful that Congress will continue to work on policy that  promotes adoption and improves the lives of those in foster care.   As National Adoption Month comes to an end tomorrow, I thank all of  those who work to improve the lives of children. I thank advocates for  children who tirelessly work to make adoption possible, and I thank  adoptive parents and families for opening their hearts and homes.                            ____________________
