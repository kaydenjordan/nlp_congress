 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize May 12  through 18 as National Police Week.   We are blessed to live in a country founded on the rule of law, and  it could not be preserved without our Nation's courageous police.   This week, we show gratitude to the 800,000 sworn law enforcement  officers who put their lives on the line daily for our safety.   We also honor those who have given their lives in the line of duty.  This year, 371 fallen heroes were added to the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial, including Trooper Samuel Newton Bullard, who died  serving Surry County in North Carolina's Fifth District.   These brave officers' sacrifices will not be forgotten, and their  families are in my prayers. This Police Week, and every week, let's  show our support for those who risk so much to keep us safe.                            ____________________
