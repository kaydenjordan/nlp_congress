 Mr. Chairman, on probably the most important issue, we are  having the dumbest debate. We say the healthcare bill is good. You say  it stinks.   We think it is good because we think it is good that kids, until they  are age 26, can stay on their parents' plan. We think it is good  because people with preexisting conditions ought to have access to  health care, and we think it is good that a person who gets sick  shouldn't lose their health care.   You say it is bad, even though the plan was based on a Heritage  Foundation initiative and adopted largely in Massachusetts by a  Republican governor.   Bottom line, you are the majority in the House; you are the majority  in the Senate; and you have got the Presidency. You have got some  responsibility to show us the beef. Where is the plan?   Now, there is a lot of paper over there, but you haven't shown us a  plan. And here is why: because when you put pen to paper, all hell is  going to break loose on your side because you have to move beyond the  rhetoric to figuring out how you are going to pay to keep our kids on  our healthcare plan. You are going to figure out how to pay if we are  going to let folks with preexisting conditions have health care.   Those don't solve themselves, and you don't have a plan. We are  entitled, the American people are entitled, to have it.
