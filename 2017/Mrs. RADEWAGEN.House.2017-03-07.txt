 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1362) to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community- based outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, the Faleomavaega  Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin VA Clinic.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1362         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-                    BASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC, PAGO PAGO, AMERICAN                     SAMOA.         The Department of Veterans Affairs community-based       outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, shall after       the date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated       as the ``Faleomavaega Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin VA Clinic''. Any       reference  [[Page H1546]]       to such community-based outpatient clinic in any law,       regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the       United States shall be considered to be a reference to the       Faleomavaega Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin VA Clinic.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  add extraneous materials.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1362, a bill to name the  Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in  Pago Pago, American Samoa, the Faleomavaega Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin VA  Clinic.   I have sponsored this bill in order to honor my predecessor and a  true public servant, the Honorable Faleomavaega Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin.   Born on August 15, 1943, in Vailoatai Village, American Samoa, Mr.  Faleomavaega graduated from Brigham Young University in 1966 and  subsequently joined the United States Army and served in Vietnam.   However, his career in the Army was just the beginning of his public  service. Mr. Faleomavaega served as a staff member to A.U. Fuimaono,  American Samoa's first Delegate at-large to Washington, D.C., from 1973  to 1975.   Having earned his law degree from the University of Houston, he next  served as staff counsel to the Committee on the Interior and Insular  Affairs.   In 1981, Mr. Faleomavaega returned to American Samoa to serve as our  deputy attorney general until 1984, then as our lieutenant governor  until 1989. During this period, Mr. Faleomavaega reentered military  service in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1982 to 1989.   In 1989, Mr. Faleomavaega began his tenure as the congressional  Delegate from American Samoa. He went on to win 13 consecutive terms,  making him the longest serving Delegate to date from American Samoa.   While in Congress, he diligently served the interests of his  constituents as a member of both the House Committee on Foreign  Relations and the Committee on Natural Resources.   Sadly, my friend Eni Faleomavaega passed away on February 22. He is  survived by his wife, 5 children, and 10 grandchildren.   I would now like to say a few personal words about the man whom I  came to call a true friend.   Given that I challenged him for his seat from 1994 until 2014, when I  won my first term, Eni and I had a long and complicated relationship.  Though we were often at odds politically, we always treated one another  with the utmost respect and grace, allowing us to form a shared bond  that I am very thankful for and will never forget.   Ours was a true friendship that demonstrated that, despite whatever  political differences we may have, we can all come together for the  good of those we serve. While we may have had disagreements on national  issues, we were very much in sync when it came to Federal policy and  funding for American Samoa.   As a veteran whose long-term health suffered due to his service in  Vietnam, Eni dedicated his life to improving conditions for veterans in  American Samoa and took great pride in securing funds to build the  local VA clinic which has served our veterans well.   Therefore, I can think of no better way to memorialize his dedication  to the people of American Samoa and his service to our country in  uniform than having the local VA clinic in Pago Pago, which he worked  so hard for, named in his honor.   I want to encourage my colleagues in the House and Senate to salute  my predecessor by supporting this measure so that we may honor this  good man for his lifelong service and dedication to the people of  American Samoa and to veterans everywhere.   This legislation satisfies all of the committee's naming criteria and  is supported by the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post Number 3391.   Once again, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time until all Members have had an opportunity to speak on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers at this time.  Once again, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
