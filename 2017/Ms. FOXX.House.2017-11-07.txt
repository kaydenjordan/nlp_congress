The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 607, the  amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on  Education and the Workforce, printed in the bill, shall be considered  as adopted, and the bill, as amended, shall be considered read.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour,  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Education and the Workforce.   The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 3441.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from North Carolina?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 3441.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from North Carolina?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3441, the Save  Local Business Act.   Mr. Speaker, the premise of this legislation is simple. It is about  protecting the ability of entrepreneurs in this country to start and  run their own business, and it is about ensuring opportunities within  reach for all Americans.   Every day, men and women across the country work hard to earn a  paycheck and provide for their families, and every day, local  businessowners work hard to keep their doors open and hire employees.   Meanwhile, bureaucrats in Washington are busy setting policies that  have a widespread impact on every workplace in the country. As we  learned during the Obama administration and from rulings made by the  previous National Labor Relations Board, too often these policies do  far more harm than good.   When it comes to rules and policies governing our Nation's workforce,  there has never been a greater need for Congress to clarify areas of  the law that shouldn't be left up to boards and Federal agencies to  decide. That is especially true regarding the joint employer issue. In  2015, when the Obama administration's NLRB unilaterally redefined what  it means to be a joint employer, the result was massive confusion and  uncertainty.   The Committee on Education and the Workforce has heard from countless  individuals on how the vague and unworkable new joint employer standard  threatens job creation, creates new roadblocks for entrepreneurs, and  upends successful business models and relationships.   H.R. 3441, the Save Local Business Act, will deliver much-needed  relief by providing legal clarity under the National Labor Relations  Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act. The legislation simply restores a  commonsense joint employer standard, and it does so in a way that  upholds vital worker protections and ensures all employers know their  responsibilities to their employees.   I want to thank my colleague, Representative Byrne, for introducing  and tirelessly championing this proposal, along with the Democratic  cosponsors.   I urge all Members to vote in favor of H.R. 3441 so we can protect  local jobs, opportunity, and entrepreneurship.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), the chief sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Cuellar), I want to take just a minute to express my deepest  sympathy to him, as the representative of the people of Sutherland  Springs, for this Sunday's tragic events. He is here today to do the  job they sent him to do, but we all know his heart is very much in that  community. I thank him for being here, and I hope he knows that so many  people are praying for him and the people he represents.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Cuellar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Chabot), the chair of the Small Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Chabot), the chair of the Small Business Committee.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Francis Rooney).   Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Foxx and  Subcommittee Chairman Byrne for bringing forth this important  legislation, the Save Local Business Act.   Construction is a major employer in the U.S. economy, with over 6  million employees, 650,000 employers, creating over $1 trillion worth  of construction every year.   Building a project involves a complex web of subcontractors, vendors,  and consultants all working together in a spirit of teamwork to  accomplish a difficult task.   I have been in this business for 40 years. The general contractor has  to put control terms in its subcontracts and purchase orders to make  sure that the subcontractors and vendors execute the work safely, on  schedule, and in coordination with the other trades on the project.  Lastly, they have to follow all the fitness-for-duty provisions to make  sure that they pass drug tests and deal with smoking and health safety  issues like that.   These requirements run right into this Browning-Ferris standard.  There is no way that you could follow the literal words of those court  cases and this horrible Obama rule and not have the argument made to  you that all these subs and vendors are part of a common enterprise.   Now employers, including myself and my employees, are left in a big  quandary as to their status under Browning-Ferris, under the Obama  rule. I can see a scenario where a batch plant located clear across  town from a construction project could have a hazardous waste problem.  Because of this ridiculous rule, my job or someone else's job using  that batch plant to supply concrete could be linked to them. How  perverse is that?   So the Save Local Business Act will fix this abuse and be beneficial  not only to the American economy, but to the safety and well-being of  American workers. I urge my colleagues to support this practical fix to  this egregious action, and I thank Chairman Byrne for introducing this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Ferguson), our distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Brat).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Brat).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Brat).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Allen), another distinguished member from the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I understand my colleague from Virginia is  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a no-brainer. Today, Congress has a  chance to stand up for jobs, opportunity, and local businesses in each  of our districts. This legislation rolls back an unworkable joint  employer policy that is hurting both workers and employers. Contrary to  some of the misleading rhetoric we have heard today, nothing in this  bill undermines worker protections. In fact, the bill ensures workers  know exactly who their employer is under Federal law.   I urge all Members to do what is best for the workers and local job  creators in their district by voting in favor of H.R. 3441, the Save  Local Business Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, this motion is just another attempt to ignore  the real damage caused by the NLRB's expanded and unworkable joint  employer standard which continues to hurt local businessowners and  their workers.   Let's not get distracted by this motion. Instead, let's focus on the  bipartisan solution which is pending: H.R. 3441, the Save Local  Business Act, which simply restores a commonsense definition of  employer to provide certainty and stability for workers and employers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to  recommit and ``yes'' on the Save Local Business Act, and I yield back  the balance of my time.  [[Page H8580]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
