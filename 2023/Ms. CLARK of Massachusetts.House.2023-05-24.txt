 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago today, the  American people were reeling from a white supremacist terror attack in  Buffalo, New York.   Families were grieving 10 Black Americans who had been targeted by an  ethno-nationalist and murdered for the color of their skin.   Loved ones were still organizing funerals for the victims of  America's latest mass shooting, and then we saw the breaking news from  Uvalde, Texas--another active mass murder; another crowd of desperate,  panicked parents surrounding a school under siege; another statistic,  21 shot and killed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I don't know how my  colleagues across the aisle who voted for the default on America act  are going to look our veterans in the eye this Memorial Day.   You have presented our country with an impossible choice: devastating  cuts or devastating default, hungry families or homeless seniors, kids  without classrooms or parents without jobs, empty VA clinics or empty  savings accounts.   Now you are sending us home with no resolution. That is the plan: to  default, to run out the clock.   Well, I have some good news for you. Madam Speaker, 213 Members of  the Democratic Caucus have signed the discharge petition.   So before you go home, it only takes five patriots to join us in the  fight for the American people. Join us. Sign the petition. Stay here  and fight for American families. Fight for their American security.
