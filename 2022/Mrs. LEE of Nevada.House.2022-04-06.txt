 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate West  Career and Technical Academy's We the People team. They are not only  studying history; they are making it.   Mr. Speaker, 1999 was the last time a southern Nevada We the People  team qualified for nationals. But now, 14 students from West Tech's We  the People team have changed that.   As part of We the People, these students are going that extra mile in  their civic education to study our history, our Constitution, and our  democracy.   To Mrs. Rozar and all the outstanding We the People teachers, we say  thank you.   I have no doubt of West Tech's success later this month when they  compete here in Washington, but I am even more excited to watch where  this passion takes them as leaders in Nevada's future.   Congratulations to West Tech's We the People team, and good luck in  D.C.                            ____________________
