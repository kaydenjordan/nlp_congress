 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4171) to amend title 5, United States Code, to extend the  authority to conduct telework travel expenses test programs, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4171         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT TELEWORK TRAVEL                     EXPENSES TEST PROGRAMS.         (a) In General.--Section 5711(g) of title 5, United States       Code, is amended by striking ``7 years after the date of the       enactment of the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010'' and       inserting ``on December 31, 2020''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect as though enacted on December 1, 2017.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4171, a bill I  introduced with Congressman Connolly, to extend Federal agencies'  authority to conduct a telework pilot program.   The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 provided Federal agencies, and  specifically the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with the authority  to conduct a pilot program to incentivize telework. The pilot program  allows agencies to waive the reimbursement of travel costs for  teleworking employees who return to headquarters for mandatory training  programs.   Both agencies and employees benefit from this arrangement. Agencies  benefit from having an additional tool for recruitment and retention.  Agencies also realize cost savings by allowing employees to work at  different locations.   For example, according to the USPTO, its telework program saved $77.4  million in fiscal year 2016 alone. The savings are related to lower  real estate costs and increased personnel retention.   In turn, teleworking employees can work from almost anywhere in the  United States. The teleworking program moves USPTO employees into the  communities that they serve. For example, in my State of Montana, the  pilot program allowed the USPTO to place patent examiners in Bozeman,  Butte, Billings, and Missoula.   Teleworking can grow opportunities in our communities that aren't  close to highly populated areas that house Federal agencies. It has the  promise of bringing more good-paying jobs to Montana and other rural  areas across the country.   Now that agencies are seeing the cost savings associated with  telework, this pilot program can be wound down. Absent congressional  action, this program expired last week. However, the USPTO has  requested an extension in order to allow it to budget for increased  travel expenses related to paying for employees to return to agency  headquarters in northern Virginia or one of its regional offices. This  bill extends the program for 3 years.   I thank the congressman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), for working  with me in a bipartisan fashion to bring this bill to the floor. I urge  my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would make the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Demings) aware that I have no further speakers and I am prepared  to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1208) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 9155 Schaefer Road, Converse, Texas, as the  ``Converse Veterans Post Office Building''.
