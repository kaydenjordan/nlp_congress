 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding  constituent and volunteer firefighter from the 22nd District, Neil  Sutherland, otherwise known as ``Suds.''   Neil has been a member of the Stittville Fire Department since 1965  and fire chief since 1998. Throughout his 53 years of dedicated fire  service, Chief Sutherland has led the Stittville Fire Department to  become one of the most well-respected departments in the State.   Stittville Fire Department is also one of the busiest fire  departments in our region, handling over 220 calls a month. Incredibly,  Chief Suds Sutherland has responded to 90 percent of those calls.   Chief Sutherland is also an active player on the Stittville Volunteer  softball team, the undefeated league champions for the past 3 years.   Recently, Chief Sutherland was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On  Saturday, I had the honor of joining our community and the Sutherland  family at a beautiful ceremony benefiting Chief Sutherland and his  dedication and service to our community.   Tragically, medical research shows that firefighters have a much  greater risk of contracting cancer due to increased exposure to smoke  and toxins.   Chief Sutherland's enduring spirit and unwavering commitment to  community is an inspiration to us all. I ask everyone to join me in  sending our thoughts and our prayers to Chief Sutherland, otherwise  lovingly known as ``Suds,'' and his family during his courageous battle  to beat cancer.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding and for bringing up this very important issue.   I just want to make a few comments, and I just want to say, what  makes the United States exceptional among all nations is the moral  courage and leadership we have displayed throughout our history.   So many times, in the face of great terror and significant moral  crisis, the United States has acted as a force for good. We have  supported our allies to restore order where there was once chaos. Where  people have been suffering famine and drought, we have stepped up to  provide food and water. Time and again, the world has faced crises, and  the United States has stepped up to defend the moral good.   The crisis in Myanmar presents yet another challenge for the global  community, but in this moral crisis is yet another opportunity for our  Nation to once again lead.   As we speak, the Rohingya people are suffering undue hardship and  violence under a government that has failed to uphold the values  inherent to a vibrant democracy.   It has been reported that an average of 2,000 Rohingya are fleeing  the country each day. Denied basic rights for decades, the Rohingya  people have been subject to systematic discrimination as a religious  minority in a predominantly Buddhist country. The state has gone so far  as to completely deny citizenship to the Rohingya people since 1982.    Serious accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide have been  leveled against the government, which has failed to respond  appropriately to the calls for calm and peace.   While the government has the right to defend itself against any form  of insurgency, common, agreed-upon rules of warfare dictate that all  civilians be protected. This rule is sacred and must not be broken.  Despite this, reports of abuse against civilians are running rampant in  Myanmar.   More than 200 villages have been destroyed, many burned to the ground  by government forces. Communities are being wiped away as hundreds,  possibly even thousands, of civilians are slaughtered. The crisis  demands our immediate attention.   Just recently, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing,  and Chairman Royce stated plainly: ``This is ethnic cleansing.''   Mr. Speaker, I must agree.   Every conflict is complex, and this one is no different, but it must  be made clear that under no conditions should the rights of innocent  civilians be abridged. To the Government of Myanmar, we must make it  equally as clear that their behavior will not be tolerated.   I recently met with constituents from Myanmar in my district office.  Utica, the largest city in New York's 22nd Congressional District, is  home to a vibrant refugee community. We are home to the largest Bosnian  refugee population in the Nation, a population that was also fleeing  ethnic cleansing in their own home country of the former Yugoslavia.   My constituents shared with me their personal stories and deep  despair over the violence in their home country. They asked that I do  all I can to make their voices heard, and tonight I am proud to speak  on their behalf.   They shared with me horrific pictures of violence and death, of  torture of children, of young people, of women, of men, of families. It  was simply just appalling.   Mr. Speaker, when our Nation faces moral challenges, it is in our  nature not to back down. I must insist that this time be no different.  I call on my colleagues to stand up and speak out and to act on this  important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas and my colleague for  highlighting this very important issue. I urge all of my colleagues to  understand this is a tragedy of major proportions that is happening in  our world today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas again for bringing this  issue to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, this is so important. I really am grateful  to my friend from Texas for doing this.
