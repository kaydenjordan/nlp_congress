 Madam Speaker, I rise today in complete support of H.R.  5376, the Inflation Reduction Act.   During my time in Congress, I have dedicated my service to improving  our healthcare system and working to lower the cost of prescription  drugs. I am ecstatic that the bill before us today includes my and  Representative Peters drug price reduction framework that will finally  rein in the cost of prescription drugs for our seniors and protect  pharmaceutical innovation, contrary to what the other side will tell  you.   The Medicare drug cost reductions will be transformative. The bill  will allow Medicare to finally negotiate drug prices and the practice  of raising prices in the Medicare program beyond the rising inflation  and provide lasting financial relief to our most vulnerable seniors by  establishing a $2,000 out-of-pocket maximum for spending on  prescription drugs.   The prescription drug cost portions of this bill will also preserve  scientific creativity and the innovation ecosystem that has been  essential to the domestic job-preserving development of life changing  and lifesaving treatments and cures.   And the close to $300 billion in deficit reduction from this portion  of the bill will be huge for the overall viability of our troubled  Medicare system going forward. This will be the biggest improvement to  Medicare since the inception of part D almost 20 years ago. I am proud  to have been a leading advocate to deliver relief on the high cost of  prescription drugs.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues in both Chambers who worked with  me directly to get this across the finish line.
