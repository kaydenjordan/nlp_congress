 Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor  of recognizing the team at the Tongue River Winery, in Custer County,  for having the skill, patience, and dedication required to produce  quality wines on the high plains of eastern Montana. Despite a  difficult growing climate, this humble, family-run operation has  successfully combined vineyard and winery functions and has received  numerous awards and recognition for their efforts.   The married couple of Bob and Marilyn Thaden, along with their son  Josh, are the team that makes the Tongue River Winery successful; 2017  marks the fifth consecutive year that the Tongue River Winery has won  the Granite Peak Award. This award is presented to the top Montana  winery at the Northwest Wine Summit.   For Bob, this year marks his 50th anniversary making wine. It has  also been about 50 years since he met his wife, Marilyn, so it comes as  no surprise that, when asked about winemaking, he compares the process  of selecting good grapes to courtship. Bob reflected, ``it's like  courtship, plant the wrong one and you will regret it for a long time;  take your time, choose carefully, so not to be disappointed later on.''  Bob has selected wisely in both endeavors. His advice on being  thoughtful and patient can be applied to many other areas of life.   In the years ahead, I wish Bob, Marilyn, and Josh all the best as  they continue to cultivate and create uniquely Montana wines. For their  efforts, I raise my glass to the team at the Tongue River  Winery.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the resolution be printed in the Record.
