This transmittal reports the replacement of fifty-eight       (58) AGM-114A Hellfire Missiles (MDE) with fifty-eight (58)       AGM-114R (NN) Hellfire Missiles (MDE); four (4) M36E8 Inert       Hellfire Captive Air Training Missiles (CATMs) (MDE) with       four (4) M36E9 Inert Hellfire CATMs (MDE); and one hundred       fourteen (114) Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS-      II) WGU-59B Guidance Sections (MDE) with one hundred fourteen       (114) Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS-II) WGU-      59/B Guidance Sections (Single Variant) (MDE). No additional       quantities will be provided. The estimated MDE value will       remain $189.7 million. The total case value will remain       $214.7 million.        (iv) Significance: These proposed weapons systems will       augment the Czech Republic's multi-mission, multi-role       helicopters, increasing the Czech Republic's ability to meet       current and future threats.        (v) Justification: The proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by improving the security of a NATO ally that is an       important force for political stability and economic progress       in Europe. It is vital to U.S. national interests to assist       the Czech Republic in developing and maintaining a strong and       ready self-defense capability.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The AGM-114R Hellfire       Missile is an air-to-surface missile with a multi-mission,       multi-target, precision strike capability. The M36E9 is an       inert Hellfire Captive Air Training Missile.        The Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) is an       air-to ground weapon that consists of an APKWS Guidance       Section (GS), legacy 2.75-inch MK66 Mod 4 rocket motor, and       legacy MK152 and MK435/436 warhead/fuze. The APKWS is a       tactical rocket system that can be launched from several       platforms, offering multi-mission, multi-target capability       and precision-strike lethality. These guided rockets are       steered to the target by following reflected laser beam       energy directed onto the target either by the launching       aircraft, a second aircraft, or ground-based troops operating       a laser designator.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.

The original FMS case, valued at $1.87       million, included forty (40) GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs,       Increment I. Therefore, this notification is for a total of       two hundred seventy-nine (279) GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs,       Increment I; two hundred four (204) FMU-152 fuzes; two       hundred four (204) MK-82 500LB General Purpose Bombs; and       fifty (50) BLU-109 2000LB Hard Target Penetrator Bombs.

The total estimated cost       is $22.7 million.        This proposed sale supports the foreign policy and national       security of the United States by increasing the flexibility       of Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece,       Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,       Spain, and the United Kingdom, twelve NATO nations and one       NATO enhanced opportunity partner nation, to contribute to       overseas contingency operations. This sale increases the       quantity of precision-guided munitions within NATO and allows       for their pre-coordinated transfer in support of national and       NATO requirements.        The proposed sale will improve NATO's capability to meet       current and future ground threats with precision. NATO will       use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional       threats, and to increase interoperability within contingency       operations. Many of the purchasing nations already have       precision-guided munitions in their inventories and will all       have no difficulty absorbing these munitions into its armed       forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors for production are the Boeing       Corporation, St Louis, MO; and Raytheon Missile Systems,       Tucson, AZ. The principal contractor for integration is       unknown and will be determined during contract negotiations.       There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection       with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to NATO.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.

If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that NATO Support and       Procurement Agency (NSPA) and the participating countries can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       NSPA, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece,       Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,       Spain, and the United Kingdom.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the Committee on Foreign Relations I  report favorably the following nomination list which was printed in the  Record on the date indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the  expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that this nomination  lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.
