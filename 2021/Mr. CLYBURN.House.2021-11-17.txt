 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this censure resolution.  Today's action is necessary due to Representative Gosar's shocking  depiction of a murder of a colleague and a violent attack against the  President of the United States. This incendiary behavior cannot go  unaddressed. The minority leader's failure to hold his conference  Member accountable leaves us no choice but to proceed with this action.   I often refer to the Hall of this House as America's classroom. As  Members of this august body, we should conduct ourselves in the way  that we want our students to emulate. Mr. Gosar's behavior fails our  students, fails our colleagues, and fails our Nation and ideals we  espouse.   Madam Speaker, I urge a unanimous vote for this resolution.
