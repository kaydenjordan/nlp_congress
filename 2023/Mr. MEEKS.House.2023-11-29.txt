 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to say to my Republican  colleagues: Stop the xenophobic rhetoric about asylum seekers and draft  some meaningful policy that addresses the migrant crisis in New York  and across this country.   Deception and extremism are what my colleagues across the aisle are  spewing. In this so-called piece of legislation, they claim that  Federal land will be hurt. The Floyd Bennett Field lease does not put  any of our public lands in harm's way.   In fact, this same field was used 11 years ago during Superstorm  Sandy as a disaster relief center for New Yorkers displaced by the  hurricane. Republicans had zero opposition to that.   Those who are voicing their feigned concern for our public lands are  the same people who have repeatedly pushed policies to defund and  degrade our public lands. In this Congress alone, Republicans are  trying to slash the National Park Service's budget by nearly half a  billion dollars. These are not ideas of a party that has actual  concerns about our public lands and parks.   Instead, this is an example of extremists trying to push policies  that vilify migrants rather than provide sensible solutions to a real  crisis.                                time  1500    Democrats, on the other hand, are working every day to put people  over politics. The Biden administration, for example, granted temporary  protected status to one-half million Venezuelans so they can  financially support their families and join the American workforce as  they await their asylum court dates. Now those are real results in  putting people over politics.   Democrats are ready to work on legislation that addresses the migrant  crisis in a humanitarian manner, but we need Republicans to stop  wasting time with their terrible and extreme bills and join us in  getting back to work.
