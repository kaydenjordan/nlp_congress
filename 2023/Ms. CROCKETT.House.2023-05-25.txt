 Madam Speaker, my Republican colleagues love to pray  but can't stay, stay and do the job we were elected to do because,  frankly, they aren't capable of governing.   Don't believe me?   Just think back to the first few days that we were here, the days in  which they were so dysfunctional that they had to go through 15 rounds  before we could get to a Speaker.   Now, mark my words, he is dragging this out, and, unfortunately, the  entire country is going into a tailspin not because they care about  being fiscally responsible but more so because he cares about his  precious Speakership.   We have seen the words of the radical right Republicans and what he  said last week, and this is all about holding us hostage.   Let me tell you something: My constituents deserve better. My  constituents deserve to have a House that functions and stays and does  the job instead of deciding that it is time to go and play.    I have a constituent that has called my office in north Texas talking  about the fact that he could not get his Federal retirement for months.  Well, guess what? We finally got it pushed through, but leave it up to  this House, and he won't get what he deserved and what he worked for.   Working families deserve a House that will stay instead of play.                            ____________________
