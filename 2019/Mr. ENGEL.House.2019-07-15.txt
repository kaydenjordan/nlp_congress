Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure, and I want to  start by thanking Mr. McCaul for his partnership in authoring this  legislation. Through our close, bipartisan collaboration, we have  before us today legislation that supports the people of Central America  and strengthens our national security by addressing the root causes of  child and family migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.   I was leading a congressional delegation to El Salvador with Mr.  McCaul in March when the Trump administration decided to cut off  foreign assistance in the region, a decision that I view as misguided  and counterproductive.   In San Salvador, we saw up close the direct, meaningful impact of our  USAID investments. Our delegation visited with an incredible group of  young people who were being trained in computer programming and offered  a path to a better life.   The United States is helping to provide opportunities for a better  future for the people of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras so  children and families are able to build prosperous lives for  themselves, and they aren't forced to make the dangerous journey to our  southern border.   But it is not just development assistance we are providing. In San  Salvador, we met with FBI agents leading our transnational antigang  task force. With State Department funding, the FBI established these  task forces in the Northern Triangle over the past decade to counter  the growth of MS-13, the 18th Street gang, and other violent criminals.   These units train Salvadorian police officers and work closely with  them to dismantle gang leadership structures in the United States and  Central America. They make our communities and constituents safer.   So I was pleased to return to Washington and partner with Mr. McCaul  to draft this legislation authorizing our assistance to Central America  for fiscal year 2020. The bill also includes strong conditions on any  assistance that goes to the central governments of the Northern  Triangle countries.   In addition, it lays out a series of actions to be taken by the  Secretary of State, the USAID Administrator, and other U.S. Government  officials to promote inclusive economic growth and development, combat  corruption, strengthen domestic institutions, and improve security  conditions in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.   Lastly, it puts in place targeted visa bans and asset freezes for  corrupt individuals from the Northern Triangle countries.   Endemic corruption by government and nongovernment actors in Central  America is hurting the region's poor and most vulnerable people, and we  should do whatever we can to stop it. Today, the House of  Representatives must stand together to pass this commonsense piece of  legislation that helps the United States and families and children in  the Northern Triangle.   So, I again thank Mr. McCaul for his partnership and for working with  me to address the root causes of migration to the U.S. from Central  America. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                       Washington, DC, June 5, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       2615, the United States-Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement       Act.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary. I acknowledge that the Committee will not seek a       referral of or formally consider H.R. 2615 and agree that the       inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does not       waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in H.R. 2615 which fall within your Committee's       Rule X jurisdiction.  [[Page H5785]]         I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.                                   ____                                                                             House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                       Washington, DC, July 8, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to advise you that the Committee       on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to review the       provisions in H.R. 2615, the ``United States-Northern       Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act,'' that fall within our Rule       X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to waive       sequential referral, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, let me thank Mr. McCaul, and it is a pleasure  to work with him on matters like this.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Providing opportunities for the most vulnerable individuals from El  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras is common sense, and working to  address the root causes of child and family migration is a long-term  solution that we should all be able to agree on. It is the right thing  to do, but it is also in our own interest.   And while U.S. foreign assistance is crucial, it is not a gift. It  must come with strong conditions. Our legislation puts in place such  conditions for our assistance to the Northern Triangle and includes  tough, smart, targeted sanctions to combat corruption.   By passing this bill today, Congress can send, and will send, a loud  and clear message that we stand with the people of the Northern  Triangle countries to make their countries safer and more prosperous so  they aren't forced to make the dangerous trek here. We can also send a  message to China and Russia that the U.S. will not abandon our friends  and partners in Central America.   Let me conclude by thanking Mr. McCaul for his partnership on this  measure. We truly worked on this together. We were together in Central  America when we got the word of the potential cutoff of funding, and we  worked closely together in a bipartisan way to make sure that that  wouldn't be the case.   So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I thank Mr.  McCaul again, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2744) to authorize the Administrator of the United States Agency  for International Development to prescribe the manner in which programs  of the agency are identified overseas, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 2744         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``USAID Branding Modernization       Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR BRANDING.         (a) In General.--The Administrator of the United States       Agency for International Development (USAID) is authorized to       prescribe, as appropriate, the use of logos or other insignia       of the USAID Identity, or the use of additional or substitute       markings including the United States flag, to appropriately       identify, including as required by section 641 of the Foreign       Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2401), overseas programs       administered by the Agency.        (b) Audit.--Not later than one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Inspector General of the United       States Agency for International Development shall submit to       Congress an audit of compliance with relevant branding and       marketing requirements of the Agency by implementing partners       funded by the USAID, including any requirements prescribed       pursuant to the authorization under subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2744.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking my friend from Texas once  again, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. McCaul,  for his hard work on this measure. I am glad to be a cosponsor.   Mr. Speaker, our development efforts around the world accomplish so  much.   Whether it is helping build a road that links a small village to a  trade hub, working with governments to make their justice systems more  transparent and accountable, assisting communities to get clean  drinking water, or expanding access to broadband internet in rural  areas, American development work is making differences you can see in  people's lives. It is also projecting our country's character of  compassion and generosity.   So when I travel around the world and I see the USAID logo--it is  that recognizable seal of two hands clasped in friendship--on the front  door of a new school or a wastewater treatment facility or a pallet of  food on its way to refugees, it makes me proud. It really does.   The people benefiting from that assistance should know where it is  coming from, too. We should signal to the world our commitment to  development is a core pillar of America's global engagement.   This legislation reaffirms the obligation to brand our foreign  assistance while continuing to provide needed flexibility to ensure we  are not putting our partners or aid recipients at risk. It requires a  long overdue audit to ensure that USAID projects are appropriately  branded in the field.   This is something Mr. McCaul and I have been working on closely  together.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter on this issue that Mr.  McCaul and I wrote to the USAID administrator, our former House  colleague, Mark Green.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.      Mr. Mark Green,      Administrator, U.S. Agency for International Development,           Washington, DC.        Dear Administrator Green: We write to you today to       reiterate the Congressional intent behind HR 2744, the USAID       Branding Modernization Act, which we have introduced in the       116th Congress.        Providing foreign assistance around the world demonstrates       the generosity of Americans, and furthers our foreign policy       objectives. Branding foreign assistance is always the first       preference, to ensure that those receiving assistance know       that support comes from the American people. As such, the       Congress believes, and has affirmed, that in general, foreign       assistance provided using U.S. taxpayer dollars should be       branded, as appropriate. This demonstrates U.S. commitment to       assisting those in need, be it through food aid after a       drought, job training to empower women entrepreneurs, or       life-saving vaccines to eradicate polio.        That said, Congress acknowledges the need for discretion       and flexibility in branding in some instances to ensure the       safety and security of both implementing partners and       beneficiaries. This bill in no way amends that understanding,       or any authorities, which would impact the ability or need       for USAID to provide branding waivers or exemptions as       appropriate, with input from and ongoing communication with       implementing partners. As referenced in the legislation, 22       USC 2401 asserts that programs ``shall be identified       appropriately overseas''. Federal Register rules and       regulations under 2 CFR Part 700 provide waivers to ensure       that branding does not put partners or beneficiaries at risk,       and USAID internal guidance regarding marking and branding       policies remain at the discretion of the Agency.        Finally, this bill requires an audit, conducted by the       Inspector General for USAID, on the compliance with relevant       branding and marking requirements. This is not intended to       re-litigate branding decisions regarding waivers or       exemptions that are already in place. Rather, this audit is       intended to provide a more comprehensive picture for USAID,       its implementing partners, and Congress, of the challenges to       successful branding and marking, and how to better       communicate, provide guidance, and implement, branding and       marking requirements.        We appreciate USAID's ongoing efforts to save lives, reduce       poverty, strengthen democratic governance, and help people       emerge from humanitarian crises, to advance a free, peaceful,       and prosperous world. We look forward to continuing to work       with USAID on effective foreign assistance.            Sincerely,      Eliot L. Engel,        Chairman.      Michael T. McCaul,        Ranking Member.     Mr. Speaker, I am glad we will be moving ahead with this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, let me again thank my friend, Ranking Member McCaul, for  his leadership on this bill.   One of the things that makes American foreign policy unique is that  when we are at our best, our values are at the center of everything we  do. I think one of the most important American values is that we are a  generous and big-hearted country. We invest in development because  development and security go hand-in-hand, but also because it is the  right thing to do. It allows more people to live fuller, healthier,  more prosperous lives.   We should take credit for that. We should let people know it is the  United States extending a hand of friendship and assistance. That is  the goal that this bill is pursuing.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to support this bill, I encourage all Members  to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 441) a resolution condemning the attack on the AMIA  Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 1994 and  expressing the concern of the United States regarding the continuing,  25-year-long delay in the resolution of this case and encouraging  accountability for the attack.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows                                H. Res. 441         Whereas, 25 years ago, on July 18, 1994, 85 innocent people       were killed and 300 were wounded when the Argentine Jewish       Mutual Association (AMIA) was bombed in Buenos Aires,       Argentina;        Whereas, 2 years earlier, Hezbollah operatives also blew up       the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 29 civilians;        Whereas it is reported that considerable evidence links the       attack to the terrorist group Hezbollah, which is based in       Lebanon, supported by the Government of the Syrian Arab       Republic, and sponsored by the Government of the Islamic       Republic of Iran;        Whereas the 25 years since the bombing have been marked by       a failure to bring those responsible, including Iranian       officials and their Hezbollah proxies, to justice;        Whereas, in September 2004, Alberto Nisman was appointed as       the Special Prosecutor in charge of the 1994 AMIA bombing       investigation;        Whereas, on October 25, 2006, Argentine prosecutors Alberto       Nisman and Marcelo Martinez Burgos formally accused the       Government of Iran of directing the bombing, and the       Hezbollah militia of carrying it out;        Whereas Ibrahim Hussein Berro, a member of the terrorist       group Hezbollah, was identified as the AMIA bomber;        Whereas, in November 2006, an Argentine judge issued arrest       warrants for Iranian nationals Ali Fallahijan (former Iranian       intelligence minister), Mohsen Rabbani (former Iranian       cultural attache), Ahmad Reza Asghari (former Iranian       diplomat), Ahmad Vahidi (former Iranian defense minister),       Ali Akbar Velayati (former Iranian foreign minister), Mohsen       Rezaee (former chief commander of the Iranian Islamic       Revolutionary Guards Corps), Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani       (former President of Iran), Hadi Soleimanpour (former Iranian       Ambassador to Argentina), and Lebanese national Imad Fayez       Moughnieh who were named as suspects in the AMIA bombing;        Whereas, in November 2007, INTERPOL voted to put the       following suspects in the 1994 AMIA attack on its most wanted       list--Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rabbani, Ahmad Reza Asghari,       Ahmad Vahidi, and Mohsen Razaee from Iran and Imad Fayez       Moughnieh from Lebanon;        Whereas Interpol currently has 4 red alerts in place in       relation to the AMIA attack;        Whereas, on January 13, 2015, prosecutor Alberto Nisman       alleged in a complaint that then-Argentinian President       Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and then-Minister of Foreign       Relations Hector Timerman conspired to cover up Iranian       involvement in the 1994 terrorist bombing, and reportedly       agreed to negotiate immunity for Iranian suspects and help       get their names removed from the INTERPOL list;        Whereas prosecutor Alberto Nisman was scheduled to present       his new findings to the Argentinian Congress on January 19,       2015;        Whereas prosecutor Alberto Nisman was found shot in the       head in his apartment in Buenos Aires on January 18, 2015;        Whereas the investigation of the AMIA bombing has been       marked by judicial misconduct;        Whereas, in March 2019, an Argentine court handed down       convictions and sentences, finding that the judge,       prosecutors, and head of the Argentina's secret services--the       individuals responsible for investigating the AMIA bombing,       Argentina's deadliest terrorist attack--had interfered with       the inquiry, diverting the investigation away from the truth;        Whereas former Federal judge Juan Jose Galeano was handed       down a 6-year conviction by the court, which will not be       enforced until the sentence is confirmed by a higher       tribunal;        Whereas former State Intelligence Secretariat (SIDE)       intelligence head Hugo Anzorreguy was handed a prison       sentence of 54 months;        Whereas Carlos Telleldin, a used car dealer who sold the       van that contained the bomb used to attack AMIA and received       a bribe to incriminate police officers falsely, was sentenced       to 42 months in jail; and        Whereas no Iranian suspects for the AMIA bombing have yet       faced prosecution: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reiterates its strongest condemnation of the 1994       attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires,       Argentina, and honors the victims of this heinous act;        (2) expresses its sympathy to the relatives of the victims,       who have waited a quarter of a century without justice for       the loss of their loved ones, and may have to wait even       longer for justice to be served;        (3) underscores the concern of the United States regarding       the continuing, 25-year-long delay in the proper resolution       of this case; and        (4) expresses strong support for accountability for this       attack, including against those Iranian and Hezbollah       operatives who were responsible.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 441, a resolution  condemning the attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos  Aires, Argentina, in July 1994, 25 years ago this month.   I have been to that community center. It is a vibrant community  center.  [[Page H5788]]  It was a horrific bombing that happened 25 years ago.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Mr. Deutch for  authoring this resolution and for his years of leadership advocating  for justice for the victims of the AMIA bombing.   In July of 1994, the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires was  bombed. Eighty-five innocent people were killed and at least 300 people  were wounded. Almost 25 years later, this heartbreaking tragedy and  vicious act of anti-Semitism still is an open wound. Justice has not  been served.   This hits close to my heart. I have visited AMIA twice to meet with  the community there and pay my respects to the victims and the  Argentine Jewish community.   For 25 years, the Argentine people have been waiting for the  perpetrators of this horrific act of violence and hate to be brought to  justice.   So, I am glad we are considering this resolution today to keep this  issue on the front burner and to continue to show solidarity with the  victims.   The measure before us condemns the AMIA attack and expresses the  United States' condolences to the families of the 85 victims.   This resolution also makes it clear that those responsible for the  murder of innocent civilians must be held accountable. Years of  investigation have found that the perpetrators of this attack were  Hezbollah operatives with strong links to Iranian Government officials.   Despite the international outcry and a stack of Interpol red notices  demanding that these individuals be brought to justice, Iran refuses to  hold the perpetrators accountable. Par for the course for the  Government of Iran.   It is the duty of all of us here in Congress to stand with the  Argentine people as they demand that those responsible face  consequences for their crimes.   I hope our friends in the Argentine Government and justice system  will do everything they can to finally provide closure for the victims'  families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 441.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), chairman of the Subcommittee on the Middle East,  North Africa, and International Terrorism.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, it is an outrage that, after all these years, there  still hasn't been justice for the AMIA bombing victims and their  families.   This resolution today is a message to the Argentine Jewish community,  and to marginalized, victimized communities around the world, that the  United States will not forget them and will continue to push for  justice.   I am glad my colleague mentioned the prosecutor, Alberto Nisman,  because what happened to him, to be murdered a day before he was to  present his work, is absolutely a disgrace. Some in the government even  [[Page H5789]]  tried to say that it was a suicide, but we know it was not.   I hope that we get to the bottom of the truth and that Mr. Nisman is  honored, which he should be. It is just an absolute disgrace that he  was murdered.   Again, I thank Mr. Deutch for authorizing this important resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it, and I  yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 432) condemning the attacks on peaceful protesters  and supporting an immediate peaceful transition to a civilian-led  democratic government in Sudan, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 432         Whereas in 2016, the Government of the United States       launched a plan aimed at reducing conflict and expanding       humanitarian access in Sudan, improving counterterrorism       cooperation, ending Sudan's negative interference in South       Sudan, and addressing the threat of the Lord's Resistance       Army, that, according to the Department of State, led to       significant progress in these areas and resulted in the       lifting of some United States sanctions on Sudan in October       2017;        Whereas the Department of State announced ``Phase II'' of       the bilateral reengagement framework with Sudan in November       2018, under which the United States would consider rescinding       Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism if the       country met the relevant statutory criteria for delisting and       if the Government of Sudan made progress along six identified       areas of concern related to counterterrorism cooperation,       humanitarian access, respect for human rights, a cessation of       internal hostilities and a conducive environment for peace       processes, efforts to address outstanding terrorism-related       legal claims, and adherence to United Nations Security       Council resolutions on North Korea;        Whereas despite the Government of Sudan's pledge to cease       hostilities, the United Nations Panel of Experts on the Sudan       reported in January 2019 that forces of the Government of       Sudan had launched ``large-scale military operations''       against insurgents in the Jebel Marra region of Darfur in       2018 and that elements of Sudan's Rapid Support Forces and       associated militia were implicated in indiscriminate       shootings, rape, acts of torture, and other inhumane       treatment of civilians;        Whereas the Department of State's country reports on human       rights practices describe reports of serious human rights       violations by Sudan's intelligence service and military,       including the Rapid Support Forces, citing credible reports       that villages in Jebel Marra were targeted for attack in       2018, resulting in the displacement of thousands of civilians       and noting that Sudan's Rapid Support Forces were implicated       in the majority of reported human rights violations against       civilians in the country;        Whereas contrary to the requirements of Phase II,       humanitarian organizations report that humanitarian access       restrictions have persisted, including bureaucratic       interference, and reports of serious human rights abuses and       media censorship increased after Phase II was launched;        Whereas in December 2018, protests that began in Damazin       and Atbara spread across the country, with thousands of       Sudanese gathering to demand political change;        Whereas the Sudanese authorities responded to the protests       by detaining hundreds of people, including protesters,       members of the political opposition, civil society,       journalists, and more than a dozen American citizens, and by       using excessive and lethal force against protesters;        Whereas in late February 2019, President Bashir declared a       yearlong nationwide state of emergency, dissolving the       Federal and State governments and appointing senior military       officers to key government posts, banning unauthorized       gatherings, demonstrations, and strikes, expanding       authorization for searches, seizures, and arrests, and       barring news deemed to undermine his government;        Whereas tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of protesters       gathered in Khartoum on April 6, 2019, calling for the end of       the government of President Bashir, and on April 11, 2019, he       was ousted from power by the military and replaced by Defense       Minister and First Vice President Lt. Gen. Ahmed Awad Ibn       Auf, who later ceded power to Military Inspector General and       Army Chief Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan;        Whereas Lt. Gen. Burhan stated that his Transitional       Military Council is committed to transferring power to a       civilian government, but the Council has sought to maintain       the military's dominance in negotiations with opposition       representatives on a transitional arrangement;        Whereas protesters maintained their vigil in Khartoum,       calling for the military to transfer power to a civilian-led       transitional authority that would end Sudan's civil wars,       address the country's economic crisis, and lay the       foundations for democratic elections;        Whereas the Transitional Military Council has not met the       demands of the protesters and the African Union Peace and       Security Council to ``step aside and hand over power to a       civilian-led transitional authority, in accordance with the       will of the people and constitutional order'';        Whereas on June 3rd, elements of Sudanese security forces,       led by the Rapid Support Forces, violently dispersed the sit-      in of the protesters and killed over 100 people, with       hundreds more injured and reports of rape and other human       rights abuses committed;        Whereas negotiations between the Transitional Military       Council and the opposition coalition, known as the Forces for       Freedom and Change, on the composition and powers of a       transitional government are complicated by the role of       individuals in the Military Council who have been accused of       war crimes, by the Council's insistence on Islamic Sharia law       as the basis for laws, and by security forces use of live       fire against protesters in the cities of Nyala, Zalingei, and       Khartoum, resulting in multiple deaths, during the talks; and        Whereas in the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004,       Congress expressed its sense that individuals found to be       involved in the planning or carrying out of genocide, war       crimes, or crimes against humanity should not hold leadership       positions in the Government of Sudan: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) stands in solidarity with the people of Sudan and       strongly supports the right of the Sudanese people to       assemble peacefully and express their legitimate demands for       fundamental political change, including a democratic,       civilian-led government;        (2) condemns the Government of Sudan's use of violence and       arbitrary detention against peaceful protesters and the       harassment and intimidation of medical professionals,       journalists, human rights defenders, political opposition,       and civil society actors;  [[Page H5790]]         (3) strongly supports an immediate transfer of power by the       military to an inclusive, civilian-led government that       reflects the aspirations of the Sudanese people and puts       Sudan on the path toward democracy and peace;        (4) condemns efforts by regional actors to undermine       negotiations between the Military Council and the protesters,       including efforts to offer financial support to military       leaders;        (5) encourages the African Union and its member states to       continue supporting the Sudanese people's aspirations for       democracy, justice, and peace;        (6) urges the United States Government to continue efforts       to convene and work with the international community in       support of a civilian-led government in Sudan;        (7) emphasizes that a more positive and productive       relationship between the United States and Sudan requires       meaningful political reform, greater accountability, and a       clear demonstration by the Government of Sudan of greater       respect for human rights;        (8) calls upon Sudanese authorities to--        (A) immediately cease attacks on protesters and civilians,       respect the right to freedom of association and expression,       and investigate protester deaths and pursue accountability       for serious crimes and human rights abuses that have occurred       in the past three decades;        (B) protect the rights of political parties, journalists,       human rights defenders, religious minorities, and       nongovernmental organizations to operate without interference       and release political prisoners;        (C) lift the bureaucratic restrictions on, and facilitate       unhindered access across the country for, humanitarian relief       operations;        (D) introduce strong measures to create transparency and       address the structural corruption and kleptocracy of the       state;        (E) meaningfully engage with opposition forces in Darfur,       Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile with the aim of achieving a       just and sustainable peace; and        (F) foster conditions for a viable transition to democracy,       economic stability, and sustainable peace and development;       and        (9) calls upon the people of Sudan to work together to       resolve conflicts peacefully.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 432.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me first thank Representatives Kildee, Bilirakis,  and McGovern, our Speaker pro tempore, for their hard work on this  measure. I was glad to join as an original cosponsor, as well.   Sudan is at a critical moment, Mr. Speaker. Three months ago, when  the Transitional Military Council, the TMC, seized power, one of my top  concerns was when the reins will be turned over to civilian  authorities. Despite the possibility of a breakthrough between the TMC  and the Forces of Freedom and Change, the FFC, I remain concerned that  Sudanese security forces intend to tighten their grip on power once  again and even more. The sad fact is, for the overwhelming majority of  its history since independence, Sudan has been ruled by military  dictatorships.   This group, the TMC, has shown the world who they really are, and it  is not a pretty picture. On June 3, they turned on the peaceful  prodemocracy movement, committing a brutal massacre at the movement's  sit-in site.   Following that atrocity, the TMC shut the internet down in a blatant  attempt to slow the momentum of antigovernment protestors and kill the  prodemocracy movement in its infancy.   Now that internet access has slowly been restored, the world is  getting its first glimpses of deeply disturbing images: Sudan's  citizens being murdered, tortured, or raped in Khartoum and across the  country last month.   These troubling developments start to make sense when we look at the  cast of characters involved. The deputy of the TMC, General Mohamed  Hamdan ``Hemeti,'' leads the Rapid Support Forces. We know them as the  Janjaweed, and we know that they have on their hands the blood of the  Darfur genocide. Now, they are turning their violent tactics against  the broader Sudanese population.   These are the same thugs responsible for the repression and economic  mismanagement that characterized Omar al-Bashir's three blood-soaked  decades in power. He is gone, but they continue to drive the country  into the ground.   Thankfully, the Sudanese people are resilient. They continue to fight  for their country's future, even in the face of violence and  repression. Their civil society and diaspora networks have helped to  shine a light on what the people in Sudan are enduring. They have had  enough, and the United States and partners around the world need to  have their backs.   This resolution underscores Congress' desire to see a civilian-led  transition in Sudan, a transition free from violence and bloodshed. It  is a good resolution. I am glad the House is considering it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), chairwoman of the Africa,  Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the chairman of the Rules Committee and  one of the most vocal Members on Sudan in Congress. He has done great  work for many years.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), the co-chair of the  Progressive Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Mr. Kildee, Mr. Bilirakis, and, of  course the Speaker pro tempore, Mr. McGovern.   What happens in Sudan in the coming weeks and months is a high  priority for the United States. It is in our national security interest  to support a peaceful, civilian-led political transition in Sudan and  is consistent with our values to support the democratic aspirations of  a people who have suffered under a brutal, violent rule for so long.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 345) recognizing widening threats to freedoms of  the press and expression around the world, reaffirming the centrality  of a free and independent press to the health of democracy, and  reaffirming freedom of the press as a priority of the United States in  promoting democracy, human rights, and good governance in commemoration  of World Press Freedom Day on May 3, 2019, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  [[Page H5794]]    The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 345         Whereas Article 19 of the United Nations Universal       Declaration of Human Rights, adopted at Paris, December 10,       1948, states, ``Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion       and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions       without interference and to seek, receive and impart       information and ideas through any media and regardless of       frontiers.'';        Whereas, in 1993, the United Nations General Assembly       proclaimed May 3 of each year as ``World Press Freedom       Day''--        (1) to celebrate the fundamental principles of freedom of       the press;        (2) to evaluate freedom of the press around the world;        (3) to defend the media against attacks on its       independence; and        (4) to pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives       while working in their profession;        Whereas, on December 18, 2013, the United Nations General       Assembly adopted Resolution 68/163 on the safety of       journalists and the problem of impunity, which unequivocally       condemns all attacks on, and violence against, journalists       and media workers, including torture, extrajudicial killing,       enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, and intimidation       and harassment in conflict and nonconflict situations;        Whereas the theme for World Press Freedom Day 2019, is       ``Media for Democracy: Journalism and Democracy in Times of       Disinformation'';        Whereas Thomas Jefferson, who recognized the importance of       the press in a constitutional republic, wisely declared, ``.       . . were it left to me to decide whether we should have a       government without newspapers, or newspapers without a       government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the       latter.'';        Whereas the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act of 2009       (Public Law 111-166; 22 U.S.C. 2151 note), signed into law by       President Barack Obama in 2010, expanded the examination of       the freedom of the press around the world in the annual       country reports on human rights practices of the Department       of State;        Whereas the 2019 World Press Freedom Index, published by       Reporters Without Borders, warns, ``The number of countries       regarded as safe, where journalists can work in complete       security, continues to decline, while authoritarian regimes       tighten their grip on the media.'';        Whereas, Freedom House's publication ``Freedom in the World       2019'' noted that global freedom of expression has declined       each year for the past 13 years;        Whereas, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists,       in 2018--        (1) at least 54 journalists were killed around the world       for their work, of which at least 34 were singled out for       murder;        (2) the 2 deadliest countries for journalists on assignment       were Afghanistan and Syria;        (3) the most dangerous subject for a journalist to report       on was politics, followed by war;        (4) 251 journalists worldwide were in prison, with Turkey,       China, and Egypt responsible for more than half of the jailed       journalists;        (5) 13 percent of the journalists in jail were female, an       increase from 8 percent in 2017;        (6) 70 percent of the journalists who were imprisoned       around the world faced antistate charges, such as belonging       to or aiding groups deemed by authorities as terrorist       organizations; and        (7) the number of journalists imprisoned on charges of       false news rose to 28 globally, compared with 9 such       imprisonments in 2016;        Whereas the People's Republic of China maintains one of the       worst media environments in the world and seeks to curtail       political speech inside and outside the country including       by--        (1) targeting independent and foreign media in China       through systematic harassment including the denial of visas       to foreign journalists, imprisonment, the denial of medical       care to imprisoned journalists, and curtailing access to       legal representation;        (2) pervasively monitoring and censoring online and social       media content, including through the banning of virtual       private networks;        (3) using the full force of the State to stifle internal       dissent including dissent online, particularly dissent that       could lead to political change and content that criticizes       China's leaders, however trivial, reportedly even to the       point of censoring comparisons of Xi Jingping's looks with       Winnie the Pooh;        (4) spreading propaganda to foreign audiences through the       United Front Work Department and related activities;        (5) seeking to intimidate American-based journalists       working for Radio Free Asia and reporting on gross human       rights violations in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous       Region by jailing or otherwise harassing members of their       families; and        (6) championing a ``sovereign Internet'' model and       exporting technology to enhance the ability of like-minded       authoritarian regimes to suppress dissent online and monitor       the activity of their people;        Whereas, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo,       recipients of the 2018 PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award were       arrested in December 2017 for investigating the murder by the       Burmese military of 10 Rohingya men in the village of Inn       Dinn in Rakhine State and were unjustly detained for 500 days       before they were released on May 7, 2019, as part of a mass       amnesty of 6,520 prisoners;        Whereas freedom of the press has been under considerable       pressure in recent years throughout Southeast Asia, including       in the Philippines, where the Government has waged a campaign       of judicial harassment against the news website Rappler and       its editor, Maria Ressa;        Whereas, Nouf Abdulaziz, Loujain Al-Hathloul, and Eman Al-      Nafjan, recipients of the 2019 PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write       Award, who wrote in opposition to Saudi Arabia's repressive       Guardianship system, have been subjected to imprisonment,       solitary confinement, and torture by the Government of the       Kingdom of Saudi Arabia since May 2018 in an apparent effort       to suppress dissent and silence the voices of women;        Whereas, Washington Post journalist and United States       resident Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by a team of Saudi       operatives while visiting the Saudi Arabian consulate in       Istanbul, Turkey;        Whereas the Senate unanimously approved a resolution       stating that Mr. Khashoggi's murder was carried out at the       behest of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman;        Whereas journalist Mimi Mefo Takambou was jailed for 4 days       in Cameroon in November 2018 on charges of spreading false       news while investigating the death of an American missionary,       where 4 out of the 7 total journalists imprisoned in Cameroon       were jailed for spreading false news, which is a rising trend       in Cameroon and elsewhere around the world;        Whereas according to the Committee to Protect Journalists,       at least 26 journalists were killed in Honduras since 2007,       making it one of the most deadly countries for journalists in       the Americas, and where journalist Leonardo Gabriel Hernandez       was murdered in March 2019 after receiving threats related to       his work;        Whereas in Nicaragua, Miguel Mora and Lucia Pineda Ubau,       the directors of the country's only 24-hour cable news       network, have been jailed since December 2018 on charges of       fomenting hate, spreading fake news, and terrorism, and       prominent journalist Carlos Fernando Chamorro has fled the       country as President Daniel Ortega cracks down on free       expression in a bid to silence dissent and end the protests       against him;        Whereas in Mexico, which remains the most dangerous country       in the Western Hemisphere for journalists--        (1) murders, death threats, and legal impunity cause       journalists to self-censor their reporting out of fear;        (2) investigative journalist Carlos Dominguez Ramirez, who       wrote frequently on local politics and corruption, was       brutally murdered in front of family members on January 13,       2018, in Nuevo Laredo, and a politician he was investigating       was subsequently arrested in connection with this heinous       act; and        (3) Rafael Murua Manriquez was abducted and murdered in       January 2019 after reporting threats from an official in the       municipal government for critical reporting;        Whereas Slovakian journalist Jan Kuciak and his partner       Martina Kusnirova were murdered in February 2018, allegedly       in retaliation for his investigative reporting of tax fraud       in connection to a businessman with close ties to Slovakia's       ruling party, where the perpetrator awaits trial, just 4       months after the murder of another European journalist,       Malta's Daphne Caruana Galizia, for her reporting on       corruption;        Whereas the world's growing cadre of ethical and hard-      hitting investigative journalists, including those       contributing to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting       Project--        (1) adhere to the highest professional standards;        (2) uncover abuses and corruption being committed in their       own countries; and        (3) deserve the international community's support and       praise for taking on the risky job of fostering       accountability and transparency in their respective       countries;        Whereas, under the auspices of the United States Agency for       Global Media, the United States Government provides financial       assistance to several editorially independent media outlets,       including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty,       Radio Free Asia, Radio y Television Marti, and the Middle       East Broadcast Networks--        (1) which report and broadcast news, information, and       analysis in critical regions around the world; and        (2) whose journalists regularly face harassment, fines, and       imprisonment for their work; and        Whereas freedom of the press--        (1) is a key component of democratic governance, activism       in civil society, and socioeconomic development; and        (2) enhances public accountability, transparency, and       participation in civil society and democratic governance:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns threats to freedom of the press and free       expression around the world;        (2) remembers the bravery of journalists and media workers       around the world who, despite threats to their safety, play       an essential role in--        (A) promoting government accountability;        (B) defending democratic activity; and        (C) strengthening civil society;        (3) remembers journalists who have lost their lives       carrying out their work;  [[Page H5795]]         (4) calls on governments abroad to implement United Nations       General Assembly Resolution 163 (2013) by thoroughly       investigating and seeking to resolve outstanding cases of       violence against journalists, including murders and       kidnappings, while ensuring the protection of witnesses;        (5) condemns all actions around the world that suppress       freedom of the press;        (6) reaffirms the centrality of freedom of the press to       efforts of the United States Government to support democracy,       mitigate conflict, and promote good governance around the       world;

       (B) to improve the rapid identification, publication, and       response by the United States Government to threats against       freedom of the press around the world;        (C) to urge foreign governments to transparently       investigate and bring to justice the perpetrators of attacks       against journalists; and        (D) to highlight the issue of threats against freedom of       the press in the annual country reports on human rights       practices of the Department of State and through diplomatic       channels.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H. Res. 345.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank Representative Schiff and  Representative Chabot for introducing this resolution which recognizes  that the freedoms of the press and expression are being threatened  globally.   A free press is an essential pillar in every democracy. It shines  light on corruption, speaks truth to power, and holds the government  accountable. However, in recent years, there has been a growing assault  on a free press.   Mr. Speaker, there are far too many shocking examples of journalists  being silenced, imprisoned, tortured, and even murdered around the  world, with each abuse only furthering a 13-year decline in the freedom  of expression.   The price of protecting these rights has become extremely high.  According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, in 2018, 54  journalists were killed and 64 went missing.   At a time when the world looks to the United States to be champions  for a free press, some call our journalists the enemy of the people.  This administration's attack on the media undermines the First  Amendment and creates a culture of intimidation and hostility towards  journalists.   By accusing media outlets of producing fake news, journalists find  themselves less safe, and our country is less informed. So H. Res. 345  condemns threats to independent media and calls on governments to  continue to address journalists' safety. It also reiterates the vital  importance of a free press in the U.S. and to well-functioning  democracies abroad, as well.   It is our duty now, more than ever, to protect the freedom of the  press and the public's right to information. I ask all Members to  support this bipartisan resolution, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), who is the author of this bill and the  chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 345 is an important resolution that honors  journalists and calls on the United States and governments abroad to  protect the freedom of the press. I commend Mr. Schiff and Mr. Chabot  for this.   Press freedom is fundamental in democracies and enhances public  accountability, transparency, and participation in governance. I  strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2037) to encourage accountability for the murder of Washington  Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2037         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2037.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to report the Saudi Arabia Human Rights and  Accountability Act of 2019.   I want to take this opportunity to thank the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Malinowski) for his leadership, his thoughtfulness, and his  vision in authoring this legislation. Mr. Malinowski came to this body  with a long track record of fighting for human rights, and he arrived  ready to tackle one of the thorniest issues: How do we ensure justice  for those responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi? How do we  demand accountability when the President refuses?   Jamal Khashoggi was a Washington Post contributing columnist and  legal permanent U.S. resident. He was killed by Saudi Government  personnel on October 2, 2018, during his visit to the Saudi consulate  in Istanbul, Turkey.   Circumstances surrounding his disappearance and death have been  extensively reported on by media outlets, briefed to some Members in  classified settings, and investigated by the United Nations special  rapporteur on extrajudicial killings.   We still haven't seen any real accountability for this heinous crime.  The Saudis originally denied any involvement and then made the  outlandish claim that this killing was an accident--yes, accidental  killing by bone saw. Give me a break.   The Trump administration said it would hold those responsible to  account, but they have been dragging their feet. We still haven't seen  any real action, so Congress must step in.   This important legislation mandates a report from the Director of  National Intelligence about those who were responsible for, complicit  in, or played a supporting role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The  legislation then imposes a visa ban on those individuals.   This bill, though, has a thoughtful off-ramp. In an effort to reshape  our relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is a very important U.S.  partner, the legislation says that if Saudi Arabia releases the  journalists and activists currently imprisoned in the kingdom, fully  cooperates in the investigation of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, and  reforms its systems to value human rights, those visa bans will not be  imposed.   If Saudi Arabia is looking for a way to reset the U.S.-Saudi  relationship, I invite them to look at this legislation. I hope they  do.   The Saudis are an important security partner, but we cannot just look  the other way when they ignore international norms and basic human  rights and when they murder a journalist in broad daylight in a  diplomatic facility.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       2037, the Saudi Arabia Human Rights and Accountability act of       2019.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary. I acknowledge that the Committee will not formally       consider H.R. 2037 and agree that the inaction of your       Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in H.R. 2037       which fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L.

Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to advise you that the Committee       on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to review the       provisions in H.R. 2037, the ``Saudi Arabia Human Rights and       Accountability Act of 2019'' that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to waive       sequential referral, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.      Hon. Adam Schiff,      Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       2037, the Saudi Arabia Human Rights and Accountability act of       2019.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence. I acknowledge that the Committee       will not formally consider H.R. 2037 and agree that the       inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does not       waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in H.R. 2037 which fall within your Committee's       Rule X jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill.

Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                     Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, House Foreign Affairs Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       2037, the Saudi Arabia Human Rights and Accountability Act of       2019. Certain provisions in the legislation fall within the       jurisdiction of the House Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence, as set forth in Rule X of the House of       Representatives for the 116th Congress.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. By waiving consideration of H.R. 2037, the House       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the subjects contained in       the bill which fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. I further       request that you urge the Speaker to appoint members of the       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to any       conference committee which is named to consider provisions       addressing such subjects.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       2037 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Adam B. Schiff,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Malinowski), who is the author of this bill and a valued  member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the chairman of the Rules Committee and  co-chairman of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, the horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi demands  accountability and justice. After the astounding evidence we have seen,  it just cannot be business as usual; and since the administration is  dragging its feet, Congress must step forward.   So I urge my colleagues to join me today and support the Saudi Arabia  Human Rights and Accountability Act, and I thank the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Malinowski) for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 129) condemning the Government of Saudi Arabia's  continued detention and alleged abuse of women's rights activists, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 129         Whereas the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been an important       strategic partner of the United States, and the United States       and Saudi Arabia share broad interests, including defeating       the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), regional       stability, and countering Iran's malign activities in the       Middle East;        Whereas, in June 2018, the Government of Saudi Arabia       reversed the longstanding ban on women driving;        Whereas Saudi Arabia's male guardianship system requires       women to attain the permission of their male guardian for a       vast array of decisions, including health care, employment,       applying for a passport, international travel, getting       married, or even leaving prison;        Whereas, since May 2018, the Government of Saudi Arabia has       arrested prominent human rights advocates and imposed travel       bans on numerous others, many of them longtime supporters of       ending the ban on women driving and abolishing the male       guardianship system;        Whereas none of the jailed activists has been convicted of       any crimes, and many reportedly have been held in solitary       confinement for prolonged periods;        Whereas Aziza al-Yousef, a United States resident who       helped lead a campaign against the male guardianship system       in Saudi Arabia, was imprisoned in May 2018;        Whereas at least 10 activists supporting the rights of       women have been subjected to psychological and physical       abuse, including sexual violence, beatings, electric shocks,       and sleep deprivation;        Whereas one of the detained activists, Loujain al-Hathloul,       was reportedly beaten, waterboarded, given electric shocks,       sexually harassed, and threatened with rape and murder;        Whereas the Department of State has undertaken some       diplomatic measures to bring concerns about the detention of       these activists to the attention of the Government of Saudi       Arabia;        Whereas, on January 14, 2019, Secretary of State Mike       Pompeo said he had raised the case of the imprisoned       activists with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman;        Whereas the 2018 Department of State Country Report on       Human Rights Practices for Saudi Arabia stated that, ``Women       continued to face significant discrimination under law and       custom, and many remained uninformed about their rights'',       and ``women also faced discrimination in courts, where in       most cases the testimony of one man equals that of two       women'';        Whereas in March and in May of 2019, Saudi authorities       temporarily released several activists pending trial;        Whereas, on April 21, 2005, Dr. Hatoon al-Fassi, an       associate professor of history at King Saud University and       prominent activist who was detained and later temporarily       released, pending trial, testified before Congress that a       Saudi woman ``is considered legally and socially a minor; she       is confined to  [[Page H5801]]       limited areas of educational opportunities; she is restricted       in employment opportunities; there are no legal bodies where       women could seek support; and finally, she is distanced from       any decisionmaking position'';        Whereas serious impediments to women's freedoms in Saudi       Arabia remain, including a high prevalence of forced       marriages, inequality in marriage, divorce, child custody and       inheritance, laws that prevents women from directly       transmitting citizenship to their children, and the male       guardianship system; and        Whereas the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability       Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114-328)       authorizes the President to deny travel visas and freeze the       United States-based assets of foreign government officials       responsible for ``extrajudicial killings, torture, or other       gross violations of internationally recognized human       rights'': Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms that promoting human rights and democracy has       long been a bedrock of United States foreign policy,       including advancing the rights and empowerment of women and       girls;        (2) condemns the Government of Saudi Arabia's continued       detention and alleged abuse of women's rights advocates       jailed for peacefully exercising their human rights;        (3) urges Government of Saudi Arabia officials to       immediately and unconditionally release the imprisoned       women's rights advocates and other political prisoners, and       hold accountable those involved in perpetrating abuses;        (4) urges Government of Saudi Arabia officials to end the       male guardianship system that restricts the ability of Saudi       women to make decisions about their lives; and        (5) calls on the United States Government to--        (A) continue publicly and privately demanding the release       of individuals wrongfully detained;        (B) use the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability       Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114-328) to       identify and impose travel and financial restrictions on all       Government of Saudi Arabia officials responsible for gross       violations of internationally recognized human rights;        (C) document relevant details of alleged torture and abuse       in future annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices;       and        (D) prioritize human rights, including the rights of women,       as a key component of the relationship between the United       States and Saudi Arabia.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 129.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Frankel and Wagner for their  leadership in bringing this measure forward.   The treatment of women's rights activists in Saudi Arabia, their  unjust imprisonment, is a serious problem.   Since May 2018, the Government of Saudi Arabia has arrested prominent  women's rights activists and imposed travel bans on numerous others.  Many of them are longtime supporters of ending the ban on a woman  driving and abolishing the male guardianship system.   At least 10 women's rights activists have been subjected to  psychological and physical abuse, including sexual violence, beatings,  electric shocks, and sleep deprivation.   The State Department reported, in 2018: ``Women continued to face  significant discrimination under law and custom, and many remain  uninformed about their rights,'' and ``women also face discrimination  in courts where, in the most cases, the testimony of one man equals  that of two women.''   Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia temporarily released four women  activists. This is a step in the right direction, but not nearly  enough.   Mr. Speaker, American foreign policy is at its best when we put our  values at the center of everything we do, and when a partner country  like Saudi Arabia tramples on human rights, it is incumbent on us to  speak out just as we would do with respect to a nation hostile to the  United States.   With this resolution, we are sending a clear message. It condemns the  Government of Saudi Arabia's continued detention of these activists. It  also urges an end to the male guardianship system and calls on the  United States Government to designate the perpetrators of serious human  rights violations under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights  Accountability Act.   We must continue to call on the Saudi Government to release these  women immediately. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution, and  I urge my colleagues to do the same.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, let me again thank my colleagues for their hard work on  this measure, and let me thank Mr. Wilson for his hard work.   Mr. Speaker, when we see abuses of human rights around the world,  when we see women treated as second-class citizens and denied basic  dignity, we need to speak out. We need to speak out whether it is an  adversary or friend. That is what is demanded of American leadership.  It is what sets us apart from other powers on the global stage.   The treatment of women in Saudi Arabia is abhorrent. The jailing of  activists is unacceptable. And it is one more roadblock in our  relationship with a country that has been and should continue to be an  important partner.   I hope it changes soon, along with a lot of other things, so that we  can get back on track.   Mr. Speaker, I support the measure, I urge all Members to do the  same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 97) to amend the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956  to authorize rewards for thwarting wildlife trafficking linked to  transnational organized crime, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                  H.R. 97         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rescuing Animals With       Rewards Act of 2019'' or the ``RAWR Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Wildlife trafficking is a major transnational crime       that is estimated to generate over $10 billion a year in       illegal profits and which is increasingly perpetrated by       organized, sophisticated criminal enterprises, including       known terrorist organizations.        (2) Wildlife trafficking not only threatens endangered       species worldwide, but also jeopardizes local security,       spreads disease, undermines rule of law, fuels corruption,       and damages economic development.        (3) Combating wildlife trafficking requires a coordinated       and sustained approach at the global, regional, national, and       local levels.        (4) Congress stated in the Eliminate, Neutralize, and       Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 that it is the       policy of the United States to take immediate actions to stop       the illegal global trade in wildlife and wildlife products       and associated transnational organized crime.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Department of State's rewards program is a powerful tool       in combating sophisticated international crime and that the       Department of State and Federal law enforcement should work       in concert to offer rewards that target wildlife traffickers.       SEC. 3. REWARDS FOR JUSTICE.         Subparagraph (B) of section 36(k)(5) of the State       Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C.       2708(k)(5)) is amended by inserting ``wildlife trafficking       (as defined by section 2(12) of the Eliminate, Neutralize,       and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 (16 U.S.C.       7601(12); Public Law 114-231)) and'' after ``includes''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 97, Rescuing Animals With Rewards  Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and rise in support of H.R. 97.   I would like to begin by thanking Mr. Buchanan and Ms. Titus for  introducing this important legislation.   In recent years, Congress has taken a number of important steps to  combat wildlife trafficking, but the situation remains dire.   Over the last 10 years, one-third of African elephants have been  slaughtered for their tusks--one-third. That is just shocking.   Rhino populations have also been decimated, and many other species  are at risk.   Protecting wildlife is the right thing to do, but it also serves  American national security interests. Wildlife trafficking feeds  corruption, undermines the rule of law, threatens economic prosperity,  and drives instability. And it is carried out by many of the same  international criminal syndicates engaged in the trafficking of drugs,  weapons, and people.   The bipartisan, commonsense legislation before us today provides our  government with a tool it can use to tackle the illegal trade in  wildlife. Specifically, it authorizes rewards, under the State  Department's Rewards for Justice Program, for information leading to  the arrest or conviction of those engaged in wildlife trafficking.   This can provide a powerful financial incentive for people to turn in  those responsible for this appalling activity.   Where I come from--Bronx, New York--we have the Wildlife Conservation  Society doing such wonderful work. It is the Bronx Zoo. They are really  doing great work in terms of this. And John Calvelli, a personal friend  of mine, is at the forefront of trying to save animals and allowing  people to understand what is going on in wildlife trafficking. It is  very important, and I commend them for their role.   This authorizes rewards, under the State Department's Rewards for  Justice Program, for information leading to the arrest or conviction of  those engaged in wildlife trafficking. This can provide a powerful  financial incentive for people to turn in those responsible for this  appalling activity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to, once again, urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this good, bipartisan bill to  combat wildlife trafficking, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 526) to promote free and fair elections, political freedoms, and  human rights in Cambodia, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 526         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cambodia Democracy Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Prime Minister Hun Sen has been in power in Cambodia       since 1985 and is the longest-serving leader in Southeast       Asia. Despite decades of international attention and       assistance to promote a pluralistic, multi-party democratic       system in Cambodia, the Government of Cambodia continues to       be  [[Page H5803]]       undemocratically dominated by the ruling Cambodia People's       Party (CPP), which controls every agency and security       apparatus of the state.        (2) In 2015, the CPP-controlled parliament passed the ``Law       on Associations and Non-Governmental Organizations'', which       gave the government sweeping powers to revoke the       registration of NGOs that the government believed to be       operating with a political bias in a blatant attempt to       restrict the legitimate work of civil society. On August 23,       2017, Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered the       closure of the National Democratic Institute and the       expulsion of its foreign staff. On September 15, 2017, Prime       Minister Hun Sen called for the withdrawal of all volunteers       from the United States Peace Corps, which has operated in       Cambodia since 2006 with 500 United States volunteers       providing English language and healthcare training.        (3) The Government of Cambodia has taken several measures       to restrict its media environment, especially through       politicized tax investigations against independent media       outlets that resulted in the closure of The Cambodian Daily       and Radio Free Asia in early September 2017. Additionally,       the Government of Cambodia has ordered several radio stations       to stop the broadcasting of Radio Free Asia and Voice of       America programming.        (4) On September 3, 2017, Kem Sokha, the President of the       Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was arrested on       politically motivated charges, including treason and       conspiring to overthrow the Government of Cambodia, and faces       up to 30 years in prison. The CNRP's previous leader, Sam       Rainsy, remains in exile. On November 16, 2017, Cambodia's       Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP, eliminating the primary       opposition party.        (5) Each of the six elections that have taken place in       Cambodia since 1991 were conducted in circumstances that were       not free and fair, and were marked by fraud, intimidation,       violence, and the government's misuse of legal mechanisms to       weaken opposition candidates and parties.        (6) In the most recent general election in July 2018,       following the dissolution of the CNRP, the CPP secured every       parliamentary seat, an electoral victory that a statement       from the White House Press Secretary stated was ``neither       free nor fair and failed to represent the will of the       Cambodian people''.        (7) The United States is committed to promoting democracy,       human rights, and the rule of law in Cambodia. The United       States continues to urge the Government of Cambodia to       immediately release Mr. Kem Sokha, reinstate the political       status of the CNRP and restore its elected seats in the       National Assembly, and support electoral reform efforts in       Cambodia with free and fair elections monitored by       international observers.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 526.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), a  valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for his hard work on  this measure.   This is an example of what our committee does best: good, bipartisan  legislation aimed at advancing American interests and leadership and,  especially in this case, our values--our support for human rights  around the world. So, I thank Mr. Yoho for this.   Hun Sen, Cambodia's strongman Prime Minister, has been in power since  1985. He has clung to power longer than any other current leader in  southeast Asia. He has violently suppressed dissent. He intimidates any  opposition.   Civil society cannot operate freely. His government restricts free  speech and free media, the bedrocks of any democracy.   For 30 years, the Cambodian people have hoped to see their country  move toward a freer, more democratic system. Democracies around the  world have hoped for the same thing, investing for decades in the hopes  of building a pluralistic, multiparty system in Cambodia.   Progress has been halting at best, and results are woefully  incomplete. Six elections have been held in Cambodia since 1991. None  of them was free or fair.   But we won't give up on the Cambodian people. This legislation gives  the President and State Department more tools to sanction Cambodian  leaders who undermine democracy and commit gross human rights  violations.   This bill would prohibit those individuals from entering the United  States and block any assets or property they may possess in our  country.   This bill sends a clear message that the United States stands  shoulder to shoulder with the people of Cambodia and that Congress will  hold Cambodia's leaders accountable for their assault on democracy and  violations of human rights.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to cosponsor this bill. I am glad we are  moving it forward today. I thank Mr. Wilson, and I reserve the balance  of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, July 12, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to advise you that the Committee       on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to review the       provisions in H.R. 526, the ``Cambodia Democracy Act of       2019'' that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate       your consulting with us on those provisions. The Judiciary       Committee has no objection to your including them in the bill       for consideration on the House floor, and to expedite that       consideration is willing to waive sequential referral, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                       Washington, DC, July 9, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R. 526,       the Cambodia Democracy Act of 2019.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary. I acknowledge that the Committee will not formally       consider H.R. 526 and agree that the inaction of your       Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in H.R. 526       which fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Chabot, for doing this with me.  Last time I saw him was a few days ago in my home city of New York. We  were going to meet the president of Taiwan, another Asian country that  has great freedom.    I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.    Well, I would say to the gentleman, if it happened on the  other night, I would have invited him to my house for a drink, but we  will have to do that another time.   Mr. Speaker, supporting democracy and human rights around the world  is an area where our values and our interests clearly intersect.   Basic freedoms: Accountable, transparent governments, respect for  individual dignity, these are the values we seek to promote around the  world and the values that underpin a vibrant democracy.   They are also what makes countries stronger, better and more stable  partners for the United States on the world stage. That is good for our  interests and our security as well.   So we want to keep supporting the people of Cambodia, we want them to  have a say in the future of their country. That starts by demanding  accountability for those who have suppressed democracy and basic  freedoms. This bill is an important step in that process. I am glad to  support it. I urge all Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
