 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mayor  Sandra Martin from Flemington, Georgia, for more than 30 years of  public service. Mayor Martin is a talented public servant who has truly  made Flemington, in Georgia's First Congressional District, a better  place to live.   Flemington is located near Hinesville, Georgia, which is home to the  Fort Stewart military base, and being the mayor here comes with unique  challenges. Under her leadership, Flemington took these challenges and  ran with them.   Flemington built its first-ever city hall for meetings and events.  Before that time, citizens needed to search around town for a city  council member to speak with.   The city also went from being an inconspicuous town on the side of  the highway to advertising itself and coaxing visitors to come in and  experience its hospitality.   I am proud to have a city official like Mayor Martin who is immensely  dedicated to our area in the First Congressional District. Other mayors  could learn from her example of good government.                            ____________________
