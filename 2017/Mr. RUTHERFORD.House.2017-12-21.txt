 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  emergency supplemental bill.   This emergency funding provides much-needed and, frankly, overdue  relief to my district in northeast Florida.   In September, Hurricane Irma caused flooding that the city of  Jacksonville had not seen in more than 150 years. Downtown was  literally under water, power was out for many days, and homes and  businesses were shuttered.   In our more rural agricultural communities in Nassau County and St.  Johns County, crops were wiped out, hurting our agriculture community  for months, if not years to come.   The city of Jacksonville recently projected that Hurricane Irma will  cost the city $85 million.   I would be remiss if I did not commend the quick Federal response,  the leadership of our Governor, and the planning and coordination of  local emergency management officials and first responders, who saved  lives and made our community safe and quickly back up and running.   But the Federal support in this bill provides the next phase in  emergency response that we so desperately need.   I would like to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and his committee and  committee staff for their work to get this bill over the line. I urge  my colleagues in the strongest way possible to support this bill.
