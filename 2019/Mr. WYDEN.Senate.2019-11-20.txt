 Mr. President, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate  Finance Committee, I can tell the Senate this morning that there is no  higher priority for Senate Finance Democrats than the well-being of  healthcare patients in this country and how strongly we feel about  their having a right to good quality, affordable healthcare coverage.   Right now, too many of those folks are getting ripped off by an  insurance lobbyist's dream--taxpayer-funded junk insurance--or by Big  Pharma, which is always, always looking to engage in price gouging for  one reason: They can get away with it. Take insulin. Insulin prices are  up thirteenfold in recent years. The drug is not 13 times better. It is  the same insulin that has been around for decades. But the reason the  pharmaceutical companies do it is because they can get away with it.   This morning, I am going to take a few minutes and talk about what  this really means for patients because I can tell you, this fall, there  are a lot of families across this country who would rather be prepping  for holidays than worrying about their healthcare. Unfortunately, the  Trump administration is refusing to provide that kind of security for  our patients.   To begin, let me tell you about a youngster in Oregon named Jasper.  Jasper is 3, full of energy and love, and a big fan of playtime with  cars and trucks and trains. He was born, however, with huge medical  challenges--cystic fibrosis, cardiac and pancreatic problems, hearing  loss. He needs a variety of treatments multiple times a day. It is so  hard on Jasper's family. It is so hard on Jasper. And, of course, the  costs of Jasper's care are in the stratosphere. The family is fortunate  to have health insurance through a parent's employer. They know how  absolutely vital it is to have what they consider to be a lifeline--the  protection of the Affordable Care Act.   At the heart of the Affordable Care Act are bedrock, ironclad  protections for people like them--no discrimination by insurance  companies against preexisting conditions. That was something we used to  have some support for from the other side of the aisle. I know about  that because I wrote a bipartisan bill that had airtight, loophole-free  protection against what essentially was discrimination against those  with preexisting conditions, and we got it into the Affordable Care  Act.   Yet now we see the other side of the aisle trying to unravel those  protections. They are trying to unravel the protection that we see for  patients with respect to big expenses. Our approach has no annual or  lifetime limits on coverage, no coverage denials that dragged people  into bureaucratic nightmares, has young people covered on their  parents' plan until age 26, and lots more. Those protections saved  people's lives and made healthcare affordable for millions of  Americans.   Unfortunately, with the support of my colleagues here on the other  side in the Senate, the Trump administration wants to eliminate those  protections that are so important to Jasper and families like his. My  colleagues on the other side are standing by and basically doing  nothing while the administration and Republican-led States are out  there maneuvering in the courts to get the entire Affordable Care Act  wiped out.   The so-called Texas case, which is an absurd lawsuit based on an  absurd argument--an argument that wouldn't pass the smell test in a  middle class school mock trial--somehow rightwing, ideological judges  have kept it alive. Because this lawsuit keeps hanging around, tens of  millions of Americans might lose their healthcare with hardly any  warning and no fallback options to protect them.   Now Republicans have claimed they have fix-it bills they could pass  in the event their allies took down the Affordable Care Act. They do  read like they were written by the lawyers and the lobbyists on the  payroll of the big insurance companies. If insurance companies can hike  up the cost of treating a preexisting condition so high that it becomes  unaffordable, it is no different from being denied coverage at the  outset.   While the Texas case moves forward, the Trump administration is  continuing to allow junk insurance scam artists to defraud Americans  into buying worthless plans that aren't worth really the paper they are  written on and certainly don't cover the healthcare Americans need.   I want to be very specific about it. This is an insurance lobbyist's  dream.  [[Page S6689]]  You have tax breaks for junk insurance. That is on every insurance  lobbyist's wish list for the holidays. I think it is federally funded  fraud, plain and simple, but unfortunately it has the support of a lot  of Republicans here in the Congress.   It is now the middle of the open enrollment period for health  insurance on healthcare.gov. The Trump administration's support for  junk plans has created a whole new burden for families across the  country who are shopping for insurance.   I am particularly troubled by this because I remember what junk  insurance used to be like. I was director of the senior citizens at  home for almost 7 years before I was elected to the Congress, and those  were the days when you could go around the country, whether it was  Montana or Oregon or anywhere else, and fast-talking salesmen would  sell 10, 15, sometimes 20 policies to supplement a senior's Medicare.  They were called Medigap policies, and they were useless. Seniors  should have saved that money to pay the rent and maybe make sure they  had heat in their houses.   Finally, we got rid of those Medigap rip-off policies. When I came to  the Congress, it was my top priority. We got it passed. It was a  bipartisan proposal. But now junk plans are back. They are different  from those Medigap rip-offs, but, much like what I battled when I was  the head of the senior citizens in Oregon, they are still built around  the same proposition. They are essentially worthless. They are an  insurance lobbyist's dream. In the case of what we are dealing with-- the administration gutting the Affordable Care Act--I think it is  essentially Federal tax breaks for junk insurance, and that is why I  think it is tantamount to federally funded fraud.   The Trump administration's support for junk plans has created a whole  new burden for families across the country who are trying to shop for  insurance that gives them real value. Those shoppers used to be able to  trust that junk plans had actually been banned from the marketplace.  Now those shoppers have to wade through Byzantine and manipulative  marketing scams and incomprehensible insurance lingo to try to figure  out if they are getting coverage that actually helps them or, as I have  described too often, just worthless junk.   What is worse, the Trump administration actually redirects people  looking for coverage from the healthcare.gov website to third-party  brokers who can sell unsuspecting customers junk plans. I think it is  astounding that the Trump administration has seen fit to heap another  burden on vulnerable people. After we have called this administration  out on it, they are not willing to do anything to correct it.   But unfortunately, since the beginning of the Trump administration-- with the help of too many allies in the Congress--it has been one  attempt after another to take healthcare away from vulnerable  Americans, from millions of vulnerable Americans, those like 3-year-old  little Jasper and his family, that I started talking about at home in  Oregon.   On a fundamental level, this is a debate about whether this country  is going to go back to the days when healthcare was only for the  healthy and wealthy. That was the way it worked, if the insurance  companies could clobber somebody with a preexisting condition. If you  are healthy, it didn't matter. You did not have to worry. If you were  wealthy, you just sat down and wrote out a check. That is the way it  worked.   But when I came to the Senate, we put together a bipartisan bill,  airtight, loophole-free protection for those with preexisting  conditions. There are colleagues on the other side of the aisle who  cosponsored my bill--and by the way, the President of the Senate knows  who was the leader of that effort, one of his predecessors in the Utah  delegation, the late Senator Bennet.   So this idea that we are just going to sit around and go back to the  days when healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy, that is not  acceptable to Finance Democrats that I have the honor to work with. It  is not acceptable to any of us on this side, and it should not be  acceptable to my colleagues in the Congress.   That is where Donald Trump wants to return to, the days when  healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy. They have made it clear by  working to eliminate preexisting condition protections in the Congress  and the courts, by giving insurance lobbyists Federal tax breaks for  junk insurance plans, and by seeking to slash health programs for the  vulnerable.   I just want to make it clear that, on this side of the aisle, we are  about patients. We are about protecting patients. We are about the  proposition that in a country as strong and good and rich as ours-- where we are going to spend $3.5 trillion this year on healthcare, if  you divide the number of Americans, like maybe 325 million into $3.5  trillion, you could send every family of four in America a check for  $40,000. We are spending enough to take care of patients.   We ought to be doing more to protect, rather than turning back the  clock on young people like Jasper and his family. I just wanted to make  it clear, we will be on the floor talking about more patients in the  days ahead and on the fight, a fight we are going to prosecute  relentlessly, to protect those patients under the Affordable Care Act.    If my colleague would yield?    My understanding--and, again, I have listened to my  colleague on the Finance Committee. He is a champion on not going back,  but going forward with more Medicare-type choices. Like making that  person who is really wondering if they are going to make it until 65 in  order to get to Medicare, he would like--for example, say an older  woman who has been a victim of age discrimination, did not have much  money, he would like to  [[Page S6690]]  make them eligible for Medicare at 60 or 61 or something like that.    Mr. President, I rise today to remember the remarkable  life of my friend Gert Boyle and her many economic and philanthropic  contributions to Oregon.   Gert died earlier this month at the age of 95. I am one of the many  fans of Columbia Sportswear--and there are an awful lot of us in  Oregon--who admired Gert and saw her as synonymous with the iconic  Oregon company she led. This force of nature came to Oregon after  fleeing Nazi Germany with her family in 1937. It is an immigrant story  she shared with my parents, who also fled the Nazis. Like so many other  refugees welcomed to America over the centuries, Gert arrived to  America ready to work and eager to contribute. She did both in spades,  adding her own significant chapter to America's proud history of  immigrant successes.   She was a pioneer, a woman running a company at a time when that was  unfortunately even more rare than women CEOs are today. When Gert's  husband Neal died unexpectedly in 1970, she stepped in to replace him  as president of what was then a tiny local company weighed down by  debt. The challenge was mighty, but so was Gert. She became identified  everywhere with Columbia Sportswear as she grew this Oregon business  into a national and international brand. It now generates net annual  revenue of $3 billion and employs more than 6,500 people. Business  school students and Oregon historians alike will always remember Gert  for that exceptional run, as will I. And she gave back along the way,  generously supporting Special Olympics and the Knight Cancer Institute  at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. She was also was a  hell of a lot of fun, as evidenced by her hilarious role spoofing  herself in a 1980s Columbia Sportswear ad campaign as ``one tough  mother.''   I close by citing two anecdotes about Gert among many in the recent  obituaries chronicling her amazing life. I think both capture her  toughness and sense of humor perfectly. One of the two anecdotes comes  from Kerry Tymchuk, executive director of the Oregon Historical  Society. He said, ``When she took over, you know, she was a woman CEO  in a business where there weren't many women CEOs, in the sports  apparel business. She was discriminated against and there was this  famous incident where she picked up her phone and the fellow on the  other end said, `I want to speak to the CEO,' and she said `speaking,'  and he said, `but you're a woman,' and she said, `you know, I noticed  that when I got up this morning.' ''   The other anecdote comes from Gert herself. In another obituary, she  was quoted as having said, ``After my husband died, I said, `It's the  same ballgame--it's just a different coach. I might not know what I'm  doing, but we're going to do it my way.' '' Gert certainly did do it  her way. And her company, its employees, and our entire State of Oregon  are much the better for it.                            ____________________
