 Mr. President, later today, the Senate will move to  consider the measure on the floor, probably pass it, and then leave  town. There will be efforts to describe what we have done as a reason  for satisfaction and pride. There have been accomplishments, but on one  critical issue--really a range of issues--involving our national  security, we have only abject failure to show for the months we have  been here.   I am proud to come to the floor of the Senate today to advocate for  that cause--election security--with colleagues like Senator Amy  Klobuchar of Minnesota and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who have  been tireless champions, articulate, and eloquent advocates for this  cause.   Election security is national security. The testimony from Robert  Mueller, whatever you think about his verdict on the President, clearly  called for action.   Robert Mueller is a modern-day Paul Revere, sounding the alarm about  the Russians and many other nations--as he put it--who are mounting a  renewed attack on this country.   In the next election, this attack will make 2016 look like child's  play, a dress rehearsal, because the tools and techniques they will  bring to bear in attacking our democracy are so much more  sophisticated. Already, in 2016, Robert Mueller called that attack  sweeping and systematic. It was the reason he first spoke about it in  his statement and in May closed that statement with a severe and dire  warning about the ongoing interference in our democracy.   Those many other nations already include Iran, which just last week  the Washington Post reported to be mounting its own disinformation  campaign using social media and misinformation--disinformation--to  distract, divide, and sow discord here and in other democracies around  the world.   There is nothing unknown to many of us about the Russians' intent and  the designs of these other nations. It is hiding in plain sight.    From all of the classified briefings that we have received over these  months, the Russians know what they are doing, we know what the  Russians are doing, and we know what we are failing to do. The ones in  the dark are the American people, and that is why Senator Klobuchar,  Senator Warner, and I are on the floor today--to make sure that when we  leave today, it is not the end of this topic. It is the beginning of a  drumbeat, a cry of outrage, and unhappiness around the Nation.   There are a number of measures that we have championed that involve  more funding for the States to do election security, paper ballots by  the States to provide backups, auditing standards, and cyber security  criteria. These measures are a matter of common sense. That word  ``common sense'' is overused these days, especially in a city where it  is on display so infrequently, but common sense is the reason we are  here.   I want to talk specifically about the Duty to Report Act. It is based  on a very simple idea: If you see something, say something. The Duty to  Report Act would require all campaigns, all candidates, and family  members to immediately report to the FBI and the Federal Election  Commission any offers of foreign assistance. It would codify in the law  what is already a matter of moral duty, patriotic duty, and common  sense. It is already illegal to accept foreign assistance during a  campaign. It is already illegal to solicit foreign assistance during a  campaign. All this bill would do is require individuals and campaigns  and family members to report those illegal foreign assistance efforts  to the FBI.   When Robert Mueller came before Congress, he outlined the most  serious attack on our democracy by a foreign power in our history. It  includes 140 contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian agents-- Russian covert and overt efforts to influence the outcome of our  election by helping one candidate and hurting another. But the Russians  and those many other nations that will engage in similar attacks on our  democracy have no particular partisan preference. They are doing what  is in their interest to disrupt our democracy, and the victim in one  election may be the one preferred in the next. So we have a common  cause here.   Indeed, Robert Mueller testified:         Over the course of my career, I've seen a number of       challenges to our democracy. The Russian government's efforts       to interfere in our election is among the most serious.    This deserves the attention of every American. We have an obligation,  above all, as Members of this body, where there has been so much  history of bipartisan action, to come together in this cause.   Christopher Wray, the Director of the FBI, recently came before the  Senate Judiciary Committee, and he warned that the Russians are still  actively trying to interfere in our elections. Again and again, our  intelligence community has warned severely, repeatedly, powerfully  about this threat.   Yet when asked whether he would accept foreign help in 2020, the  President of the United States said: ``I'd take it.'' It is much like  his son Donald Junior said during this last campaign in response to an  offer of assistance from the Russians: ``I love it.''   When Robert Mueller was asked about this point during his testimony,  he said: ``I hope this is not the new normal. But I fear it is.''   That is the reason we need this measure. That is the reason we need  the measures that my colleagues, Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota and  Senator Warner of Virginia, have helped to lead, and that is why I have  been proud to join them in this effort.   To my Republican colleagues in the leadership, I say: Lead or get out  of the way. To the President of the United States: Lead or get out of  the way. Our national security is too important to make a partisan  issue. We ought to join together, as we did after 9/11, to prevent more  disaster and to join in this common cause.   This legislation is a matter of moral duty, patriotic duty, and  common sense. With the 2020 election literally on the horizon before  us, we must act now. Time is not on our side. It is only on our  adversary's side.   As much as we take pride in the National Defense Authorization Act,  the threat to our national security is not only from the planes and the  submarines and the aircraft carriers. It is also from the cyber attacks  and the social media campaigns to disrupt and destroy our democracy.   I am proud to be joined today by a great colleague who has been a  wonderful champion on this issue, Senator Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota.   I yield the floor.
