 Mr. Speaker, I, too, as all of my colleagues, not just  Pennsylvanians, but all the others, stand up to speak about a young  man, because he was a young man, Congressman Michael Fitzpatrick.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember him not as just a departed  colleague from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but he was also  a good person. He was someone whom I knew from the fact that, when I  was in the State legislature and he was a Congressman, that although I  was not in his congressional district, I knew him very much as a  person. I knew his leadership; I knew what he provided; and I knew his  friendliness.    He, both, was a principled conservative and comfortable working with  people on both sides of the aisle. That is how he got things done,  including the creation of the Washington Crossing National Cemetery.   He also led the effort to better secure passenger planes from  terrorism, a cause inspired by September 11 families from Bucks County.   Bucks County was very close to the congressional district in the  legislative district I represented. Limekiln Pike is something that led  up directly to Bucks County. So Mike was not a stranger to the issues  in the southeast part of Pennsylvania, as well as the city of  Philadelphia, as well as the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   My fellow Democrats from this district all remember him as a true  patriot, a father to Bucks County, a man of grace and honor who looked  past politics in the community.   There is a quote from my departed colleague, and this is what he  said: ``Some legislators look back at how many bills they passed. I  measure my time by how many people I helped.''   That was a quote that Mike has stated, and I think it is important if  all of us remember this. So, in that spirit, we from Pennsylvania stand  with that spirit of Michael Fitzpatrick. It is safe to say he helped a  lot of people.   Mr. Speaker, to Brian and his family, please know that you are in our  prayers and our thoughts. We don't take that lightly. We understand it.  I say to you that I am honored to be a part of the delegation of people  who are standing here today to add my voice to the importance of what  Michael Fitzpatrick meant to this body and to this country, and I thank  him.
