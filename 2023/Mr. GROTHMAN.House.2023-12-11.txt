 Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the American public and  my colleagues one more time of the biggest threat we face today, and  that is the huge volume of people crossing our southern border.   Again, in the most recent month available, we made an all-time record  of the number of people coming here, about 11 times the number of  people crossing the border as were crossing the border just 3 years  ago.   Don't let anybody tell you we have got to work on some solution. The  solution was there. Just a little bit of will, and you could cut it by  91 percent.   Above that, don't forget, over a million people are sworn in legally.  Don't let anybody ever tell you that we have a problem, and we have got  to get more people here. A million people per year come here legally.   Don't forget that during the Trump administration, when Trump was  criticized for not deporting enough criminals from this country, we  were deporting about four times the number of people here today.   The American public has to wake up and tell this body to get in gear  and do something about this illegal immigration.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate National Bible Week,  and it is right that we do so. Our forefathers felt very strongly that  America was fit for a moral and religious people and totally unfit for  anyone else, and our forefathers frequently quoted the Bible and made  reference to the Bible. I think if we are going to continue with our  oaths of office to uphold our Constitution, inevitably that means  familiarizing ourselves with the Bible and guiding ourselves in this  institution by the Bible.   George Washington, the father of our Nation, said that it is  impossible to rightly govern a nation without God and the Bible.   I just mentioned John Adams. I should mention Benjamin Rush who was a  signer of the Declaration of Independence and a Representative of  Pennsylvania at the beginning of our Nation.   The Bible contains more truth than any other book in the world. John  Jay was our first Supreme Court Justice. For some who think there is a  separation of church and state, John Jay, our first Supreme Court  Justice said: ``Let us therefore persevere steadfastly in distributing  the Scriptures far and near, and without note or comment. We are  assured that they are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for  correction, for instruction in righteousness.''   John Quincy Adams, the son of John Adams, said: ``The Bible is of all  books in the world that which contributes most to make men good, wise,  and happy.''   Of all the books in the Old Testament other than, of course, Psalms,  which is a very long book, the book quoted most by our forefathers was  Deuteronomy. It is kind of interesting because normally, Mr. Speaker,  when you hear somebody quote something in the Bible, you never hear  Deuteronomy. Nevertheless, what I take it to mean is that Deuteronomy  was kind of the book laying out the type of government that our Lord  expected the Jewish people to have when they left Egypt and established  their land even before they had a king.   Therefore, if you look at it that way, Mr. Speaker, it is not  surprising at all. In any event, I do think it is time for the American  public--there are some churches that do it more than others--to read  some of the Bible, to try to live by its precepts, and insofar as we  raise our younger people in this country, familiarize them with the  Bible and have them live by its precepts.   I thank Congressman Lamborn for yielding to me to talk about the  Bible. I hope Members of Congress, when they return after this week to  their districts, make a special point of reading parts of the Bible.
