 Mr. President, I rise to honor the career of Sam  Mamet, who recently announced his retirement as the executive director  of the Colorado Municipal League. Sam spent the better half of his  adult life working to empower communities and local governments across  Colorado. It is not an understatement to say that every corner of the  State is incredibly grateful for his work.   Sam joined the Colorado Municipal League in 1979, when he spearheaded  the organization's advocacy in the State capitol. After 26 years in  that position, Sam would go on to spend the rest of his time in the  organization as its executive director. There, he worked tirelessly to  foster partnerships across the State and the country that have  benefited Colorado's 270 towns and cities. He also spent time as an  adjunct professor of political science at CU Denver.   Throughout my time in public service, I have always appreciated Sam's  thoughtful approach to policymaking, his collaborative spirit, and his  unwavering advocacy for our local communities. When I worked in local  government, I always knew I could count on Sam to ensure that our  perspective would be heard at the State and Federal level. After  joining the Senate, I have had the benefit of his advice across issues,  ranging from infrastructure to tax policy.   Going forward, I will miss Sam's wit, humility, and sense of humor-- attributes in short supply in our politics today.   Although Sam is retiring from the Municipal League, I suspect he will  continue to serve the State of Colorado with the same passion that has  characterized his career. We wish Sam well in retirement and extend our  deepest thanks for his lifetime of public service.                            ____________________
