 Madam Chair, I am greatly honored to support this  piece of legislation, especially honored that Chairwoman Lowey has put  language in there that will streamline the process that Mr. Hoyer  helped to develop.   I would just like to add this. I know what it is like to live in  harm's way. In Houston, Texas, we have billion-dollar floods that take  lives, and these are supposed to be 100-year floods. Unfortunately,  they are happening all too often, and sometimes on a yearly basis.   So I stand here today to say thank you to all involved, especially to  Mrs. Lowey for what she has done to streamline this process. It will be  helpful to persons in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, but, also, in  the long run, it will be helpful to the people of Houston, Texas.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Chair, I yield back the  balance of my time.
