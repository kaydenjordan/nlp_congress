 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  opposition to President Trump's proposed budget. This budget proposal  confirms our worst fears about the priorities of his administration.   The budget is cruel, it is shortsighted, and would be a disaster for  efforts to strengthen the middle class in my district and across this  country.   It will hurt hardworking families and communities throughout New  Hampshire. It guts public education, afterschool programs, and student  loan support. It jeopardizes clean air, clean water, and our response  to the opioid epidemic that is reaching crisis proportions.   It eliminates critical programs for the most vulnerable, like the Low  Income Home Energy Assistance Program which keeps low-income seniors  and families warm in the cold winter months and SNAP which helps  families feed their children, and decimates successful economic  development programs like the Northern Border Regional Commission and  community development block grants.   The last thing we should be doing is eliminating effective programs  that create jobs and boost our economic competitiveness.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose these misguided cuts.                            ____________________
