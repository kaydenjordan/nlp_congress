 Mr. Speaker, Representatives of the 115th Congress, I am  profoundly humbled and honored that the people of my district have  entrusted me with the duty of representing them.   The work of conducting the people's business in this Chamber has  endured through unfinished struggles for equality and justice, through  conflicts abroad and crises at home.   I look forward to taking part in that work through the remainder of  this session and into the next Congress, when a historically diverse  freshman class, including more women than ever before in our Nation's  history, will take their oaths. Our first responsibility must be to the  most vulnerable and least fortunate among us, and our voices should  amplify theirs.   My parents both lived lives of service. My father, a conservative  Republican, spent his entire career in the Air Force and was driven by  a sense of duty. My mother, a progressive Democrat, believed at her  core that we are defined by what we do for others. They have both  passed away now, but my standing here is a testament to them.   We in Congress have a responsibility and opportunity to improve the  everyday lives of the people of our districts. On behalf of my  community, your communities, and generations to come, I know that we  can and must rise to the occasion and deliver shared and lasting  progress.                            ____________________
