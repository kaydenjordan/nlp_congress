 Madam President, today I wish to congratulate  Ascension Parish Sheriff Jeffrey Wiley on an exceptional career and to  thank him for his service to the people of Louisiana. Sheriff Wiley has  served Louisiana honorably, putting his life on the line for the  protection and safety of his community for many years.   Sheriff Wiley is a Marine Corps veteran and began his law enforcement  career while attending advanced military police training at Fort Gordon  in Georgia. He joined the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Department in 1974  as a patrol officer and was quickly promoted to the detective division  in 1975, where he specialized in juvenile justice.   It was during this time that Sheriff Wiley helped organize several  initiatives, including the Junior Deputy Program and the Sheriffs Young  Adult League. He would later go on to serve on the Ascension Parish  School Board, where he helped establish numerous programs, such as the  Substance Abuse Education Program and the placement of substance abuse  counselors in the schools.   In 1988, he returned to the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Department and  was appointed chief criminal deputy. He spearheaded the department's  first full-time narcotics division and the implementation of the  D.A.R.E. program. After being elected sheriff, he grew the patrol/ traffic force by 40 percent, increased police salaries, and put more  officers on the street. His first term was so successful that he became  the first sheriff in the history of Ascension Parish to be reelected  without opposition. In 2009, he was inducted into the Louisiana Justice  Hall of Fame.   It is because of his long list of accomplishments and good deeds that  we honor Sheriff Wiley. We thank him for his commitment to the people  of Ascension Parish and to the people of our State. Our communities are  safer because of his dedication to the rule of law. Thank you, Sheriff  Wiley, for 22 years in office and for a lifetime of service to  Ascension Parish and to Louisiana.                            ____________________
