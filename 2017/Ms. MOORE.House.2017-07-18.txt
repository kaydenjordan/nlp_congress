 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just  want to tell you how grateful I am that my colleagues want to have this  dialogue, this colloquy with me.   I have been so disturbed by the false information that is being given  to Americans about the Affordable Care Act, the whole notion that it is  somehow in this death spiral, that somehow the Affordable Care Act is  dead. And I think that the President and our illustrious Speaker, and  the majority are promoting this point of view because they want the  public to believe that the things that they are doing to destroy the  Affordable Care Act and, ultimately, Medicaid are the causes for them  not having health insurance, the causes for their premiums rising, the  causes for insurers fleeing the market in rural areas. And I just want  to spend some time this evening sharing the truth with you all this  evening.   The majority, they now have both houses of Congress: the Senate and  the House of Representatives. They have the White House. And their  message that ObamaCare or the Affordable Care  [[Page H5972]]  Act is dead sort of covers up the fact that they owe the insurance  industry $8 billion that we, in the Affordable Care Act, promised to  give to the insurance companies while they sort of figured out how much  premiums would cost in this new market.   They have sued the Federal Government because they say that the  subsidies that we are paying for poor people are unconstitutional. And,  of course, insurers, not knowing whether or not we are actually going  to appropriate the money for the Affordable Care Act because they don't  know whether we are going to do it or not, that causes destabilization  in the market.   They are threatening in their bill to eliminate the individual  mandate, which, of course, the individual mandate is a great source of  revenue.                                time  1830    They are gutting the taxes on the wealthiest people in the Affordable  Care Act to pay for some of the cost-sharing expenses. And, of course,  insurance companies have no idea. In order to set appropriate rates and  in order to stay in the market, insurance companies need some  certainty. So if, in fact, ObamaCare is dead, it is because they have  killed it.    Well, I am glad you asked that question, because there are  a couple of things that have happened. They ran into so much trouble in  the Senate from those Senators who were concerned about them block- granting the Medicaid program, killing basically Medicaid. This was  aside from the Affordable Care Act. To reduce Medicaid funding by one- third was one of the most egregious portions of the bills that have  come out of the House and the proposals in the Senate.   What people need to understand is that, especially in States like  Alaska, West Virginia, we have got 70 percent of people in nursing  homes depending on Medicaid. We are not talking about able-bodied  working people who have been able to benefit from the expansion of  Medicaid.    Exactly.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Will the gentleman yield?    Exactly.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, that is right, because the narrative is that  Medicaid only covers these ne'er-do-well, able-bodied people who the  Medicaid expansion dealt with. But the reason why the Senate, to answer  your question, couldn't live with the bill that was there is because  not only did it repeal the Affordable Care Act, so-called ObamaCare,  but it also undermined Medicaid, which is so vital.   And just think about this: cutting Medicaid by one-third would lead  to people in nursing homes competing with disabled children, disabled  children competing with other disabled adults, and with hospitals and  nursing homes fighting for the crumbs that fall from the master's  table.    It is mean.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. ``Mean'' was the exact word that the President  used.  [[Page H5973]]         Will the gentlewoman from Florida explain kind of the  budget reconciliation, where they are going to get these tax cuts?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    I would be stunned to think that any party or any  President would do that.   Infrastructure has been the bread and butter, and it has been one of  the most bipartisan things that we have.   When you talk about the need to expand our economy, expand the gross  domestic product, one of the sure-fire ways to do that is through  infrastructure projects. Not just building roads, but we need water  treatment plants, our new energy economy, we have bio technology, and a  number of other ways.   But I hail from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which is still very reliant on  the manufacturing industry. But I am wondering if my colleagues would  be surprised to know that healthcare is one-sixth of our economy, and  that if we were to repeal the Affordable Care Act and then slash the  growth of Medicaid by one-third over the next decade, that there will  literally be millions of jobs that are lost?   I mean, everybody depends on the healthcare system, whether you are  the brain surgeon or you are the guy that is mopping up the ICU;  whether you are the person who is dispensing pharmaceuticals at CVS or  whether you are the receptionist at the community health center.   And by destroying the Affordable Care Act, we are going to cost shift  a lot to our States. Just over the next decade, it is $68 billion of  unfunded mandates shifted to the States so that they won't be able to  fund things.   And I just want to point something out before I finish. There are a  lot of people who think that this just doesn't matter to me. Those 24  million, 22 million, whatever number people agree upon that the CBO  says that will lose health insurance if the Affordable Care Act ends-- those people who are in nursing homes--that doesn't matter to me.  Forty-nine percent of the folks in this country receive their  healthcare through their employer and your premiums will go sky high,  unlike what President Trump says, because you will have to pay for all  of the uncompensated care that this country will see after we destroy  Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act.
