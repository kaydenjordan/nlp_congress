 Mr. Chair, I rise today on an issue very personal to me  and to American workers: the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or  the PRO Act.   I am a member of the IBEW for over 40 years and a lifelong labor  leader, a proud labor leader. I can attest to the importance of giving  workers a voice by protecting them from unfair labor practices.   I saw, firsthand, as workers were unjustly fired, lost their wages,  their job, because they dared to speak up about unionization; workers  with families back home, living paycheck to paycheck, who couldn't  afford to be out of work, but they understood how important this was.   Companies have the money. They hire the $1,000-an-hour lawyers. They  delay, they delay, they delay. They would make an example out of one  person, as unjust as that is. They put the life of that worker on hold.   Currently, the NLRA has no penalties for employers that do this, that  violate the law. If workers are fired, there is no current recourse.   I would just ask that we support the PRO Act.   Mr. Chair, I enter into the Record letters of support from the IBEW,  the International Union of Operating Engineers, and the International  Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers.                                          International Brotherhood                                           of Electrical Workers,                                   Washington, DC, February 3, 2020.      To: All Members of the United States House of           Representatives.      Re Protecting the Right to Organize Act.         Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the 775,000 active       members and retirees of the International Brotherhood of       Electrical Workers (IBEW), I urge you to vote in support of       H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act,       when it is considered by the full U.S. House of       Representatives this week and to oppose weakening amendments       and any Motion to Recommit. The PRO Act would restore the       original intent of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to       protect workers' right to organize a union and negotiate       higher wages and better benefits.        The right to organize and collectively bargain is a       fundamental right of all Americans and the bedrock of a       capitalist society that allows the benefits of a growing       economy to be shared broadly between workers and employers.       These fundamental rights, however, have been steadily       undermined in recent decades. As a result, union membership       has dropped precipitously from over 20 percent in 1983 to       just 10 percent in 2018. During the same period, incomes for       the bottom half of income earners in the United States have       grown by just one percent between 1980 and 2014, while income       for the top one percent increased by 205 percent. Today,       income inequality has reached levels that predate the Great       Depression.        The reason membership in labor unions is declining is not       due to eroding interest in family-sustaining wages and       benefits--it is because employers have the upper hand.       Workers attempting to unionize often face a hostile legal       environment and are commonly intimidated by aggressive anti-      union employers. Outdated labor laws have failed to provide       Americans with protection from this anti-worker onslaught       against collective bargaining.        The Economic Policy Institute published a report in       December 2019 that found 41.5 percent of all employers in a       National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) sponsored election were       charged with violating federal labor law. The PRO Act would       help even this vastly tilted playing field by invoking       stronger remedies for violating the law. Currently, there are       no penalties on employers who illegally fire or retaliate       against workers attempting to form a union. This legislation       establishes compensatory damages for workers and penalties       against employers when they fire or retaliate against       workers. In addition, the PRO Act streamlines the NLRB       process so workers can petition to form a union and get a       timely vote without their employer interfering or delaying       the vote. It would also prohibit companies from forcing       workers to attend mandatory captive audience meetings as a       condition of continued employment.        Even if workers do vote for union representation, more than       half do not have a collective bargaining agreement a year       later. The PRO Act would establish a process for reaching a       first agreement when workers organize.        Employers often misclassify workers as supervisors or       independent contractors to deprive them of their rights under       the NLRA while allowing management to skirt minimum wage,       Social Security and workers' compensation laws. The PRO Act       tightens the definitions of independent contractor and       supervisor to crack down on misclassification and extend NLRA       protections to more eligible workers.        Unions provide skills training and continuing education to       their membership, as well as a more stable and safer       workforce. A worker covered by a union contract earns more       than 13 percent more in wages than a peer with similar       education, occupation and experience in a non-union workplace       in the same sector. Where unions are strong, wages are higher       for typical workers--union and nonunion members alike.        Research shows that workers want unions, evidenced by the       large gap between the share of workers with union       representation--about 12 percent--and the share of workers       that would like to have a voice on the job--48 percent. The       PRO Act would take a major step forward toward closing that       gap.        There is no better path to the middle class than a union       job with the security it provides in salary, health benefits       and retirement income. Family sustaining middle class jobs       are the route to economic security, providing the crucial       financial cushion that protect so many families on the edge       of economic disaster once a job loss or a medical emergency       hits a family. Unions provide economic independence and self-      sufficiency, and an expanding middle class is good for the       economy and the country.        The IBEW urges all members of the United States House of       Representatives to stand with working Americans in every       state and community and vote in favor of the PRO Act.            Sincerely yours,                                              Lonnie R. Stephenson,      International President.                                   ____                                              International Union of                                             Operating Engineers,                                   Washington, DC, January 31, 2020.        Dear Representative: The International Union of Operating       Engineers requests your support for the Protecting the Right       to Organize (PRO) Act, H.R. 2474, and to oppose any weakening       amendments and any Motion to Recommit when the House of       Representatives considers the bill. The PRO Act will repair       the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to protect workers       and strengthen the fundamental rights of Operating Engineers       across the nation.        The International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) is       one of North America's leading construction unions,       representing nearly 400,000 hardworking men and women in the       United States and Canada. Most members of the IUOE work in       the construction sector, operating and maintaining heavy       equipment, in addition to other occupations in the industry.       We represent heavy equipment operators, mechanics, surveyors,       and other occupations in the sector, and, building the       nation's public works is the bread and butter of the skilled,       proud members of the Operating Engineers union.        The PRO Act would reinforce the federal laws that protect       workers' right to organize a union and bargain for better       wages, benefits, and conditions at their workplaces. For       decades, working families could depend on unions to represent       their collective interests and, by encouraging collective       bargaining, the NLRA offered protection and empowered workers       to seek fairness on the job.  [[Page H886]]         Over the past 50 years, unethical employers have exploited       labor laws and routinely denied workers their basic rights.       While the collective strength of workers has eroded over       time, income inequality has reached levels that predate the       Great Depression. It is imperative that Congress protect the       rights of workers in order to guarantee a healthy economy.        This legislation addresses several major problems with the       current law and tries to level a playing field that is       currently stacked against workers. It will penalize employers       for interfering in the workers' right to form a union,       conduct organizing campaigns, and hold fair elections. It       will strengthen their ability to negotiate first contract       agreements and notably overrides so-called ``right-to-work''       laws by establishing a ``fair share'' clause. It will ensure       workers have a voice on the job by prohibiting employers from       permanently replacing strikers and repealing the prohibition       on secondary boycotts. In addition, it will protect workers       against misclassification--an egregious tactic used in the       construction industry to dodge wage and hour standards. The       PRO Act would ensure employers are not able to skirt their       responsibilities for pay, benefits, and other working       conditions.        This legislation will close loopholes in federal laws and       increase transparency in labormanagement relations. Without       these essential protections, the playing field will remain       heavily stacked against workers. Strengthening the collective       power of workers will strengthen our economy and restore the       American middle class. We urge you to support the PRO Act to       defend the dignity of work for all working families.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                 James T. Callahan,      General President.                                   ____           International Union of Bricklayers and Allied             Craftworkers,                                  Washington, DC, January 31, 2020.        Dear House Members: On behalf of the International Union of       Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers (BAC), I am writing to       express our strong support for the Protecting the Right to       Organize (PRO) Act, H.R. 2474. The PRO Act is historic       legislation that will help level the playing field and help       give workers the opportunity to exercise their right to       organize a union.        BAC is proud of the relationship that we share with our       signatory employers across the United States to provide vital       building and construction services to the communities we live       in. However, our members, and just as importantly the       contractors that hire them, are under assault by unscrupulous       corporations and employers that abuse and deny their workers       from having a meaningful voice in the workplace. The PRO Act       would help address these abuses and provide workers a fair       shot at forming a union of their choice to bargain for better       wages, benefits, and conditions in the workplace.        Too often, employers intentionally violate the law during       organizing campaigns because some of the penalties are so       weak that low road employers just view them as a small cost       of doing the business of union busting. The PRO act       strengthens penalties for such behavior in order to deter       employers from interfering with workers' rights.        The PRO Act also clarifies the definition of independent       contractor and supervisor to help prevent the       misclassification of workers. Misclassification is far too       common in construction and other industries and it prevents       workers from exercising their rights, getting the pay and       benefits they deserve, and deprives communities of much-      needed revenue through tax evasion.        Our economy is out of balance and it is time for Congress       to step up to protect working class families and restore       economic stability. We urge you to support the PRO Act and       oppose any weakening amendments when the House of       Representatives considers the bill.            Sincerely,                                               Timothy J. Driscoll,                                                         President.     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer a simple amendment to  protect the efficiency of the union representation election process by  ensuring that preelection hearings before the NLRB are conducted on a  day-to-day basis.   The PRO Act strengthens workers' rights to a free and fair union  representation election. It does so by preventing unnecessary delays,  which allow employers to engage more time against antiunion campaigns  that are designed to erode support for the union.   In 2014, the NLRB updated its union election procedures by enacting  reasonable deadlines and preventing employers from stalling elections  through frivolous litigation. The PRO Act codifies many of these  requirements, including the timeliness for pre- and post-election  hearings.   One important change in the 2014 election rule was to require that,  whenever the NLRB conducts a preelection hearing, the hearing must be  held from day to day. Prior to 2014, hearings could either be held day  to day or adjourned to a later date. Requiring these hearings to be  held day to day provides more certainty in the preelection hearing  process that codifies this best practice.                                time  1715    In those cases where the NLRB decides a pre-election hearing is  necessary; this amendment ensures efficiency in the NLRB pre-election  process and prevents employers from seizing upon unnecessary delays.   Unnecessary delays leading up to a representation election enables  employers to have more time to campaign against the union, through  lawful, or many times unlawful means. Once the NLRB receives a petition  for the union election, it must process the election expeditiously in  order for the rights of the workers to be upheld.   Mr. Chairman, I urge this amendment be voted on in the affirmative,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Back on December 18, the Trump NLRB issued a dramatic rewrite of the  union election procedures, thus undermining the streamlining efficiency  of the original 2014 election rule.   However, even in the NLRB by Trump, the new rule left this  requirement for elections to proceed day by day. They believe in  efficiency. They believe in doing things the correct way. This just  codifies it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Fake news. Don't believe it.   Just ask the people what they want to do. Close to 80 percent of  those in the workplace would vote today to join a union, if they were  allowed to under a fair process. That doesn't happen.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
