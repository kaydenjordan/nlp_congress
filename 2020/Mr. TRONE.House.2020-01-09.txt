 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to an  unnecessary war with Iran in support of this resolution.   Today, the question before us is: Are the American people more safe  or less safe after the killing of Qasem Soleimani?  [[Page H101]]    As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have significant  concerns about the administration's inability to answer this question  and communicate a coherent strategy to avoid war and keep us safe.   The American people have seen no evidence that killing Soleimani was  a result of an imminent threat; no evidence of a discernible political  plan for our policy toward Iran moving forward.   Questions of war and peace are the most fundamental of the issues  that come before this Congress. They require deliberate and thoughtful  decisionmaking. This action by the administration was not that.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  resolution.
