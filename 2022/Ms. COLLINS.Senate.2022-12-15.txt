 Mr. President, when it was reported a few years ago that  Senator Pat Toomey had taken up beekeeping, he said this about the  appeal of his new hobby:         When you're in my line of work, you're often dealing with       abstractions. It's fun to have something tangible, where you       can see the results.    Well, my good friend from Pennsylvania has, of course, produced many  tangible results during his 12 years in the Senate. As Senator Toomey's  service here draws to a close, I rise today in tribute to an  outstanding leader who has been as busy and beneficial as those hard- working bees he tends.   Pat came to the Senate in 2011 well prepared for this line of work by  his three terms in the House. With his background in the financial  services industry and as the owner and operator of a small family  business with his brothers, he has been an effective voice for economic  growth, regulatory reform, and fiscal responsibility. His respectful  demeanor, his integrity, and his commitment to getting the facts have  earned him the respect of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. His  persuasive and principled arguments often convince his opponents to  become his allies.   I always personally looked forward to Senator Toomey coming to visit  me to discuss a nominee or a piece of legislation. Inevitably, he would  arrive with all the facts, all the data, all the quotations, and make  his case. He didn't rely simply on rhetoric or an appeal to party  loyalty--not at all. His approach was to present a solid case for why I  should agree with him, and his track record, I must say, was very good.   Throughout his time in Congress, Pat has focused on creating good  jobs for the people in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and across our  entire country. He knows that America has the best workers in the  world, and when they have a level playing field, they can compete with  anyone.   Drawing on his expertise in finance, Pat pushed for policies that  supported workers and were conducive to the startup and growth of  businesses. He played an absolutely essential role in shaping the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the tax burden for American families.  He coauthored sections of the JOBS Act, which made it easier for  businesses to invest and expand. He has always worked to cut redtape to  help unleash economic opportunities.   There is another side to Pat as well. He is a true champion for those  who are vulnerable in our society. I have worked with him on many  issues over the years, including legislation to safeguard seniors from  financial exploitation, as well as a bill to support 50 million  Americans who serve as family caregivers. Pat has led efforts to better  protect children from abuse, as well as to prevent animal cruelty.   Pat is a determined leader. He is a leader who seeks bipartisan  solutions. After the horrendous and heartbreaking Sandy Hook school  shooting in 2012 that took the lives of 26 people, including 20  children, he reached across the aisle to work with another good friend  of mine, Senator Joe Manchin, on comprehensive legislation to keep  firearms out of the hands of criminals, terrorists, and those who are  dangerously mentally ill. That initiative laid the foundation for the  Safer Communities Act that became law this year. It was a pleasure to  serve with Pat on the bipartisan 20- Member working group who forged  that landmark law.   Pat, it has been such an honor to serve with you, and I cherish our  friendship. I will miss those visits to my office to straighten me out  on certain issues and to educate me.   In all sincerity, I really did look forward to those visits because  they were always an intellectual exchange, and you always made such a  great case.   I wish you, Kris, and your wonderful children all the best. You will  be missed.
