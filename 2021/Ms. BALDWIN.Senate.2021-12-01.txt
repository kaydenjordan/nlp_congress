 Mr. President, on Sunday, November 21, the joy and  celebration of Waukesha's annual Christmas parade was shattered by a  horrendous, senseless act of violence that took the lives of six  individuals and injured scores of others.   Immediately, the community responded. Waukesha police and  firefighters leapt into action, as did other first responders and so  did parade-goers, providing aid and comfort to the injured and their  families and those who witnessed such horrendous violence. They  escorted some to safety. Many used personal vehicles to bring victims  to area hospitals. These were acts of extraordinary heroism at a moment  of immense tragedy.   I, too, joined in the interfaith vigil the following evening, where I  joined hundreds upon hundreds in Waukesha and the surrounding area.  This is a first step of an infinite number of steps in both the  grieving and healing process. And while the entire vigil was moving in  so many ways, I just remember the end where neighbor turned to neighbor  to light their candles, and the light was passed on and on.   In that night, after dusk had passed, the area lit up, a symbol of  both hope and unity, as well as grief and remembrance.   I want to be very clear where I stand, as I stand together with the  Waukesha community. I think it is simply wrong and disrespectful to the  innocent lives that were taken away for anyone to play politics with  this horrific tragedy. We know this is not a political issue asking for  division; it is a community standing together in unity, asking for  [[Page S8842]]  support to heal and asking for our love and support as we move forward  together.   So we remember Wilhelm ``Bill'' Hospel, Virginia ``Ginny'' Sorenson,  Leanna ``Lee'' Owen, Tamara Durand, Jane Kulich, and 8-year-old Jackson  Sparks.   I yield back to my colleague to ask for a moment of silence in their  memory.
