 Mr. President, over the past year, there has been a  rising tide of violence and discrimination against Asian Americans,  from shouted insults and racial slurs to outright physical assaults.   I have attended a whole bunch of rallies against Asian-American  violence over the past few weeks. You would be heartsick--heartsick--to  hear the stories shared, the fear in the voices of Asian-American  citizens, and to listen to the way they change their daily lives to  avoid the subway or stay indoors most of the day.   The surge in anti-Asian violence is revolting and, sadly, contains  the echoes of dark chapters in our history when Asian Americans were  subject to widespread bigotry and discrimination.   The poison of racism has always existed in America, but  unfortunately, over the past 4 years, it seems to have found new life.  There is no question that the former President fanned the flames of  racial bias in our country and too often encouraged--let alone  discouraged--the vicious slander that connected COVID-19 to the people  of Asian descent.   Every day in America, in this 21st-century America, Asian Americans  fear they might be insulted, assaulted, spat upon, or even worse. As  Americans, we must stand up and do something about it. The foundation  of our pluralistic society is that an attack on one group is an attack  on all of us. So tomorrow the Senate will vote on whether to take up  and debate Senator Hirono's anti-Asian hate crimes bill, sponsored by  Representative Meng in the House. This bill is as unobjectionable as it  could be. It would designate a point person at the Justice Department  to identify hate crimes towards Asian Americans related to COVID-19,  telling Federal law enforcement to make these hate crimes a top  priority during the pandemic.   This isn't some kind of ``gotcha'' legislation. It is not some  complex new program or appropriation. This is as straightforward as it  gets. This is legislation our times demand.   Of course, we are open to strengthening the bill. I understand that  there is an effort underway to add bipartisan legislation called the No  Hate Act--sponsored by Senators Blumenthal and Moran, one Democrat and  one Republican--as an amendment, and I fully support that effort.   The Blumenthal-Moran bill would provide resources to State and local  law enforcement to improve hate crimes reporting, increase training,  while also improving education to root out the bias that fuels these  despicable, despicable acts. That makes perfect sense as a bipartisan  amendment to Senator Hirono's legislation, and I believe that combating  hate against the Asian-American community should be thoroughly, if not  unanimously, bipartisan.   Congress can send a strong signal in one loud, clear voice that these  kinds of hate crimes will not be tolerated. The way to do it is for 60  Senators to vote to proceed to the bill tomorrow. I sure hope it will  be more than 60. Then it is my intention to make the first amendment to  the bill the bipartisan No Hate Act, but in order to offer the  [[Page S1880]]  amendment, the Senate must vote to proceed with debate on the bill.   President Biden has called on Congress to swiftly pass Senator  Hirono's legislation and get it to his desk for signature as soon as  possible. There is no good reason the Senate can't complete the task  this week.                            ____________________     Now on another matter, beyond Senator Hirono's  legislation, the Senate is also focused this week on confirming an  impressive slate of nominees to the Biden administration.   I am especially pleased that in a few hours, the Senate will vote to  confirm Polly Trottenberg to serve as Deputy Secretary of  Transportation. This is great news for New York and great news for the  country.   Her credentials are beyond doubt. For the last 7 years, she has  served as New York City's commissioner of transportation, managing a  transportation system that helps tens of millions of people get to and  from work, connects businesses to customers, and brings life to one of  America's largest and most visited cities every single day.   Before that, Polly served in the Department of Transportation under  President Obama, advising policymakers and working with stakeholders  across the country on everything from high-speed rail to roads,  highways, and bridges.   Of course, her nomination is especially meaningful to me. Polly  served for nearly a decade as my legislative director and  transportation adviser. She knows the needs of the country, and she  knows the needs of New York. And a pet project so important to the New  York Gateway will be well served in her capable hands. We will get this  done.   Take it from me: Polly has smarts, she has savvy, and she has moxie.  She knows how to work with people of all backgrounds to get things done  for the American people. And there isn't a moment to lose. As we work  to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic and bring our economy fully back  online, we must look ahead to tackle the challenges of our time, and on  top of the list is finally getting serious about addressing our  Nation's crumbling infrastructure--a topic that Ms. Trottenberg is very  familiar with.   For New York, as I mentioned, this means continuing to move the ball  forward on projects like Gateway, rebuilding the two rail tunnels under  the Hudson--perhaps the most important transportation infrastructure  priority in the entire Nation and something I have spoken to Ms.  Trottenberg and Secretary Buttigieg and President Biden about  regularly.   But our infrastructure woes extend to every city and every State in  the country. Our roads, bridges, highways, airports, public transit,  housing, and the electric grid are all in need of an overhaul. So, too,  does our country need to invest in the infrastructure of the 21st  century--broadband internet access, 5G, electric vehicles. America  cannot compete in this century if our infrastructure is stuck in the  last century.   That is why, in addition to confirming important nominees like Ms.  Trottenberg, the Senate will continue to work with the Biden  administration on a comprehensive infrastructure and jobs bill. If  there is an issue that ought to unite Democrats and Republicans, it is  putting people to work to update our Nation's infrastructure.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
