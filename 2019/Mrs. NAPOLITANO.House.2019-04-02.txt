 Mr. Speaker, as the chair of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, I rise  to celebrate Clean Water Week. I would like to take this opportunity to  highlight the importance of water for our communities, not only in my  home State of California, but across the country. Americans depend on  clean water for their health, the health of their communities, and the  health of the economy.   Our water resources are precious, and every drop matters, which is  why we need significant Federal investment in our Nation's  infrastructure and strong Federal protections for our Nation's water  resources.   We need to protect our waterways, large and small, from pollution;  ensure we conserve our water resources; recycle water where we can; and  protect our groundwater resources for long-term reliance.   There are tremendous clean water infrastructure needs facing our  country. Our communities, large and small, urban and rural, and tribal,  as well as our American families are facing great challenges in meeting  these needs.    Today, our Nation's network of sewers, stormwater conveyances, and  treatment facilities are aging, often very outdated, and, in many  places all over the country, not meeting the needs of our communities  or water quality standards.   We, in Congress, need to do more, not only to renew the Federal  financial commitment to repair, replace, and upgrade our water-related  infrastructure, but also to ensure that this work remains affordable to  all of our communities.   Today, too many Americans are uncertain whether their drinking water  is safe for themselves and for their families. Now is not the time to  cut back on the protections of our Nation's clean water. Yet, this  administration is proposing to do just that.   For more than 45 years, the Clean Water Act has helped to protect our  streams, our rivers, our wetlands, and our lakes, and provided States  with the tools to keep our waters clean. This administration has  proposed eliminating longstanding protections for small streams and  wetlands, which play a very important role in feeding our drinking  water resources. They also help store water during storms and alleviate  flooding, which, in turn, protects communities. These small streams and  wetlands help recharge our groundwater supplies. They also filter  pollution and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.   Clean and safe water is a very basic human need. Unfortunately, this  administration has made it a priority to dismantle the Clean Water Act,  regardless of what the science or the law provides. The President's  #DirtyWaterRule puts our water and health at risk and must be stopped.   Our drought cycle in southern California continues, even though we  have had repeated rain in March. We must continue to conserve. This  must be the new norm for us in the West.                            ____________________
