 Madam Speaker, the history of whistleblowing dates back  to the founding of this country. The Continental Congress was committed  to making sure that whistleblowers would have a voice. Last year alone,  $2.2 billion was saved by the taxpayers because of whistleblowers in  our government.   The April massacre of IGs was an unprecedented power play by the  President, a ruthless President who somehow thought they worked for  him. They don't work for him. They didn't work for him. They work for  the American people, and that is why, since the founding of this  country, we have been so committed to it.    Today's legislation will protect IGs from retaliation and increase  their independence, ensuring they operate free from political  interference. Those complaints that those IGs were looking at were  brought to them by individuals. It was a political move by the  President to fire them.   I am interested that my colleague on the other side of the aisle was  concerned about the costs of being represented by counsel when someone  who is a Federal employee is called in to testify. Maybe we can work on  a bill to make sure that every Federal employee has that benefit. No  one talked about that when Ambassador Yovanovitch was called in to  testify or National Security Advisor Fiona Hill or Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman, all of whom had to pick up the tab for the attorneys  representing them.   Last month during a hearing before the Oversight Subcommittee on  Government Operations, the current Chair of the Council of the  Inspectors General, Inspector General Allison Lerner, testified that  while they offer multiple trainings for IGs, the trainings are not  mandated.   I believe, without mandated training, it is impossible to ensure that  IGs are operating at the highest level and are well-equipped to carry  out their duties, so I am pleased that my amendment requiring minimum  standards and best practices for training IGs has been included in this  bill.
