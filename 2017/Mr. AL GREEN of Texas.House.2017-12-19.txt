 Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do anticipate additional  speakers, and I will be making comments myself.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, because I believe in truth in labeling, truth in  titling, truth in the style of legislation, Mr. Speaker, I believe that  this bill should be appropriately styled the Big Bank Bonus Bill.   As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that this  bill be styled the Big Bank Bonus Bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am sorry?    A UC request.   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side have said much about Barney  Frank.   Chairman Frank was a dear friend of mine. I knew him well. I still do  know him well. Mr. Speaker, Chairman Frank has not endorsed this bill.  The language that they have used would lead an unsuspecting person to  conclude that Chairman Frank supports this piece of legislation. He  does not.   I have in my hand a letter from Chairman Frank. I will read a portion  of it. He indicates:         H.R. 3312 significantly increases the need for subjective       judgment by the regulators and very much weakens the ability       of financial institutions to rely on clear rules to guide       their decisionmaking.    Mr. Speaker, without question, Chairman Frank does not support this  legislation.   My friends have made much to-do about the term ``arbitrary and  capricious,'' a threshold that is arbitrary. What is more arbitrary  than reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent,  which you just did? What is more arbitrary than reducing the individual  tax rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, which you just did?   You are the masters of arbitrary and capricious numbers. That bill  that you just passed is flush with arbitrary and capricious numbers.   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that they examine their thoughts about  arbitrary and capricious before we continue, because I have more to say  about arbitrary and capricious numbers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Sarbanes), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I would like to engage my friend from Minnesota, if I may, before he  leaves. Would the gentleman please not leave?   Would Mr. Hensarling ask the gentleman not to leave? I want to engage  him.   I would like to engage Mr. Emmer, if he will come back, please. I  would like to engage with the gentleman for just a moment if I may.   The gentleman declines.   Is there anyone on the other side that I can talk to?   I ask Mr. Hensarling, is 39.6 arbitrary, reducing the taxes on  individuals from 39.6 to 37? What is 37? Why is it not arbitrary?    Pardon?    I yield time. Yes, of course.    I yield.    I yield you such time as I may deem necessary,  if you will take time.   Well, you may use your own time.    Mr. Speaker, the arbitrary numbers that they  have they don't care to defend.   Let's talk about the one-size-fits-all accusation, if you will.   Mr. Speaker, I have a source, and it is the Department of the  Treasury, which indicates that we have a tiered system, and we actually  have five different tiers. These tiers will allow banks to be  classified as small, midsize, regional, international active, and G- SIBs.                                time  1545    There is a tiering system, but within the tiering system, we have  given the regulators the authority to tailor rules to fit banks within  the system.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague mentioned institution failure. I was here.  I know what happened in 2008. I understand why we have Dodd-Frank. We  don't have Dodd-Frank because Mr. Dodd and Mr. Frank woke up one  morning and decided that they would like to regulate banks to the  extent that they were regulated.   We have Dodd-Frank because we had a crisis. We had Dodd-Frank  developed because of exotic products, the 327s and the 228s, which had  teaser rates that would allow persons to get into loans that had fixed  rates for 3 years or 2 years, and then they would have 27 years of  variable rates or 28 years of variable rates.   This was the exotic product that a good many people had and could not  get out of because, quite frankly, they also had a prepayment penalty  that would coincide with these teaser rates.   It was a time of great crisis for banking.   We also had the so-called credit default swaps, which were just  another way of laying off bets. Banks found clever ways to lay off  their bets that they thought were risky.   We had no-doc loans, negative amortization. You could pay as much as  you wanted and would add to the principal what you didn't pay, which  means that you would end up paying a lot more for your loan than you  initially started out owing.   We had interest-only loans: just pay the interest, let the loan  continue to increase in value.   There was no firewall between commercial banking and investment  banking. They finally got Glass-Steagall. Took them decades to do it,  but they did.   Then we had the dastardly yield spread premium, which would allow the  person who was servicing you, the loan originator, to qualify you for a  loan at 5 percent, come out and shake your hand and say: Good news, you  now have a loan for 10 percent.   That was all lawful, but Dodd-Frank ended all of this.   We have Dodd-Frank because we had a deregulation era, very much  comparable to what we are about to go through now. Banks were regulated  to the extent that they couldn't do all of these things, but we  deregulated, just as we are about to do it now, and we will get back to  the future, where banks will not have the liquidity necessary, where  the credit risk that they take will be unreasonable.   This is a bill that belongs on the trash heap of history. I adamantly  oppose the bill. I believe that it is time for us to take the stand  that the American people want us to take, not the stand that the big  banks would have us take.   This is a big bank bonus. The big banks love this bill. Thirty banks  are going to be relieved of their obligation to let us know how to put  them out of their misery in the event that they are about to bring the  banking system down. Thirty banks. These are big banks, $500 billion  max. Big banks.   These banks will continue to give us their stress test so that we can  know what their liquidity is and understand their credit worthiness by  virtue of the loans that they make.   This bill is what the big banks want, but not the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member.    Mr. Speaker, what is the amount of time  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, this bill does not impact 99 percent, approximately, of  the banks. Most banks in this country have assets--about 89 to 90  percent of them--of $1 billion or under.                                time  1600    This bill is for the big banks. The big banks are doing quite well.  Last year, the banks made record profits of $171 billion. Community  banks grew at 8.3 percent, and big banks grew at a 4.8 percent rate.  They are lending to businesses at a record level.   So the contention cannot be that they are doing this because banks  are losing money. It has very little to do with how much money they are  losing. It has a lot to do with the fact that big banks would like to  be deregulated so that they can get back to the business as usual that  caused the crisis of 2008.   Mr. Speaker, there are 30 big banks this bill will impact worth more  than $5 trillion in assets. This bill is not needed because, if this  bill is implemented, it will cause the banks to no longer be placed  under the $50 billion threshold, except by way of regulation from the  prudential regulator, which won't happen easily.   MetLife is a pretty good example of what can happen. Currently,  MetLife is in court. They are tied up in court, probably indefinitely,  because the big banks have big bucks, and they are  [[Page H10227]]  going to fight being designated as SIFIs.   MetLife is fighting it. It is an insurance company, of course, but it  is fighting it. If they are going to fight the designation, you have to  have some way to put them under the stress test, under the living wills  test. This has to be done.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30  seconds.   If you don't have a trigger, it is not likely to be done, because the  banks are going to fight you all the way through the courts and tie you  up for years.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the amount of  time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters).    Mr. Speaker, how much time does the other  gentleman from Texas have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think that we have to reemphasize that Chairman Frank  is not supporting this bill. I thought that the initial comment would  be sufficient, but, again, I will read what Chairman Frank has  delivered to us. He indicates that H.R. 3312 significantly increases  the need for subjective judgments by the regulators and very much  weakens the ability of financial institutions to rely on clear rules to  guide their decisionmaking. Chairman Frank does not support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not before the House because banks are  losing money. Banks are making record profits: $171 billion last year.  The big banks, a 4.8 percent growth rate; and community banks, an 8.3  percent growth rate.   This bill is before the House because the big banks want to again get  back to business as usual, which will allow them to do many of the  things that brought this economy to its knees.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, we have 30 banks with assets in  excess of $5 trillion. These banks have been designated as SIFIs for a  reason. They ought to have to let the regulators know how they can be  wound down in the event there is a crisis in the economy. They ought to  undergo stress tests.   If a consumer wants a loan, the consumer has to demonstrate  creditworthiness. If banks of this size are going to remain in  business, they ought to let us know what their liquidity is and be  required to have a certain amount of liquidity that will cause them to  stay in business, even when we are faced with a crisis. They ought to  be tested for their creditworthiness. That is what we currently have.   If the $50 billion threshold is released, then they will be placed  under the designation of SIFI only by regulators; and MetLife is proof  positive that it is difficult, if not impossible, to do.   AIG went under simply because it was already known to be a  systemically important institution.   Mr. Speaker, we must defeat this bill. I call on my colleagues to  vote against it. It is a big-bank-bonus bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to remind my colleague  that he will have another chance to vote on impeachment and to ask for  a recorded vote.
