 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  an inspiring woman in my district, Mrs. Gail Kemler. Gail is  celebrating her 100th birthday this month on October 28.   Gail has lived in Rochester, Michigan, since 1931, and has been an  integral part of the city--through her steadfast volunteerism with the  Rochester Board of Education; Daughters of the American Revolution,  Stoney Creek Chapter; Rochester-Avon Historical Society; Rochester  Lions Club; and Questers Organization.   Gail's longest tenure as a volunteer was with the Rochester Area  Neighborhood House, an organization that she has helped from its  inception. She remained a dedicated volunteer with the organization for  over 50 years.   An active supporter of the Rochester Community Schools, Gail also  served as a room mother and scout leader, and was one of the original  PTA founders. She has been a member of the First Congregational Church  in Rochester for over 85 years, and has served on the building  committee, pastoral search committee, and board of trustees.   Gail and her late husband, Donald Kemler, have four children, nine  grandchildren, four great-grandchildren, and four great-great- grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have such a selfless, giving, and  inspirational woman in my district. Thank you, Mrs. Gail Kemler, for  your service to the entire Rochester community, and happy 100th  birthday.                            ____________________
