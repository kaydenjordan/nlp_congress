 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Mr. Vincent Speranza, a 101st Airborne Division paratrooper,  a Battle of the Bulge legend, and now a frequent flyer out of the  Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport in Springfield, Illinois.   Mr. Speranza is 95 years old and usually flies out of Abraham Lincoln  on his way to travel the world or to jump out of airplanes like last  year with the U.S. Army's Golden Knights.   Just a few weeks ago, I had the honor of being on the same flight as  he was. TSA Officers Martin Derhake and Deanna Victor love Mr. Speranza  and know he will always have a new story to brighten their day and lift  their spirits.   Mr. Speranza grew up in Staten Island but now lives in Sherman,  Illinois. He became a paratrooper after basic training and joined the  101st just prior to the Battle of the Bulge, where his actions have  cemented his legacy to this day. Mr. Speranza filled up his Army helmet  with beer from a tap in Bastogne for his friend who was wounded. Later,  Airborne Beer was born because of Speranza's efforts. Madam Speaker, I  urge you to look this story up if you haven't already.   I thank Mr. Speranza for his service to our country, for the way his  presence brightens everyone's day, and for helping his fellow troops  find a beer during the Battle of the Bulge.   Cheers to many more years, my friend.                            ____________________
