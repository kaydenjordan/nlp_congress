 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate three  decades of faithful leadership from New Orleans minister Bishop Darryl  S. Brister.   Bishop Brister's life is a story of dedication and purpose. His  commitment to his faith led him to leadership in the Full Gospel  Baptist Church Fellowship International, becoming its second presiding  bishop in 1996 at the tender age of 29 years old.   Bishop Brister's impact extends far beyond his church's walls. He has  taken the Word of God around the world, from Japan to Africa. He also  founded nonprofit organizations, including DSB International  Ministries, which provides spiritual guidance to those incarcerated,  and the Darryl S. Brister Scholarship Fund, which supports students'  educational aspirations.   Bishop Brister's commitment to his calling remains steadfast. He  continues to inspire, guide, and support his community, living a life  that is dedicated to serving God and those around him.   It is an honor to celebrate Bishop Brister's 30 years of spiritual  leadership. May he continue to shine as a spiritual light for all those  he touches.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Bishop Brister for his extraordinary friendship,  service, and commitment to the community and his unwavering commitment  to spreading the Word of God.                            ____________________
