 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2480, the  bipartisan Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.   Child maltreatment is a public health crisis and a threat to our  country. Although we have made progress toward reducing cases of child  maltreatment since passage of the original CAPTA, in recent years, the  rates at which children are abused and neglected have steadily  increased. Evidence suggests that the opioid crisis is responsible for  new challenges in protecting vulnerable children.   Stronger CAPTA is an important step toward making sure that all  children grow up in safe and healthy environments that allow them to  reach their full potential.   The bill will strengthen Federal investments in community-based  prevention services so families across the country can receive help  before children suffer.   It will build networks of wraparound services that lower the risk of  child maltreatment by helping families navigate complex health,  education, and financial hardships.   It will seek to reduce rates of child maltreatment exacerbated by the  opioid crisis by supporting the development of best practices and  strategies.   Importantly, the bill will streamline communication between and among  States so child protection agencies across the country can work  together and prevent cases of maltreatment from slipping through the  cracks, no matter where they occur.    Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott and Ranking  Member Foxx but also especially Ranking Member Comer of the  subcommittee and Representatives Schrier, Trahan, Johnson, and Stefanik  for their leadership.   I strongly urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill.
