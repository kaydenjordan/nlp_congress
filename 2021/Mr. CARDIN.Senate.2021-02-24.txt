 Madam President, each February, we mark Black History  Month by coming together to highlight the achievements and  contributions of Black Americans to our national story and remember the  centuries of struggle that have shaped our society.   At every turning point in American history, Black American  achievements and calls to action have driven our Nation's cultural,  economic, and social progress forward, helping to hold to account the  promises of freedom and equality for all people that our founding  doctrine failed to uphold.   For too long, this history and the names and faces of those who  marched, sacrificed, and fought for change have been obscured by  prejudice and hate. It is our charge to remember those who marched for  justice and the forces they marched against.   When we ignore the injustices of our past, we cannot make amends in  the present. The consequences of such inaction are grave and live on in  present day: the ongoing racial and religious profiling, brutality, and  killing of Black Americans by police; the high rates of COVID-19  transmission and death in Black communities; and the disproportionate  impact this current economic crisis has had on Black workers and Black- owned businesses.   The unemployment rate for Black workers reached 9.9 percent, for  instance--far beyond the national average of 6.7 percent, according to  the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   These issues, including the broader economic and health consequences  of the pandemic, result from systemic failures in place far before the  current crisis, and they threaten to worsen racial gaps in wealth,  health outcomes, and opportunities for years to come.   Last year, our Nation's fight against racism gained new urgency by a  police officer's callous killing of George Floyd in May. The Trump  administration and law enforcement's response to peaceful protests  further displayed the double standard that still exists in our society  today. Protesters were attacked with tear gas and rubber bullets across  the Nation and here in our capital as they organized and marched to  make it known that Black lives matter. We watched on television as the  National Guard forcefully removed peaceful protesters from Lafayette  Park to make way for President Trump to walk to St. John's Episcopal  Church for a photo op. President Trump brandished a Bible in front of  the church while he continued to fan the flames of bigotry, hate, and  racism.   The historic election of Kamala Harris as our Nation's first Black  female Vice President serves as a reminder of the power of collective  action. The Biden-Harris administration gives us opportunity to take  meaningful action in government to create a more just society. In the  year ahead, we must work together to advance the George Floyd Justice  in Policing Act to bring accountability to law enforcement and the   John Lewis Voting Rights Act to combat voter suppression and restore  the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   It is our charge to mobilize all levels, from our communities to the  Oval Office, to advance social, economic, and civil rights and justice  to all Americans. It is time to expel all remaining vestiges of slavery  and White supremacy that continue to plague our Nation.   As our National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman said so eloquently  in her inaugural day address, ``[B]eing American is more than [just] a  pride we inherit, it's the past we step into and how we repair it.''  Black History Month is a reminder to look to this past and to act on  our responsibilities in the present to make our Nation a better place  for all of us.   We are still fighting against the vestiges of the institutions of  slavery, of targeted violence and resistance in the Reconstruction and  the Jim Crow eras, and of the tactics to keep Black Americans from the  polls and out of government   They are not merely footnotes in our history textbooks; they are the  lineage of our Nation, the obstacles that have left millions of our  citizens behind in the effort to obtain the American dream.   The realization of justice and true equality depends on our work to  build a country committed to righting historic wrongs, closing gaps in  the opportunity to achieve, and dismantling vestiges of inequality in  our foundations. The 28 days in February must set the tone for the  entire year--a continued commitment to justice, equality, and  opportunity.   Celebrating Black experiences and culture contributes to the  greatness of our diverse society. Such a celebration is aspirational,  highlighting one of the many fundamental components that make this  Nation a beacon around the world despite our flaws.   For the past 40 years, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer celebrated  Black History Month by hosting a breakfast for political and civic  leaders and inviting illustrious keynote speakers. Past speakers  included then-Senator Barack Obama and Congressman John Lewis.  Congressman Anthony Brown joined the effort to bring so many of us  together for this 40th Annual Black History Month Celebration and  featured Vice President Harris as the honored guest and keynote  speaker.   I would like to acknowledge the planning committee for this year's  event, including Jackie Rhone and the former chair, Betty Richardson.  Through their hard work, the celebration is a true success that  everyone who participates looks forward to year after year.   This year's event focused on the identity, representation, and  diversity of the Black family. Maya Angelou once said:         I sustain myself with the love of my family.    The lasting bonds we have with our families sustain us through life.  For many, our families serve as our home base through times of triumph,  trial, and tragedy.   The past year was a tumultuous year, from the COVID-19 pandemic,  which has disproportionately harmed African Americans much more  severely than others, to the resounding calls for racial justice and  racial equity, which have long been overdue. Through all of the  turmoil, 2020 brought us together to appreciate and celebrate the gifts  of life, family, and diversity. As we celebrate Black History Month and  moving forward, we can recommit ourselves to promoting and celebrating  diversity and advancing civil rights in our society. Black history is  American history. It is a story of oppression, struggle, and, if we are  to be true to our founding premise, redemption and equality.  [[Page S847]]    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Sean  McCagh, a Marylander whom we should all emulate for his selflessness  and passion for helping others. Sean touched the hearts and lives of  his family, friends, coworkers, patients, and the entire community of  Allegany County in the western part of my State. Sadly, Sean was taken  far too soon from his family and the many neighbors who cared so deeply  for him due to complications of COVID-19. He leaves behind his wife,  Terri, and three sons, Mike, Cory, and Casey.   Sean was born and raised in Cumberland, MD. He graduated from Bishop  Walsh High School and completed his undergraduate studies at Mount St.  Mary's University. He earned his medical degree from Georgetown  University School of Medicine and completed his dermatology residency  at the University of West Virginia. He returned to the hometown he  loved so well and joined his brother Mike's dermatology practice in  1996.   Sean was a man of vision who was never one to sit idly by. He  volunteered his time as the athletic physician for Allegany High School  for several years and later established a community fundraiser known as  the Hooley Plunge to support the ice rink at the local YMCA. When the  YMCA closed the ice rink, Sean redirected his efforts to another cause  close to his heart, people with developmental disabilities. With Sean  as its champion for 17 years, the Hooley Plunge has raised more than  $1.5 million to support the Special Olympics of Allegany County and  other local programs that serve individuals with development  disabilities. It has become the largest single-day fundraising event in  Allegany County, with hundreds of brave souls running into the freezing  waters of Rocky Gap State Park's Lake Habeeb in return for donations.   A few years ago, Sean received the Community Service Award from the  Allegany County Chamber of Commerce, one of numerous entities to  recognize his unwavering commitment to the greater good. Sean's sister,  Erin McCagh Morrissey, has fittingly called him Cumberland's George  Bailey, referring to the community-minded banker James Stewart played  in the classic movie, ``It's a Wonderful Life.''   While Sean loved his job as a dermatologist and was passionate about  helping others, he also loved being a cattle farmer. When his middle  son, Cory, graduated from college, Sean encouraged him to follow his  dream to start a brewery. With Cory's vision and Sean's support and  investment, they christened the 200-year-old barn on the family's farm  as the ``1812 Brewery,'' which set the stage for a growing and mutually  supportive family of small brewers to attract tourists and enhance the  lives of local residents.   While the people of Allegany County grieve the sudden, stunning loss  of a cherished husband, father, friend, doctor, businessman, and  community leader, I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in remembering  and honoring the life of Dr. Sean McCagh who, through his service and  love for people, has left his community a better place.                            ____________________
