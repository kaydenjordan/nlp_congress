 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman  and my good friend from Massachusetts for yielding me the customary 30  minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the rule before us today provides for consideration of  H.R. 8393, the Puerto Rico Status Act. This is a bill that received an  emergency Rules hearing yesterday with just 3 hours' notice, 3 hours  for an issue that deserves to be heard through regular order.   H.R. 8393 would authorize a federally sponsored, taxpayer-funded  election to be held in Puerto Rico on 5 November 2023. This election  would require the voters of Puerto Rico to choose between three status  options: independence, sovereignty and free association, or U.S.  statehood.   You might notice something missing here. This bill doesn't even give  Puerto Ricans the option to preserve their current status as a  territory of the United States. So not only do House Democrats want to  control how the States run their elections, they now want to control  how Puerto Rico runs their elections.   H.R. 8393 even takes things a step further than that. If Puerto  Ricans vote to become a sovereign or independent nation, this  legislation tells them what they have to include in their new  constitution, how they have to ratify their constitution, and how  elections for government officers should take place.   My friends across the aisle want to talk about colonial power. What  does that sound like?   Further, this bill would completely circumvent congressional  authority by not allowing Congress to ratify the option that Puerto  Rico ultimately chooses.   The question of Puerto Rico's statehood is a serious topic, one that  I am not necessarily opposed to, but it is a topic that deserves a  deliberative process with careful consideration and expert input.   There have been numerous hearings on this issue, but there were no  hearings on this specific bill. There has been no vetting of legal  implications of using this unprecedented, self-executing process to  statehood.   This is not a question that should be run through a lameduck Congress  on the last day of a scheduled session with less than 24 hours' notice.  That is unacceptable.   Again, I am not debating the merits of Puerto Rican statehood, but I  am pointing out the glaring problems in this ill-conceived, half-baked  legislation that leaves too many questions unanswered.   House Democrats are doing nothing more today than using Puerto Ricans  as pawns to score cheap political points with a bill that has zero  chance of becoming law.   Let's just be frank and honest about that. This bill has zero chance  of becoming law this session of Congress. It is a joke that we are even  considering it today.   We owe it to the voters of Puerto Rico to do better than this. They  deserve more.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would like to inquire as to  whether my friend has any additional speakers.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, I have no  further speakers, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I have already talked about the fact that this bill  did not go through regular order. It is even questionable whether the  committee that heard this hearing has jurisdiction to consider this  bill.   I haven't even touched on the fact that the status options that are  called for don't give Puerto Rico the chance to keep its current  status. The status quo is totally off limits.   We have also talked about dictating to a sovereign nation what is in  their constitution. It also, as I said before, abrogates constitutional  authority. This has never been done before.   Also, there is no CBO score on this. We have zero idea how much this  is going to cost. This also doesn't take into consideration PROMESA  which is the financial oversight and management board that helps Puerto  Rico.   A big glaring issue here is citizenship. We haven't had a single  hearing on how this would affect citizenship.   So you are in Puerto Rico and born to two U.S. citizens, what happens  to your status?   Are you a U.S. citizen or not?   That is not considered in this bill.   So, again, this bill is half-baked. It didn't go through regular  order, and it didn't go through proper committees of jurisdiction, yet  here we are considering it in a lameduck session.   I am incredibly disappointed by this. I am here just 1 day after this  bill was  [[Page H9861]]  considered in a hearing that was held in the Rules Committee debating  legislation scheduled on, again, the last day of the 117th Congress.  Again, this bill has zero chance of becoming law. We are wasting the  time of the American people.   I have said it repeatedly, but it requires saying again: we have real  crises that this Nation is facing. Our southern border is one great  example.   At no time has our southern border been more dangerous and more  unstable than right now. This past fiscal year set the record for  encounters of illegal immigrants, also a record for migrant deaths, a  record for apprehension of suspected terrorists, and a record for  seizure of fentanyl at the southern border.   The seizure of fentanyl might sound as if we are doing something  good, but we only interdict less than 10 percent of the fentanyl. So if  our fentanyl seizures are up, then the amount of fentanyl coming into  the United States is, of course, up. Yet with all that, congressional  Democrats won't even acknowledge that there is a problem at our  southern border. Even the Biden administration won't admit the gravity  of the situation.   Vice President Kamala Harris, the so-called border czar, has said:  ``Our border is secure.''   That is gaslighting. That is gaslighting the American people.  President Biden himself has said: ``There are more important things  going on.''   He refuses to even visit the southern border. That is gaslighting,  and that is also dereliction of duty.   Further, House Democrats failed to meet the fundamental duty of  funding the government, despite spending most of last year passing  trillions of dollars in wasteful spending that has done nothing but  driven up inflation, driven up our national debt, and has seen real  wages decrease for working Americans.   So now we are letting two Senators who won't even be in office next  year ram through a massive omnibus spending bill that was written  behind closed doors and without the input of House Republicans.   So with today's rule, House Democrats are, once again, refusing to  put forward solid legislation that has an actual chance of moving  forward and bringing relief to the American people.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
