 Mr. President, what happens when you decide to write a  tax bill that changes the economy of the United States of America, you  don't have adequate hearings to gauge what is going to happen, you  don't bring in the experts to try to tell you what the impact will be  on individual families and businesses, and you stick around until 5  o'clock on a Friday night and you hand out the work product for all of  the Members of the Senate to take a look at before they vote on changes  in the Tax Code that will affect the people they represent?   This is what happens: 479 pages were handed to us. They tell us that  some of this has been around for a while, and some of it is new. They  don't tell us which part is new and which part is old. Lucky for us, on  K Street--and there is nothing wrong with lobbyists--where the Federal  lobbyists live, they are following this really closely, and they have  given us basically a cheat sheet, a scorecard, so we can figure out, at  least generally speaking, how many changes have been made in the 479  pages since the last time we saw this proposed bill.   I defy any Member of the Senate to stand here and take an oath that  they have read this and understand what in the world it means to  businesses, families, and individuals. If they want to take that oath,  and maybe some will, then I refer them, ladies and gentlemen of the  American jury, to exhibit A, page 257 out of the 479.   Why do I pick this page? Because they didn't have time to type it.  They wrote it out in longhand. We are not even teaching cursive in a  lot of schools anymore, but someone on the staff knew it enough to try.  The problem is, they wrote it in cursive along the margin here. It is  about subchapter  [[Page S7688]]  S corporations and how much tax they paid and what they don't pay. I  defy anybody to read it because the problem was, when they copied it,  they chopped off lines so there aren't full sentences here. They are  like little phrases and words.   This is your Senate at work. This is what happens when you push  through a bill late at night, desperate to pass it, without really  stopping to ask yourself: Will this make us a stronger nation? Will  this help legitimate businesses that want to expand and create jobs? Is  this good for American families?   The Joint Committee on Taxation told us yesterday--that is our  scorekeeper; they are the ones who we hired to be our scorekeeper; they  are nonpartisan--what they learned about this bill before we got the  new version, with the new amendments. Our friends on K Street were  happy to tell us what the listings were. They told us that this  starting bill will add $1 trillion to the national debt--so our kids  and grandkids can pay it off--to pay for the tax cuts. They also told  us that the predicted economic growth that is supposed to come out of  these pages of 4, 5 percent a year is 0.8 percent. Is it not? Am I  right?    They also told us that the biggest beneficiaries under  this Tax Code--this Joint Committee on Taxation--happen to be the  wealthiest people in America--surprise--and the biggest corporations.  They told us that, at least in the second 10 years--maybe before-- regular middle-income families are going to pay higher taxes because of  this. They let us know, and we knew already, what is going to happen to  programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. You see, when  you run up the national debt and you want to try to balance the books-- our Republican friends have been very open about this. They want to cut  the benefits under Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to try to  balance the books.   America, are you ready for this? Are you ready for senior citizens  who are counting on that Social Security check to get a cut in benefits  to pay for a tax cut, a tax giveaway to the wealthiest people in  America? Are you ready to see Medicare cut--that is, reimbursement for  seniors for medical expenses--in order to make sure that the biggest  corporations in America get a tax break? Are you ready to see Medicaid,  which has as its major expense taking care of seniors in nursing  homes--benefits cut in order to give an incentive for businesses to  move jobs overseas? That is what this is all about.   Here is the reality. As a percentage of gross domestic product,  American corporations have never been more profitable--never. As a  percentage of gross domestic product, American corporations have never  paid less in Federal taxes.   What is the Republican response to that? Cut corporate taxes. Why?  Shouldn't we be focused on doing what is necessary so that middle- income families have a fighting chance to pay their bills and put some  money away for their kids and their future? Shouldn't we be working on  helping small and medium-sized corporations instead of the big boys?   That is what I think we should focus on. I don't know for sure that  this bill doesn't do that. In fact, nobody does. Nobody knows what is  in here--479 pages. If they tell you they do, then ask them to explain  page 257. Ask them to try to read this. I have tried. This is going to  change the tax law of America in ways that we can't even explain. We  have to get this done because the Senate has done little or nothing  this year, and so they are desperate to get something done before the  end of the year. Sadly, it is a tax bill that we have just been handed  1 hour and 50 minutes ago.   I yield the floor.    If the Senator from Oregon would yield for just a moment,  I would like to ask consent that this infamous page 257 be made a part  of the Record after my speech, but I am really sorry for the members of  the staff who have to try to write this out--type it out.    Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.    I submitted page 257 of the amendment to be placed in the  Record and you gave unanimous consent for that to happen. I have now  been instructed that the personnel at the Senate cannot read this page  the way it is currently written. Could I have this entered in the  Record just as written with the handwritten notations on the side?  Could I enter it as a graphic or artwork or something like that?   I ask the Presiding Officer, does that mean if the amendment has this  page in it, that the amendment cannot be filed?    I would like to ask a further parliamentary inquiry. Why  didn't they accept page 257 after I received consent to put it in the  Record?    Parliamentary inquiry. This page, which is part of the  tax bill,  [[Page S7689]]  257, as written, cannot be filed in the Senate because no one can read  it; is that correct?    Parliamentary inquiry. Why can't this page be filed in  that form?    Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the Senate  staff, and I am not trying to say anything negative about them. I was  hoping that this could be entered into the Record, and I asked for  unanimous consent to enter it, believing that the handwritten portion  would show up in the Record. I have since been advised that there will  have to be translators and interpreters who will have to decide exactly  what this says before it is actually part of the Congressional Record.  I think that I have made my point as to where we stand in preparation  of tax reform for America.   Thank you.    I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Ms.  Heitkamp) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr.  Whitehouse) is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Ms. Dee  Braden on her retirement from the Coles County Council on Aging, CCCoA,  after more than 41 years of service.   One of Illinois' finest advocates for older residents, Dee started  with CCCoA in 1976, as the RSVP volunteer recruiter and was quickly  promoted to be its first executive director in 1978.   Under Dee's leadership, CCCoA flourished and received the 2008  Governor's Award for Unique Achievement for its vision, innovation, and  collaborative public and private partnerships in Illinois.   To understand Dee's tireless commitment to Illinois' older  population, one need only look at her long service record. Dee  developed and orchestrated the first successful passage of a county- wide property tax referendum in Illinois to fund senior services and  advocated for decades to enhance the quality of life of older adults in  Coles County. For 10 years, she also fundraised for the LifeSpan  Center, a 25,000-square-foot multipurpose intergenerational facility in  Mattoon, IL. Dee devoted herself to bettering the quality of life for  our older Illinoisans.   Dee's many years of leadership and contributions to the elderly made  her the deserving recipient of several awards, including the Coles  County Zonta Woman of the Year Award for Community Service, the Epsilon  Sigma Alpha Diana Award for her service, and the Illinois Governor's  Award for Unique Achievement after she developed a countywide Elder  Abuse Task Force. This year, the East Central Illinois Area Agency on  Aging awarded Dee the Dr. Arthur H. Larsen Leadership Award for her  outstanding leadership in advancing programs, services, and  opportunities for older persons in east central Illinois.   These are just a few of Dee's many accomplishment. A full rendering  of her achievements would take much longer than these few moments. I  will end by saying that I visited the CCCoA several times, and I can  tell you firsthand that the work Dee has done in the community is  nothing short of remarkable.   Dee's generous heart is as big as Illinois. I don't know a better  volunteer who has given so much to helping people. I wish Dee a happy,  relaxing retirement and the best of luck in her life's next chapter.  She has certainly earned it.                            ____________________
