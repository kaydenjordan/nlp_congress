 Mr. Speaker, as we celebrated National Teacher  Appreciation Week earlier this month, I rise to recognize the hard work  of teachers across northwest Indiana. From the time our children take  their first steps into a classroom, teachers empower them with  knowledge and support and serve as inspiring role models.   As a parent, I am grateful for their devotion to their students, for  offering stability in an uncertain time, and for their determination to  ensure that students can thrive in a safe and productive environment.   I personally thank all the teachers who helped shape me into the  person I am today.   I thank Mr. Janich, may he rest in peace, for being an inspiration;  Mr. Woodward, my government teacher, Mrs. Bliss; and Mrs. Marciniak.  All of these teachers inspired me to be a better person.   I also thank my sister, Francis Majchrowicz, who is a teacher molding  young minds and making sure that students are taken care of.   Good educators create engaged citizens, and I appreciate the lessons  and work ethic they helped to instill in me every day.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking all of the impactful teachers  in northwest Indiana and throughout our Nation as we continue to  recognize National Teacher Appreciation Week.                            ____________________
