Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, we are moving forward now on the  consideration of Congressman Mick Mulvaney, the President's nominee to  head the Office of Management and Budget, which is an enormous  responsibility and which often directs the traffic of what is going to  happen in all of the agencies and directs traffic as to what  legislation the White House is going to be working on and working with  the Congress on. This is an enormous responsibility and a very powerful  position.   When looking for someone to lead this agency, we have to carefully  consider the person's record. The Presiding Officer is someone who is  practical, who is a military officer, and who understands a lot about  human nature, as I hope this Senator from Florida does, and what I  suspect that both of us have found is that you can often tell where a  fellow is going by where he has been.   Let's look at Congressman Mulvaney's record on everything from things  like Social Security and Medicare. Let's look at what his record is on  climate change and sea level rise, and, oh, by the way, of particular  note to the gentleman presiding in the Chair, what is his record on  defense spending. Office of Management and Budget is going to have a  great deal to say about what is in the budget with regard to any kind  of spending, but let's see what he has said with regard to defense  spending.   Congressman Mulvaney has advocated for raising the retirement age for  Social Security to 70. He has also said he wants to raise the Medicare  eligibility age from 65 to 67, both of which would require senior  citizens to work longer, even though they have worked a long time and  have paid into these programs in good faith.   Take, for example, Medicare. People have tried to provide for health  insurance, if they have enough money, or otherwise through the ACA,  getting subsidies to afford health insurance or, if they don't have  enough money, having Medicaid, and they are waiting for the day they  turn 65 to be eligible for Medicare.   It is the same thing with Social Security. Social Security over time  has been raised from 65 to 67, but Congressman Mulvaney has talked  about raising the eligibility for Social Security to age 70. I don't  think this is going to go over too well with a population of senior  citizens who have paid into Social Security, who have paid in to  finance Medicare and now are being told they are going to have to wait  until later.   I know how you can dress it up. You can say: Oh, it is not going to  affect anybody who is currently eligible, but what about all the young  people who are paying in? Well, time flies, and suddenly they find they  are approaching that age in their midsixties. I don't think people are  going to take very well to Congressman Mulvaney's position.   Let's see what else he has said. He called Social Security a Ponzi  scheme. He further has said he supports turning Medicare into a voucher  system. That, under any independent economist's examination, would lead  to big cuts for seniors, many of our senior citizens who have no other  options for health coverage.   When the President was running for office--remember, he said exactly  the opposite. Then-Candidate Trump said he promised there would be no  cuts to Medicare and Social Security. Yet the White House has nominated  somebody who has taken positions contrary to that because it is clear  from Congressman Mulvaney's past positions, that we can't rely on him  to keep this promise that the President made.   Again, I remind our listeners that the head of the OMB is like a  chief air traffic controller. He is directing a lot of the traffic of  what the White House will bless, and it is a position--need I remind  you--that is also considered a member of the President's Cabinet. Well,  the positions Mulvaney has taken are opposite to those stated by  Candidate Trump.   Let's look at something else. You know the Nation has debt. In fact,  U.S. bonds are the strongest investment in the world because they are  backed up by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, the  strongest government in the world. So any kind of U.S. debt, backed by  the full faith and credit, is the strongest investment in the world,  but Congressman Mulvaney has taken an alarming position on our Nation's  debt, advocating for shutting down the government and defaulting on the  debt--all a part of a political game to gain leverage in budget  battles.   Anybody who takes a position that you want our government to go into  default on its financial obligations--that is a pretty extreme  position. So this Senator would merely say we can't have somebody in  charge of our budget as the Director of the Office of Management and  Budget who is willing to risk a default on our government to meet a  personal ideological agenda.    Let's look at something else. The Presiding Officer is in one area of  the United States outside of the continental United States, and yours  truly is in another part of the United States. One is near the Arctic,  and the other is near southern climes. Our State, and specifically  South Florida, is ground zero for sea level rise.   I think most people are familiar with the photographs on television  showing seawater washing through the streets during the seasonal high  tides of Miami Beach. Most people have heard that in some of the  coastal cities they had to relocate well fields further west because of  sea level rise and the intrusion of salt water, which is heavier than  freshwater, into the interior. Florida sits on top of a honeycomb of  limestone that is filled with water. That is what is happening in the  southern part of the United States.   A NASA scientist testified to the Commerce Committee that--these are  measurements, not forecasts or projections but measurements over the  last 4 years--the sea has risen in South Florida 5 to 8 inches. Of  course, we have heard the projections. This is something we are getting  ready for. The city of Miami Beach is spending millions of dollars on  very expensive pumps. Other governments in South Florida are planning  to do the same. It is not a forecast. It is happening.   Three-quarters of our State's population in Florida lives on the  coast. Look at the population in the United States. A lot of people  live on the coast, and those populations are going to bear the brunt of  sea level rise from the flooded streets to tainted drinking water. But  during his confirmation hearing, the fellow being considered to be head  of the OMB, Congressman Mulvaney, questioned the scientific fact of  climate change.   We can't muzzle scientists. We can't muzzle science. It is not going  to go away. You can attempt to muzzle the scientists as some Governors  in the South have done, and alarmingly, as I have found in the last few  weeks, some agencies of government are having implied threats that they  stop using the words ``climate change.'' You can't muzzle this when the  effects of scientifically proven climate change are  [[Page S1172]]  posing a real threat to a lot of our people.   I specifically made it a point to question the fellow whom we will  vote on next week--a really good person, Wilbur Ross, who is going to  be the Secretary of Commerce. He came out of our Commerce Committee  with an overwhelming vote. I specifically said, and it is on the  record: What do you think about climate change science?   I said: Mr. Ross, Wilbur Ross, do you know you have three Nobel  laureates as scientists who are employed in the Department of Commerce?  Do you know that you have not only NOAA and all the intricate  measurements that are so important for us to protect ourselves, to read  in-bound hurricanes, tornadoes, the amount of rain that is going to  fall for our agriculture industry, all the rest, but also we have  scientists over there in the Department of Commerce, I reminded him,  who are doing the delicate measurements of science, of standards and  technology that are kneading science to sniff the atmosphere for  nuclear explosions by potential enemies. We don't want to muzzle these  scientists. We want them to bring forth the best that they can come up  with in modern-day techniques.   I would ask the Presiding Officer to look at the bill we have filed  with a number of our fellow Members of the Commerce Committee, the  Scientific Integrity Act, which would ensure that Federal scientists  can freely communicate their findings with the public and with  Congress. It requires Federal agencies to implement and enforce  scientific integrity policies and to ensure that adequate procedures  are in place to report when those integrity policies are violated. That  ought to be common sense. That ought to be the normal course of  business around here. Let people speak their minds, speak their  expertise. That is what we want. That bill requires Federal agencies to  implement and enforce those policies.   Let's get to defense spending. The nominee for Office of Management  and Budget--Congressman Mulvaney's--record on military spending is  concerning. In 2011, in an interview on ABC's ``Top Line,'' Congressman  Mulvaney said:         Defense has to be cut--it has to be on the table, no       question. There is a group of Republicans--myself included--      who think that we should be cutting defense. There's a large       portion of folks in our own party who know that you can cut       defense and not impact the ability of our troops in the field       to be defending us.    Why don't we ask the people in Ukraine who are fighting for their  lives against the projected arm of Vladimir Putin trying to take over  their territory, just like he already did in taking over Crimea? Why  don't we ask our NATO allies? Why don't we ask our troops in the hot,  sandy regions of Iraq and Syria right now? Yes, our U.S. troops are in  Syria--the Special Operations forces advising the combined forces over  there fighting ISIS. Why don't we ask them if they want defense cuts?  As we see the continuous projection of the ability of Russia to move on  to three Baltic States which are our NATO partners, why don't we ask  them if they would like our defense budget cut? Why don't we ask our  allies in the Pacific region that are so concerned about the testing of  these increasingly longer range, intermediate range ballistic missiles  by North Korea--why don't we ask them if they want us to cut back on  the assets that we have in the region to be able to protect them from  the North Koreans if that child dictator suddenly goes off on some  crazy tangent and pushes the button?   So I will just summarize and state that Congressman Mulvaney has  repeatedly demonstrated an unwillingness to face domestic and global  realities, and for this Senator, that raises serious concerns as to  whether he can be trusted to responsibly oversee our Nation's budget  process. For these reasons and others, I will be voting no on  Congressman Mulvaney's nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
