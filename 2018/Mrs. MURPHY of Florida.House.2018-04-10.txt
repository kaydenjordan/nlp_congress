 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be the lead  Democrat on this bill, and I want to thank my colleague and friend  Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick for his leadership on this important  issue.   This bipartisan legislation toughens Federal antistalking laws by  increasing the penalty for convicted defendants by up to 5 additional  years when their victim is a minor. The bill also requires the  Department of Justice to review the enforcement of stalking laws at the  State and Federal level and to identify best practices for enforcing  such laws. Publishing best practices will help law enforcement agencies  and prosecutors around the country secure convictions in these  difficult cases.   There is nothing more important than protecting our children from  harm. Those adults who harass or intimidate minors, whether in  cyberspace or in our communities, must understand that the penalty for  their conduct will be severe.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the House will approve this bill today, and  I urge the Senate to swiftly do the same.
