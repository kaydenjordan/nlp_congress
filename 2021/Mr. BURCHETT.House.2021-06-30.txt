 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation.   Improving and reauthorizing our Nation's surface transportation  programs should take priority over advancing a very liberal, woke,  partisan agenda. These programs should fund our roads, railways, and  waterways, and should be the foundation of our country's long-term  economic success.   Mr. Speaker, instead of working with Republicans, the majority  advanced a partisan bill that dramatically increases spending and  regulation that would stifle development. I even had an amendment that  was nonpartisan. It was just a technical correction, which was agreed  upon by several Members, and it went straight down party lines. So if  anybody tells you this is a bipartisan bill, they are speaking with a  very forked tongue.   It redirects funding away from basic investments and physical  infrastructure and towards social programs, new regulatory regimes, and  government mandates on business. Out-of-control spending by Congress  and the Biden administration has triggered an inflation crisis that is  leaving less money in the pockets of working folks.   Mr. Speaker, American citizens cannot afford another partisan  spending boondoggle orchestrated by Washington liberals. I urge my  colleagues to join me in opposing this bill.    Mr. Speaker, Joe Biden's budget request is troubling  for many reasons. Today, I want to focus on how the President is  weaponizing his budget to the left's anti-life agenda.   In his fiscal year 2022 budget, President Biden has called on  Congress to eliminate the Hyde amendment, which Biden used to support  when he was in the United States Senate.   The Hyde amendment is commonsense policy that has stood for decades.  It would be wrong to force pro-life Americans to fund abortions against  their moral will.   Mr. Speaker, abortion goes directly against the Catholic Church's  teachings, but Joe Biden, a Catholic himself, has embraced abortion.   I applaud the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for  sticking to their guns about the church's principles. On June 18, the  organization condemned President Biden's assault on right to life by  overwhelmingly voting to deny him communion.   Eliminating the Hyde amendment would be a death sentence for millions  of unborn Americans, Mr. Speaker. Being anti-life is now the price of  admission into today's Democratic Party, but Joe Biden knows deep down  this isn't right.   The President needs to buck his party's radical base on this issue  and ditch his plans to scrap the Hyde amendment.   Mr. President, get back to your roots from when you were a Senator.  Make the right decision and protect the lives of the unborn.                            ____________________
