 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill and, in particular,  opposition to section 407, which would, essentially, repeal the Johnson  amendment. The Johnson amendment protects the integrity and  independence of charities and houses of worship by ensuring that they  do not endorse or oppose political candidates.   One of the characteristics of American religious institutions that  has made them so sacred is that they are separate from government and  separate from campaign profits.                                time  1630    If Americans want to get involved in partisan elections, we know how  to do that, but what we are seeking when we attend church, synagogue,  mosque, temple, or any or house of worship is something quite  different.   This distinction has long been reflected in how our law treats  religious institutions differently than political institutions, to  preserve their sacred place in American society, houses of worship must  stay above the political fray, and refrain from endorsing candidates  for political office.   Current law strikes as balance, and it is important to emphasize what  houses of worship with tax-exempt status can do: they are permitted to  advocate for policies that are consistent with their values, and they  can help their members become engaged in the political process by  organizing events, registering voters, and getting them to the polls.  They just can't tell people who to vote for.   It is no surprise that a wide array of religious organizations and  faith leaders support the Johnson amendment and oppose section 407 of  this bill, out of an understandable concern that political parties and  candidates seeking power would be empowered to use their congregations  as tools and pressure them for their endorsements.   I think we can all agree that Americans have had enough of political  partisanship. They do not want more of it, and they certainly don't  want it in their houses of worship where so many seek refuge from the  tumult and chaos of their day-to-day life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the bill for this and many other  reasons.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  legislation.   We are at this point because of President Trump's recklessness and  House Republicans' refusal to govern responsibly. We are already nearly  3 months behind schedule on completing the fiscal year 2019  appropriations bills.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats would prefer to get our work done instead of  kicking the can down the road. However, it appears that the only thing  that seemed possible for us to accomplish before adjourning for the  holidays was to pass the CR until February 8 that the Senate passed  unanimously last night.   However, after another Twitter tantrum, House Republicans are once  again catering to Trump's worst impulses with this terrible bill. This  bill wastes billions of taxpayer dollars, fails to fully address the  urgent needs of disaster victims, and will fail in the Senate. It is a  waste of time for us to consider it.  [[Page H10499]]    Our country faces many pressing needs, and there is simply no reason  to waste $5.7 billion on President Trump's immoral, unnecessary,  irresponsible wall.   Mr. Speaker, $5.7 billion would completely rebuild Tyndall Air Force  Base, rebase the F-22s and F-35s, and completely rebuild all damaged  Marine Corps facilities in North Carolina with money to spare. These  are facilities and equipment that were wiped out by Hurricane Michael.   The disaster supplemental funds in this bill are designed to be a  sweetener but aren't even enough to give us a toothache.   Democrats have always been willing to negotiate how best to secure  our border, but we will not support the President's boondoggle vanity  project that Mexico was supposed to pay for. Likewise, we strongly  support a comprehensive disaster supplemental, but this bill completely  fails to address mitigation and resilience efforts that will prevent  future disasters.   We are now less than 36 hours from another Trump government shutdown.  Democrats were prepared to bail out Republicans once again by providing  the votes to pass a clean CR, yet they can't take ``yes'' for an  answer.   No wonder voters have said they have had enough. This is no time for  political games. It is time to go home for the holidays.
