 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my colleague  Congresswoman Julia Brownley's amendment to increase funding for  veterans treatment courts.   Veterans courts keep our heroes struggling with addiction or a mental  health condition from going to jail, instead providing them with the  care they need and a second chance.   Our Nation's military is returning home from a decade and a half of  war with invisible wounds: PTSD, depression, TBI, trauma, and more.  Researchers are continuing to find links between substance abuse and  combat-related mental health struggles.   Specialized drug court participants are significantly less likely  than nonparticipants to relapse or later commit crimes. By keeping  veterans out of prisons, focusing on rehabilitation and sobriety, these  programs offer long-term solutions rather than shortsighted  punishments.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' for  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 264, line 13, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $18,000,000)''.        Page 314, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $18,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentlewoman  from Nevada (Ms. Rosen) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Nevada.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to  increase funding to the National Science Foundation's Computer and  Information Science and Engineering research directorate, commonly  known as CISE.   CISE supports research in computing, communications, information  science, and engineering. Through their NSF-supported work, our  Nation's scientists have been able to develop innovative solutions to  energy,  [[Page H7258]]  advanced manufacturing, national security, healthcare, and personal  communications.   CISE also provides advanced cyber infrastructure for all areas of  science and engineering, and it contributes to the education and  training of computer engineers, ensuring our future generations are  well equipped with the skills they need in an increasingly competitive  global market.   In Nevada and across the country, we are continuing to see a huge  demand for workers in the tech industry, including software developers,  analysts, engineers, and computer programmers like myself. According to  the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the computing industry's rate of job  creation in the U.S. is now three times the national average. In order  for our workforce to continue to push the boundaries, we must invest in  research and training programs at NSF.   CISE is particularly important because it provides funding for  cutting-edge computing and information science research, which is  critical to innovation in nearly all lines of work from business to  government.   Simply put, the 21st century runs on computers and constantly  evolving technologies. As one of the few women in Congress to build her  career in STEM, I know all too well the demand for talent in STEM is  real, and we must make smart investments now.   Current CISE projects across the country include developing unmanned  aerial systems technology to help reduce wildfires, creating new  clinical modeling techniques to use electronic health records for  personalized patient care, and strengthening our cyber infrastructure.   In my district, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas is using CISE  funding for several groundbreaking initiatives. One of their projects  focuses on increasing the participation of students with disabilities  in computer science courses by creating accessible tools and curricula,  preparing professors for diverse students.   UNLV is also partnering with the local Clark County School District  to mentor high school teachers on computer science, cybersecurity, and  big data.   Mr. Chairman, this current bill maintains fiscal year 2017 level  funding for NSF research and related activities, which CISE is funded  through. That is admirable, given the fact that President Trump's  proposed budget slashed NSF research. Maintaining level funding shows  shared, bipartisan support for scientific research right here in  Congress.   I thank the majority and the subcommittee chairman for recognizing  the importance of supporting computer and information science. However,  even with this funding level, according to agency leadership, the NSF  has had to deny over $2 billion worth of excellent proposals every  year, indicating the fact that it is underfunded.   If we are going to be serious about competing in the economy of  tomorrow and the economy of today, then we must continue funding  programs that help our country to remain the global leader in  innovation, productivity, economic growth, and provide good-paying jobs  for the future.   My amendment would increase funding to CISE by 2 percent, allowing it  to keep up with year-over-year inflation and fund the same number of  grants as previous years. This level funding in real dollars is the  least we can do to remain globally competitive in computer science and  engineering.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' for  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
