 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate life, to stand  for the idea that every human life is a gift from God, and to join my  colleagues in renewing our commitment to defend the inherent dignity of  every person born or unborn.  [[Page H463]]    This week, we will vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act, which says that a baby born after a failed abortion  attempt should be given the same medical care as a baby born any other  way.   The same day, hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans will  march on the Nation's capital to celebrate the sanctity of life. Those  who march for life come from every corner of the Nation to be voices  for the voiceless and to defend the most vulnerable among us. Such  compassion, their dedication to this worthy cause, gives us hope that,  through service and action, we can foster a culture of life.   Mr. Speaker, each and every life is precious. That is why we must  continue to be tireless in our work to defend the sanctity of life and  to protect the unborn.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  very strong and powerful statement.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to Robert Pittenger from North Carolina, who  is the author of the No Abortion Bonds Act, a bill that would close  loopholes in the Tax Code that allow abortion providers to finance new  clinics and facilities with local bonds that are exempt from Federal  taxes. Congressman Pittenger serves on the Financial Services  Committee.
