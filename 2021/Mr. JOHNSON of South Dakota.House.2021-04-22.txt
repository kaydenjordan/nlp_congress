 Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to D.C.  statehood, but I am not opposed to suffrage.   If your goal is truly suffrage rather than increasing Democratic  control of the Senate, boy, do I have a plan for you.   My bill would reunite the residential areas of the District with  Maryland, as was done with Virginia in 1847. This plan would give full  voting rights that we have heard so much about this morning without  ignoring the Constitution or the practical realities of what  constitutes a State.   So I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: If your  goal is truly suffrage, then let's do this together. Let's set aside  the divisive rhetoric we have heard, and work together to craft an  appropriate and bipartisan solution to give representation to the  people of D.C.
