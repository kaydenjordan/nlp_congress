 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for his leadership on this very important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to be a voice for Kansans who know our  status quo Tax Code no longer works for them. They know it doesn't work  when it favors special interests over individuals or when it causes  Kansas factories to close, sending those jobs to other countries.   I rise today because Kansans know that without rejuvenated and  sustained economic growth, we will never find the money to pay down our  Nation's debt.   That is why I strongly support H.R. 1, which will close special  interest loopholes and lower rates for everyone--not just the rich, not  just the poor, but everyone.   Individuals in my district will see immediate tax relief with the  doubling of the standard deduction and the child tax credit. We also  lessen the financial burden of education by keeping important college  tax provisions and expanding access to 529 savings plans.   On average, a family of four in my district will see a tax cut of  just over $2,300 because of this bill.   A fairer, simpler Tax Code means every hardworking family will see  the tax relief and economic growth this country rightfully deserves.
