 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, section 193 simply ensures  that when TIFIA loans are repaid by local funds, they are treated as  part of the local share of transportation projects. That sounds like  common sense to me.   Let me address some of the concerns addressed by my colleague from  Georgia.   First, this provision was included in the bill with the full support  of the authorizers, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.   Second, when my colleague was in the majority, I would remind him  there were no concerns with making permanent authorizing changes on the  Transportation appropriations bill, and it did not matter if a highway  reauthorization bill was on the horizon.   Third, section 193 is not a significant departure from current law.  Today, the Department of Transportation may--may--determine that a  TIFIA loan repaid from non-Federal funds--that is, local funding--can  be designated as part of a non-Federal share of Transportation projects  costs. This is particularly important for large, complex projects,  which are seeking to piece together local, State, and Federal funding  from multiple sources.   The gentleman claims to be concerned about small communities losing  their fair share of Federal capital investment grant funding, but he  should know that we have appropriated ample funding for all projects in  the grants pipeline. The bill includes more than $430 million for  smaller projects, which are often projects in small and midsize  communities, in addition to the $500 million that was appropriated last  year.   To provide greater certainty to States and local communities, section  193 requires the Department to consider if a TIFIA loan has been repaid  by local funds. That is just common sense. If a local government is  going to use local revenue to repay a loan, why wouldn't that count as  a local share?   For an administration that speaks so often about innovative  financing, public-private partnerships, and local communities taking on  more when it comes to improving our Nation's infrastructure, it makes  no sense to discourage State and local governments from contributing to  the overall cost of a project. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose  this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's  concern about the committee of jurisdiction, so I am happy to be able  to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  DeFazio), the chairman of that committee.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, if our colleague says that  the word ``may'' was put in to prevent a perversion of the process, I  will simply say, as Mr. DeFazio has made very clear, we put in the word  ``shall'' to prevent a clear and present perversion of the process.   Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to section 3 of  House Resolution 445, as the designee of the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Lowey), I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, the amendments included in  the en bloc amendment were made in order by the rule.   Mr. Chair, I support this amendment. I urge its adoption, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to section 3 of  House Resolution 445, and as the designee of the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Lowey), I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, the amendments included in  this en bloc were made in order by the rule. They have been agreed to  by both sides. I support the amendment, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice).                                time  1545    Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Chair, my amendment supports the Federal  Aviation Administration Airport and Airway Trust Fund. This program is  responsible for the research, engineering, and development of aircraft  technologies that reduce aviation noise.   In my district, communities near JFK Airport and La Guardia Airport  must endure the constant noise of overhead aircraft, and other  communities farther away are beginning to experience significant  airplane noise as a result of newly developed flight plans.   I am disappointed that the FAA recently announced it would postpone  important minimum altitude regulations for certain flight patterns  coming into JFK Airport, and I call on the FAA to implement these  regulations as soon as possible.   While changing flight paths are no silver bullet to solving airplane  noise, we must continue to adequately fund Federal efforts to discover  new technologies that can retrofit existing airplanes to be quieter for  the benefit of communities not just on Long Island, but airport  communities across the country.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Mr. Chairman, we are prepared to close,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  raising this issue.   I want to note that the underlying bill provides $1 million for the  Transportation Research Board to conduct a study to review all aspects  of the transportation of liquefied natural gas in rail tank cars, and  it requires the Department to incorporate findings and recommendations  from this study into any rulemaking on the transportation of LNG in  rail tank cars before issuing a final rule authorizing such shipments.   Mr. Chair, I plan to vote for this amendment, and I look forward to  continuing to work with my colleague on this issue.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    May I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I am baffled and  distressed that my colleagues seem so intent on targeting such a  vulnerable population.   This Equal Access in Accordance with an Individual's Gender Identity  in Community Planning and Development Programs rule simply ensures that  all Americans have access to HUD services regardless of sexual  orientation, gender identity, or marital status.   This amendment strikes protections for homeless youth seeking help in  shelters. It also strikes eligibility for other HUD programs and for  FHA loans. Mr. Chairman, research shows that same-sex couples and  transgender individuals experience significant discrimination when  seeking housing.   LGBTQ youth comprise up to 40 percent of the homeless population. Let  me, again, remind my colleagues of the risks faced, as Ms. Wexton has  stressed, the risks faced by transgender, homeless youth when they are  living on the streets.   This population is much more likely to experience physical,  emotional, sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, sexual  exploitation, or trafficking. LGBTQ youth have over twice the rate of  early death compared to other youth experiencing homelessness.   When these young people arrive at a shelter, they are not a safety  risk for others. On the contrary, they are desperate. They are  vulnerable. Many are homeless because their families rejected them for  being transgender. We should be doing everything we can to ensure they  have alternatives to living on the streets, and that when they ask for  help, they are not turned away and revictimized.   Secretary Carson assured our committee and our colleagues on the  Financial Services Committee as well, that HUD would not revoke these  protections. But right after he made those assurances, the announcement  came that he was doing just that.   Our subcommittee has repeatedly asked the Department to provide a  report detailing their strategy for continuing to ensure that LGBTQ  individuals have access to HUD programs, and that they plan for  disseminating this information to housing providers. They have yet to  provide such a strategy or such a plan, leaving us with no choice, Mr.  Chairman, but to enshrine the Equal Access in Accordance with an  Individual's Gender Identity in Community Planning and Development  Programs rule in law, and to permanently reinstate the Department's  guidance to ensure that providers have the tools they need to protect  and to serve this vulnerable population.   This heartless amendment would lead to more discrimination, more  homeless LGBTQ youth, and more vulnerability to abuse and violence.   We simply must vote ``no,'' and I urge my colleagues to do so, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support-- in strong opposition to this amendment.   Our subcommittee has repeatedly asked the Department to provide a  report detailing their strategy for continuing to ensure that LGBTQ  individuals have access to HUD programs and the plan for disseminating  that information to housing providers. HUD has yet to provide any  strategy or any plan. So that is why we have acted. It has left us no  choice but to act.   This House took great strides a few weeks ago in passing the Equality  Act, and we are certainly not going to turn around today and take those  rights away. I am offended we have not one, not two, but three  amendments designed precisely to take those rights away.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this discrimination and  to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, this incredible amendment  would target some of our most vulnerable people in our society today.   A study by True Colors United found that among homeless transgender  youth, 75 percent had been victims of physical, emotional, or sexual  abuse; 25 percent had been victims of intimate partner violence; and 20  percent had been victims of sexual exploitation or trafficking.   Mr. Chairman, more than 300 domestic violence and sexual violence  organizations have signed a national consensus statement agreeing it is  appropriate to serve transgender women alongside other women according  to their gender identity.   They agreed there is no safety issue despite the rhetoric heard  today. In fact, transgender women are much more likely to suffer abuse  themselves.   So let's not turn that safety issue on its head. Let's reinstate the  guidance, let's enforce the rule, and let's make certain that in this  society people are treated equally and fairly.   Mr. Chairman, let's reject this amendment. I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of  Chairwoman Lowey, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Napolitano) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman and  the colleagues she mentioned for bringing up this important issue. It  may impose legal and financial challenges to certain States. Certainly  it is an important issue for my friend from California and for her  State, so I will be happy to work with her and the FAA to find a  mutually acceptable solution.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of Chairwoman Lowey, and I move  to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank our  colleague from Maryland for highlighting this issue of aviation noise  and the need for the FAA to be responsive to community concerns.   Noise we know is an unfortunate and unpleasant side effect of the  investments, the jobs, and the mobility gained from aviation service.  We received numerous requests about noise from colleagues this year,  and we underscore the FAA should make every feasible effort to assist  airports, airlines, and local communities mitigate noise for the health  and benefit of those affected.   Mr. Chair, I thank our colleague for raising this issue, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Chair, I rise to support this  amendment.   The Indian Community Development Block Grant program provides Indian  Tribes and Alaska Native Villages the opportunity to compete for a  flexible source of funding to address pressing housing and community  needs in Indian Country.   We know the needs continue to exceed the funding available. In fiscal  year 2017, HUD was able to fund only 62 percent of the eligible  applications it received. That is why we provided in the bill $75  million, a $10 million increase over last year, for the program. This  amendment would further increase that to $80 million.   Mr. Chair, I support this amendment and the strong investment it  would  [[Page H5059]]  make possible, but I do want to express a note of concern about the  offsetting cuts to HUD's Cybersecurity and Information Technology Fund.   HUD is facing daunting challenges to upgrade its technology  infrastructure. As we head into conference negotiations with the  Senate, I am hopeful we can reach a comprehensive, bipartisan agreement  that makes it possible to boost funding both for critical housing  programs and for IT modernization at HUD.   Again, I urge adoption of the gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment  indiscriminately cuts programs in transportation and housing with,  apparently, very little thought as to the relative merit of the  programs contained in the bill.   The amendment would result in less affordable housing and less  support for Habitat for Humanity, public housing, homeless veterans,  housing, the elderly, the disabled, and the Department of  Transportation and its agencies responsible for the safety of our  roads, our bridges, our aviation, our pipelines, and our waterways.   It would reduce funds available to pay the bills submitted by State  and local governments for their transportation programs. These programs  are the legal responsibility of the Federal Government.   The base bill enables us to continue to make progress in restoring  our infrastructure. This amendment would roll that back.   This amendment would not encourage DOT or HUD to do more with less.  It would force them to do less with less.   Our colleague describes this as a modest amendment. Well, let me just  ask how modest these cuts are for his home State of Wisconsin.   Mr. Chair, is $3.1 million for CDBG funding, which could have been  used to rehabilitate housing or improve water mains and sewers, a  modest cut?   $12.4 million in Wisconsin funding for CDBG dollars, the money that  would be generated, is that modest?   Or is $1.5 million in HOME funding in Wisconsin, $1.8 million in  funding for transit in Wisconsin, or $1.3 million in funding for  highway infrastructure in Wisconsin?   Our colleague may want to inquire back home as to how modest those  cuts are.   The amendment is particularly galling since the gentleman voted for  the 2017 tax bill, a $1.5 trillion tax cut, most of which went to the  top 1 percent.   He is concerned about the deficit. That tax bill alone adds $1.9  trillion to our deficit from 2018 to 2027.   Why is it more important to give tax cuts to the wealthy than it is  to build affordable housing and other infrastructure like roads and  bridges that all of our citizens need and that they benefit from? It  doesn't make sense.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge Members to oppose this damaging and  indiscriminate amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as to the tax cut, I will  simply quote very reliable figures from the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities: The top 1 percent of the population received 34 percent of  the benefits of the tax cut.   As to the constitutional point, if I hear that correctly, the point  is that these programs should be eliminated. Constitutionality raises  the issue as to whether this should, perhaps, be zero funding, as  opposed to these indiscriminate cuts that would do so much damage to  the State of Wisconsin and to the entire country.   Mr. Chair, I urge opposition of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to claim the  time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to strongly support  this amendment and commend the gentleman for offering it. He is  highlighting horrible conditions with the situation in Alexander  County, Illinois.   HUD's IG has concluded that HUD should have done more to oversee this  decades-long situation, these deteriorating conditions at the Alexander  County Housing Authority and has made multiple recommendations to  address the situation and to ensure that something like this doesn't  recur.   In fiscal year 2018, our House THUD report requested that HUD work  with the community to find adequate housing for displaced residents,  and to quickly investigate the root causes of the situation.   The base bill, I am happy to say, does fund the IG account above the  request level, partly to help with work on this issue. And we have also  increased funding in the Public Housing Operating and Capital Funds to  provide more resources to public housing authorities for capital  improvements and better management.   Mr. Chairman, we are continuing to monitor this situation. We expect  HUD to implement the Inspector General's recommendations as quickly as  possible. So I urge adoption of the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I suppose if you liked a  4.6 percent across-the-board, indiscriminate cut, you will love 14  percent, even more draconian, and equally indiscriminate.   I won't repeat what I said a few minutes ago about the drastic  effects a cut of this magnitude would have on the range of housing and  transportation priorities for this country. But I will look at a  particular State, the gentleman's own State, Indiana, and just mention  what some of the consequences would be. I hope this is useful  information.   The gentleman's amendment would cut $10.2 million in CDBG funding for  Indiana, which could have been used to rehab housing, to repair streets  and sidewalks, provide senior and youth programs. The amount of  additional funding generated by CDBG dollars in Indiana is estimated to  be--the cut, the effect is estimated to be $40.6 million in money taken  out of the Indiana economy.   Home funding, the most flexible affordable housing funding we have,  $4.8 million taken out of that funding in Indiana.   Transit projects in Indiana take a whopping loss of $23.8 million.   Highways in Indiana, highway infrastructure, a loss of $5.1 million;  and so it goes.   These are cuts that would reverse the progress we have made.   A lot of people are talking infrastructure these days, including our  President. This bill is actually doing something about it. We are  making long overdue investments in this country's infrastructure, and  that includes the housing infrastructure.   Yet, colleagues who--I don't know what they have said about this as a  national priority. Certainly, if they offer an amendment like this, or  vote for an amendment like this, they are marching back down the hill  in terms of the progress we have made and hope to make.   So this amendment, I would think, has very little to recommend it for  any Member who wishes to invest in our country's future, and I urge its  rejection.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am happy to strongly  support this amendment, and I thank my colleagues for offering it.   I want to make a comment on what is going on over at HUD. Secretary  Carson assured our committee that Dreamers were not being denied FHA  loans, that there was no change to the policy, no plan to change the  policy. Now, HUD has confirmed that FHA will no longer make loans  available to Dreamers.   This is the latest in what is becoming a disturbing pattern of HUD  telling Congress one thing and then doing another. They haven't been  forthcoming, to say the least, on this issue.    This amendment reverses that decision, that HUD decision that would  effectively block a key part of the American Dream, homeownership, to  this population.   Dreamers are already in limbo, Mr. Chair. Let's not make these young  people pay a further price for our failure to act.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for the amendment and urge its  adoption.    Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of  Chairwoman Nita Lowey, and I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for the purpose of entering into a  colloquy.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague from  Texas for those questions, which highlight the issue of historic  preservation and NEPA review.   As part of its evaluation and approval process, the Department of  Transportation must consider the effects of proposed projects on areas  of historical significance. Under the law, the Department must make an  assessment of any effects of a project on historic properties and  evaluate options to avoid, minimize, and mitigate negative effects.  This assessment must be completed in consultation with State and local  partners, as well as civic and community leaders.   Mr. Chair, I look forward to working with the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee) on issues of historic preservation.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas for any comments she  might have.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for her  kind words and also for her relentless efforts, and I yield back the  balance of my time.               Amendment No. 267 Offered by Mr. Krishnamoorthi     Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise in  support of this amendment and commend my colleague and a number of  colleagues, actually, for offering it.   The recent news reports about the Secretary of Transportation are  disturbing. It is critical that anyone who serves in public office  follows the law, and if the law clearly states you can't use your  public office for personal gain, that is what following the law  requires. We expect all Federal employees to follow the law, and this  amendment reminds them that it is their obligation to do so.   So I thank the gentleman again for raising this issue.   Mr. Chair, I would urge adoption of the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman  for yielding and wish to express support for her amendment. I commend  her for offering it.   Our underlying bill provides $2.8 billion for HUD's Homeless  Assistance Grants program. That is the highest funding level in that  program's history. It includes more resources for Emergency Solutions  Grants to rapidly rehouse and prevent homelessness, and the bill  includes targeted investments for survivors of domestic violence and  for youth experiencing homelessness.   In addition, section 231 of the bill creates a mechanism that allows  HUD to more readily use recaptured funds from the small number of  projects that  [[Page H5065]]  might not utilize their resources. We expect this provision will give  us an additional $90 million to use as grantees fight on the front  lines to end homelessness.   So we have added resources. More can and must be done, and our  colleague's amendment reflects that reality. We are going to pair this  with sustained investments in affordable housing, and we are determined  to reduce housing insecurity across the Nation.   So I am proud of what our bill accomplishes in this area. I commend  the gentlewoman for her amendment additionally emphasizing our homeless  challenge, and I urge adoption of our colleague's amendment.    I thank my colleague for yielding, and I  am happy to express support for her amendment and for highlighting this  issue.   Remote towers can be a cost-effective way to provide additional  safety and operational benefits to the National Air Space program. The  underlying bill, in fact, includes report language encouraging the FAA  ``to use remote tower technology as a means to enhance safety, reduce  costs, and expand air traffic control services at rural and small  community airports.''   I appreciate the gentlewoman's leadership on this issue. I urge  adoption of her well-considered amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for  yielding and for offering this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I am willing to accept this amendment, take it to  conference, and work out what the most appropriate level of funding is.   I want to acknowledge strong support of this Chamber from both sides  of the aisle for the BUILD program. That is the one discretionary  program within DOT that allows States and local communities to seek  funding for major multi-modal transportation projects.   As our colleague has underscored, technical assistance and planning  support is often essential to that process, especially for communities  with more limited resources or expertise.   These planning grants are important. The underlying bill provides $15  million for competitive grants for planning, preparation, and design.  The amendment sets that figure at $20 million. These resources are  going to lead to increased investments in our communities, they are  going to create jobs, and spur economic growth.   Mr. Chairman, I applaud the gentleman's efforts to highlight the  importance of planning grants, and I urge adoption of the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for  yielding and I wish to support his amendment, particularly to stress  the emphasis he has given to low- and no-emission buses. They do  improve the environment. They improve public health, they reduce  greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, and also reduce long-term  maintenance costs for transit.   Our bill provides robust funding for these grants to State and local  governments of $145 million. That is $94 million above the authorized  amount.   Meanwhile, we are offering strong support for the bus and bus  facilities program. That provides vital resources that improve bus  fleets in communities large and small. Between the transit  infrastructure grants and funding provided via trust funds, the bill  provides $678 million in competitive grants under that program.   These are both important programs for transit grantees. I look  forward to working with my colleague to ensure robust funding in public  transit.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the amendment's adoption.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for  yielding. I am happy to offer support for her amendment.   Mr. Chair, the Family Self-Sufficiency program helps low-income  families living in subsidized housing. It allows them to enhance their  job skills and to increase earnings to improve their economic security.   Currently, there are more than 75,000 families enrolled in FSS, which  is just a fraction of the number that should be--the families living in  assisted housing, many, many more than that.   Mr. Chair, I am proud of the fact that our base bill already  increases this program, providing $100 million for Family Self- Sufficiency. That is a $20 million increase from current funding. This  amendment would do even better, would make FSS available to even more  families, so I applaud my colleagues for offering this.   I want to register some concern about the offset in this and other  amendments in terms of the Office of the Secretary and other  departmental staff. They do have to do their work, and we have to  consider the cumulative effect of amendments, but we will do that as  the process moves along and we go to conference.   Mr. Chair, the situation can be addressed. This is a useful and  helpful amendment, and I am happy to support adoption.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much  time is remaining.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for  yielding. I am happy to offer support for her amendment and to take  advantage of the opportunity this offers to say something about the  BUILD program.   Mr. Chair, it is unique, as our colleague has stressed. It provides  the kind of flexible funding to States and localities that can address  complex multimodal projects.   My district has benefited greatly from this. The city of Raleigh has  successfully built Union Station, a state-of-the-art rail and public  transit facility that is already transforming that area of downtown.   Unfortunately, despite the diverse set of eligible projects, the  current administration has heavily favored road projects only when  awarding BUILD grants. This has most significantly affected transit. On  average, it received about 32 percent of the awards during the previous  administration.   Under the Trump administration, this has plummeted to less than 10  percent, and at the same time, the Department has completely abandoned  bicycle and pedestrian improvement projects and actually eliminated  this as an option for primary project type for years 2017 and 2018.   So, the underlying bill provides $1 billion for BUILD--that is a $100  million increase--but it places greater emphasis on investments in  transit, passenger rail, pedestrian improvements, and multimodal  projects. It also maintains a 50-50 parity between urban and rural  awards, while directing the Department to consider the full range of  benefits from a project, regardless of location in an urban or rural  area.   Mr. Chair, I commend my colleague for offering this amendment. I am  happy to support it and look forward to continuing to work with her on  this issue.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do  now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Pressley) having assumed the chair, Mr. Tonko, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3055)  making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30,  2020, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do  now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Titus) having assumed the chair, Mr. Peters, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3055)  making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30,  2020, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.
