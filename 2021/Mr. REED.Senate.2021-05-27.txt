 Mr. President, reserving the right to object. For the  reasons I articulated on Monday and remain, I think, accurate, I would  object.    Mr. President, I am disappointed that my bipartisan  amendment with Senators Moran and Murkowski is not receiving a vote  today.   Our amendment has a simple purpose--to protect taxpayers. It seeks to  do so by providing the administration the discretionary authority to  negotiate for warrants, which are like stock options, as part of the  $50 billion we are appropriating in this bill for the CHIPS for America  Fund.   A warrant is the right to purchase one share of common stock at a  preestablished price, known as the strike price. Warrants, just like  stock options, are exercised when the stock price is greater than the  strike price. The idea is that if taxpayer dollars are necessary to  invest in a company, then taxpayers should also benefit from some of  the upside when the company grows.   I worked on a bipartisan basis to secure warrants when Federal funds  were needed for private companies as part of the Troubled Asset Relief  Program, TARP, and in the CARES Act. As a result of the warrants  provision in TARP, nearly $10 billion in profit was generated for  taxpayers. And according to new Department of Treasury estimates,  taxpayers stand to gain more than $1 billion for the CARES Act  warrants.   Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who also has prior private sector  experience as a venture capital investor and as a former treasurer of  Rhode Island, said this week at a CJS Appropriations Subcommittee  hearing that she would ``support'' having this authority as a ``good  way to stick up for American taxpayers.''   So if companies are receiving taxpayer funds to make investments in  semiconductors, U.S. taxpayers should also be able to get some of the  upside when these investments pay off. We should be striving to ensure  that we get the best possible deal for our constituents' money.   I appreciate Leader Schumer's commitment to get this concept included  in the bill as it moves forward in the  [[Page S3878]]  process, and I will continue working with him and all of our colleagues  to make that commitment a reality.    Mr. President. as many of my colleagues know. the  transition from military to civilian life can be very difficult. To  address these kinds of challenges. Vet Centers were created in the wake  of the Vietnam War to provide critical services for veterans. service  members. and their families in community-based settings separate from  other Veterans Health Administration facilities. Today. there is a need  to enhance these Centers to continue to realize that original vision-- which is why I am reintroducing the Vet Center Improvement Act.   This legislation is the product of a Government Accountability Office  (GAO) investigation that Senator Tester and I requested into  allegations that changes to performance metrics at Vet Centers may have  negatively impacted quality of care as well as additional concerns that  we had about their staffing practices. The GAO report concluded that  recent changes ``have the potential to negatively affect care and  create undue burden and stress on counselors providing that care at  some Vet Centers.'' This report included recommendations to improve  care, transparency. and hiring and staffing methods that are the  foundation for our legislation.   Specifically, the Vet Center Improvement Act requires periodic review  and reform of performance standards at Vet Centers; the creation and  periodic reevaluation of a staffing model, along with standardization  of position descriptions and responsibilities across Vet Centers; the  creation of a working group to implement changes to improve quality of  care for veterans and recruitment and retention of staff; and the GAO  to review Vet Center infrastructure and examine what future investments  are needed. Additionally, our legislation creates a $50 million pilot  program to provide grants to combat food insecurity and provide  necessary heating and cooling assistance to veterans and their  families. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored  the need for this legislation--to ensure that we are providing high  quality counseling services and offering programs that help our  veterans meet their daily needs, like feeding their families and  heating their homes.   I would like to thank Senator Tester for joining me in introducing  this important legislation and the attention he has paid to this issue  as Ranking Member and now Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs  Committee. Our legislation has received support from such organizations  as the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), American Veterans (AMVETS),  National Community Action Foundation (NCAF), National Association for  State Community Services Programs (NASCSP). the National Energy &  Utility Affordability Coalition (NEUAC),  [[Page S3901]]  and the URI Feinstein Center for a Hunger Free America. I look forward  to continuing our partnership on this and other measures to improve  care for our veterans. and I hope our colleagues will join us in this  endeavor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED:   S. 1954. A bill to reauthorize the John H. Chafee Blackstone River  Valley National Heritage Corridor, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.    Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to  reauthorize the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National  Heritage Corridor for the next fifteen years. This legislation will  continue to preserve the industrial, natural, and cultural heritage of  the Blackstone River Valley for generations to come.   In 1986, Congress designated the Blackstone River Valley as a  National Heritage Corridor, recognizing the region's critical  contributions to the American Industrial Revolution. Indeed, in 1793.  Samuel Slater initiated the American Industrial Revolution in Rhode  Island when he built his historic mill along the Blackstone River,  Today, the mills and villages throughout the Corridor reflect the  legacy of this key chapter in American history.   Encompassing both Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the John H. Chafee  Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor links twenty-four  communities along the Blackstone River from Providence to Worcester.  The Corridor has also served as a critical partner to the Blackstone  River Valley National Historical Park, resulting in the recovery of  dozens of historic villages, waterways, and rural landscapes throughout  the Blackstone River Valley, which includes thousands of acres of  beautiful lands and waters that are home to diverse wildlife.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to  ensure the continued preservation of the Blackstone River Valley for  the benefit of our natural resources and our country's history.                            ____________________
