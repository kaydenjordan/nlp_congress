 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and  honor the memory of Tony Lee Dill, a west Texas farmer, who I had the  privilege of representing and the great blessing of calling my friend.   Tony was born on June 3, 1960, to G.W. and Sue Dill in Terry County,  Texas. Tony had a lifelong passion for the land and a love for people  that was second to none.   Tony wasn't just a great farmer, he was a great leader, dedicating  much of his life to being a voice for agriculture in rural America. He  was absolutely committed to public service for his community, for his  industry, and for the country he loved.   When I first met Tony, he was president of the Western Peanut Growers  Association.   Tony was the epitome of a west Texan and a great American farmer.  Tony was honest, humble, and hardworking. Tony was a gentleman, a man  of great faith and love for the Lord, and he was happiest when he was  with his family, his beloved wife, Donna, five children, and eight  grandchildren.   I know they miss Tony something fierce, and I do, too, but I am  confident that Tony is in the presence of the great farmer, the Creator  of Heaven and Earth, and all that share Tony's faith will be with him  for all eternity.   God bless and go west Texas.                            Honoring Josh Bartlett     Madam Speaker, last week west Texas witnessed an  unspeakable tragedy. One of Lubbock County's true heroes, Sergeant Josh  Bartlett, lost his life in the line of duty. Our hearts are heavy with  grief for the Bartlett family, and our prayers are with them along with  the injured officers and their families, especially including Sergeant  Shawn Wilson.   Sergeant Bartlett dedicated his life to the sacred calling of wearing  the uniform in defense of his country and community, honorably  protecting and serving his fellow Americans. We are all heartbroken for  his wife Rebecca and their children, Zachary, Christian, Logan and  Kasidy. Like so many in law enforcement, Josh watched over our families  while taking care of his own as a husband and a father.   We must never forget that the men and women in blue represent the  very best of our Nation, the bravest and most dedicated among our  citizens. We all owe them the highest respect and deepest gratitude for  their willingness to sacrifice their lives to protect ours.    West Texas, Madam Speaker, is a family, and west Texans  unapologetically, unreservedly love and respect our brothers and  sisters in law enforcement. We know they stand between us and the bad  guys, and we stand with them and their families, especially in these  times of sorrow and loss.   May God comfort all the families affected in this tragedy, and may He  protect and keep those who keep watch over us along the thin blue line.                      Congratulating the New Deal Lions     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the New  Deal Lions on winning their first 2A baseball State championship.   The Lions' State championship win comes after a playoff loss in  regionals and a 2020 season where they canceled six games due to COVID.  Fueled by those setbacks, the New Deal Lions took head coach Jason  Ybarra's motto, ``Unfinished Business,'' to heart during the 2021  season.   Led by Kyler Reed, Harley Patterson, and Noah Rodriguez as team  captains, the New Deal Lions season included not only a State  championship, Madam Speaker, but a 13 and 0 record district play.   Kyler Reed retained district MVP, Harley Patterson was named  offensive MVP, Tanner Seeley was awarded defensive MVP, and Noah  Rodriguez was recognized as the Newcomer of the Year.   So congratulations to Lion Nation. This team of young men, along with  their coach, represent the west Texas value of hard work and dedication  and the west Texas spirit of excellence in all things.   God bless and go west Texas.                            ____________________
