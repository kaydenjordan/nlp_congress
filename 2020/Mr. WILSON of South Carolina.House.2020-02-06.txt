 Madam Speaker, February is American  Heart Month, a month where we especially recognize and promote positive  heart health.   Currently, 302,000 people in South Carolina have coronary heart  disease. I am thankful for the great work of the National Coalition for  Women with Heart Disease and the American Heart Association for their  steps to spread awareness about heart disease, the number one killer of  men and women in America.   I am grateful that, in the Second Congressional District, we have  many incredible events to recognize heart health, including the Heart  Walk, held in Aiken and the Midlands. These walks raise critical funds  to help save lives from heart disease.   As a volunteer with the Lexington County Heart Association, I know  firsthand of the dedicated personnel. I appreciate American Heart  Association Executive Director Crystal Kirkland of the Midlands and  Jackie Lipscomb of the American Heart Association-CSRA.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Congratulations, President Donald Trump, for your deserved  exoneration.                            ____________________
