 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  due a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, earlier this morning, it was my distinct  honor, along with Leader McConnell, to welcome Ukrainian President  Zelenskyy to the United States. It is always a privilege to welcome a  foreign head of state to the Capitol, but rarely in history have we  heard directly from a leader who is fighting for his country's survival  and fighting to preserve the idea of democracy.   I told the Members that, right now, this courageous man is at the  fulcrum of democracy and freedom. And my message to President Zelenskyy  and to my colleagues was simple: America must always stand with our  friends around the world, and that includes the people of Ukraine.   President Zelenskyy could not have arrived at a more crucial moment  for his country and for Congress. Right now, Ukraine is engaged in a  major counteroffensive against Putin's forces to reclaim their own  territory and turn the tide of their bloody and brutal conflict. But it  is also a moment for Congress too. It is very clear that if we were to  have a government shutdown or pass a CR without Ukrainian aid, the  damage to Ukraine's campaign would be devastating.   In fact, to quote President Zelenskyy, in the room--and this is a  quote--he said: If we don't get the aid, we will lose the war.   That is a quote from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That is how stark  the issue is. Nothing would make Putin happier right now than to see  the United States waver in our support for the Ukrainian people.  [[Page S4638]]    This is not just about Ukrainian security, but as President Zelenskyy  reminded us, it is about American security, as well, because a  victorious Putin would be an emboldened Putin.   What is the point of cutting off support now, when we are at a  turning point in the war, when we have invested a large amount of  resources to get to this turning point? To be sure, there are some on  the hard right who say we should abandon Ukraine and negotiate with  Putin. It is ironic that the hard right, which historically opposed  communism, now openly flirts with autocrats like Putin.   Giving Putin what he wants, for America to abandon Ukraine--that is  what Putin wants--would be a terrible, terrible mistake and one I think  that would come back to haunt us more rapidly and quickly than people  believe.   Now is not the time to take our foot off the gas when it comes to  helping Ukraine. Turning our backs would make the world less safe for  American democracy.   I commend President Zelenskyy for his leadership during this  unprecedented moment in his country's history. I thank him for his  visit. I thank him for his courage. I thank him for his steadfastness.  And I will keep working to ensure we continue supporting the Ukrainian  people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the CR, an ominous case of deja vu is  playing out this week in the House of Representatives. A national  crisis is around the corner. The solution demands bipartisanship, but  Speaker McCarthy is wasting precious time catering to the hard, hard  MAGA right. Catering to the hard right didn't work during the default  crisis, and it will not work here in the shutdown crisis.   It has been a troublesome, vexing week for the House of  Representatives. A few days ago, House Republicans released what they  called the deal on a CR but which, in reality, read like a House  Freedom Caucus screed. It called for a devastating 8-percent cut on  virtually all nondefense spending. It would have gutted law enforcement  funding, border protection, nutrition benefits, and so much more. But  that still wasn't extreme enough for MAGA Republicans.   The House GOP's latest proposals are even more extreme, call for even  greater cuts, and stand even less of a chance of passing the U.S.  Senate. House Republicans are still trying to appease the most hard- right elements of their conference. It is almost as if a small handful  are deciding what the whole body of 435 Members should do. It makes no  sense. And the hard right, many of them, publicly say they want the  government to shut down, despite the fact that it would hurt so many.   So that is what seems the Republican leadership is doing, instead of  pursuing the one path we all know will work: bipartisanship. Instead of  decreasing the chances of a shutdown, Speaker McCarthy is actually  increasing it by wasting time on extremist proposals that everyone  knows--he knows--cannot become law.   Let me say that again. Instead of decreasing the chance of a  shutdown, Speaker McCarthy is actually increasing it by wasting time on  extremist proposals that cannot become law.   In the Senate, many of us are united in the need for more Ukraine  aid, but the hard-right proposals in the House fail to provide any. In  the Senate, only an agreement that can get votes from both parties will  be able to pass, but the hard-right proposals have all been drafted  with zero Democratic input and zero effort to even appear bipartisan.   So for all the efforts Speaker McCarthy has spent on trying to find  something that makes MAGA Republicans happy, there is no scenario where  we avoid a shutdown without a bipartisan agreement. If the Speaker  continues down on the path he is on, the odds of a shutdown, sadly, go  up, and Americans will know that the responsibility of a shutdown will  be on the Republicans' hands.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on TPS, yesterday, the Biden  administration announced they will designate temporary protection  status for Venezuela, giving migrants from that country relief from  removal and the ability to get work authorization. This decision will  affect more than half of the newly arrived asylum seekers in New York.   The administration's announcement is welcome news and one many of us  in the New York congressional delegation have been calling on for  months. I wrote to Secretaries Blinken and Mayorkas, in July, that  country conditions in Venezuela clearly met the criteria for TPS. So  this is a good step forward.   TPS will give much needed relief for New York systems currently  straining to support newly arrived immigrants. It is going to save New  York taxpayer dollars, and it will allow migrants from Venezuela who  are seeking asylum to find temporary employment, support themselves and  their families, contribute to our economy, and reduce the shelter  burden that New York is now undergoing.   So this is very, very welcome news. Many of these migrants can now,  hopefully, get closer to finding work and finding shelter, which they  need, and I thank the Biden administration for taking this step.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 307, Philip S. Hadji,  to be a judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims for a term  of 15 years, that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening  action or debate, that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table, and that the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I have four requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                  committee on energy and natural resources    The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is authorized to meet  during the session of the Senate on Thursday, September 21, 2023, at  9:30 a.m., to conduct a business meeting.             committee on health, education, labor, and pensions    The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions is authorized  to meet in executive session during the session of the Senate on  Thursday, September 21, 2023, at 11 a.m.           committee on homeland security and governmental affairs    The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is  authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Thursday,  September 21, 2023, at 11 a.m., to conduct a hearing on nominations.                          special committee on aging    The Special Committee on Aging is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, September 21, 2023, at 9 a.m., to  conduct a hearing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 211,  H.R. 3935.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, September 21, be waived.    Mr. President, I have just filed cloture to move forward  on FAA. As I have said for months, we must work in a bipartisan fashion  to keep our government open, avoid a shutdown, and avoid inflicting  unnecessary pain on the American people.   This action will give the Senate the option to do just that.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration,  and the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 208.    I ask unanimous consent that the Shaheen amendment at  the desk to the resolution be agreed to; the resolution as amended be  agreed to; the Shaheen amendment at the desk to the preamble be agreed  to; the preamble as amended be agreed to; and that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to consideration of S. Res. 358, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of S. Res. 359, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from  further consideration of S. 2787, and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned to convene for  a pro forma session, with no business being conducted, at 10 a.m. on  Friday, September 22, 2023, and then that the Senate stand in recess  until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, September 26; that on Tuesday, following the  prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed; that upon the conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume  consideration of the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 211, H.R. 3935;  further, that the cloture motion filed during today's session ripen at  5:30 p.m. on Tuesday.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 4:43 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, September 22, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
