L. Pate from Beaumont, Texas.   Words cannot adequately express how deeply saddened Brenda and I were  to hear of W.L. Pate's passing just the other day. As I think back,  Madam Speaker, we are hard-pressed to remember anyone who gave more to  their community than W.L. did to his--or ours, for that matter.   The list of W.L.'s considerable accomplishments and contributions are  far too numerous to be listed here, but here are just a few.   W.L. was a two-term mayor of Beaumont. He was an Army veteran and had  14 years of service as a city councilman. W.L. was the past president  of the Texas Association of Mayors, Council Members and Commissioners.  W.L. was on the board of the Texas Municipal League and served as TML  president for Region 16.   Never missing a chance to give back, W.L. assisted the District 14  office every single year with military service academy nominations, and  he was good at it and proud to be able to do it.    I am particularly proud of W.L.'s passion project in recent years.  W.L. was the driving force behind obtaining the Presidential Medal of  Freedom that was posthumously awarded to Babe Didrikson Zaharias, a  fantastic female athlete, given by President Donald Trump.   I recognize and thank W.L. Pate for his servant leadership. Our  deepest sympathy goes out to his family and friends, especially his  daughters, Jennifer and Suzanne.   This is a tremendous loss for Beaumont and the Nation. W.L.'s  remarkable legacy of service and sacrifice is the epitome of what it  means to be a great American. Our country would be well-served to have  many more with such a servant's heart.   Rest in peace, my friend. W.L. Pate, you done good.                            ____________________
