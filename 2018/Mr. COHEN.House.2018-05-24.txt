 Mr. Speaker, our country's democracy and rule of law are  in danger, being threatened at every moment.   Today is my birthday and also the birthday of Bobby Zimmerman aka Bob  Dylan. And with that, I quote Bob Dylan:       Come writers and critics      Who prophesize with your pen      And keep your eyes wide      The chance won't come again      And don't speak too soon      For the wheel's still in spin      And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'      For the loser now will be later to win      For the times they are a-changin'      Come senators, congressmen      Please heed the call      Don't stand in the doorway      Don't block up the hall      For he that gets hurt      Will be he who has stalled      There's a battle outside and it is ragin'      It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls      For the times they are a-changin'      The line that is drawn      The curse it is cast      The slow one now      Will later be fast      As the present now      Will later be past      The order is rapidly fadin'      And the first one now will later be last      For the times they are a-changin'    My colleagues, get it together and save democracy and protect us from  this President.                            ____________________
