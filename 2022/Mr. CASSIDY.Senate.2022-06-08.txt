 Madam President, today I rise in recognition of  seersucker manufacturers and enthusiasts across the United States. I  wish everyone a Happy National Seersucker Day. This uniquely American  fashion has a storied history dating back to 1909. The first seersucker  suit was designed by Joseph Haspel at his Broad Street facility in New  Orleans, LA. Louisiana is proud to have played an important part in  introducing the country to seersucker apparel.   This lightweight cotton fabric, known for its signature pucker, has  been worn and enjoyed by Americans across the country during the hot  summer months. Mr. Haspel said it best: ``Hot is hot, no matter what  you do for a living.''   In the 1990s, Seersucker Day was established by Members of this  Chamber to honor this unique American fashion. I proudly resumed this  tradition in 2014 in the U.S. House of Representatives and continued  this tradition in the U.S. Senate. This year, I wish to designate  Thursday, June 9, 2022, as the ninth annual National Seersucker Day. I  encourage everyone to wear seersucker on this day to commemorate this  traditionally American clothing.                            ____________________
